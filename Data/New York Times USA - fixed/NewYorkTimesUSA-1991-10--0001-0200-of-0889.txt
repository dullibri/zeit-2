Round the World, Bond Profits Soar

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
FOR bondholders around the world, the summer of 1991 was a joyous time. With interest rates generally falling, their profits soared.
For American investors, the advantages of investing overseas have been enhanced even further by the dollar's recent weakness. After rising sharply early in the year, the dollar gave up some of its gains in the third quarter, and that served to accelerate profits from foreign markets. 
 In the third quarter, J. P. Morgan reported yesterday, government bonds in 9 of the 12 countries it monitored produced a total dollar return of at least 10 percent. The return, including coupon interest payments, capital appreciation and currency changes, ranged from 14.88 percent in Britain to 5.33 percent in the United States, where there was of course no benefit from the dollar's depreciation.
Over all, the global return in dollars for the J. P. Morgan Government Bond Index was 7.68 percent, the highest quarterly return since the fourth quarter of 1987, when interest rates fell around the world as central banks eased credit in the wake of the stock market crash. The gain then was 11.97 percent.
The gains in local currencies during the quarter were less impressive, ranging from 1.84 percent in the Netherlands to 7.18 percent in Canada, but they were still impressive, and related to the general slowness in world economies, which has dampened inflationary fears. While there has been much talk about economic revival in countries that fell into recessions, the evidence of such gains is still mixed at best. The three best bond markets in the quarter, on a local currency basis, were Canada, Britain and Australia, all of which have been in recessions.
J. P. Morgan calculated that on a global basis the average gain in local currencies was 4.91 percent, the best of the year but trailing behind the 5.47 percent in the fourth quarter of 1990.
The figures for this year's third quarter are through last Friday. Trading yesterday, the final session of the quarter, was generally quiet, and it was not expected to change the results significantly.
The profits in bond markets around the world helped to whet the appetite of American investors, who continued to pour cash into mutual funds that specialize in foreign bonds, even during the first part of 1991, when a strong dollar was making life painful for owners of such bonds.
During the first eight months of this year, global bond funds reported cash inflows of $6.4 billion, compared with $5.6 billion for all of 1990. The surge of cash into those funds began in August 1990, amid worry over American investments and declining short-term interest rates.
Much of that money has gone into short-term funds, which involve little interest-rate risk because they invest in the equivalent of Treasury bills around the world, seizing the higher interest rates available in many other markets. Those funds get the advantages of a depreciating dollar, but give up the potential of capital gains.
At the end of August, assets of such global bond funds had risen to $20.5 billion, well over twice the level of $8.6 billion that had prevailed a year earlier. Of that $20.5 billion, more than 40 percent was in short-term investments, according to figures released last week by the Investment Company Institute.
One fund manager who contends that emphasis on short maturities is a mistake is Leslie Nanberg of MFS Worldwide Governments Trust. He predicts interest rates will continue to fall, and that those who focus on short-term investments overseas are giving up opportunities to prosper.
The Morgan bond indexes are based on government bonds available for trading, and thus are not completely comparable between countries. For example, the United States and Britain have more bonds with decades to go until maturity, while some European countries have much shorter credit structures, making the possibility of capital gains, or losses, less likely.
For the first nine months of this year, the best bond markets, including currency gains, were those in Australia and Canada, both countries that have been mired in recession and have brought down interest rates without damaging their currencies. The third best market was Japan, where bond bullishness has grown rapidly in recent months, as the economy and monetary growth have slowed.

HEADLINE: In Search of Greener Showrooms

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Tony Salcido, who sells Toyotas in Puente Hills, Calif., is the kind of salesman who makes car companies both smile and cringe.
As the top salesman at his dealership, he helps move a lot of cars and keep Toyota's assembly lines humming. But Mr. Salcido's loyalty is to his paycheck, not his brand. 
 In the past, when sales of one type of car have cooled, he has never hesitated to change jobs and sell what is hot -- and profitable. Mr. Salcido, who began his current job two months ago, has changed dealers four times since February.
Auto makers worry increasingly that the people selling their products know too little about the features of the cars and do not sell them long enough to develop repeat customers or take advantage of referrals. Recently, manufacturers have trumpeted a host of new programs and incentives aimed at reducing turnover on the sales floor.
Just last week, the General Motors Corporation announced a deferred bonus program, which beginning next year will give salespeople a $50 bonus for every car they sell; G.M.'s Cadillac division will pay $75 a car. But these bonuses would be awarded only if the sales representative remained at the dealership until 1995.
The program, to be jointly financed by G.M. and the dealers, is voluntary. The company said it hoped as many as two-thirds of its dealers would participate. The Ford Motor Company is studying the G.M. idea, which is an adaptation of a program that Volkswagen is using in North America.
About 40 percent of people who stop selling cars for a dealer move to another field, according to one survey. But the majority are people who have been promoted off the showroom floor or moved on to another dealer. Besides deferred-bonus programs to retain good salespeople, other approaches include campaigns to instill a heightened sense of professionalism in the much disparaged car-sales business.
The Toyota Motor Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation have established certification programs within the last year that require sales staff to attend training sessions and pass exams on product knowledge. Certification also depends upon earning passing grades from customer surveys on how well the salespeople served their customers' needs. The National Automobile Dealers Association, meantime, plans to start the Society of Automotive Sales Professionals next year, complete with wall plaques and lapel pins for members who pass tests on product knowledge and salesmanship.
 
'Tremendous Heartburn'
 Industry surveys estimate that annual turnover runs between 35 and 50 percent, although it reaches more than 100 percent a year at some dealerships.
"Turnover causes us tremendous heartburn," said Robert Coletta, general sales and service manager for G.M.'s Buick division. Salespeople, he said, need about a year to fully understand a manufacturer's products and a dealer's procedures. And as cars grow more complex, he added, that learning period grows longer.
One of the earliest deferred bonus plans began two years at Volkswagen, which for every car sold pays the sales representative $150 -- in three installments, spread over two years. The bonus comes on top of whatever commission the dealer pays the sales staff. Volkswagen officials have no statistics on whether the program has reduced turnover, but they say dealers have told them it has helped.
Audi of America offers yearly bonuses of $6,000 to salespeople who sell 60 cars, and $12,000 and a trip to Germany to those who push 120 cars out the door. The wait is not as long as with Volkswagen's program but the idea is the same: to keep top producers in the fold, some of whom had left as sales drooped.
"If you lose a guy who's worth a hundred cars a year, it's like losing a whole dealer," said Joseph H. Tate, general sales manager of Audi of America.
Fritz Hitchcock, the owner of the Toyota dealership where Mr. Salcido works, calls the traditional commission system "very destructive." But Mr. Hitchcock, who has set up his own deferred-bonus program, doubts whether other alternatives -- some sort of guaranteed salary, say -- would be the answer. "It's hard to figure out if a guy is giving you his all if he's on a guarantee as opposed to a commission," Mr. Hitchcock said.
Mr. Salcido and other salesmen said that deferred bonus programs like the one offered by General Motors were a nice perk, but were not enough to make salespeople stick around after several slow months at a dealership. "It's an extra, but people want money now, said one Detroit-area car salesman who insisted that he not be identified. "My mortgage bill is now."
 
An Inherently Transient Business
 Salespeople and car dealers say they applaud any programs designed to reduce turnover and improve the image of salespeople. But many also believe the incentives or courses do not address the fundamental realities of selling cars that make it such a transient business: long hours, few benefits and unpredictable paychecks.
Mr. Salcido, the Toyota salesman, draws no salary at all. He earns 20 percent -- about $200 -- of the gross profit on each car he sells, plus bonuses for meeting volume goals. In addition, there is the deferred bonus program created by his boss, Mr. Hitchcock, which involves a six-month lag.
In pursuit of these emoluments, Mr. Salcido works about 65 hours a week and often comes in on his scheduled days off. He expects to make $50,000 this year, about twice the earnings of the average salesman in the current sluggish market.
"When you're running this type of system," he said, "you feel very insecure when you take a day off."
The new "sales professionals" society being set up by the National Automobile Dealers Association will require that members pass several training "modules," each containing six one-hour audio tapes, written homework, tests and training seminars. "The program hits hard on developing long-term customer loyalty, which is really what we're in business for," said Robert W. Nagel, a Casper, Wyo., G.M. and Jeep-Eagle dealer and chairman of the association's certification committee.
Mr. Nagel said the program was also designed to counter the negative self-image of many car sellers. "A lot of salespeople don't like to admit they sell autos," he said.
Many dealers have started hiring younger salespeople with no experience selling cars, in hopes that they will remain loyal to those who trained them.
"If I can get a fresh, energetic person who hasn't sold cars before and is willing to listen and accept training from us and the manufacturer, they can make a real good, loyal associate," said Ramsay Gillman, who owns several types of American and Japanese dealerships in Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Tex.
 
Nurturing the Customer
 The traditional high-volume, sales-commission approach is at odds with a shift in the industry to broaden salespeople's role to include more nurturing of customers current and past. Many of Nissan's Infiniti dealers, for exmple, now pay commissions based in part on how well each sales representative scores in customer-satisfaction surveys.
For all the innovations in the industry, though, many car dealers voice skepticism over how well the new programs will work. The best solution for high turnover in the sales ranks, they say, would be a stronger economy.
In the view of James B. Woulfe, owner of Shamrock Ford in Dublin, Calif., "The only thing that is going to solve the problem is when the market turns up."

Dollar Falls as Gold Rises On Soviet Reserves Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
But gold prices advanced. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $354 an ounce, up $4.90 from Friday. The Republic National Bank of New York said gold rose $4.75, to a late bid price of $353.75 an ounce.
Dealers said the dollar traded in a relatively narrow range throughout the session, while sentiment toward the currency remained bearish. 
 Investors are awaiting the Government's release on Friday of jobless data for September. "That is seen to be the next key factor that will influence Fed policy," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with IDEA, an investment advisory firm.
Economists expect the Federal Reserve will move to cut interest rates again to help stimulate the economy. At the same time, lower interest rates generally have a negative influence on the dollar because they make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors.
"Participants are not willing to take on any new positions," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. "The dollar is vulnerable to the downside, while the high-yielding currencies attracted a lot of buying interest," he said.
A sharp rise in the price of gold, attributable to reports that the Soviet Union's gold reserves were dwindling, also put pressure on the dollar, as money fund managers shifted into precious metals on the assumption that gold had greater upside potential than currencies.
The Soviets were thought to be selling gold to pay for imports and to make debt payments. But gold prices slid from their session highs in domestic dealings.
"People have to realize that those who bought gold can also become sellers," Mr. Chandler said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at a seven-month low of 132.95 yen, down 0.87 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 132.85 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 132.95 yen, down from 133.15 yen on Friday.
In London, the pound rose to $1.7525, from $1.7370 late on Friday. In New York, it cost $1.7500 to buy a pound, more expensive than $1.7435 on Friday.

Southwest Air Makes Bid for Midway Assets

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The Southwest Airlines Company emerged as a second bidder today for Midway Airlines' assets. But unlike Northwest Airlines, Southwest said it had no interest in acquiring all of Midway, which is in bankruptcy.
Southwest's $30 million package exceeds by $10 million the deal offered last week by Northwest to help Midway out of bankruptcy. 
 But Midway officials were wary. David R. Hinson, the chairman, said the airline was reviewing Southwest's proposal "but, preliminarily, we are very skeptical about its feasibility."
Officials for the airlines were discussing the offer in Chicago, a Southwest spokesman, Ed Stewart, said.
"We are not interested in acquiring Midway," Mr. Stewart said. "This is basically an agreement to buy gates and lend money."
He said the offer was aimed at keeping Midway alive for the good of Midway Airport in Chicago. The carriers operate out of Midway, but neither flies out of Chicago's largest airport, O'Hare International.
Midway, which sought Federal bankruptcy court protection in March, still serves at least two dozen cities from Midway Airport.
Southwest, based in Dallas, said it had offered to buy 10 of Midway's 21 gates at Midway Airport for $10 million and sublease some of the gates back to the airline. The carrier also offered to lend Midway $20 million, repayable over five years and secured by a lien on Midway's additional assets at the airport.
Southwest, with 2.4 percent of the market, is the nation's 10th-largest airline. It uses a low-fare, single-class strategy that has helped bring it $47.1 million in profits last year, when most other carriers were being economically devastated.
Midway agreed on Sept. 23 to sell all of its gates at Midway Airport, as well as related operations, to Northwest for $20 million and to lease them back for a year.
Midway and Northwest also agreed last week to begin negotiations that could lead to Northwest acquiring the rest of Midway's assets.
Midway and Northwest signed a letter of intent, which is subject to approval by the Federal bankruptcy court. A hearing is set for Oct. 8.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, Southwest's stock fell 37.5 cents, to $24.375, while Midway's rose 12.5 cents, to $2.

HEADLINE: Blackstone Unit to Buy Days Inns

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
A Blackstone Group subsidiary that owns the Ramada and Howard Johnson hotel chains agreed yesterday to pay $250 million for Days Inns of America Inc., the 1,214-unit franchise system burdened by some $750 million in debt.
If approved by the bankruptcy court, the transaction, which could be derailed if a better offer appeared -- would create one of the world's largest hotel franchisers. The three chains combined now operate 2,236 hotels with 284,000 rooms. 
 Days Inns also said it had filed for Chapter 11 reorganization on Friday in Wilmington, Del., shortly before three bondholders filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition that day in Manhattan.
 
Default on Interest Payments
 Those bondholders -- Northern Life Insurance, Northwestern National Life Insurance and High Income Advantage Trust -- said in their petition that Days Inns had defaulted on interest payments to them.
The buyer, Hospitality Franchise Systems, is a subsidiary of Blackstone Capital Partners, which is owned by the Blackstone Group, a leveraged buyout firm formed in 1985 by Peter G. Peterson and Stephen A. Schwarzman.
The transaction would also intensify Hospitality's spirited rivalry with Choice Hotels International, an affiliate of Manor Care Inc., a nursing home company in Silver Spring, Md. Choice's seven chains, including Comfort, Quality and Econo Lodge, have 2,245 hotels in operation with 210,000 rooms, plus an additional 514 hotels under construction.
 
Possible Bid by Rival Group
 Last year, Hospitality outbid Choice for Ramada and Howard Johnson, paying Prime Motor Inns Inc. $175 million. Choice, in turn, bought Econo Lodge, Friendship Inns and Rodeway for $75 million. Andrew R. Heyer, managing director of the Argosy Group, the financial adviser to Days Inns, said yesterday that Choice "expressed some interest on behalf of an investor group" in acquiring Days Inns, which Choice would then operate.
"If this acquisition is approved, it will give Hospitality a strong position in three segments of the market," said Dan Daniele, director of hospitality industry consulting for Ernst & Young in Chicago. Rates at Days Inns average $30 to $40 a day; at Howard Johnson's they average $40 to $50, and at the Ramada inns, $50 to $60.
While cautioning that the agreement is subject to approval, Henry R. Silverman, the chairman and chief executive of Hospitality, described it as a "classic strategic investment."
Reservations and advertising make up about 80 percent of a franchiser's costs, Mr. Silverman said, and with 1,214 additional units, Hospitality would be able to negotiate lower rates for its advertisements and for its toll-free reservations lines. That saving would translate into lower rates for the franchise operators, who contribute to a chain's advertising and reservations costs.
Mr. Silverman is no stranger to Days Inns. The Atlanta-based chain was a small operation when he joined Reliance Group Holdings Inc. in 1982, and the following year he formed the Reliance Capital Group, a leveraged-buyout firm. Reliance bought Days Inns in 1984, and Mr. Silverman, as chairman and chief executive of the chain, quickly expanded it to about 1,000 properties.
 
Sold for Profit 2 Years Ago
 Two years ago Mr. Silverman sold Days Inns to Tollman-Hundley Hotels, the largest Days Inns franchisee, for $765 million. The original investors, he said, made four to five times the $30 million they put up for the chain. Mr. Silverman joined Blackstone in January 1990.
If the economy had remained sound, Mr. Heyer said, the purchase would have been a good one. But the hotel industry fell into one of the deepest slumps in its history, with 60 percent of the hotels in the United States currently experiencing a net operating loss.
Mr. Heyer said the creditors are largely insurance companies, mutual funds and money managers, probably 30 or 40 of which are owed more than $1 million. The largest creditor, he said, is the First Executive Corporation, and others include CNA Financial and Allstate Insurance.
John D. Snodgrass, the president and chief operating officer of Days Inns, said the three bondholders who filed for involuntary bankruptcy "represent 6 percent of the debt."
Mr. Snodgrass added that the operating company -- the individual franchises -- "has done very well," generating more than enough cash to cover operating expenses.
 
Oversupply of Hotels
 Analysts say it will be at least two and possibly as many as five years before demand catches up with the oversupply of hotels, many of them built in the early 1980's to take advantage of easy financing and generous tax laws.
But the economy end of the hotel business -- or "limited service hotels," as Mr. Silverman said he preferred to call it -- is the fastest-growing segment of the industry. In the first six months of this year, while the average occupancy rate fell to 60 percent -- far below the average 65 percent break-even point -- the occupancy rate at economy hotels averaged 62.4 percent.
In addition, franchise operators have avoided many of the financial woes that have plagued other hotel operations.
"A franchiser gets a percentage of gross room sales, plus money for advertising and reservations," Mr. Daniele said. "And they are not saddled with all the real estate. The key is for them to get as many hotels in place in as many locations as possible, to make the advertising and marketing more economical. But to grow, a franchiser has to position itself as strong and attentive."
Under the agreement with Days Inns, Hospitality Franchise System is to pay $250 millon, of which at least $210 million -- cash and about 25 percent of Hospitality's equity -- is expected to be paid to Days Inns and its subsidiaries. Hospital's affiliate, the Days Inns Acquisition Corporation, which was formed specifically for this transaction, expects to commence a tender offer to purchase $40 million principal amount of Days Inns bonds for $40 million in cash.
If approved, the affiliate will acquire the Days Inns franchise system, including the Days Inns name, trademarks and support services.

HEADLINE: Another Strong Quarter for Wall St. Fees

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Despite the recession, American corporations maintained their strong appetite for cash from the stock and bond markets in the third quarter, bringing a healthy flow of fees to Wall Street investment houses.
The quarter also saw a significant change in the rankings of the top securities underwriters, as securities firms apparently dashed to capture market share lost by Salomon Brothers Inc., which has been shaken by the Treasury market scandal since August, and from Goldman, Sachs & Company. 
 But all of the firms had more business in the quarter than they had a year earlier. Rushing to take advantage of lower interest rates, which reduce borrowing costs, corporations raised $141.6 billion in the third quarter, up 94 percent from the $73 billion raised in the quarter last year, according to the Securities Data Company, a research firm in New York.
The good third-quarter results also brought a strong flow of fees to Wall Street investment houses for the second consecutive quarter. Fees nearly tripled, to $996.9 million, from $352.3 million in the third quarter of 1990.
Salomon also received higher fees, but its piece of the pie was much smaller than in the third quarter of last year. For the quarter, Salomon ranked sixth in fees, compared with second in the third quarter of 1990.
Over all, Salomon slid to sixth place in the rankings of underwriters, with 8.2 percent of the market, down from third place in the preceding quarter. The drop appeared to accentuate a fall that had already been under way at the firm, which was ranked third in the equivalent quarter of 1990 with 12 percent of the market.
The decline hits at a business that has been one of the most important for Salomon. The firm was a perennial leader in the underwriting business through most of the 1980's. It was overtaken by Merrill Lynch & Company in 1988.
Salomon executives attributed the decline partly to the firm's decision to be less aggressive in bidding for competitive deals, extending itself less in the aftermath of the Treasury scandal because of narrow profit margins.
The executives also said that the firm's performance was better than the data indicated because of flaws from improperly counted deals. The methodology of the underwriting rankings has long been attacked by the firms that ranked low, and praised by those with strong showings.
In the first nine months of 1991, corporations issued $408.3 billion in domestic securities, a 71 percent increase over the $238.2 billion raised in the equivalent period of 1990, according to Securities Data.
The growth in underwritings got its biggest push from the drop in interest rates in the third quarter, underwriters said. Many companies that had been holding out for lower rates finally found rates so attractive that they plunged into the marketplace.
"I was thinking the third quarter was going to be soft, but it turned out to be pretty active," said Dave Komansky, executive vice president of global equity markets at Merrill Lynch. "Our view of the fourth quarter looks as though it will continue to be surprisingly strong."
Added Jessica Palmer, managing director and head of capital markets at Salomon, "The rundown in rates we have seen over the last couple of months has brought a fair number of issuers out of the woodwork."
The quarter had the second-highest quarterly volume of stock and bond offerings in history, falling behind only the previous quarter, when a record $154.5 billion of securities were issued.
Merrill Lynch was the biggest underwriter in the third quarter, dealing $24.4 billion in domestic securities, or 17.3 percent of the market, according to Securities Data.
Lehman Brothers captured second place in the rankings, with 12.3 percent of the market, climbing over its fourth-place ranking at the end of the second quarter and its seventh-place spot in the third quarter of last year. Lehman Brothers underwrote $17.5 billion in the third quarter, compared with $4.8 billion in the comparable period of 1990.
The First Boston Corporation was third in the rankings, moving up from sixth place at the end of the second quarter. The firm underwrote $14.9 billion in securities, or 10.5 percent of the market, in the third quarter.
Goldman, Sachs, which had been ranked second in the second quarter, slipped to fourth, underwriting $14.5 billion, for a 10.2 percent share of the market.
Initial public offerings continued to be strong in the quarter, with $6.6 billion in new securities issued. That compares with the anemic $1.6 billion issued in the third quarter of 1990.

HEADLINE: Fall in Soviet Oil Exports Said to Force Sale of Gold

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Leonid A. Abalkin, a senior economic adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, said yesterday that the recent sharp decline in Soviet oil exports had forced the nation to sell off gold reserves to pay for imports and to make payments on foreign debt.
Although Mr. Abalkin said he did not have figures at hand, he generally confirmed disclosures in Moscow on Friday and yesterday that the central Government's gold reserves were well below Western estimates of how much gold was available to help meet foreign payments. 
 "The traditional understanding that the Soviet Union has large stocks of gold reserves is a mythical one," Mr. Abalkin said in a telephone interview from Duke University in Durham, N.C., where he visited the business school. Only half the gold mined in the Soviet Union, he said, goes into central bank reserves; the other half is for industrial use or jewelry.
 
Hedge Against Inflation
 "Given the existing level of Soviet inflation, we cannot get people to sell gold back to the state," Mr. Abalkin said. Gold, valued as it is in hard currency -- currently about $350 an ounce -- serves for Russians today as a hedge against the Soviet Union's high inflation rate, now more than 100 percent a year.
Western estimates of the Soviet Union's gold reserves, including estimates by the Central Intelligence Agency, put them at 500 to 1,000 metric tons. But Grigory A. Yavlinksky, another senior Soviet economist and the architect of a plan to move the nation toward a market economy, said on Soviet television on Friday that the reserves were only 240 metric tons, worth nearly $3 billion.
The Yavlinsky estimate was disputed yesterday by Aleksandr N. Doumnov, a deputy managing director of the Soviet State Bank. The Associated Press quoted him from Moscow as having said that the reserves were actually 374.5 metric tons, worth about $4.6 billion -- still well below Western estimates.
 
3 Possibilities Raised
 The disclosures raised three possibilities to two Western experts on the Soviet Union, David M. Kemme, an economist at Wichita State University, and Jacques Sapir of the School of Higher Studies in Social Sciences in Paris. One is that Mr. Gorbachev's advisers underreported gold reserves to strengthen their case for foreign assistance.
Another possibility is that the dwindling gold reserves would prevent the central Government from tying the ruble to a gold standard, to help control inflation. And finally, Mr. Sapir said, "the central Government might be understating reserves to avoid giving part of the stock to the Russian Republic."
Whatever the politics, oil apparently played a role. Mr. Abalkin said that the central Government had been forced to sell gold for hard currency because of a sharp drop in Soviet oil exports -- to just over two million barrels a day now from nearly four million in 1988. Oil and gas sales abroad account for roughly half the nation's export income.

Decline at Disney

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla., Sept. 30

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company continues to feel the effects of the recession, with attendance declines at its theme parks and resorts, said Michael D. Eisner, the chairman. "We are down; there's no way to deny it," he said at a news conference that was part of the 20th anniversay celebration for Disney World here. He characterized the decline as "bigger than a bread basket." The chief financial officer, Richard D. Manula, said earnings for the fiscal year would be $4.75 to $4.80 a share, versus $6 a share in the 1990 year.

HEADLINE: Life Support for the Recovery

BYLINE: BY SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
With consumers cautious and service industries in the throes of cost-cutting, America's factories are likely to serve as the main life-support system for the weak recovery.
Manufacturing has been fitfully tugging the rest of the economy out of recession. Factory production has been climbing for five straight months and should continue to outpace sales of services in the coming months, economists and executives say. 
 By itself, the rebound in manufacturing has not been robust enough to propel a brisk economic recovery.
 
Disproportionate Impact
 But manufacturing's comeback is apt to aid the rest of the economy enough to keep the recovery alive. Even though factories employ just one in five American workers, they have provided nearly three-fourths of the meager gain of 110,000 jobs since the economy hit bottom in the spring. Manufacturers also get credit for more than a third of the rise in total private wage income since March.
Manufacturing's disproportionate impact on the economy is not all that surprising. While factory employment is down from around 30 percent of the work force in the mid-1960's, manufacturing's share of the gross national product, at 22 percent, is about the same now as it was then.
As factories churn out more goods, they buy more services and other goods from other businesses. They also fatten workers' paychecks, which in turn inspires greater consumer spending and larger tax collections.
That is exactly what's been happening at the General Motors plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., according to its manager, Gus Beirne. Although the auto industry in general remains weak, this factory, which makes mini-vans, has benefited from depleted dealer inventories and the manufacture of vans with more new features. Since last spring, the plant has recalled laid-off workers, assigned overtime and, more recently, added Saturday production. Its use of services, from recycling and waste-hauling to materials deliveries, is up sharply.
"There's no question that the G.M. plant has picked up and that's helped us," said D. Joseph Fleming, president of Falcon Transport in Youngstown, Ohio, which hauls truckloads of steel from U.S. Steel and LTV to G.M. Higher production is even helping the village government that sells the plant its water. North Tarrytown's Mayor, Frank Rey, reports that revenue from that source, though still depressed, is now going up. Local shops and restaurants, however, have yet to see their business improve much.
So far, in fact, the manufacturing recovery has been modest by past standards. Factory output and employment have not so far recouped more than a fraction of the ground lost during the recession. Computer makers and military contractors are in the midst of long-term restructuring. And though manufacturing output fell five times as much as overall G.N.P. during the recession, its decline was mild by past standards and suggests that the recovery will not be as robust either.
But barring an unexpected collapse in consumer or business sales, manufacturing is likely to continue expanding as companies replenish their inventories. Stocks of unsold goods in stores, warehouses and factories have been shrinking rapidly since last fall. But the latest readings show that inventory reductions, which shaved nearly two points off G.N.P. during the spring, may have started to ease in July. Now business is reordering freely. Factory order backlogs are rising. It is the classic pattern for a recovery.
The dynamic is clearest in cars and trucks, despite disappointing sales. Motor vehicle inventories have fallen from a 70-day supply in February to 50 days now. Production was a fifth higher in the summer than the spring, possibly adding as much as one percentage point to third-quarter G.N.P., according to Richard B. Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
Consumers, still worried by layoffs, could use more help from the factories. Factory wage income, about a fifth of total income, has recently advanced at a 6 percent annual rate, faster than after the 1981-2 recession. Partly that reflects a jump in pay: hourly compensation was up strongly in the spring, according to the latest available data. One reason is that manufacturers are relying on increases in overtime, with higher pay rates, to raise production.
Increasingly, however, wages are getting a lift from rising payroll employment. "The expansion in manufacturing is as healthy as in any recovery," said David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
Manufacturers expect to step up hiring this fall, according to a new survey by the Milwaukee-based Manpower Inc., the nation's largest temporary help concern. Among manufacturers, 21 percent say they anticipate more hiring this fall while just 10 percent of durables manufacturers and 13 percent of nondurables manufacturers see more cuts. These responses provide the second straight quarterly improvement in hiring plans, a good leading indicator of actual hiring.
 
Servicing Manufacturers
 Better times for manufacturers are brightening the picture for companies that sell business services. They added 23,000 new jobs in August. On average, manufacturers buy about one-sixth of what service companies sell, according to Inforum, a University of Maryland consulting enterprise that focuses on the links among industries.
That portion rose in the 1980's as more manufacturers contracted out all sorts of services, ranging from cafeteria management and cleaning crews to advertising, data processing and guard services. Every dollar of added auto production now generates about 50 cents for service businesses from car dealers and body shops to truckers.
One kind of business service, temporary help, is especially in demand among manufacturers right now. "When you have slimmed down the work force and you get some activity, you have to get some people," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, president of Manpower Inc. "Businesses don't want to get into hiring mode though, just after trimming."
Manpower's business has been on the mend since April, Mr. Fromstein said, with hours billed in August ahead of figures a year ago. The biggest gains, he said, reflect calls for assembly-line workers from companies in food processing, pharmaceuticals, electronics and packaging.
 
Cutbacks Could Be Harmful
 The factory revival faces several uncertainties. Since a third of all factory orders, for everything from paper plates to giant generators, come from service companies, overzealous cutbacks in retailing, finance and other services could harm the manufacturers. But that fear seems overblown, Mr. Fromstein said. Health-care companies are still hiring. Wall Street, which has been hacking away at payrolls for four years, is finally seeing healthier profits and adding a few new jobs.
As a result, private services employment, which performed more poorly in this recession than in most others, is already inching up. Moreover, the Manpower hiring survey indicates that except for government, service companies -- especially retailers and wholesalers -- plan to resume hiring this fall. Service companies also plan modest increases in purchases of equipment this fall.
The larger worry is that the factory revival will fizzle before consumer spending picks up again. "If consumers and businesses don't keep buying," said Jill Thompson, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, "manufacturers can't keep spending."
Right now, the prospects look better on the business side. Outlays on equipment, though weak, are not falling. Equipment orders, which bottomed out in May, surged in July and lost only part of that gain in August.
Exports also seem to be holding up better than expected. They will almost certainly slow from their astonishing pace last spring, when exports of goods other than agricultural products surged at a 22 percent annual rate. According to Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the business survey committee of the National Assocation of Purchasing Managers, export orders have leveled out, but not declined.
Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said, "The leadership in this recovery has been and will continue to be manufacturing."

HEADLINE: Nebraska Senator Enters the 1992 Race

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. 30

 BODY:
To the strains of Bruce Springsteen's "Born to Run," Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska entered the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination today and asserted that a short-sighted and cynical Federal Government was robbing young Americans of their birthright of good jobs, good educations and national greatness.
Mr. Kerrey, whose political odyssey began as a Navy Seal in Vietnam, where he won the Medal of Honor, accused the Republicans of a decade of "malignant neglect" that had left the nation adrift. 
 His speech was an echo, in spirit if not in langugage, of John F. Kennedy's 1960 appeal to "get the country moving again." Against the backdrop of the Nebraska Capitol, which Mr. Kerrey portrayed as a monument to prairie optimism in the depths of the Depression, the 48-year-old Senator said he hoped to touch off another era of national renewal.
"I want to lead America's fearless, restless voyage of generational progress," Mr. Kerrey said. "We have been led off course by a Federal Government whose engine has become inertia, whose direction is drift, and whose compass is cynicism."
Mr. Kerrey's speech reflected many of the traits that his allies say will serve him well in this late-starting race for the nomination. It was emotionally hot, an effort to provide the kind of inspirational leadership that many Democrats believe has been lacking in their party.
Mr. Kerrey's indictment was as much against a state of mind as against a party, asserting that continued inaction by the Federal Government had let the economy, the schools, the cities, the infrastructure of highways and bridges founder.
"Unless we do things differently now," he said, the nation in the year 2000 will be a grim place "where stagnant incomes will force them into more hours at work and less time with their children, where homeownership and college tuition and even adequate health care will be beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest."
It is time, he said, "for leadership that focuses its attention on posterity, rather than popularity, on the next generation, rather than the next election."
 
Unconventional Career
 Mr. Kerrey's announcement today capped a meteoric and unconventional political career that begin in 1982 when the young Nebraska restaurateur decided to run for office for the first time -- and defeated an incumbent Republican Governor. As the Springsteen title suggested, Mr. Kerrey's allies see him as a natural politician who seemed destined to take the step he took today, even though, for most of this year, he brushed aside the Presidential rumors that surrounded him.
As he took the stage in a downtown Lincoln park, under a brilliant autumn sky, surrounded by a euphoric crowd, that periodically broke into University of Nebraska fight cheers, Mr. Kerrey's eyes glistened and he seemed, for a moment, to be taking the full measure of what he was about to do. He looked out over the crowd, and an almost melancholic look crossed his face, then he turned to his speech and began.
Mr. Kerrey's attack on the Bush Administration did not have the personal tone used by his colleague and rival, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. But Mr. Kerrey's language was unstinting.
He said the 1992 election "offers us a chance to break from a decade in which our leaders invited a season of cynicism." He went on: "They invoked morality but winked at greed. They crticized the public sector, but then robbed it blind. They spoke of balanced budgets but never submitted one.
"They railed against taxes but raised them on the middle class. They called for civil rights but practiced racial politics. They wrapped their cause in motherhood but then worked to deny motherhood of choice and meaningful opportunities."
But Mr. Kerrey asserted that Mr. Bush was not the enemy. "A more difficult enemy for us to defeat is our own pessimism," he said, "particularly in the Democratic Party."
Mr. Kerrey is the fourth major candidate to enter the race for the Democratic nomination, joining former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, Mr. Harkin of Iowa and Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas is expected to announce his candidacy in Little Rock on Thursday; former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California is exploring a race, as is Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma. The Rev. Jesse Jackson is still considering his options.
Mr. Kerrey will have a impact on the campaign of Mr. Harkin. Athough Mr. Harkin's message of economic populism and old-time Democratic religion is quite different from Mr. Kerrey's, they draw from the same regional base. Mr. Kerrey will also probably cut across Mr. Clinton's potential support, since both offer themselves as young, exciting, change-oriented Democrats.
While his race is starting late, Mr. Kerrey's operation had a seasoned look to it, thanks, in part, to his quick collection of several campaign veterans, including some top strategists from the campaign of former Senator Gary Hart.
He was surrounded by a loyal audience of family and friends, including his former wife, Bev Higby. Mr. Kerrey, who was divorced in 1978, remains single.
Mr. Kerrey, who has often talked of his anger over the Vietnam War after he returned home, opened today's speech by thanking his community for helping a "bitter and lonely and altogether unpleasant young man." Mr. Kerry lost part of his leg in a raid that won him the Medal of Honor.
It is Mr. Kerrey's status as a Medal of Honor winner that, many Democrats assert, will protect him from Republican attacks, which often center on the charge that Democrats are weak on defense and out of touch with traditional patriotic values. But Republicans see vulnerabilities on this front: Mr. Kerrey voted against the resolution authorizing the use of force in the Persian Gulf.
There are also people in both parties who wonder whether Mr. Kerrey can live up to his billing. "It reminds me of John Glenn," said Charles Black, a top Republican strategist. "You remember, in 1983, Glenn announces -- astronaut, world hero, huge press coverage. Then he ran out of steam on the biography and had no message. And he got elbowed aside. Maybe Kerry has a message, but the jury's still out on that."

Will Haughey Get the Heave? It's an Irish Riddle

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The ancient Celts, fierce in battle though they were, had a nagging fear that if they angered the gods, the sky would fall on their heads. Their descendants, especially Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey, probably know the feeling.
In recent weeks, a wave of scandals involving public officials has combined with Ireland's worsening economy to shake Mr. Haughey's proven ability to rule this country of 3.6 million with a firm hand, taking backtalk from no one. 
 On Friday, four members of his party, Fianna Fail -- the Warriors of Destiny -- stirred the political world here by criticizing him publicly, possibly setting the stage for "a heave movement," as dumping a leader is known in Ireland.
To deprive his opponents of time to organize, the 66-year-old Mr. Haughey moved up by a week an important party conference, rescheduling it for Wednesday. The party could replace him as leader, which might lead to a battle with Government coalition partners over a new Prime Minister, or failing that, to a general election.
"Mr. Haughey has never had an easy ride," a spokesman remarked today. "Every three years he has had to prove his manhood."
Of the scandals and the political moves against the Prime Minister he said, "Hysteria -- everybody wants blood and they want it now."
Findings of investigations begun by the Government will be made public within six weeks, he said. As for the motives of the party dissidents, he said that they might honestly wish for better government, or possibly hope for promotions for themselves by a new leader.
For the better part of Mr. Haughey's tenure -- he has been Prime Minister in 9 of the last 13 years -- much of Ireland has seen relatively good times. Even his adversaries agree on that. As one of the smaller European Community members, just ahead of Portugal and Greece economically, the country enjoyed a mild boom from European subsidies and began to attract foreign companies to invest in plants and offices.
Although unemployment in some regions was high by European standards, it was eased by emigration. About 40,000 people a year left the country in the late 1980's for Britain, Canada and the United States, sending back millions to their families. But in the last year, mostly because of the American and European recessions, the Irish boom has collapsed.
Unemployment is now above 19 percent, and the Haughey Government is considering reneging on pay raises it negotiated with public employees -- whose leaders say the Government should instead catch the multimillionaire tax cheaters for the money it needs.
Were all this not bad enough, the scandals, most of them disclosed in The Irish Times and The Irish Independent, have given many people the impression that ranking Government officials have been filling their pockets at public expense -- "the cats among the pigeons," the editorial writers like to say.
 
Parrying With a Laugh
 Mr. Haughey, an accountant and lawyer, who instead of Prime Minister is called the Taoiseach, (pronounced TEE-shuck), the Irish word for chief or leader, has tried to brush it all off, smiling and quipping in the style he has used for handling the public since he was a star soccer player in college. Asked last week about the scandals, he said, "Look at London and New York -- there are scandals there daily which make anything that happens here seem in the half-penny place."
The most prominently reported of the scandals concerns a charge that officials of the Irish national sugar company used insider information to make a $10 million profit on shares of stock they acquired before the company was partly privatized last year. The officials also reportedly arranged millions in golden handshake pensions for themselves. Sugargate, the tabloids call it.
In addition, the chairman of Telecom Eireann, the state-run communications system, resigned, professing purity, after a company he partly owned sold a property to Telecom at a profit of $5 million.
Goodman International, a meat-processing and fertilizer company that controls much of the country's major meat exports, is under investigation by another commission on charges that it obtained unfairly advantageous loans from the Government, and sold the world cheap meat certified as top-grade.
In none of these has there been a suggestion that Mr. Haughey himself was tainted. But his ministers and friends in high office, where he put them, are being portrayed and perceived as naive, conniving or venal.
But one situation seems to get close to him, the sewer-pipe case. A public sewer line that local officials considered unnecessary was run under property that Mr. Haughey owns near his estate in the north Dublin suburb of Kinsealy. Members of Parliament from the principal opposition party, Fine Gael -- the Tribe of the Gaels -- said Mr. Haughey was in effect using public funds to improve the value of his property -- this even though the land is now a complex of modest cottages mostly without indoor plumbing.
 
Mom and a School Speech
 In interviews, some of the residents said Mr. Haughey was a good neighbor, and they thanked him for the sewerage. Others complained that their old mothers still had no bathtub in the house and had to go outside to the toilet. Mr. Haughey, who does not own the cottages, said he had no intention of selling the land for more luxurious housing.
The Prime Minister, a gifted speaker who refers convincingly to Virgil or to Gorbachev, has thrown no formal counterpunches. But the other night, The Irish Times reported, he noted at a school cememony that he had received two gifts that day, the same day that members of his party started the ouster process.
One was a bag of dirt from a place of religious importance, the garden of St. Colmcille in County Donegal, the other a sharp steel letter opener.
Having refused to comment directly on the ouster attempt, he dealt a simple Haughey parable: "I would like to assure everybody that that little bag of earth preserved me from disasters of any kind, and if the miracles do not work in this regard, I've got this little knife."

HEADLINE: First Report Card Issued on U.S. Education Goals

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Two years ago, President Bush and the nation's 50 governors, at a celebrated education summit conference, agreed to six national education goals to be achieved by the year 2000. It took them two years to decide how to measure progress toward the goals, but today they issued their first "report card" on that progress.
The report offered a baseline from which the nation will have to climb to reach the six goals -- and it will be a steep climb. 
 Although the report emphasized that the states must provide more reliable and more standardized data in order for more accurate reports to be written, it generally conceded that there were few areas where progress is clearly being made. The report said the nation was making progress in areas like educating the growing number of ethnically diverse students and in providing more of those students with minimum skills.
 
Some Good News
 The panel's report on the six national goals was one of three education studies released today. The other two were straightforward statistical reports on student achievement -- one on how well American students have performed in math, science, reading and writing over the past 20 years; the other was a report on students' math performances in 1990, measured against new national standards for 4th, 8th and 12th graders.
The report by the National Education Goals Panel, made up of six Governors, four members of the Bush Administration and four members of Congress, echoed recent studies that show American students failing to measure up academically. But it contained some good news as well: the percentage of students who earn a high school diploma or its equivalent is at an all-time high, although not significantly higher than it was 15 years ago. Also, drug use by students has declined, the report said.
"This report is not an action plan, it is a measurement instrument," said Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, a Democrat who is the outgoing chairman of the goals panel. "We now have a baseline, and we have a decade-long commitment by the President and 50 governors to move towards the goals."
The report is likely to renew arguments over the financing of Head Start, the Federal preschool program; to heighten debate over whether there should be national education tests and standards, and to provide political grist for both Democrats and Republicans over which party cares most about American education.
But over all, the report tells more about what the nation does not know about its educational status than how far it has progressed toward any single ideal. In many cases, the panel said it was unable to confidently measure progress toward its own goals because of a lack of reliable, standardized information from the states.
 
A Lack of Data
 National standards and national testing for American students are central elements in the education legislation presented to Congress by the Administration in April. Without adequate data to compare children, the Administration believes, it is impossible to know if progress is being made.
The report said there was no data, for example, on 3- to 5-year-olds that show how close the nation is to the first goal: having all children arrive in first grade ready to learn. It noted that there was "significant concern" that many children lack the necessary skills.
Such children are inhibited by factors like poor nutrition, poor health care, inadequate prenatal care for their mothers and other parental problems. Some educators and lawmakers, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, say the Administration could make great progress in preparing these children for school by fully financing Head Start. The Administration wants to spend $2.5 billion on Head Start in the 1992 fiscal year, enough to enroll 633,415 children, or 58 percent of the 4-year-olds it believes are eligible and interested.
On the second goal, a high school graduation rate of at least 90 percent, the panel relied on data from the National Center for Education Statistics, which showed that between 1975 and 1990 the number of 19- and 20-year-old students who have completed a high school degree or its equivalent rose to 83 percent from 81 percent. Among blacks, the rate rose to 78 percent from 66 percent over roughly the same period. But among Hispanic students, it declined to 60 percent from 63 percent.
 
Long Way to Go
 Goal three calls for American students, by the year 2000, to be able to leave school with demonstrated competence in English, mathematics, science, history and geography. Here the report incorporated data on national education trends reported today by the federally financed National Assessment for Education Progress.
Fewer than one in five students in 4th, 8th and 12th grades has reached competence in mathematics, the assessment found. But the number of Advanced Placement exams taken by high school juniors and seniors in English, mathematics, science and history has increased by 51 percent since 1986.
The fourth goal calls for American students to be first in the world in science and mathematics achievement. Here the report relied on earlier studies, which show students in the United States doing poorly in relation to others their age.
The fifth goal calls for every American to be literate and possess the skills to compete in a global economy. The panel reported that the vast majority of American adults are unable to carry out tasks like interpreting the main argument from a lengthy newspaper column or using a page from a shopping catalog to fill out an order form and calculate costs.
The sixth goal calls for every school to be free of drugs and violence and offer a disciplined environment for learning by the year 2000. Here again, the report card offered an incomplete picture. Marijuana use at school by 12th graders dropped from 21 percent of high school seniors in 1980 to 6 percent in 1990. At the same time, in a 1989 survey, about 30 percent of high school seniors reported that alcohol and marijuana were easy to obtain in their schools.
The report said violence remained a problem and found that black students were more likely to be the victims of violent crime than Hispanic or white students.
When the national goals were announced in the spring of 1990, educators expressed skepticism, noting that the goals had been set by politicians rather than experts in the field. And educators were quick to react critically to today's report.
"If President Bush truly wants to be the education President, he needs to use his influence to make 'better childhoods' a national priority," said Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association.
Some Democratic lawmakers recently accused the Bush Administration of using the issue of education, an arena where the Federal role has traditionally been small, to further Mr. Bush's as yet unannounced bid for re-election. Until the appointment of Lamar Alexander as Education Secretary earlier this year, there was little Federal momentum in the education arena.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Gets Polite Brushoff in Japan

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, churning through his first day of meetings in Japan, repeatedly told government officials here that Japan had to do more to open its markets to American investments and exports. But he was told repeatedly in return that Japan was doing all that it could.
Mr. Cuomo thus became the latest United States official to ask Japan to take steps to open its markets, only to hear that the problem of lagging American exports to Japan, the biggest source of mutual friction, was basically for the United States to solve. 
 "It's obvious that in many areas, you are simply intent on not allowing other people to compete," Mr. Cuomo told an executive at the Olympus Corporation, which makes cameras and other high-technology equipment. "You have a right to do that, but it's a problem."
It was a theme Mr. Cuomo repeated at meetings with the Foreign Minister, Taro Nakayama, and the Minister of International Trade and Industry, Eiichi Nakao. Those officials reportedly listened politely, then told Mr. Cuomo that Japan was doing as much as it could to meet American demands.
 
A Three-Part Theme
 "Cuomo is a very good salesman," said a Foreign Ministry official. But he said Mr. Nakayama told the Governor that "each country has its own way of solving these questions" and that the United States should first reduce the Federal budget deficit in an effort to improve the trade situation.
Mr. Cuomo, who is in Japan to promote exports of New York-made products to Japan, particularly those of small and medium-sized manufacturers, sounded a three-part theme during his first day: Japanese investment and involvement in the United States was welcome, the United States had to do more to solve its own economic problems and Japan had to do more to open its markets to American investments and products.
He said Americans were increasingly willing to blame Japan for America's economic woes, just as Americans were blaming politicians like himself, regardless of whether the blame was fair. If Japan failed to respond to United States efforts to improve the trade situtation, Mr. Cuomo said, "the political pressure is bound to create undesirable results."
While Mr. Cuomo agreed with his Japanese hosts that the United States was responsible for not addressing such problems as a declining educational system and the growing Federal deficit, he nonetheless asserted that Japan still had to do its share to reduce trade imbalances.
 
Little Interest in the Press
 Mr. Cuomo also repeated a familiar incantation to American journalists: "I am not running for President even though reporters don't believe me."
It was too early to tell how Mr. Cuomo was being received, but his visit seemed to stir little interest in the Japanese press. To them he seemed to be yet another in a string of about 30 governors who have come to Japan on economic missions in the last two years.
Mr. Cuomo also toured the Olympus Corporation, which has a joint venture with Symbol Technologies Inc. of Long Island to make high-technology instruments that are then sold in Japan.
He also performed double duty as a New York State commercial officer, pushing Japan to buy air reconnaisance planes built by the Grumman Corporation on Long Island to meet Japan's pledge to perform air surveillance over its surrounding sea lanes.
Mr. Nakayama, the Foreign Minister, said Japan would give "due consideration" to Mr. Cuomo's request, a spokesman said. But defense officials have said that a decision on what planes to buy would not be made for a year.
The Governor seemed to have the most fun meeting with one of Japan's most successful elected politicians, Gov. Sunichi Suzuki of the Tokyo metropolitan government, who recently won his fourth four-year term in a bruising political campaign.
Presented a key to the city, Mr. Cuomo thanked Mr. Suzuki but added, "What I'd really like is the key to your political success."

HEADLINE: Legislators Seek Exoneration In House Bank Controversy

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Stung by criticism from constituents, more than two dozen lawmakers have asked officials of the House of Representatives to certify that they were not among the House members who had insufficient funds to cover checks drawn on the House bank last year, lawmakers and House officials said today.
A study issued this month by the General Accounting Office, an investigating arm of Congress, found that House members did not have sufficient funds to cover a total of 8,331 checks written last year. In none of these cases, the audit found, did the bank impose penalties. The accounting office reported that 24 House members wrote at least one uncovered check for $1,000 or more each month for the last six months of 1990. 
 Both the G.A.O. and House officials have refused to name the offenders, but it is understood that they include Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, rich and poor. Millionaires were among the worst offenders, House officials said, noting that many entrusted their checkbooks to aides.
The House bank has stopped the practice of honoring the uncovered checks. Members who wish to write checks on the House bank will now be required to belong to the House credit union, which will cover the checks and charge lawmakers the prevailing interest rates in the event of an overdraft, said Speaker Thomas S. Foley. Of the 435 House members, 300 belong to the credit union.
 
Questions From Voters
 Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, a Kentucky Democrat who asked for and received an exonerating letter from Jack Russ, the House's Sergeant at Arms, recalled his embarrassment when the accounting office report was published. He said his constituents asked how fiscal policy could be entrusted to lawmakers who could not handle their own finances, and resented the lawmakers' ability to obtain what amounted to interest-free loans.
"I had had a meeting with some constituents the day the news broke," Mr. Mazzoli said in an interview. "It was an issue raised by the constituents, and raised in a way that was very hurtful to me in that it reflected extremely unfavorably on the House as an institution.
"It's a minuscule amount of money, but it says that members of Congress are saying that the normal rules don't apply to them."
Representative David Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, requested a similar letter, only to learn that he had lacked sufficient funds to cover several relatively small checks he wrote during a 12-day period, said Jack Cole, the Congressman's press secretary. Mr. Obey made the admission to CongressDaily, a report on Capitol Hill activities published by the National Journal.
 
'A Private Matter'
 The letters of exoneration are being written even though Mr. Foley, a Washington Democrat, said last week that they should not be necessary. Asked on the House floor whether it would be proper for the Sergeant at Arms to "prepare a letter so as not to identify the transgressors but to free the innocent," the Speaker replied, "I think the member's word in this matter is trustworthy, and the members can say whatever they wish to the press."
Some lawmakers, including Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, were reluctant to discuss their check-writing practices. Mr. Solarz said he was unaware of having written any bad checks but believed that "one's tax returns and checking accounts are a private matter."
"I disclose everything I'm obligated to disclose," he said, "but one must try to preserve in this business some modicum of privacy."
The opposite view was expressed by Representative Scott L. Klug of Wisconsin, who is among a group of seven freshman Republicans who asked for a full disclosure of those who abused their checking privileges. "We can get John Sununu's travel records," Mr. Klug said in an interview from Madison, "but you can't get any information at all in the House. That's a double standard that I think makes the House look like it's hiding things."
 
'It Raises Questions'Check-Kiting Operation?
 "At some point, if the checks were substantial enough and on a frequent basis, it raises questions about whether it was a check-kiting operation," Mr. Klug added, referring to the practice of writing checks against insufficient funds to obtain credit.
Mr. Klug said he had also asked for a letter of exoneration, as a "pro forma" matter.
The lawmakers' check-writing privilege goes back 200 years, to the early days of the House bank, which is technically a disbursing office, House officials said. They said that over the years several presidents and senators who served their political apprenticeships in the House had been among those who wrote checks without sufficient funds to cover them.
Journalists and Congressional aides who used the House bank to cash their own checks often did not have enough money in their accounts to cover the checks, House officials said.
The officials said the House bank had never lost money on the uncovered checks. Most are uncovered for just one or two days, but some remain so for a month or two.

HEADLINE: For Babies, an Ounce Can Alter Quality of Life

SERIES: Smallest Survivors: Dilemmas of Prematurity - Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
Cutler Dozier is a quick-witted, lively 4-year-old who gives not the slightest sign of how precariously his life began.
Born after only 26 weeks in the womb and weighing just 2 pounds 6 ounces, he spent the first two and a half months of his life on the precipice of medical calamity in the neonatal intensive care unit of Minneapolis Children's Hospital. He could not breathe on his own, he was severely jaundiced, his heart had a hole that prevented his blood from being properly oxygenated and he had to be fed through a tube directly into his small intestine. 
 But, as his mother, Phyllis Dozier of Eagen, Minn., put it, he was "a tough little tyke" who, despite his extreme prematurity, managed to leave the hospital more or less intact. Except for his small size and lung problems he has since overcome, he has no apparent physical or mental defects.
Cutler is a modern miracle, the beneficiary of extraordinary strides that have been made in the last two decades to support and nurture fetuses that leave the womb long before they can survive on their own.
Every year in the United States, 45,000 babies are born weighing less than three and a half pounds and more than two months premature. Today, 80 percent to 85 percent of these "very low birth-weight" babies live long enough to leave the hospital, four out of five of them without major physical or mental disabilities.
But Cutler belongs to the category of very premature infants who weigh more than 750 grams (1 pound 10 ounces) at birth. Infants born below this weight have a much higher chance of physical disability. And even with babies who weigh up to 3 pounds 10 ounces at birth, researchers are finding that many with apparently normal intelligence and sensory development turn out on reaching school age to have learning disorders and behavioral difficulties that can spell academic failure.
So far, Cutler seems fine. But Mrs.
Dozier said: "We don't know what will happen when he starts elementary school. We're still waiting for the other shoe to drop."
 
'Fetal Infants'
Saving More, At Higher Price
 In decades past, before the advent of sophisticated neonatal care, only an occasional extremely premature and very tiny baby weighing little more than a pound would survive and somehow grow up more or less normal. Today survival is commonplace even among the "fetal infants" who have spent little more than half the normal time in the womb and weigh only a pound or two.
Today the most pressing question is not survival, but the quality of that survival.
"Our ability to assess and report the outcome of surviving very-low-birth-weight infants has lagged behind our willingness to resuscitate them," Dr. Gabriel J. Escobar of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Walnut Creek, Calif., and his co-authors wrote recently in an analysis of 111 studies that examined the fate of very-low-birth-weight babies
"We didn't know what we were getting into" when Cutler was in the hospital surmounting one medical crisis after another, Mrs. Dozier recalled. "No one could tell us what kind of child we would end up with, and we could only hope we would have the skills as parents to cope with whatever problems he would have."
Two infants who shared the neonatal intensive care unit with Cutler offer vivid examples of what can go wrong. Christopher Strommen of St. Louis Park, Minn., born at 1 pound 2 ounces after only 23 weeks' gestation, is blind and very delayed in his development. At 4 years of age, he still communicates with grunts and squeals. Emily Hanson of Bloomington, Minn., who was born after 27 weeks' gestation weighing 1 pound 11 ounces, has cerebral palsy and must use a walker or wheelchair. Her speech and other cognitive functions are also delayed, and she is still fed primarily through a tube in her stomach.
Both of these children were born to middle-class parents who were willing and able to devote time, money and educational and emotional resources to rearing children with serious disabilities and seeing to it that the children became well-integrated into the family and the community.
Even after they leave the hospital, babies like Christopher and Emily may need therapy that can cost of tens of thousands of dollars. Their parents may end up trapped in jobs they might otherwise leave, solely because the employer provides good medical insurance. Even then, the parents may spend thousands of dollars on care their policies do not cover.
The situation is even bleaker for the disproportionate number of premature babies born into families with limited economic and social resources. Many premature babies have unwed mothers, some barely out of childhood themselves. Others are born to women who abuse drugs or alcohol.
"Children born both very premature and into a low socioeconomic environment have a double whammy," said Dr. Maureen Hack, a neonatologist at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland.
On the other hand, Christopher Strommen, the blind, nonverbal child who was 14 months old before he was able to leave the hospital, came home to parents who were dedicated to his well-being and willing to do whatever it took to foster his development. He now attends a preschool that has both normal children and some children with special needs. He receives regular physical, occupational and speech therapy and his mother, Judy Strommen, said he is making progress, however slowly.
"On the plus side," she said, "he's an extremely happy, good-natured little guy with strong attachments to everyone in the family."
Infants that are not so lucky may languish in hospital wards for years.
 
Lasting Legacies
Physical Problems Beyond Infancy
 While the majority of premature babies escape serious permanent harm, the legacy of desperate efforts to keep them alive can sometimes be severe visual damage, stunted growth and lungs too brittle to breathe without a respirator. During the first years of life, very premature babies tend to be highly susceptible to respiratory infections and many have problems eating, digesting food and absorbing nutrients.
Far more severe and irreversible complications can result from hemorrhages that occur in the brains of many of the tiniest babies. These "brain bleeds," as they are called, can, if severe, cause disabling movement disorders like cerebral palsy or serious intellectual deficits like mental retardation. Such a brain bleed was the cause of Emily Hanson's neurological damage. Less extensive hemorrhages may cause more subtle motor or cognitive problems.
"The smaller the baby the poorer the outcome is likely to be," Dr. Hack said. Over all, among those babies weighing less than 1,500 grams who survive, 16 percent to 18 percent will have "lasting neurological impairment" -- cerebral palsy or mental retardation, she said. For babies under 750 grams, 25 percent to 33 percent are so affected, and for those weighing from 500 to 600 grams at birth, 40 percent to 50 percent will be neurologically abnormal.
While these percentages of severely damaged babies may seem unacceptably high, those at greatest risk of serious consequences -- the "very low birth weight" babies that weigh less than 3 pounds 5 ounces, or 1,500 grams -- represent less than 1 percent of all live births. And fewer than two babies in a thousand weigh half that -- called "extremely low birth weight" -- and survive.
The vast majority of premature births occur after 32 of the normal 40 weeks of pregnancy and the babies weigh four and a half pounds or more. Nearly all of these larger infants leave the hospital neurologically normal and, if properly fed and nurtured, catch up in growth within a year or two.
But 5 percent to 10 percent of the very-low-birth-weight babies will have cerebral palsy involving the legs only or the legs and arms, and a similar percentage will be mentally retarded (with I.Q.s below 70). Other possible serious complications of extreme prematurity include seizure disorders, blindness or very poor vision and deafness, as well as milder forms of physical disability and mental slowness.
Researchers at McMaster University in Ontario who studied 129 extremely-low-birth-weight babies found that at 8 years of age the children had "as expected" more neurological impairments, general health problems and stunted physical growth than a comparable group of children who were not born prematurely.
But the researchers, led by Dr. Saroj Saigal, said they were encouraged by their finding that from two-thirds to three-fourths of the children "were performing in the normal range on most measures other than visual-motor integration and motor function."
In their report, published in May in The Journal of Pediatrics, the researchers emphasized that the greater needs these children have for special community and educational services "is not likely to pose a significant burden to society because the overall survivors number fewer than 0.2 percent of live births."
 
State of Mind
Learning Problems Surface Later
 But even premature babies who leave the hospital ostensibly neurologically normal do not always stay normal. In a study of 249 very-low-birth-weight children published last July by Dr. Hack and her colleagues, tests conducted at 8 years of age found that 25 percent had an I.Q. of less than 85 (slow normal) and 34 percent were doing poorly in a combined measure of academic skills.
At the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque, Dr. Jean Lowe, an educational psychologist, and Dr. LuAnn Papile, a neonatologist, showed that even children who tested neurodevelopmentally normal at 1 and 2 years of age often performed below normal on tests administered at ages 5 and 6. This decline in performance, which could impair learning, was more likely to be seen in children who had mild brain bleeds as premature infants.
Over all, said Dr. Marie C. McCormick of the Children's Hospital in Boston, several large and well-designed studies that took social class into account have shown that one-fourth to one-third of seemingly normal children who weighed less than 1,500 grams at birth are likely to have learning or behavioral problems once they enter elementary school. The most frequent learning disorder involves visual-motor skills -- the ability to translate what the eye sees into a proper physical response. For example, a child with visual-motor problems is likely to have difficulty copying figures or letters.
Another common problem is attention-deficit disorder, the inability to pay attention long enough to hear instructions or complete a task. Children with this problem often fail academically even though they may be bright. Many are also labeled hyperactive because they often disrupt classroom activities.
Dr. McCormick, who directs an infant follow-up program, said that even larger premature babies -- those who weigh less than five and a half pounds -- are more likely than full-term children to have behavioral problems like distractibility and difficulty focusing and concentrating, which can interfere with learning.
 
Early Intervention
Saving Children And Money, Too
 Hospitals that treat large numbers of premature babies in neonatal intensive care units typically follow the children for two years after they leave the hospital to monitor their physical and neurological development. Neonatologists are now beginning to realize that this is neither long enough nor comprehensive enough to assure the babies' maximum possible development.
Parents of premature babies need treatment too, Dr. Ruth T. Gross of Stanford University insists. A major study she directed showed that providing intensive help for both premature babies and their families in the first years after birth can greatly reduce the need for remedial education later on.
Even though the high-quality intervention she advocates is very expensive, costing $10,000 to $15,000 a year per child for two years, the later savings in educational costs -- $5,00 to $6,000 a year for 12 years -- would more than compensate. Over and above this, she said, society would save by fostering the development of an adult who is more likely to become a productive citizen.
The study, financed primarily by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was conducted at eight university centers among 985 infants who were born before 37 weeks' gestation and weighed less than five and a half pounds.
The babies were randomly assigned to receive either regular pediatric follow-up care or regular care supplemented by intensive intervention by child development specialists. Home visits were made weekly the first year and biweekly the second. Parents were taught what to expect from their baby and how to respond appropriately to promote the child's development. Starting at the age of 1 the children attended specialized day care that fostered social, linguistic and motor skills.
The project's dramatic results, the first three years of which were published last year in The Journal of the American Medical Association, showed that those babies who received an educational boost and whose families received professional guidance on child development had significantly higher I.Q.s and many fewer behavioral problems.
Under grants from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Pew Charitable Trusts, the children are now being followed until they are 8 1/2 years old.. A participant in the ongoing study, Mimi Graham, an educational consultant at Florida State University Center for Prevention and Early Intervention, said that at age 6 only one-third as many children who received early intervention needed special education. She calculated that the resulting savings over a 20-year period would be $20,887 per child.
"Now what we need is a Madison Avenue approach to sell early intervention," she said. "The costs -- both monetary and societal -- of not preventing these problems in premature babies is just too high."
Dr. Michael Whitfield, a neonatologist, put it this way: "We're creating a new species of human being and don't yet know what their outcome will be. It's not enough just to wave goodbye and wish them well when they leave the nursery. We have an obligation to these children because we kept them alive."

HEADLINE: BUSH'S ARMS PLAN: Battle Cry In Congress;
Lawmakers Brace For Fight on Arms

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
In his speech to the nation on Friday night, outlining major reductions in American nuclear armaments, President Bush warned against "unwise or unwarranted cuts in the defense budget" and said he was "counting on Congressional support" for his plans for the future.
On Sunday morning, his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said that by pushing ahead with plans for eliminating most tactical nuclear weapons Mr. Bush might win increased cooperation from the Democrats on Capitol Hill. The Democratic majority "will be more inclined to give the President what he needs for the defense of the country and less inclined to micro-manage," he said. 
 But early comments by influential Democratic lawmakers suggest that the White House may well have made a serious miscalculation.
With the precipitous decline in Soviet power and the crumbling of the Soviet economy, all of the political momentum is running against military spending. Worrying about their own economy, concerned about education and health care and other domestic issues, more and more Americans are concluding, according to the polls, that the time for pouring most of their tax dollars into the enormous military budget is nearing an end.
Making just that point, Senator John McCain, a conservative Republican from Arizona who sits on the Armed Services Committee, said he thought "the American people should be rewarded in some fashion for the fruits of their labors" -- preferably through tax cuts and deficit reduction.
Although he said Mr. Bush enhanced his standing by the boldness of his proposals, Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution, a leading Washington research organization, also suggested that the President "probably legitimized the Democratic efforts to argue for a more rapid defense build-down."
The problem is this: To justify the abandonment of some American nuclear weapons and the removal of others from alert status, President Bush and his aides argued eloquently that there was no longer much prospect of war with the Soviet Union, which is what many of the weapons were built for. And that just whetted the Democrats' appetites for deeper cuts by giving them a ready-made philosophical justification for diverting more spending to domestic needs.
Mr. Bush himself said that the prospect of a Soviet invasion into western Europe was "no longer a realistic threat." Earlier that same day, Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had used stronger language in speaking to the Senate Armed Services Committee.
"We have seen our implacable enemy of 40 years vaporize before our eyes, a victim of its own contradictions, its imperial ambitions destroyed by the flame of freedom and by our willingness to meet the challenge that was put forward to us by the Soviet empire over the last 40 years," he declared.
Comments like those are hardly intended to build support for such projects as the B-2 bomber and the "Star Wars" missile defense program, which were in considerable trouble on Capitol Hill even before Mr. Bush spoke.
 
'Our Greatest Threat'
 Asked today if he thought the Administration's initiative would lead to further military cuts, the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, replied, "Yes, I think it will and should." In a preview of the approach Democratic candidates are likely to take in next year's campaign, he added: "Our greatest threat is here, in America. It comes from the steady erosion of our economy."
Others disagree. Representative G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery, an influential conservative Democrat from Mississippi, said he thought "we're cutting the military too much." He argued: "When you spend money for defense, you get two things, a good defense if you handle your money right and secondly you get people jobs. That's the name of the game out here, keeping people working."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said it was "disappointing" that having reduced tactical weapons, Mr. Bush "failed to apply the same compelling logic to pull the plug on the B-2 bomber and scale back 'Star Wars' from its gold-plated Cold War spending levels."
The B-2 and missile defense programs came under sharp attack in the Senate during last week's debate on the $291 billion military budget for next year. They survived, but Budget Committee officials predicted that Mr. Bush's speech would convince enough Senators that the Soviet menace was dead to hurt the two programs when conferees from the Senate and House of Representatives seek a compromise.
The House voted to halt B-2 production after completion of the 15 bombers already authorized, only one-fifth of the 75 envisaged in a scaled-down program approved by the Pentagon in April 1990 and four fewer than the White House had asked, and to cut Star Wars spending to $3.5 billion from $5.2 billion. The Senate voted for 19 bombers and $4.6 billion for the missile defense program.
Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, the staunchly pro-defense chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Mr. Bush had undercut his negotiating position. He also called for savings of about $1 billion a year by mothballing the B-1 bomber fleet, which is now grounded for safety reasons. And he suggested that fewer aircraft carriers might be needed.
Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who sits on the Armed Services Committee, said in an interview with Fox television, "The B-2 didn't pass in the House and barely passed in the Senate, so I would think as of this Monday morning the B-2 is in a lot more jeopardy."
Another potential target for cuts is the Seawolf attack submarine.
But Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, noted that "real budget impact requires changes in conventional forces," not merely decisions not to build "big-ticket" items. And Congress has yet to examine the planned 25 percent reduction in military forces or the base force to be left after those cuts take effect.

HEADLINE: Money Scarce, Dinkins Warns; Labor Dismayed

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration has warned labor leaders that it is considering paring proposed property-tax increases, a decision that would deprive them of an important source of money for wage increases.
That warning, delivered by Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel in a speech to labor leaders over the weekend, represents the opening of a crucial phase in the city's negotiations with organized labor, which have been badly tangled since the city reached a controversial agreement with the teachers' union a year ago today. 
 Mr. Steisel's speech was intended to explicitly caution the unions not to expect that revenue from the proposed property-tax increase -- supplemented, perhaps, with money from a bond refinancing and additional state aid -- would be available for raises. Rather, scaling back on the increase could deepen projected deficits, which the Dinkins administration is counting on labor's cooperation to close.
 
The Threat of Layoffs
 In a bow to political and economic reality, the deputy mayor said the administration was backing away from the taxes because of their potential impact on New York City's stagnant economy and the probability that the City Council would reject them.
Mr. Steisel balanced a largely conciliatory speech in Atlantic City on Saturday to a meeting of the Municipal Labor Committee, a confederation of New York City public employee union leaders, with warnings that the unions's failure to grant concessions might make wage increases in any of the next four years politically untenable and would likely provoke further demands that some city services be turned over to private contractors.
Regardless, he said, a possible infusion from the Municipal Assistance Corporation and additional state Medicaid money "will not eliminate the need for significant downsizing -- accompanied in part by work force reductions."
The administration was hoping, though, that the possible re-emergence of those two financial contributions from others might revive stalled talks with unions over givebacks. Labor leaders were sending conflicting, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, signals in response.
Some were suggesting privately that they were prepared to devise their own broad austerity plan and one, Barry Feinstein of Teamsters Local 237, was threatening to bolt the concession talks and focus only on his contract, which expired yesterday.
Asked whether he found Mr. Steisel's remarks conciliatory, Mr. Feinstein said yesterday that he was awaiting the text because at the conference "I was too infuriated to listen."
Mr. Steisel acknowledged that "there have been misunderstandings and some contention on both sides of the table," and held out hope that the unions would share in efficiency savings -- like those he negotiated when he was sanitation commissioner. He hinted at another round of early retirement incentives and promised to rely on more attrition to avoid layoffs.
 
6,000 Workers Gone
 Since June, the city has laid off 3,000 employees in mayoral agencies and the Board of Education plus 3,000 others in places like the Health and Hospitals Corporation and libraries. The unions have maintained that attrition would make layoffs unnecessary, but the administration has demanded flexibility to reassign certain employees who survived and to get the most out of them so as not to gut municipal services.
Mr. Steisel said the administration's policy is to maintain a wage freeze through the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992. But other city officials said that if the unions want raises, the administration might give them in return for concessions: a 3 percent pay raise, one official suggested, could be justified with 4 percent worth of concessions. Each 1 percent pay increase for all 240,000 municipal employees costs the city about $140 million.
Without concessions, the Dinkins administration is prepared to freeze wages and threaten another round of layoffs when it outlines a revised financial plan to state monitors as early as next week.
Further complicating negotiations is the prospect that the state will begin relieving the city's Medicaid burden, as proposed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last week, and that the assistance corporation will generate hundreds of millions of dollars by refinancing its debt -- but only if labor contributes, too.
Felix G. Rohatyn, the assistance corporation chairman, warned yesterday that a failure to reach agreement on enduring savings by later this month would jeopardize the refinancing.
The administration has hinted before that it might seek ways to avoid raising the property tax by more than $1.5 billion over three years, as it had proposed. In June, the Council shaved the Mayor's property-tax request in half.
One year ago today, Mayor David N. Dinkins announced a surprisingly generous 5.5 percent salary increase for the teachers' union. The settlement avoided a strike but triggered recriminations from other unions. This year, even the teachers' union is angry.
More than half the city's employees are working without a contract. The teachers' decision last week to join them -- only the second time in its three-decade history that the union has worked after its contract has expired -- reflects both its uncertainty about city finances and labor's increasingly contentious relationship with a Mayor whom many of the unions helped elect.
Sandra Feldman, the teachers' union president, yesterday echoed other labor leaders who hope their members will be spared layoffs through savings in other agencies or through attrition.
 
'There's Nothing to Negotiate'
 Ms. Feldman's reticence this year was in contrast to her threat to strike without a contract last year -- a threat that provoked a deep rift within the administration between those who insisted that the teachers deserved more than other unions and those who warned that the settlement would set a pattern that the city could not match in other contracts.
Ms. Feldman said yesterday that the city's financial situation is more precarious than it was a year ago, but that raises were still possible and were reasonable -- particularly because the union had deferred some benefits earlier this year to avoid layoffs.
After returning from the meeting of the Municipal Labor Committee, Stanley Hill, executive director of the largest municipal employees union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said yesterday, "There's nothing to negotiate."
And asked whether he found any cause for hope, James F. Hanley, the city's Director of Labor Relations, replied, "No."
Labor neogitations were further complicated this year by the dismissal of Mr. Hanley's predecessor, Eric J. Schmertz, after internal bickering finally erupted in public, and by Mr. Feinstein's preoccupation over the summer with the sudden death of his wife.
Mr. Hill's 15-month contract runs out in December. Bargaining is to resume today on a teachers' contract, which expired yesterday, as did the city's labor pact with Mr. Feinstein of the Teamsters. The police union, which entered binding arbitration with the city last month, has been working without a contract since June 30, 1990.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Peace Dividends

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
How swiftly and richly it has come -- the first great dividend of the disintegration of the centralized Soviet state.
Only a moment ago, the very idea of the collapse of Soviet central authority terrified the governments of Western Europe and the United States. They did what they could to shore up Mikhail Gorbachev in his struggle to keep the system working through maneuver, reform, tacking. 
 They failed. But the destruction of the Soviet internal empire was no sudden miracle. It came about through hard decades of the rot of built-in corruption, of bravery and suffering by its opponents at home, and the long wearing away of the Kremlin's strength by the commitment of Western military and economic power to containment.
But when the centralized power of the Communist Party and Moscow began to fall apart, Western politicians and theorists for the most part were filled with fear rather than rejoicing. They saw the dangers of conflict and disorder, which were and are real.
But they tended to pass over or minimize the benefits that the end of central rule could bring not only to Soviet citizens but to the world. They were paralyzed either by anxiety or by their own past political insistence on the critical importance of Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviet state.
The first dividend, of course, is the steps taken by President Bush to pull back nuclear forward forces -- including the destruction of short-range nuclear shells.
Fine -- but they do have one strange gap. Why no provision for mutual inspection once they are matched? Inspection is important not only for the U.S. but for the Soviet people, to make sure that no regional leader can squirrel away a shell or two. There's still time to patch up that hole.
Still, Mr. Bush's decisions were realistic, minimally risky now, and a step toward even more important stand-downs. That is plain and so should be this: they would have been impossible if Mr. Gorbachev had succeeded in maintaining the Soviet central structure in command.
The disintegration of central power allowed Mr. Bush to talk reciprocity not with a handful of top, never-elected apparatchiks who controlled Soviet military and political decisions but to representatives of the republics. They have everything to gain in getting rid of all or many nuclear bombs -- including the blessings of their voters.
So Mr. Bush said let's not spend years negotiating, let's act. He knew that Mr. Gorbachev could not negotiate right now, forget years to come and that only the republics act at all.
Yes, there's trouble ahead for many of those republics. Some of their leaders are dreary Communist hacks. Boris Yeltsin himself owes the world an explanation of precisely how he feels about Pamyat, a Russian Fascist group -- no more lackadaisical ambiguities. He knows how to make himself clear when he wants to.
Almost all the republics are still figuring out where to go, let alone how to get there. The West urges them to jump into total free market systems. But the people of the republics are shrewd enough to see that each and every Western government subsidizes producers, prices and social services of its particular choice.
Certainly, the ethnic hatreds that festered under Communism are breaking out. Be sure that Western politicians and specialists will again say, to see or deal with it we must protect, or resurrect, whatever is left of the Soviet central system.
The temptation for Western leaders will be to try to do that. Centralized authority always seems so much neater and easier to deal with.
Sometimes it is -- in a free society. But in imposed systems, whether Lenin's or Saddam Hussein's, centralization and despotism are twins. Their milk of life is war of aggression abroad or war of repression at home.
The U.S. cannot determine the exact mix of economic and state enterprise in the republics -- any more than it can India's, or Canada's. That is not our business.
But political freedom in the former Soviet Union -- from regional repressions or central dominance -- is our affair. Political freedom is the one best barrier to civil or international war. It is the garden that bears the dividends of peace and tending it should be very much our business.

HEADLINE: Again, the Unemployed Need Public Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Fifty-six years ago, Walter Lippmann wrote a letter to John Maynard Keynes describing some exciting developments in Washington. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration was about to introduce a bill to help the unemployed. 
 Lippmann explained, "we shall set up a scheme of unemployment insurance more or less on the British model, but we shall supplement by providing that when an unemployed man has exhausted the 15 or 26 weeks benefit (the exact amount is not yet settled) to which he is entitled, he will then go off the insurance, but will acquire the right to a job on a public works project."
Lippmann was referring to the landmark Social Security bill, which included provisions for unemployment and old-age insurance. As originally conceived by the President's Committee on Economic Security, the unemployed person who exhausted unemployment benefits would be entitled to a job. The committee called it "employment assurance."
But the revised bill that President Roosevelt signed into law in August 1935 made no mention of employment assurance. That part of the proposal was torn away from Social Security and written into the Emergency Relief Act of 1935, which appropriated $4.8 billion for work relief. Roosevelt turned the money over to Harry Hopkins and his new Works Progress Administration, which provided 8.5 million public jobs to the unemployed over the next eight years.
Social Security has long outlived the W.P.A., and now Congress and the Administration are wrestling with extending unemployment benefits. Wouldn't it be a good time to reconsider the idea of providing public jobs for those who have exhausted their benefits? Looking out my window, I see plenty of public work that needs to be done.

HEADLINE: No Danger in Airport Route During U.S. Open

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leonard L. Fleisig's conclusion (letter, Sept. 4) that "diversion" of some airplane traffic from Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens during the United States Open tennis tournament constitutes some unidentified safety problem is erroneous. Yet he uses it to support his general opposition to the proposed National Tennis Center expansion. 
 The Open is an international sports event that brings great recognition and economic activity to New York City and the borough of Queens. This is important when we are attempting to attract new business while retaining our tax base to avoid further tax increases. The tournament has been a fixture in the park for 10 years and will continue under the lease for at least the next 3.
Last year and this, Mayor David N. Dinkins and I requested the Federal Aviation Administration to use one of two standard runway procedures that minimize noise over the tournament during the hours of play. It is a safe and less complicated takeoff route than turning above the park and avoids a large, heavily populated portion of Queens. Last year, many constituents commented that use of this takeoff route during the Open permitted greater use of backyards and community parks.
Although I endorse in principle retaining the United States Open in Flushing Meadows, I am awaiting word on the terms the Dinkins administration is negotiating. I have advised the administration that Queens, its citizens and its flagship park must substantially benefit from retention of the tournament. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, which generates more income for the city than any other park, has never received adequate attention or resources.
Finally, and most important, when it comes to the safety of our citizens, I have never waivered and will never compromise.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Traders Bid Up Treasury Prices

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Traders in the United States Treasury market, bolstered by a belief that the Federal Reserve will ease credit again soon, bid up prices yesterday, sending bond yields to their lowest level in four and a half years.
Bonds prices rise when there are signs that interest rates are heading down, and traders appear to be growing more convinced that the Federal Reserve will ease credit again soon to keep the recovery on track. 
 The benchmark 30-year bond gained 5/32, or $1.56 for $1,000 face amount, to end at 103 22/32. The yield on the bond closed at 7.80 percent, the lowest since March 1987, and down from 7.81 percent on Friday. The yield was the lowest since March 27, 1987, when it fell to 7.64 percent.
"We're at some interesting levels, levels that haven't been seen for years," said Scott Winningham, chief market analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc.
 
Committee Meets Today
 The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets in Washington today to discuss monetary policy, and some economists expect the Fed to force down interest rates as soon as Friday, after the influential unemployment report for September is issued.
The current target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on short-term loans, is believed to be 5 1/4 percent, and many traders expect the Fed to move it to 5 percent if the unemployment numbers are weak. The rate last month was 6.8 percent.
"The only issue that needs to be resolved right now is the exact timing of the next Fed move," said Anthony Karydakis, an economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. "I would be inclined to say they will probably hold out a little longer."
Douglas McAllister, a sales manager at Prudential Securities Inc., said, "Friday's employment number will give them the first opportunity to ease."
 
Higher Yields Sought
 The intermediate sector of the market, securities that mature in four to seven years, led the way as investors decided to extend maturities for a higher yield than can be obtained at the short end or in bank accounts.
"Intermediate-term investments are being favored by individuals aghast at the low yield in money market funds and bank deposits," one economist said.
Money-market accounts are currently yielding about 4.6 percent, while savings accounts yield about 5.35 percent. The four-year note ended with a 6.42 percent yield, while the seven-year yielded 7.25 percent.
The two-year note yield broke below the key 6 percent level, which traders said showed that another Fed easing was fully expected. The 6 1/8 percent two-year note ended at 100 8/ 32, up 2/32 to yield 5.99 percent.
Usually there is a spread of 100 basis points -- one full percentage point -- between the two-year note yield and the Federal funds rate target, which is now at 5 1/2 percent.
The 7 7/8 percent 10-year note ended at 102 29/32, up 7/32, to yield 7.45 percent. The three- and six-month bills both ended at 5.11 percent. The one-year bill was down two basis points at 5.12 percent.
Following are the results from yesterday's Treasury auctions:

HEADLINE: Lights, Cameras and a Sudden Surge in Action

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
During the hurly-burly of rush hour on a recent afternoon, a film crew had set up on West 58th Street in Manhattan. Horns honked, cabbies rubbernecked, pedestrians gawked and the New York-born director Paul Mazursky yelled "Action!" The New York-born actor Danny Aiello began speaking on cue in a movie about New York.
It was the first film crew the neighborhood had seen for a solid year.
"We're back, and it's about time, too," Mr. Mazursky said during a break from directing "The Pickle," a new Columbia Pictures film. "I think we were in real danger of losing New York as a film community." 
 He referred to the bitter stalemate between Hollywood producers and New York film unions that virtually shut down major-studio film making in New York City from last November to mid-May. The settlement, reached May 16, was viewed as a breakthrough that would bring producers substantial savings for night and weekend shooting in New York, work that had previously entailed considerable overtime penalties.
Until the agreement was reached, producers steered at least 10 films away from New York City, including "Frankie and Johnny" and "The Babe Ruth Story." The Hollywood decision-making amounted to a boycott of New York movie making except for independent productions.
 
Suddenly Short-Handed
 Because of the long lead time in film planning, it has taken since May for productions to reach New York in real numbers. But now they've definitely arrived. "A lot of people's phones started ringing a few weeks ago," said Brian Hamill, the unit photographer for "The Pickle." On one recent day, there were so many film productions in the city that one film union couldn't find enough grips -- the camera-moving crew members -- so some electricians were quickly drafted for camera duty.
In addition to Mr. Mazursky's film, shooting in the city are "Close to Eden," a Sidney Lumet movie about a detective, played by Melanie Griffith, who investigates a murder in the Hasidic community of Williamsburg; "By Any Means Necessary," Spike Lee's biography of Malcolm X starring Denzel Washington, and "Glengarry Glen Ross," an adaptation of the David Mamet play starring Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon.
The city has issued 29 feature-film permits for shooting until the end of the year, said Jaynne C. Keyes, director of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. Among the productions scheduled to film here are "Boomerang," a Paramount comedy starring Eddie Murphy; "Mr. Saturday Night," a Castle Rock film directed by and starring Billy Crystal; "Night and the City," a 20th Century Fox film starring Robert De Niro and directed by Irwin Winkler, and Woody Allen's as yet untitled fall project, his first film for Tri-Star. Also working on films will be Al Pacino, John Turturro, Harvey Keitel and Elizabeth McGovern.
"We are having a great fall," Ms. Keyes said.
 
Spending Money in the City
 Nevertheless the losses, both artistic and economic, have been considerable. The film industry is estimated to generate $500 million to $2.3 billion in business as well as an abundance of ancillary jobs in New York City. Ms. Keyes estimates that more than $100 million was lost during the seven-month film hiatus.
Although activity has picked up, the film industry is a long way from full employment. "I think it'll take the movie industry here about six months to get back in gear," said Lieut. John D. Gasperin, head of the New York Police Department's Movie and Television Unit, which controls crowds and traffic at movie locations. "It's nothing like last year, which was one of our busiest years ever."
Frank Schulz, president of Local 52 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators, said: "During the boycott, we had better than 80 percent unemployment -- and the new contract is a 35 percent giveback." The 2,000-member union, under intense pressure from members of other film unions, voted to accept the new contract on May 16. Union leaders said members' annual salaries would be cut by one-third because of lost overtime from night and weekend shooting.
Michael Hyde, the teamster captain on "The Pickle," said he had been worried during the film drought last summer that he would lose his house. "And I know a couple of guys who actually did," said Mr. Hyde, whose crew of 24 moves equipment trucks, trailers and vans as the unit goes from location to location in midtown Manhattan, Greenwich Village and Brownsville, Brooklyn. "I've been on films here since 1967, and this year was the worst ever. I'd guess 90 percent of our people were out of work," he said of the 350 members of Local 817 of the teamsters.
Jan Foster, the film's location manager, who is covered by the Director's Guild, said: "Many people had to move to Los Angeles and Chicago to get work. I hope they all come back." She was out of work from March to July.
Producers, however, said they have benefited from the new union work rules. "It was like night and day, the difference between shooting in New York before versus now," said Roger Pugliese, co-producer of "Single White Female," a psychological thriller starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridget Fonda that finished six days of shooting here on Friday.
"We saved money on night shooting, under the terms of the new contract," he said. "The attitude has changed, too. In the past they were rigid, and now they're bending over backwards to make things work. We definitely want to come back to New York, whereas in the past we were always a little bit hesitant."
"The Pickle" stars Mr. Aiello as a visiting film director who collides with New York before the screening of his latest opus, a teen-age science-fiction exploitation epic about a giant pickle-esque space ship.
Mr. Mazursky, who is not only the producer, director and writer of "The Pickle," but also plays a Hitchcockian bit part as a film projectionist, said, "I think the new rules will make New York more competitive." He said "The Pickle" would save money under the new rules. "At the last minute, the unions said they'd do a Sunday shoot at no extra cost. That wouldn't have happened before."
"There's no place like New York," said Mr. Mazursky, who will shoot four weeks of exteriors in New York before the company moves to Los Angeles to do interior scenes. "New York can actually change a shot."
While he was directing a scene on Central Park West, Mr. Mazursky said, he noticed a woman wandering by with a poodle and promptly asked if he could make the poodle and the woman the stars of a sequence involving Mr. Aiello. "You'd never have that happen in L.A.," he said. "First of all, no one would be walking. And secondly, if someone were walking a dog, it would be the maid."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Mixed News On Dividends

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
LAST month, for the first time in nearly two years, more companies increased dividends than had done so a year earlier.
That fact, in figures released yesterday by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, was part of a somewhat contradictory report that shows that while there are signs of a revival in the fortunes of corporate America, there are also indications of increasing financial distress. 
 The offsetting indication came from the fact that 29 companies that had been paying dividends chose to stop paying them last month. That figure was the largest of any month in 1991.
Last month, 63 companies raised their payouts, compared with 56 in September 1990, when confidence in the economy was at a low after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the recession had begun.
Among those raising dividends last month were American Express, Union Pacific, Reader's Digest and Upjohn. While not all the companies on the list were large, most were. Of the 500 companies in the S.& P. 500, 12 announced increases, 2 decreases and none disclosed omissions.
By contrast, most of the 29 companies that omitted dividends last month were small ones, a number of them banks that had been forced to raise loan-loss reserves in the wake of real estate problems. The banks that halted payouts included the Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation in Pennsylvania, the Rochester Community Savings Bank in New York and the Bank of San Francisco.
But the list contained not only financial institutions. The Preston Corporation, a trucking company that had slashed its dividend in July, omitted it in September, saying it was more prudent to keep cash flow within the company.
Last month was the first year-over-year improvement in dividend increases since October 1989, when 139 companies raised dividends, up from 138 the year before. September's total was nonetheless a low number; it was the lowest level for a September, other than in 1990, since 1971, when only 24 companies raised dividends. That low figure came when Federal wage-and-price controls limited such increases.
Most companies make dividend decisions on a regular schedule, and fewer companies than normal generally make such decisions in September, reducing the impact of that month's figures.
Nonetheless, Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S.& P.'s Outlook newsletter, said he was encouraged. "I would not be surprised if we had another month or two of negative readings, but I think we are probably around a turning point," he said yesterday. "It is no surprise that directors are not rushing out to boost dividends. They don't really see the end of the recession in their earnings numbers."
While the number of companies omitting dividends in September was unusually high and an indication that many companies are continuing to suffer, the number of companies reducing but not eliminating payouts was unsually low, at seven. That was down from 12 a year earlier, and the lowest figure for any month since January 1990.
For the entire third quarter, 217 companies raised payouts, down from 242 in the corresponding quarter of 1990. That 10.3 percent drop was the smallest for any quarter since the end of 1989.
The dividend picture in this recession has been clouded by the relatively low level of inflation, which has meant that even among companies where business has held steady, fewer have been able to impose price increases and obtain the funds to raise dividends. As a result, while it appears that there will be fewer dividend decreases and omissions this year than in 1982, the year of the last big recession, the number of increases is running well below the 1982 level and is likely to be the lowest since 1971.
When 1991 began, the companies in the S.& P. 500 were paying dividends at an annual rate of $12.25, based on the S.& P. stock index. That meant dividend yield of 3.71 percent, based on prices at the time.
But there were so many dividend cuts among the S.& P. 500 that by mid-August, the dividend figure was down to $12.13. It has since climbed back to $12.18. With the S.& P. 500 index up 17.9 percent this year, that means the dividend yield now is down to 3.13 percent, near the low end of its historic range.
To justify sharply higher stock prices, either investors will have to accept much lower dividend yields, or dividends will have to rise rapidly. In the 1980's, they grew at a compounded rate of 7 percent, but there is widespread doubt that a rate that high will be sustainable in the current decade.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Broadly; Gold Prices Edge Upward

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly higher in uneventful trading on world currency markets yesterday.
Gold prices were marginally higher after finishing mixed overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $354.20 a troy ounce, up 20 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold gained 25 cents an ounce for a late bid price of $354. 
 The dollar posted moderate gains in European trading, and the currency advanced in similar fashion when dealing shifted to domestic markets.
Traders said a report by the nation's purchasing managers that showed the manufacturing sector continued to advance in September helped underpin the dollar.
"The report gave the dollar a boost, but there wasn't that much follow-through," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Chicago-based Harris Trust and Savings Bank. He said the overall sentiment toward the dollar remained bearish.
Traders continue to mark time ahead of Friday's release of employment data for September. If the report is weak, as it is expected to be, market participants anticipate the Federal Reserve will nudge interest rates still lower. Lower interest rates are generally bearish for the dollar because they reduce the value of dollar-denominated securities.
Still, Mr. Johnson said many traders had already taken a rate cut into account, so the dollar might not be affected dramatically.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.23 yen, to a closing 133.18 yen. Later in London, it finished at 133.15 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 133.40 yen, up from 132.95 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7485, from $1.7525 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.7465 to buy one pound, less expensive than Monday's $1.7500.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6685 German marks, up from 1.6650; 1.4550 Swiss francs, up from 1.4505; 5.6845 French francs, up from 5.6740; 1,247.75 Italian lire, up from 1,245.75, and 1.1314 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1318.

HEADLINE: Trying to Give Las Vegas a G Rating

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
Can this sleazy town that never sleeps transform itself into a Disneyland with slot machines, a family place where the kids ride bumper cars while Mom and Dad work the blackjack tables?
It is an unlikely notion, and one that would no doubt dismay the pioneering gangsters of Las Vegas like Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel. It was he who built the first major hotel and casino here in 1947 and invited guests to "come as you are to America's Monte Carlo" -- before being summarily gunned down that year. 
 Now MGM Grand Inc., based in Los Angeles, is about to embark on a $1 billion gamble that one day family vacationers will talk about the town in the same breath with Orlando, Fla., home of Walt Disney World.
The company, which is 86 percent owned by the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, will break ground next week on a singular resort combining the world's largest hotel (5,007 rooms), the world's largest casino, a sports arena bigger than Madison Square Garden and a theme park almost as large as the Walt Disney Company's in Anaheim, Calif. Among the attractions of this diversified gaming palace, a prospectus says, will be an elaborate child-care center.
Corporations like Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. and Mirage Resorts Inc. that own several casinos here have been trying for some time to promote the notion that they offer good clean fun for everyone. They have been helped by the fact that stiff controls on the granting of casino licenses have more or less eliminated organized crime, said Ron Asher, chief of the enforcement division of the Nevada Gaming Control Board.
But through its sheer scale and unique mingling of family attraction and casino, the MGM Grand Hotel and Theme Park is a radical departure in pursuit of what the company's chief executive, Robert R. Maxey, calls "the belief that we can turn this place from a gambling town into the great American vacation spot."
Las Vegas, America's fastest-growing metropolis, with 6,000 new arrivals a month, has already proved itself an adaptable place. The country's economic downturn has largely passed it by. Galvanized by two enormous new hotels and aided by the arrival of Asian high rollers playing for huge stakes, the town has "experienced no significant recession," said Harland Elges, the chief of administration for the state gaming agency.
Indeed, gambling revenue surged 13 percent in the last fiscal year. The hotel occupancy rate, at more than 85 percent, amounts to a remarkable anomaly at a time when the national occupancy rate has slumped to 60 percent. The Las Vegas rate eclipsed that in the Orlando area, where hotel occupancy was 79 percent last year.
The resilient growth of Las Vegas -- from 11.8 million visitors a year in 1981 to 20.3 million last year -- has been based in part on a successful broadening of the town's appeal. Still, it remains a casino town and the MGM project amounts to the boldest statement yet that gambling and children really can go together.
"We're making this investment because we believe that when you put a theme park in a place with 20 million visitors a year -- and that's never been done before -- you get something explosive," Mr. Maxey said. "Last year, only 5 percent of visitors to Las Vegas were children. That can go much, much higher."
The MGM executive is based in makeshift offices overlooking the vestiges of a golf course on a 112-acre site on the Las Vegas Strip. The basic cost of the complex, which is scheduled to open in 1994, is estimated at $875 million, but with financing charges from borrowing more than $500 million, MGM expects the tab to rise to more than $1 billion.
 
Some Skeptics, Some Believers
 Some are skeptical that the money will prove well spent. Stephen A. Wynn, the flamboyant chief executive of the rival Mirage Resorts, said: "A theme park is a whole new dimension for Las Vegas. Still, I wonder if kids' rides, gambling and a hotel are really compatible. Las Vegas is adult entertainment. Gamblers don't like to trip over children, you know."
But Richard J. Byrne, a vice president and gaming analyst at Merrill Lynch, argued that "the theme park amounts to a clever baby-sitting device." He added, "I think the concept will work and that in the gambling business you have to keep inventing new ways to appeal to the public."
Certainly the striking success of two innovative projects has done much to inspire the ambitious plans of MGM Grand, which has no financial ties to the troubled MGM/UA Communications Company.
Both the 4,032-room Excalibur Hotel, which cost Circus Circus $300 million, and Mirage Resorts' more luxurious 3,054-room Mirage Hotel, which cost $730 million, have defied the recession, with occupancy rates of around 90 percent and profit margins of more than 25 percent in their first year of operation.
 
Medieval Merrymaking
 The Excalibur, which opened in June 1990, is a sprawling monument to medieval merrymaking. Guests are greeted by costumed damsels peeking out from behind a turreted reception area. Telephone operators actually say, "Have a royal day!" and a guide to hotel services states: "Here ye! Here ye! His Majesty the King would like to welcome each of you to the land of Excalibur. He hopes you have a royal stay and would like to remind you that all Spectradyne in-room movies are $7.95 each."
For all its kitsch -- outlandish even by this town's standards -- the formula seems to work. The Excalibur, which offers rooms at a mere $39, had estimated operating profits of about $103 million on revenues of $316 million in its first year of operation. This money was made principally on the casino, whose high rate of return makes it possible to lure people by offering rooms relatively cheaply. Rooms at the MGM Grand resort will cost about $70.
Glenn Schaeffer, the president and chief financial officer of Circus Circus, Excalibur's owner said, "We're appealing to the baby boom generation who want to bring their children and to the elderly who, for the first time, have time, money and their health."
Blanca Serrato, for one, likes it. Steering her small son, Jonathan, through the maze of whirring slot machines that fill the Excalibur's lobby, she says that she and her husband have been to the hotel twice this year.
"We like gambling and this is a nice family place," she explained. "Sometimes we bring Grandma and Grandpa to take care of our boy."
Circus Circus, which also owns the Las Vegas hotel of that name, has almost doubled its revenue, to $692.1 million from $373.9 million, in the last five years. Now, it is about to announce another major project on the scale of Excalibur, to be built at the same time as the MGM project.
When it comes to boldness, few rival Mr. Wynn of Mirage resorts. He had a $13 million erupting volcano built outside his Mirage hotel and a 20,000-gallon aquarium of exotic fish placed inside it just to insure the place really looks like Polynesia in Nevada. The result in the first year of operation ended last November: operating profits of $187.6 million on revenues of $660.5 million.
"This hotel is the biggest success in the history of the world," said Mr. Wynn, who is not a man given to understatement.
 
Praise From Competitors
 Even the old family clans, like the Boyds, Binions and Gaughans, whose downtown "Glitter Culch" casinos have been hurt by the new projects, acknowledge Mr. Wynn's ingenuity.
"Wynn is the most creative guy in gambling today," said Michael Gaughan, the president of the Gold Coast and Barbary Coast casinos. "He has brought a whole new meaning to high rolling."
Jack Binion, the owner of the Horseshoe Casino, agreed that "Wynn's success lies in having created a hotel within a hotel for the super players from Asia."
Accommodated in special suites that have their own gardens, statuary swimming pools and putting greens, these gamblers -- mainly from Japan but also from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand -- are capable of gambling as much as $12 million an hour on baccarat, according to several casino executives.
 
Ignoring the Recession
 This combination of high-roller gambling and a new family appeal has helped keep Las Vegas buoyant. Mr. Elges of the Nevada Gaming Board said gambling revenues in Clark County -- essentially Las Vegas -- rose 13 percent, to $4.035 billion, in the year ended June 30 after a 12.2 percent rise the previous year.
But the old downtown area saw its revenues decline slightly, to $657 million in the 1990-91 year from $662 million the previous year, while the Strip -- where Excalibur, Mirage and the planned MGM Grand resort are -- surged. "Downtown is not progressing, and it's a problem," said Mr. Binion, whose Horseshoe casino is in the midst of this more tawdry area.
Another potential problem for Las Vegas is the spread of legalized gambling in the United States, which could provide competition as well as new opportunities for Las-Vegas based gambling companies. With many Indian reservations now allowing gambling and a growing number of states legalizing it, there may be less incentive to come to Las Vegas.
Mr. Byrne of Merrill Lynch conceded that "as gambling proliferates there may be less reason to make the trip." But he argued that Las Vegas still has significant advantages over Atlantic City -- including 24-hour gambling, fewer regulations, visitors who generally stay several days rather than a few hours, and the population drift to the Southwest.
All these factors encourage the likes of MGM Grand and Circus Circus to plan their huge and ever more outlandish projects geared to families. "We're professional managers building one-of-a-kind, must-see entertainment mega-stores," said Mr. Schaeffer of Circus Circus. "That is what is going to turn Las Vegas into the next Orlando."
As for Mr. Maxey of MGM Grand, he reels off the figures for the theme-park-cum-casino: 3,500 slot machines, 165 gambling tables, a raft journey through a 1,600-foot watercourse, a 50-foot plunge on a log into the pond of a logging camp, a ghost coaster with a 35-foot drop.
"People want total fantasy, a release from everyday reality," he said, gesturing toward the vast and empty site. "They've shown us that. So we'd be fools not to provide it."

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Money Funds Fall Again

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts continued to decline for the week that ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, the publication in North Palm Beach, Fla., that focuses on interest rates.
"Not only are the numbers falling quickly," said Robert K. Heady, The Monitor's publisher, "but savers should not expect any rate uptick by banks during the traditional October certificates-of-deposit roll-over period. Weak loan demand is keeping savings rates low, and certain institutions are purposely allowing their deposit bases to erode, thus reducing their cost of funds." 
 This, he says, offers an opportunity for banks' rivals to attract funds.
"Competitors such as mutual funds and brokerages will now aggressively pursue that roll-over money with yields higher than what the banks are paying," he said.
 
Falling Rates
 At New York area institutions, rates are being cut at a rapid pace, Mr. Heady said.
According to The Monitor, the largest change in New York area banks was made by Marine Midland, which lowered its six-month yield on a certificate of deposit by 27 basis points, to 4.86 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
First Nationwide cut the yield on its three-month certificate by 20 basis points, to 4.85 percent, the largest cut for that investment.
The New York branch of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, reduced the yield on its money market account by 26 basis points, to 4.60 percent, the largest cut for such accounts among the area banks.
Among the commercial banks in New York, the average yield on money market accounts, has been cut to 4.72 percent, a decline of 6 basis points, and the average yield on three-month certificates was off by a basis point, to 5.01 percent.
 
S.& L. Yields Lower
 For depositors at savings institutions in the New York area, yields fell by an average of 4 basis points, to 5.02 percent, for money market accounts, and by an average of 3 points, to 5.19 percent, for three-month certificates.
Nationwide, according to The Monitor, the average yields of 20 leading banks outside the New York area have been cut by 4 basis points, to 4.98 percent, on money market accounts, and by 3 points, to 5.24 percent, on six-month certificates.
At the Treasury Department's weekly bill auction on Monday, the three-month bill was auctioned at an average discount rate of 5.11, below the 5.18 percent rate the previous Monday, while that of the six-month bill averaged 5.14 percent, compared with 5.23 percent a week ago.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, October 2,1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Prices Continue Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices moved stubbornly higher yesterday despite a monthly survey showing that United States manufacturing expanded in September for the fourth consecutive month.
The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond, which fell 1/16 of a point in early trading, closed up 4/32, or $1.25 for $1,000 in face amount, to 103 26/32. Its yield was quoted at 7.79 percent, down from 7.80 percent late Monday. 
 The long bond's price has rallied 1 1/2 points in the last four sessions, buoyed by a growing conviction that the Federal Reserve is poised to ease interest rates to help stimulate the economy.
The Fed gave no clues about its near-term monetary course after a meeting yesterday of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. But many traders believe the Fed will move after Friday's unemployment report, which is expected to show continued weakness in the job sector.
"Most people sense if the data portray another shortfall in labor force activity, the Fed is apt to consider further relaxation in money market conditions," said William Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Interest-rate enthusiasm was temporarily dampened early in the session after a widely followed survey showed sustained growth at the nation's factories last month.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of business activity rose to 55 percent last month from August's 54.8 percent. When the index exceeds 50 percent, it generally indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding.
The report surprised economists, who had expected a decline, and sent bonds lower. However, underlying bullishness that the Fed will ease interest rates sent prices upward again.
Mr. Sullivan described the report as "too narrow to have any pronounced influence on Fed policy."
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities were unchanged to 1/16 point higher; intermediate maturities were up 1/8 point to 5/32 point, and long-term issues were up 1/32 point to 3/32 point.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, gained 0.63 to close at 1,220.09.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills issued at auction on Monday eased to 5.23 percent, as the discount rate fell 2 basis points, to 5.19 percent. Yields on six-month bills auctioned Monday fell to 5.33 percent, as the discount rate lost 2 basis points, to 5.12 percent. Yields on one-year bills held at 5.39 percent, as the discount rate stayed at 5.11 percent.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 5 5/16 percent, down from 5 1/2 percent late Monday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 94 29/32, up 5/ 32 point. The average yield to maturity was unchanged from late Monday's 6.89 percent.

Hushing an Engine, Electronically

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Automotive researchers, who have long sought to develop a muffler that would suppress engine noise without creating a drag on horsepower and fuel efficiency, think they are finally nearing that goal.
An electronic muffler is under development by a joint venture between the Walker Manufacturing Company, the exhaust-system division of Tenneco Automotive, and Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc., which specializes in noise and vibration reduction. The joint venture is refining a microprocessor it developed to curb engine noise. The system is designed to generate a pattern of sound waves that in effect cancel out the engine's sound waves.
 
In Touch With Car Makers
 The joint venture, based in Grass Lake, Mich., has been keeping car makers informed of its progress and is working with a manufacturer of diesel truck engines on electronic mufflers for large trucks. Although a few other companies are at work on similar technologies, the participation of Walker -- the largest manufacturer of exhaust systems -- is thought to give the joint venture a marketing advantage.
A conventional muffler dampens the sound produced when the engine ignites fuel, using a series of baffles to redirect the sound of these explosions into an enclosed chamber where much of the sound dissipates. But this conventional muffler system tends to create a buildup of exhaust that causes back pressure on the engine, reducing power and efficiency.
The electronic muffler would have the same purpose as its conventional counterpart -- reducing noice -- but would not create the back pressure. As a result, the designers say, the electronic muffler would raise horsepower by as much as 7 percent and increase fuel efficiency.
"Tests have proven that the mufflers using this technology improve fuel efficiency by as much as 2 percent on the highway and about 5 percent in city driving," said Ronald J. Martoia, general manager of the joint venture.
Mr. Martoia also contends that the system would have no adverse effect on air quality, because pollution controls on modern cars are farther up the exhaust stream, at the catalytic converter or in the engine itself.
The acoustical theory behind the electronic muffler is straightforward. The system is based on the premise that undesirable sound can be neutralized by producing a wave pattern that is an exact opposite of the unwanted wave pattern produced by the engine. Thus, the crests of the first wave of sound are countered by the valleys of an opposing wave, creating a flattened sound wave. To the human ear, this translates into a significant reduction in noise -- only about one-third the sound of an unmuffled engine, officials say.
Applying the opposing-wave principle, Noise Cancellation Technologies, based in Stamford, Conn., is working on products to reduce vibration in car engines and devices to make household appliances quieter.
 
Prototypes Being Tested
 Mr. Martoia said that although the electronic muffler systems were still in the experimental stage, prototypes had been given to the three leading American automobile companies for testing. "We also have prototypes with just about every automobile maker in Europe," he said.
The venture hopes to make the electronic muffler available on an experimental basis on one or two car models within two years. "We can't try out new technology on cars until there are model changes," Mr. Martoia said. "The costs involved in retooling automobile models are high, and we have to wait until it becomes economically feasible for automobile companies to use this technology."
The system basically consists of a microprocessor-powered controller unit that analyzes the noise being produced by the engine and generates the opposing sound waves, and an amplified speaker that plays these sound waves at the tailpipe to cancel out the undesired sound. The microprocessor unit, which could be housed behind the dashboard or under a seat, is roughly 6 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches -- a bit smaller than a paperback novel. The speaker is about six inches in diameter.
A speaker must still be developed that is sufficiently small but also sturdy and powerful enough to keep piping out anti-noise for years through the rigors of daily driving. "We find that there is some trouble in getting the speaker to a size that will fit in the enclosure to allow it to be packaged to fit in the car," Mr. Martoia said. "We're working on developing a new speaker technology that will make it small enough to accommodate fitting under a vehicle."
 
Quick Response Is Required
 Another challenge facing the developers: making sure that their audio computer can respond quickly enough to engine changes. "We want to avoid having a system that does not respond fast enough to the changes in engine speeds," Mr. Martoia said. "The computer has to be able to detect changes in speed quickly enough so that it generates the proper frequencies of sound."
A microphone near the speaker at the tailpipe acts as an electronic ear, monitoring the sound. It sends its signal back to the computerized controller unit, which performs whatever adjustments are necessary to keep the ensemble in tune.
"The whole system produces the opposing wave faster than the ear can possibly detect," Mr. Martoia said. "It has to work at phenomenally fast increments of time."
The companies are testing the electronic muffler on several types of cars, but Mr. Martoia said the product would be "generic in the sense that it doesn't need to be tailored to any specific automobile model."
Walker Manufacturing and Noise Cancellation each started investigating electronic muffler technologies about three years ago. A year later they decided to collaborate, and the joint venture was formed.
 
Expanded to Trucks and Buses
 Under their agreement, the companies originally intended to test the system on passenger cars and light trucks. But the experimentation has been expanded to include electronic mufflers for heavy-duty trucks, farm equipment and buses; earlier this year, the joint venture entered into a development agreement with the Detroit Diesel Corporation, a leading maker of diesel engines, to work on systems for heavy-duty applications.
Mr. Martoia said that the joint venture hoped to price its electronic mufflers competitively with conventional offerings, although he added that the electronic models were likely to be somewhat more expensive. "We don't have the exact numbers yet, because we are still working on developing the electronics in a cost-effective way," Mr. Martoia said.
But the expected higher fuel efficiency and improved horsepower from the electronic mufflers "will more than compensate for the disadvantage of higher costs," he said. Compared with other recent technological advances in automobiles, like air bags and anti-lock braking systems, Mr. Martoia said, "the electronic muffler won't represent very much of a premium."

HEADLINE: Japan's Central Bank Loosens Credit Squeeze

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Japan's central bank took an important step today to stimulate the nation's sagging economy by changing a rule that will release more than $15 billion of cash into the banking system. The move could also give a modest lift to other countries, particularly the recession-bound United States, by making it easier for them to cut interest rates.
The move by the Bank of Japan ended a two-year-old policy of squeezing bank lending to stamp out inflation. 
 Economists said that by substantailly easing what are known as reserve requirements -- a proportion of deposits that commercial banks must keep on reserve with the central bank for safety purposes -- the Bank of Japan is likely to force interest rates lower, increase bank lending and give impetus to Japan's battered stock market.
 
Seen as Signal of Further Easing
 The new reserve requirements take effect on Oct. 16 and reduce the amount required under the old rules by about 40 percent. The central bank estimated that the move would release about 2 trillion yen -- about $15 billion at current exchange rates -- to banks, significantly increasing the amount of money they will have available for new loans.
"This was partly a technical move and partly for policy reasons, but it does send a signal they will ease interest rates further," said Kermit Schoenholtz, an economist here with Salomon Brothers Asia. "In the short term it lets 2 trillion yen of hot money loose, and that will definitely help the banks."
Coming a week before the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the so-called Group of Seven industrialized nations, to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, the easing of Japan's monetary policy is likely to enhance the nation's standing because of the potential benefits to other countries.
 
Speculation on Discount Rate
 In response to today's announcement Japan's stock market rallied, with the Nikkei average jumping a healthy 460.57 points to close at 24,377.01. The interest rates on long-term government bonds fell to a 21-month low: a yield of 5.91 percent on the benchmark 10-year bond. The rate on overnight loans between banks, which hovered near 8 percent in May, is now heading below 7 percent.
The move also fueled speculation that the central bank would reduce its official discount rate later this fall in another effort to help the economy. The discount rate is what the central bank charges commercial banks for short-term loans.
"The bank is responding to the fact that the economy is fragile right now," said Paul Summerville, the economist here for Jardine Fleming Securities. "This is the most accommodative the Bank of Japan has been in two years," he said, "and it will have a positive impact."
The central bank announced it was reducing the amount of cash that commercial banks must keep on deposit in case it is needed to meet sudden withdrawals by customers or other emergencies. Depending on the type of accounts, banks must maintain from 0.05 percent to 1.3 percent of the value of their deposits on reserve with the Bank of Japan, under the new guidelines.
It was the first time in 10 years that the Bank of Japan has altered the reserve requirements as a way of adjusting its monetary policy. In the United States, the Federal Reserve made a similar adjustment late last year to help the flagging American economy.
 
Easing a Period of Tight Lending
 The announcement today provided another sign that the pendulum was starting to swing back after a regimen of high interest rates and tough restrictions on Japanese bank lending over the last two years. From late 1985 to mid-1989, the Bank of Japan had pushed interest rates down to historically low levels, fueling one of the greatest financial booms in history.
But by late 1989, the central bank became concerned that the spiraling prices of stocks and real estate might ignite soaring consumer prices. The Bank of Japan began to clamp down by raising the official discount rate. Earlier this year, when signs of an economic slowdown cropped up, the bank began to ease its discount rate.
But the Finance Ministry maintained tight restrictions on certain kinds of bank lending. Bankruptcies soared, many as a result of the credit squeeze. Liquidity, the amount of cash available for lending and investing, began to dry up.
"There's still a tremendous liquidity squeeze out there," said Kenneth Courtis, economist here for Deutsche Bank Capital Markets. "It will take even greater efforts to make a real impact in that."

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Unchanged in August

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The Government's main economic forecasting index was flat in August after six straight increases dating back to the period immediately after the Persian Gulf war, the Commerce Department reported today.
The unchanged reading for the index of leading indicators, combined with a small decline in a companion index that gauges current business activity, was seen by many analysts as dimming prospects for the economy as the Federal Reserve's policy-setting body met behind closed doors to set monetary policy for the next five weeks. 
 "The message is that the economy seems to have lost some momentum over the summer," said Robert T. McGee, senior vice president of the Tokai Bank Ltd. in New York. "You can see why the Fed and the Bush Administration are concerned."
 
Basically Optimistic
 Nevertheless, Mr. McGee and most other private analysts still say that the recession ended some months ago and that what is already a clear recovery in manufacturing will be augmented before long by a revival of consumer spending.
A private-sector predictive index compiled by Josephthal & Company climbed to 81 in August from 77 in July and 49 in June, far above the low point of minus 114 reached in October 1990. "I think the turn is for real," said David B. Bostian Jr., economist for the Wall Street firm.
Another report today supported the signs of strength among the nation's manufacturers. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its September index of activity in the industrial sector, a precursor of business activity, climbed to 55 from 54.8.
The Commerce Department, however, reported that construction spending was lackluster. Home-building was the only positive sector as overall spending on new construction recorded a rise for August of three-tenths of 1 percent, to an annual rate of $406.2 billion, slightly above the $404.9 billion of July.
Whether the Federal Reserve opts for another round of interest-rate cuts to improve the odds of sustained recovery will depend heavily, analysts said, on Friday's report on the labor market conditions in September. The expectation generally is for a moderate rise in payroll jobs accompanied by an uptick of one-tenth of a percentage point in the unemployment rate, to 6.9 percent.
Of the 11 components of the Commerce Department's leading index, 4 made positive contributions, paced by a rise in manufacturers' unfilled orders for durable goods. The others were a longer average workweek, higher stock prices and a rise in consumer expectations.
The six negative items were lower contracts and orders for plant and equipment, a decline in building permits, higher initial weekly claims for state unemployment insurance, a lower money supply, a smaller proportion of companies experiencing slower deliveries from suppliers, and lower prices for materials that are especially sensitive to the business cycle.
One component, new factory orders for consumer goods and materials, was lower by a tiny amount, which was rounded to zero.
August's unchanged showing in the index, leaving it at 145.4, followed a 1.2 percent jump in July, the biggest of the six straight increases since January, which have averaged more than eight-tenths of 1 percent each.
 
Declines in 2 Indexes
 The coincident index, meanwhile, edged down one-tenth of 1 percent after showing no change in July. This was in contrast to moderate gains for April, May and June.
An index of indicators that lag behind the economy, like the average duration of unemployment and the prime rate, dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent, the seventh straight decline.
As a result, the ratio of the coincident and lagging indexes, considered a predictor of the economy, rose to 1.1327 from 1.1245.
The Center for International Business Cycle Research at the Columbia Business School reported that its leading index of service-sector activity, an area underrepresented in the Commerce Department's index, rose to 169.8 in August from 167.7. Geoffrey H. Moore, director of the center, called this a "reassuring sign that despite recent stumbles, the service sector is on the road to recovery."
The center said its new leading index of financial services also rose -- to 204.3, from 203.1 in July.

HEADLINE: Successful Stock Sale By Chrysler

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation, seeking to shore up its sagging finances, raised approximately $350 million yesterday with a successful sale of new common stock to a syndicate of investment banks. Demand for the stock was strong enough that Chrysler increased the offering to 35 million new shares from the 33 million originally planned.
The shares were priced after the New York Stock Exchange closed, and were the same as the closing price on Chrysler's outstanding shares, $10.125, up 12.5 cents. 
 In the days before the offering, Wall Street professionals involved in the deal were unusually nervous, owing to the auto industry's difficulties and Chrysler's specific problems, including a decline in market share, a dearth of new models and low credit ratings that have hurt its ability to borrow. Chrysler's stock traded below $10 on Friday and Monday.
The offering was also important to Salomon Brothers, the lead underwriter, providing an opportunity to prove that it still had enough clout to raise a large amount of capital for an important client, thereby easing any doubts raised by the firm's involvement in the Treasury auction scandal. A Wall Street executive involved in the offering said demand was strong from both retail and institutional clients.
Most Wall Street professionals declined to be quoted, referring questions to Salomon, which did not respond to telephone inquiries. The offering followed a dozen recent presentations in Europe and the United States by Chrysler executives to stimulate interest in the stock.
The presentations were open only to money managers, syndicate members and other potential buyers. People who attended said Lee A. Iacocca, chairman; Robert Lutz, president; Robert S. Miller Jr., vice chairman, and others described new Chrysler models that will be introduced in 1992, including the Grand Cherokee four-door utility vehicle, the L/H series of midsized cars and the Viper, a limited-production sports car.
The final stop was on Thursday at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. One person who attended, and insisted on anonymity, said Mr. Iacocca "preached about the problems in the United States economy like it was a Billy Sunday revival." Chrysler also displayed prototypes of future vehicles.
Chrysler's primary concern and reason for offering shares was its credit rating, which has been lowered several times in the past two years so that its debt is now below investment grade, making borrowing expensive. The company said in its prospectus that the additional equity and other moves were taken "to stabilize its credit ratings" and to pay for capital expenditures on new models and plant modernization.
As part of a financial stabilization plan announced last summer, Chrysler will also contribute 27 million new common shares to its pension fund this year.
Without additional equity, Chrysler said further ratings downgrades were likely. Chrysler has been particularly worried about its Chrysler Financial Corporation unit, whose access to borrowings used to finance retail sales and dealer inventories has been constricted.
Chrysler's successful stock offering may be tempered by the memory of its recent stock repurchase plan. That program lasted six years and cost about $1.43 billion to buy 66.2 million shares, for an average price of $21 a share. Chrysler also repurchased common shares from its employee stock ownership plant worth more than $500 million.

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Excerpts From Senate Hearing on Nomination of C.I.A. Chief

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from hearings by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the nomination of Robert M. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, as transcribed by the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private service, including a statement by Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, vice-chairman of the committee, and testimony by Melvin A. Goodman, a former division chief in Soviet affairs at the Central Intelligence Agency; Graham E. Fuller, a senior analyst at the Rand Corporation and a former intelligence officer, and Harold Ford, a C.I.A. contract employee:
 

 
Murkowski Statement
 The allegation that intelligence analysis has been slanted or suppressed, . .goes to the integrity and it goes to the very heart of the intelligence process. The taxpayers have paid many, many millions of dollars to build an exotic collection and communications system and to maintain a massive intelligence bureaucracy. But what is that investment worth if the analysis that actually goes to the policy makers at the end of the day is tainted? 
 But the specific issue before us today is whether Robert Gates, as the senior manager of the C.I.A. in community analysis, was responsible for slanting or suppressing intelligence to please policy makers. I think the record should note that we have heard from three of the most experienced and respected figures in American intelligence -- John McMahon, Admiral Inman and the current D.D.I., Richard Kerr -- testify that they believed Robert Gates did not do so. Mr. Gates himself has given this committee strong assurances that he regards the integrity of intelligence analysis as vital. In my view, therefore, those who assert the contrary have a very heavy burden of proof.

 
 
Testimony by Mr. Goodman
 . . . I want to thank the Committee for the opportunity to discuss these issues in public. For too long, the C.I.A. has hidden behind a veil of secrecy not to protect legitimate assets or legitimate secrets, but to protect its reputation. I feel this has complicated our efforts, the C.I.A.'s efforts, to recruit the best brains in the country, and I also feel that it has created a public perception of the C.I.A.'s disregard for law, morality and public disclosure.
I must say that there has been some confusion with regard to the circumstances of my departure from the C.I.A. and I am going to take a few minutes to develop that.
In 1985 I was told privately by the director of my office, that Bob Gates had ordered my removal from my managerial position in SOVA. I was not the only one to be removed, there were three of us.
Why did I leave the C.I.A.? I left because of politicization. And I must state at the outset that I agree with John McMahon, that the integrity and the objectivity of intelligence is central to the mission of the C.I.A.
Moreover, I strongly believe that any effort to subvert the process of independent analysis, that is, politicization, can lead to the loss of life, as in Vietnam; to national embarrassment, as in the Bay of Pigs; and to national tragedy, as in Iran-contra.
Now, I can understand the country's desire to put Iran-contra in the background. And I can certainly understand the Congress desire to put Iran-contra in the background. But it should never be forgotten that the actions and the policies of very few people in government, including the C.I.A., led to the sale of arms to the same Iranians who held U.S. diplomats hostage for more than a year, and were linked -- and we know this from intelligence sources -- were linked to the murder of more than 200 Marines in Lebanon, the savage bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, and the death of a good friend, Bob Ames.
There were two primary targets for politicization. First, nearly all intelligence issues connected to covert action. That is, the operational commitments that Casey had made regarding Iran, Nicaragua and Afghanistan. All those issues were politicalized. The second area concerned Casey's other major concern, his world view of the Soviet Union. That is, the Soviet Union as the source of all U.S. problems in the international arena. Casey seized on every opportunity to exaggerate the Soviet threat. This included the case for Soviet involvement in the papal plot, international terrorism and Soviet-third world relations, my own area of specialization. All of those issues were politicalized.
Gates's role in this activity was to corrupt the process and the ethics of intelligence on all of these issues. He was Casey's filter in the Directorate of Intelligence. He protected Casey's equity in these issues. And as the memo calling for the bombing of Nicaragua showed, he pandered to Casey's agenda. There were other memos of this type that maybe you have not seen. I remember one calling for the bombing of Libya to, quote, change the map of the region, unquote.
Gates's other contribution was to ignore and suppress signs of the Soviet strategic retreat, including the collapse of the Soviet empire, even the Soviet Union itself. . . .
I'm going to start with my first charge, the use of the Directorate of Operations to slant Directorate of Intelligence analysis. I will be making a very important charge, and I know it's a very serious charge. I believe that the C.I.A. was responsible for providing the N.S.C. and even the President with misleading and false information on a sensitive issue.
As you well know, George Cave, from the Directorate of Operations, joined Robert McFarlane on the trip to Iran in 1986. Upon return, he was allowed or encouraged to do several things.
One, he sent a typescript memo to the White House regarding Iranian politics. This memo was never coordinated in the Directorate of Intelligence. The memo argued for the fact that there was a moderate faction in Iran that wanted to establish contacts with the United States.
Two, he sent Director of Operations reporting along with the P.D.B., that is the President's daily brief, to the President. These reports, in terms of their message, were at variance with the views of the Directorate of Intelligence and the senior analyst on Iran with regard to whether or not there was a moderate faction in Iran.
Three, he was allowed to brief the N.S.C. on the basis of these reports. He was given a special channel to the White House and the N.S.C. Also, I might add that the N.I.O. for Counterterrorism, Charlie Allen, sent a memo to the N.S.C. that said that moderates were eager for improved relations with the United States and that they were in sufficient charge to carry this policy out.
Five, the N.I.O. for Counterterrorism briefed the NSC on Iranian attitudes toward the United States. Again, the analysts of the Directorate of Intelligence were not consulted.
Now all the activity I've cited thus far was not coordinated within the Directorate of Intelligence. It was at variance with the views of the Directorate of Intelligence and with the entire intelligence community, especially with regard to the existence of moderate factions in Iran wanting contacts with the United States.
I believe, this is my opinion, that this was a conscious attempt to provide uncoordinated information to the N.S.C. and even the President in support of operational activities and that this effort had devastating consequences. This activity also violated the ethics of the intelligence community. And it may mean that when President Reagan said he thought he was dealing with a moderate Iranian faction with interest in dealing with the United States, he was acting on the basis of false C.I.A. analysis.
So a question remains. Was the President himself a victim of C.I.A. misinformation or even disinformation?
Now, I want to deal with my third charge: Regarding intelligence on Iran, which I believed involved every instrument of politicization.
Let me introduce this subject by providing some context. From 1981 to 1985, the Directorate of Intelligence -- that is, the analysts in the Office of Soviet Affairs and the analysts in the Near Eastern Office -- developed rather strong analytical positions on several key issues: Iran support for terrorism was significant; Iran's political scene did not include a moderate faction; seeking ties with the United States; that the Soviet position in Iran was in decline; and that Soviet arms sales were declining significantly. I might add that in 1986 there were no Soviet arms deliveries to Iran. The important point about all of this is that all of this analysis was based on very strong evidence.
Now, one thing is certain and can be documented: The C.I.A. changed its analytical position on all of these views during a very important period. We're talking about mid-May 1985, before the delivery of Hawk missiles to Iran.
I think it's also important that the views were changed without a strong evidentiary base, and over the protests of the senior analysts, particularly in SOVA. I find it's also interesting that in 1986, after the disclosure of many of these events associated with Iran-contra, the C.I.A. then reverted to the old line it had consistently established from 1981 to 1985.
Now, Gates has told this committee that he was unaware of dissent . . . In fact, Gates suppressed dissent, and he even strongly pressured one agency, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, not to take a footnote. I think he also strong-armed his own Directorate of Intelligence.
Now, just to sum up this point, I think that this swerve in analysis in the estimate on Iran and the intelligence on terrorism and the view with regard to the moderate faction were all cases of politicization. That is my opinion.
Now I would like to deal with the suppression of intelligence. In some ways I consider this just as important as my previous examples, because it deals with all the things, all the analysis we were never permitted to say. We're talking about the intelligence that policymakers never got, trends that were never reported, data that was suppressed, particularly with regard to Soviet retrenchment and retreat.
This was true also with regard to Soviet problems in Africa, and I'll give you a personal example from 1981. This was before Gates joined Bill Casey's staff. He was still the N.I.O. for the Soviet Union. At that time he commissioned an assessment on Soviet policy in Africa. I didn't believe the assessment was a good one. I had to go to the meetings for coordination because I was the DI representative to the coordination process, and I thought it was only fair to go to the drafter to give him some advance warning that I was going to have some problems at the meeting. I thought the paper had ignored evidence that the Soviets were having their own problems in Africa. The analyst who drafted the paper said, "Your problem isn't with me. I was just, quote, 'a hired gun' on this paper." I said, "Who hired you?" He said, "Bob Gates."
I took my problems to Bob Gates. This was the first encounter I ever had with Bob Gates, someone who I have known since 1968 --
 the first encounter with Gates on integrity and the intelligence process. There was an angry exchange. It is not necessary to go into that. The important point I want to make is that when we got to the coordination meeting, even though some changes were made in the coordination process, at one point in these deliberations Bob Gates says this is the paper that Casey wants, and this is the paper that Casey is going to get.
I want to just point out one other issue. We lost a lot of good senior people in the directorate of Intelligence because of this activity. I think we lost our best people. Some of our best people are working now for other intelligence agencies.
Let me tell you about one anecdote of someone who has stayed behind, who is still there. One day he wrote a piece that apparently attracted a great deal of anger of the management of the Office of Soviet Analysis -- this was recent, this was in the last year. He was called in by his supervisor, and I quote, You know, this isn't a democracy we're running here. Your job is to know the message the office wants and make sure the analysts get it right, unquote.
Frankly, I find this history distasteful. I find my own recollections distasteful. I don't want anyone on this committee to think that I get any satisfaction whatsoever out of bringing any of this to you. I might add that I did not come to the committee; the committee came to me.
Frankly, I worry about the signal that would be sent in returning Gates to the environment he created. I worry about the effect this would have on the standards of others back at the Central Intelligence Agency to be led by someone so lacking in vision, integrity and courage.
 
Testimony by Fuller
 Mr. Chairman, as I read the testimony of others in the past week, I find myself disquieted. Serious charges have been raised against Bob Gates, especially those of Mel Goodman. While I know and respect Mel Goodman as a very knowledgeable and experienced Soviet analyst, in all frankness, I do not readily recognize the Bob Gates described in his testimony. I am indeed disturbed at hearing the specific and worrisome accusations that he levels against Gates. But I find that when he talks on those incidents of which I am personally familiar, his account, in my opinion, contain serious distortions in content and in the manner of telling.
In brief, I do not believe that during my five-year's tenure at the National Intelligence Council I witnessed anything that I would call improprieties in the conduct of estimative work by Bob Gates. I have no direct knowledge of his leadership of the DI, which has figured in so much of the testimony. But I do know that within the confines of the NIC and the National Intelligence Estimates, I have not seen Gates engage in anything that can be loosely called polticization of intelligence.
It is very important to distinguish between sharp differences of opinion and sharp disagreements about the implications of those differences on the one hand and deliberate distortion of facts on the other.
During my entire time at the N.I.C., I felt there was a scrupulous regard and concern for the integrity of the estimative process and a singularly high proportion of time spent in talking about what the integrity of that process implies in concrete terms.
'Taken Flack for Casey'
To be specific, at no time was I ever told what either the administration or Gates or Casey wanted to come out of an estimate or what it should say or what conclusions it should reach. Not only was I never told what to say, but I would have regarded it as outrageously improper to even hear the suggestion and I would have rejected it forthright.
I have taken flack for Casey for what we ended saying on occasion. He did not always like the product that I delivered to him. But I have never been told what to say, even indirectly. There was never a hint that there was an unspoken line somehow to follow and that I was to respond to.
Mr. Chairman, I may have many failings and I have indeed made errors in calling the political shots correctly on a number of issues over my many years in this very risky business of prediction. But nobody who knows me would ever call me a toady or patsy to upper management.
Casey had a broad sense of global politics and the interrelationships of things. He could usually think of 10 more implications of any international event than the average analyst could. He read widely, and his N.I.O.'s had to run to keep up with his restless mind and flow of various hypotheses. He was an unabashed cold warrior and tended to view all events in terms of their impact on the struggle with the Soviet Union apart from other regional implications.
Mr. Goodman, I think, has suggested what I think is a slight parody of Casey's views on these things.
Now Bob Gates may be a skillful staffer who has served a number of differing bosses well. But he, too, is not a faceless bureaucrat. He is immensely intelligent, has a superb grasp of substance. He is a quick study, and he fully understands the relationship between policy and intelligence. He was indeed able to keep pace with Casey's own geopolitical instincts, but he was also able to tone down some of Casey's more far-fetched hypotheses, in discussions which were held in which I have been personally present.
Where Casey did not always hide what he hoped intelligence might indicate, Gates was always fully aware of the requirements of analytic procedure and the validity of independent analysis from everything I saw within the NIC. I cannot speak to charges leveled about Gates' handling of research within the D.I. . . . .
Gates did share a hardline view, but a very well-informed view of the Soviet Union, independent of Casey. The international situation at that time, I would argue, perhaps justified a fairly hard line view in any case. The world was very different in 1980 to 1985, prior to Gorbachev, than it has been in these stunning years that we have witnessed following the Gorbachev tenure.
I felt [there] was the development of an adversary culture within CIA -- within at least the Third World branch of SOVA, given Mr. Casey's own strong views, Bob Gates' partial adherence to some of those views, and the very strongly felt discontent within the SOVA-Third World group that saw things quite differently . . . .
My own sense of [the Soviet-third world group] was not that they were wrong in their understanding of what the Soviets' stated positions were and what Soviet writings and analysis were in these things, but that sometimes they reflected less of an understanding of the countries whose Soviet relationships they were examining. As someone who had served overseas for many years, I had a slightly different sense of reality about the Soviets on the ground...
It was not part of the SOVA culture to believe that, quote, That was the way the Soviets would do business, unquote. No SOVA analysts would have been likely to tell you, until the troops were lined up and ready to go, that the U.S.S.R. would ever send the Red Army into Afghanistan, because the Soviet Union had no history and no background of doing that.
When Mr. Goodman suggests, for example, that in the year that we were doing the analysis on Iran that the Soviets were losing a position in Iran and were systematically finding their position weakened, I would only like to point out that the same was true in Afghanistan in the year that preceded the Soviet coup there.
 
. . .

 Now I do not want to oversimplify what were complex views of both sides of these debates. But I for one independently grew unhappy with the product that I received from many SOVA Third World analysts. There was a liberal versus conservative struggle, and this was not a healthy situation within the Agency to have exist.
Iran was ultimately the key power in the Gulf and already a major ideological threat to the region and to Western interests there through its zealous Islamic fundamentalism.
But American policies towards Iran in that period were based solely on two factors and had only two goals: one was to strike back at Iranian terrorism and the other was to staunch all flow of any weapons from the West to Iran. Now these goals were certainly understandable. . . .These two factors hardly constituted a serious policy designed to get the United States back into some position in Iran. We were engaged in a basic struggle with Moscow for influence in Iran, the most important country on the entire southern Soviet border.
I was likewise concerned with our excessive tilt towards Saddam Hussein, who -- and I am on record on this -- I felt had never moderated during the Gulf War. Now DIA analysts -- excuse me, DI analysts within the Agency's analytic section had already produced analyses earlier that year indicating concern for instability, future instability in Iran, with which I agreed. Any careful look at the situation raised potentially alarming prospects. The clerical regime was perhaps foundering. Khomeini was aging and losing grip daily on the situation, opening the way potentially to radical leftist forces within the country.
I was concerned that a very serious geopolitical imbalance could be emerging in Iran of major import to U.S. policies. If Western arms -- if the Western arms embargo was a total success, it was logical that Moscow would be the most natural next source of arms and could quickly come to gain a monopoly over arms to Iran if it wished. A direct arms relationship with Moscow would have provided a major strategic advance for Moscow in Iran . . . . A weakening clerical regime could certainly strike a bargain with the devil to survive. I believe that Moscow would not turn down that opportunity if it were presented, especially as the clerical regime seemed to move towards possible collapse in that year, as was feared by the CIA's own estimative Middle East people.
A pro-Soviet group conceivably could have come to power in Iran under such circumstances, a far worse disaster for the West than Afghanistan had been so far. I had communicated my concerns to Casey on this quite unsolicited at about this time.
When the SOVA analyst brought me his draft portion of the estimate, Mr. Chairman, on Soviet policy towards Iran, I was immediately unhappy. It dismissed the possibility that the USSR would even seek to take advantage of the desperate arms need in Iran and it comfortably dismissed any serious Soviet design or intention to gain dominant influence in Iran in the foreseeable future. Such a view ignored several hundred years of Russian expansionism inexorably southward . . . .
It ignored a Soviet effort to ditch Iraq in favor of Iran as soon as Khomeini had come to power. . . . Even if the possibility were only slight, the impact of such a logical move by Moscow to support left wing forces in Iran, to exploit chaos, or to become a sole arms source to Iran would have been a major political coup for Moscow and a major loss for the U.S.
I felt that a formal warning of this eventuality -- potential eventuality was of critical importance to US interests. And estiamtes are partly designed to play a warning function as well.
I do believe that it can only be through the relentless examination of various new hypotheses and counterhypotheses that the intelligence community will ever have a chance to get at the elusive truths of forecasting the unknowable.
Because of this legitimate disagreement, SOVA analysts -- some of them -- have chosen to cast this issue in terms of right and wrong, truth versus politicization. Their own internal frustrations seem to have caused them to reject out of hand this line of analysis that was not stated as a certitude on my part but only as a distinct and serious strategic possibility that the U.S. Government must be watchful for.
The argument instead has been presented now as to being -- serving either Casey or serving Gates or serving the White House. I have not even been given the courtesy of simply being called "wrong," but rather portrayed as someone else's instrument in the struggle against SOVA. Whether the application of the word "wrong" is appropriate in any case is questionable when one speaks of the warning function in intelligence. . . .
'Plenty of Fires'
No, in the end the barn did not burn down, but there were plenty of fires raging in the region and people were playing with matches in the barn. Even the possibility of this major calamity for American interests seems not to have been acknowledged by SOVA analysts.
Mr. Chairman, the N.I.O. and I and Gates were also accused of politicization in an estimate we did on Soviet-Israeli relations in a year or so later. In that estimate, both myself and the Soviet N.I.O., impressed with the new vigor of Gorbachev in foreign affairs in the early days, reconsidered the old issue of Soviet-Israeli relations, and we felt, in fact, by now there were very good reasons why it would now be in the Soviet advantage to establish diplomatic relations with Israel within, as the estimate said, within possibly the next 18 months.
. . . There were no policy needs, Mr. chairman, as far as I can see. To say that the Soviets might do this I could see as playing one agenda; to say that they wouldn't do it might play to another policy agenda.
Our revisionist review, myself and the Soviet N.I.O., of this time-honored SOVA position -- that we chose to review this time-honored position was viewed with scorn by SOVA, and our estimate was acknowledged -- even though our estimate openly acknowledged a difference of opinion and explicitly stated so.
SOVA analysts now triumphantly point out that they were right; that diplomatic relations were not, in fact, restored within 18 months between the Soviet Union and Israel. But if formal relations were not restored, Mr. Chairman, in fact a whole revolution came out about in Soviet relations with the whole region, and informal ties, informal ties with Israel blossomed extraordinarily. It was a true time of revolution.
This indeed -- and this is a very important point, Mr. chairman, this is one of the dilemmas of intelligence work. It is not a good versus evil. It is a dilemma of intelligence work. Does absence of evidence mean that something is not there or it has not happened? How much should we rely on intuition, judgment and experience in appraising the likelihood of events or motives or the issue of who benefits from an event?
This dilemma can never be solved. SOVA seems to have clung to the idea that the sweeping force of, quote, no evidence, means that we don't think it happened, which is the safe and perhaps appropriate position for a junior analyst. But is a more experienced analyst or manager wrong to examine other considerations even in the absence of evidence that we may never collect?
Mr. Chairman, this is the real world of intelligence analysis that I knew and experienced. That is the Casey and the Bob Gates that I know. I am acutely aware that we have many analysts, including serious respected and knowledgeable senior analysts and junior analysts, who somehow feel pain at the way the process worked when they were there.
But in the trenches of analysis and policy over the years mistakes do get made. We have all made them. God knows I have made mistakes in my own judgments, and I will probably go on to make more in the future. Yet I have not personally experienced anything that I would call true politicalization of estimates in my personal experience, even by Casey . . . . Nor do I think that politicalization accurately or fairly describes the Gates that I worked with for five years, whatever failings, harshness, insensitivies, or analytical misjudgments he, too, may be guilty of in this period.
 
Testimony by Mr. Ford
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have some very difficult things to say today, but I feel I must say them.
In brief, my message is that I think Robert Gates should not be confirmed as Director of Central Intelligence. This is a difficult task for me, in part because though semiretired, I am still an employee of the C.I.A. on part-time contract. This is also a very painful task for me. It is painful to be negative about someone who has been my colleague, a relationship that was cooperative throughout, and where there was no bad blood whatsoever between us. Moreover, as my supervisor, Bob Gates was good to me and awareded me increased responsibilities. Furthermore, he is extremely able and has clearly had unique experience in both the production of intelligence and its use by the country's to decisionmakers. It is also painful to have to differ with my good friend, Graham Fuller. I see things differently, I see Bob Gates diferently, as I will spell out.
Discerning what is a skewing of intelligence and what is not is a tricky business, but from my four decades of experience in and around intelligence, I think I can help the committee thread its way through the differing kinds of pressure which Bob Gates did or did not bring on intelligence analysis. It is my view that many of his pressures were justified as he sought to sharpen analysis and its usefulness to decision-makers. Secondly, that some of the pressures he brought on analysis simply reflected differing professional judgments, and that some of the allegations that he skewed intelligence doubtless have arisen from an analyst whose pride was damaged by his revisions. Thirdly, however, as I am prepared to discuss at greater length, it is my view based on documents that have been released in the last few days, on testimonies that have been given to this committee of late, and on the confidence of many C.I.A. officers whose abilities and character I respect, that other of Bob Gates pressures have gone beyond professional bounds and clearly constitute a skewing of intelligence. Not in the fields of military and strategic issues, but chiefly concerning Soviet political matters, Soviet's and the third world.
With respect to the latter, I would interject, events have proved that the Soviets have for some years been definitely lessening their commitments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; thus validating the earlier judgments that SOVA made, not those that Bob Gates and his supporters did.
I would also add that the skewing of intelligence and the purging of dissident D.D.I. analysts, as we've already heard today, goes considerably beyond the four particular issues this committee happens to be focusing upon. It isn't wholly across the board, but there are many more than just four issues.
In my view, that 1985 estimate on Iran was not an estimate in the usual sense. A national intelligence estimate presents the data -- all the data on all sides -- and then draws what seem to be the most likely patterns and the most likely future. If an N.I.E. or S.N.I.E. goes on to talk about, "Well, it's possible that the Soviets might do this, the worst case that they might do this," it clearly says so. This 1985 estimate was a worst-case paper, clearly, but it did not clue the reader that it was, and therefore the readers could misjudge it, thinking this is the way things were going to be -- not this is the way things might be if the Soviets did their damnedest.
More important, that 1985 estimate skewed -- had significant policy consequences. As the Congress's Iran-contra report and the Tower Report both indicate, that estimate directly fed White House interest and enthusiasm with respect to reversing the then-boycott of U.S. arms to Iran. Again, as Doug MacEachin said in his memo to Dick Kerr of January 1987, later national intelligence estimates backed off from the 1985 estimate's stress on the Soviet threat to Iran.
I differ with Graham. I think no one can read these without drawing that same conclusion. They softened that view. Why? Because it became more clear that the level of Soviet military support to Iran had been dropping precipitiously for some years.
As for the pressures Bob Gates wrought within C.I.A. overall, it is clear that he leaned much more heavily on intelligence analysts in the Directorate of Intelligence than he did with the N.I.C. This is probably because it is harder, much harder, as Graham has said, to skew a broad national intelligenc estimate than it is the narrower questions more often addressed by and in the D.D.I. Secondly, it was probably more difficult because the D.D.I.'s analysts are mostly younger, more junior officers than the N.I.C.'s tough veterans.
Now, the key question before us, why do I take the painful step of urging that Bob Gates not be confirmed?
Several reasons. First, my views on the nomination have become markedly more critical since the confirmation hearingfs began . . . .
Secondly, I have become more critical because of certain testimonies of Bob Gates himself. His earlier testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which I mentioned a moment ago, and his many instances of forgetfulness in his responses to this committee. I am sorry to say it, but the word that for me captures this latter testimony of his is clever. The forgetfulness of this brilliant officer gifted with a photographic memory, does not to me instill confidence.
Thirdly, to develop the finest U.S. intelliegence possible, as D.C.I., Gates would have to attract and recruit the best brains in the country. I fear that he would have some difficulty doing so because many would shy away from serving a D.C.I. about whom some serious questions have been raised.
Fourthly, there should also be reservations about Bob Gates's analytical style and judgment. Over the years the best analytical results in U.S. intelligence have occurred when the D.C.I. attracted the very best analytical talent he could find, then listen to their judgments, ground in his own and then presented their collective views to the senior policymakers.
My view that Bob Gates has ignored or scorned the views of others whose assessments did not accord with his own would be okay if he were uniquely all seeing. The trouble is he has not been. Most importantly, he has been dead wrong on the central analytic target of the past few years -- the outlook for change, or not, in the fortunes of the U.S.S.R. and the Soviet-European block. He was wrong in presenting the Soviet threat to Iran in 1985 as a true N.I.E., and then telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee two years later that those things still applied. I think Bob Gates was overly certain earlier that the Soviets ran or were in charge of international terrorism. He certainly was overly certain that the sky would fall if we didn't bomb Nicaragua, to say nothing of the wisdom of such a recommended course of action.
The U.S.A. deserves a D.C.I. whose analytic batting average is better than that, especially if that D.C.I. tends to force his views on C.I.A. and the intelligence community, and especially at a time when U.S. intelligence and US policy face a far more complex world than the one we have known.
I do agree with Admiral Inman's testimony that there will not necessarily be dancing in the streets in C.I.A. if Bob Gates becomes the D.C.I. I do feel, however, that Admiral Inman may have left a mistaken impression with this committee that the reason C.I.A. senior officers might not wholly welcome a D.C.I. Gates is because they are simply set in their ways and don't want to have to change.

HEADLINE: With Deficits Looming, Syracuse University Considers Major Cuts

BYLINE: By SAMUEL WEISS

 BODY:
In a dramatic proposal to cope with looming budget deficits, officials of Syracuse University have presented the broad outline of plans to cut the school's faculty and staff up to 20 percent by 1995, eliminating some programs and consolidating others.
The reorganization, whose specifics will not be announced by the university's chancellor until the end of January, comes in response to forecasts of a drop in enrollment and budget deficits over the next few years. 
 This academic year, as well as last, the university froze salaries and cut administrative costs to make up a $9.5 million budget gap resulting from a decline of about 700 undergraduates from last year and cuts in state aid. The university projects a further enrollment decline of 1,000 to 1,800 undergraduates by 1995 and a cumulative budget deficit of about $28 million.
 
No Threat of Closing
 Syracuse now has about 16,500 students, about 4,000 faculty and staff members and a budget of $450 million.
Despite the anticipated cutbacks, university officials said the situation did not represent a crisis. "Nobody is talking about closing the doors of Syracuse University," Robert Hill, the university's vice president for public relations, said yesterday. "What we're talking about is repositioning ourselves before we get to a situation we can't manage."
While the fiscal problems of New York State's two large public university systems have received widespread attention in recent years, the state's large network of private colleges have also been experiencing problems as a result of the recession in the Northeast, escalating costs, enrollment declines and, this fall, a major reduction in state aid.
Although Syracuse may represent the most dramatic example, New York's other major research institutions, including Cornell, Columbia, the University of Rochester and New York University, are all experiencing varying degrees of budget difficulties, according to Mark Lawton, president of the Commission of Independent Colleges and Universities.
However, some educators familiar with the situation at Syracuse suggested yesterday that current fiscal climate may have affected the university harder than other institutions because it expanded too much during the 1970's and 1980's and that it is now seeking to rein itself in.
The scope of the restructuring plan for Syracuse was outlined to the University Senate on Sept. 11 by the university's new chancellor, Kenneth A. Shaw, who said that the university faced "a fiscal challenge of major proportions."
On Sept. 16, the university released a report by an advisory group to the Chancellor, made up of faculty members and administrators, which analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the university's 14 schools and colleges and offered suggestions for possible consolidations and elimination of academic programs.
 
Range of Alternatives
 The group's suggestions included consolidation of the university's School of Architecture with its College of Visual and Performing Arts, the consolidation of the School of Information Studies with the School of Management and a combining of the College of Nursing, the School of Social Work and the School of Education.
On Monday, the group followed up with recommendations concerning academic support services and academic auxiliaries. The group's suggestions included making the university's athletic department more self-supporting, selling two buildings in downtown Syracuse and modest budget cuts for libraries.
Mr. Hill, the university spokesman, said yesterday that another report on reducing administrative costs would be issued next month by a team of consultants. The proposals in these reports, he said, would be turned into a comprehensive plan for the university's vice chancellor for academic affairs and then acted upon by Chancellor Shaw by Jan. 30.

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Excerpts From C.I.A. Documents Released in Gates Hearings

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The Senate Intelligence Committee today gave outsiders a rare glimpse into the way the Central Intelligence Agency molds the secrets it gathers into the white papers, known as intelligence estimates, that the White House uses to help shape foreign policy. A sheaf of declassified documents released as part of committee hearings on Robert M. Gates's nomination to become Director of Central Intelligence reflects the debate between Mr. Gates and his staff of analysts over some of the most heated intelligence issues of the 1980's.
Following are excerpts of some of those documents, reflecting internal disagreements over Soviet involvement in the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II, Soviet influence in Iran and elsewhere in the third world and the effect of United States economic sanctions against Libya.
The excerpts reflect debates about the quality of written intelligence analyses that were produced by experts at the C.I.A. or the National Intelligence Council. The council is a senior body of analysts that represents the consensus view of all United States intelligence agencies on world events. From 1982 to 1986, Mr. Gates was both the C.I.A.'s Deputy Director for Intelligence -- the head of its analysis shop -- and chairman of the National Intelligence Council.
Still classified -- and therefore not published here -- are the actual estimates that sparked the debates. The exception is the situation in Iran in the early and mid-1980's, a subject on which many analyses by the C.I.A. and the intelligence council have been made public. Several others were released today. Excerpts from one are printed below.
 
Soviet Role in Third World
 Melvin A. Goodman, a deputy division chief in the C.I.A.'s Soviet analytical division, wrote a draft National Intelligence Estimate in early 1982 concluding that Soviet influence in the third world may be reaching its limit. Mr. Gates, then head of the C.I.A.'s intelligence analysis shop, responded with a memorandum on Feb. 14, 1982, sharply criticizing the report.
Per your request, I have read the attached draft and, unhappily, find it to be rather dry and lacking any sense of the dynamics of Soviet involvement in the third world . . .
*. . . one has only a snapshot of Soviet involvement in the third world that tends too much to reflect on present opportunities and power balances and less on the ideological and political motives that have impelled the Soviet Union to an activist role in the third world now for more than 60 years. . . .
This section would then draw the distinction between the policies that the Soviets pursued until the mid-1970's and then the different kind of involvement that the Soviets have sponsored since that time, including a modernization of the Cuban armed forces to encourage Cuba's greater role abroad. . . .
In sum, this estimate misses the whole historical significance of Soviet involvement in the third world and the ways in which their tactics and approach have changed in the postwar period. The reader cannot understand Soviet activities in the third world without some understanding of these changes. The importance of the changes is reflected by the fact that the Soviets have allowed their relationship with the United States to founder in many respects over the last eight years over the question of their involvement in the third world. . . .
*On page 10 the estimate draft contends that Moscow believes that the U.S. is now more willing to counter Soviet activities in the third world than during the immediate post-Vietnam years. I think it is not possible yet to draw that conclusion and I think the Soviets themselves have not drawn that conclusion. So far, except in El Salvador, the Soviets principally have seen American rhetoric since 1975 and very little action. . . . The only place they know we are involved to any degree at all is in Afghanistan. . . .
*On page 24, the draft indicates that Soviets will have more difficulty in gaining new clients than after first becoming active in the third world in the 1950's. Again, this does not reflect the change in Soviet tactics. It is much easier for the Soviets to let the Cubans or the Libyans or others develop such clients and to support them indirectly than it is to do so directly. Examples include Grenada and potentially Suriname. . . .
*The estimate seems to conclude that fewer opportunities will present themselves to the Soviets in the 1980's than before for a variety of reasons and that the opportunities the Soviets have exploited will begin to present them with increased problems. I think this overlooks the creativity of the Soviet approach . . . I see a lot more trouble for us in the third world in the years ahead because it's easier to make trouble than it is to solve it.
 
Libya Analysis Assailed
 On July 12, 1983, Mr. Gates sent a memo to the director of the C.I.A.'s Near East and South Asia analysis division, criticizing a report that concluded United States economic sanctions against Libya were ineffective.
1. This seems to me too narrow a cut at this subject and presumes an important lack of sophistication . . . it is fairly well documented that few, if any, expected the sanctions to have a significant economic impact . . .
2. It seems to me that they went ahead as a political gesture to dramatize Qaddafi's behavior, [Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's leader] rivet attention on his activities, and try to ostracize him. . . .
3. I have three additional problems with the paper:
*Most importantly, the paper conveys (unintentionally or not) a strong bias on the part of the author against economic sanctions. The analysis simply does not sound objective.
*Second, I believe the paper is too generalized for those interested in the topic.
*Finally, the paper has the underlying but unproven assumption that Libya has been pushed further into the Soviet camp by our sanctions. No attempt is made to prove this . . . These references add to an aura of slanted analysis.
4. In sum, the paper reads like the author had reached his conclusions at the beginning and then researched and wrote the paper to substantiate the conclusions.
 
Analysts' Response
 On July 21, 1983, the analysts defended the report.
We disagree that few, if any, policymakers expected the sanctions to have a significant economic impact or to cause Qaddafi to change his stripes. . . . This is evidenced by:
*A 17 December memo from [censored] to the D.C.I. [William J. Casey, then Director of Central Intelligence] . . . This memo states: "To sum up, the Intelligence Community unanimously feels the proposed sanctions would be counterproductive. If they are applied, their symbolic nature must be clearly understood. I do not believe the policy level task force personnel [the Reagan Administration policymakers who decided to impose sanctions] are seized with this fact."
*A draft of the discussion paper from a 4 February N.S.C. [National Security Council] meeting which states "Economic sanctions . . . as well as other economic and military measures are intended not only to signal Qaddhafi about our displeasure, but to pressure him as well to cease his policies of international terrorism and aggression." *A 1 September 1982 meeting of the Libyan Working Group called by [censored] to "review the effects of our economic measures." If the sanctions were only a symbolic gesture, why hold this meeting?
We agree that the author and reviewers of the paper pretty well knew the conclusions the paper would reach before it was written and in fact do have a bias against economic sanctions as applied against Libya. We fail to see any problem with this, however, since this simply reflects the experience, knowledge, and judgment of the individuals involved.

 
Attempted Assassination of Pope
 In early 1985, Director Casey ordered Mr. Gates to review intelligence on the shooting of Pope John Paul II four years earlier, with the stated aim of making the strongest argument that the Soviet Union had masterminded the assassination attempt. A review of the evidence in 1983 had concluded that the Soviets were not involved in the shooting by Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman.
Mr. Gates assigned three analysts to prepare the case, entitled "Agca's Attempt to Kill the Pope: The Case for Soviet Involvement." The report was not among the documents made public today.
Some five months later, an internal C.I.A. review panel produced a report that found "serious shortcomings" in both the 1983 and 1985 analyses, as well as other C.I.A. reports on the assassination attempt. 
 
Key Findings
 *Our review of the product record on the Papal assassination attempt reveals some serious shortcomings . . .
*Alternative explanations were not adequately examined . . .
*The widespread perception that upper management had strong and in some cases conflicting views on the issue had a pervasive effect on the analytic and production process.
*Senior management may want to take some steps to dispel the perception in some quarters that the issue has become politicized . . .
I. Nature of the Case and the Analytic Environment
The environment with C.I.A. -- particularly the reorganization of the D.I. in late 1981, the mindsets prevailing in various offices, and the "hot potato climate" associated with the [Papal shooting] case -- also influenced the amount and quality of D.I. production. [Mr. Gates and other senior officials had overhauled the C.I.A.'s analysis division. They also created new offices, covering such subjects as terrorism, that crossed both geographic and topical lines, sparking turf fights among analysts.]
Responsibility for the case initially went to the Terrorism Branch. . . . .
As time went on and the Italian judicial investigation increasingly pointed to Bulgarian involvement, the case became the responsibility of one analyst in O.G.I. This analyst was eventually designated by the D.D.I. [Deputy Director for Intelligence] as the key person responsible for the case within the D.I. . . . As a result, incentives for interoffice cooperation began to evaporate.
Even more important appears to be the view expressed by some analysts interviewed that most SOVA [Office of Soviet Analysis] analysts and managers preferred, at least in the early years, not to consider the "seamy" side of Soviet policy -- wet operations [assassinations] and the like. . . .
Perhaps the most important factor contributing to this climate was the perception by analysts and managers that the seventh floor [the C.I.A.'s executive offices] had strong views on the case. Most thought that the D.C.I. [Mr. Casey] had a strong gut feeling that the Soviets were involved; most also were convinced that the D.D.C.I. [then John McMahon] for a long time was persuaded that the tradecraft exhibited did not bear the marks of a Soviet operation.
II. Setting the Stage: Moscow and the Polish Pope
By early 1981 . . . several D.I. products warned that Moscow might be growing "disillusioned with the utility of its connection" because it had not led to greater calm in Poland and since the Soviets were unhappy with Walesa's [Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader] highly publicized meetings with the Pope. In retrospect, we would have expected that this latter reporting would have set the stage for analysts at least to consider Soviet motives for getting rid of the Pope. In fact, they continued to see the Pope as a moderating force . . .
III. The Production Record
Looking first at the internal agency documents and responses to specific external questions (30 documents covering September 1982 to June 1985), several patterns emerge:
*As in the current and serial publications, the tendency is to cast doubt on Bulgarian complicity.
*The major recurrent reasons for this position are the agency's inability to obtain specific evidence of a Bulgarian/Soviet link, [and] the supposedly "sloppy" tradecraft in the operation.
*The nearly complete absence of consideration of alternative scenarios to explain the Papal shooting.
Noteworthy by its uniqueness in mentioning alternative scenarios is a memo on 17 September 1982 from the D.D.I. to the D.C.I. titled Status of the Investigation of the Attempted Assassination of Pope John Paul II. After discussing in considerable detail what the agency knew about the case, the memo concluded that "hard information . . . supports several scenarios not all of which are mutually exclusive:
*That Agca's plans . . . were known beforehand, perhaps to one or more of several parties including the Bulgarian service and rightist Turkish terrorists.
*That Agca attempted to assassinate the Pope without sponsorship and for his own reasons . . .
*That Agca was a hired assassin."
But the memo then went on to judge that if Agca was a hired assassin, Turkish terrorists were probably his paymasters, because the Soviets would have regarded him as having "too high" a profile and being "too risky an instrument."
Despite the unidimensional thrust of much of the ad hoc production, the D.I., in our judgment, took a balanced, objective -- and agnostic -- view of the case in the three instances in which it addressed a wide or important external audience.
Of the three formal Intelligence Assessments [I.A.s] the D.I. has produced since the assassination attempt, two address the question of bloc complicity. These are "The Papal Assassination Attempt: A Review of the Record" (May 1983) and "Agca's Attempt to Kill the Pope: The Case for Soviet Involvement" (April 1985). Both papers are impressive efforts to bring some order out of the fragmentary and often contradictory data on the case. Judging from our own review of the two papers and from our interviews with key participants, however, both assessments were troubled by problems in coordination and sourcing.
The 1985 I.A., a joint effort by O.G.I. and SOVA, is the agency's most comprehensive look at the case to date. By any standard, it is an impressive compilation of the facts and marshalling of the evidence and reasoning for Soviet involvement. . . .
The I.A. breaks new ground by taking the agency's first comprehensive look at the possibility of Soviet complicity. But many of the people we interviewed thought the paper had an unusual thrust for an intelligence assessment. They thought that calling the paper "The Case for Soviet Involvement" and marshalling evidence only for the side "stacked the deck" in favor of that argument and ran the risk of appearing biased. This impression was further reinforced, they thought, by the "unbalanced" treatment of counterarguments in the text.
Many participants in the process thought that without the qualifiers, particularly on source reliability, the Key Judgments give readers the impression that the agency is saying -- more definitively than the paper intends or the evidence warrants -- the Soviets were responsible. At the very least, the sourcing in the Key Judgments is inconsistent with the D.D.I. guidance in 1982 to "focus on the weakest element in the collection chain in terms of reliability" when referring to D.O. [Directorate of Operations] sources in D.I. publications.
The sourcing issue was at the heart of complaints about coordination from officers in D.O./S.E. [the C.I.A. division that runs clandestine operations in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe] and D.O./EUR [the Agency's European operaitons division]. S.E. officers said their reservations about the sourcing chain on the original raw reports were serious enough that they might not have disseminated the reports had it not been for the high interest in the subject. In their view, the paper was deliberately skewed to make the case for Soviet complicity look more solid that it is; they thought the author(s) had been "manipulated."
The concerns about "balance" and about readers misinterpreting the paper might have been eased by the inclusion of a Scope Note saying that the paper deliberately does not try to make the counterargument against Soviet complicity. Absent such a Scope Note, this paper, like its 1983 counterpart, would have been strengthened and made more balanced by consideration of alternative scenarios.
But we would not exclude the possibility that the agency might not, in the final analysis, be able to choose any single theory as the most plausible; in this case, we would serve our readers well by emphasizing the complexity of the case, the contradictory nature of the evidence, and the difficulty of arriving at any firm conclusion. As the D.I. record stands now, our readers are left to gues what the Agency poistion is on this issue, or, indeed, whether we have a position. The definitive piece is yet to be written.
IV. Problems in the Analytic Process
. . . Another external influence was the "perception in the trenches that there was a mindset at the highest levels" in the U.S. Government and the agency that the Soviets were behind the attempt on the Pope's life. In one manager's opinion, the effect of this perception on analysts was either to intimidate them or (in our view, more often) to push them into a defensive posture. . . .
In the early phases of the case, however, there appears to have been a conscious effort on the part of upper management -- the D.D.I., at least -- to keep hands off the D.I. product in order to avoid the appearance of manipulating the analytic process. . . .
Largely because of the sensitivity of the issue, however, we found that most ad hoc production was initiated from on-high or in response to outside request rather than from below. So, despite the D.D.I.'s best efforts, there was a perception among analysts of upper-level direction, which became more pronounced after the new evidence of Soviet complicity was acquired. In the event, however, our interviews suggested that it was not so much D.C.I. or D.D.I. direction as it was an effort on the part of some D.I. managers at the next one or two layers down to be responsive to perceived D.C.I. and D.D.I. desires.
V. Conclusions
*Throughout the case, greater emphasis should have been placed on analysis of alternative scenarios . . .
*Finally, senior management could have provided clearer and more explicit guidance -- to all of the relevant players -- on how it viewed this problem . . . The last point may hold the key to where the agency goes from here in dealing with the case. . . . As things stand now, there is a deeply rooted perception at the working level that senior management:
*Regards this as a politically sensitive case that requires special handling.
*Leans toward the view that the Soviets were involved.
*Takes a special interest in the content and timing of what is published on this issue.
*Has "anointed" one office, and indeed one analyst, with principal responsibility for the problem and has therefore discouraged others from taking initiative on the issue.
 
Changing U.S. Policy on Iran
 On May 17, 1985, the chief Middle East analyst for the National Intelligence Council, Graham E. Fuller, sent Mr. Casey and Mr. McMahon one in a series of memoranda arguing that the United States and the Soviet Union were reaching a crossroads in their competition for influence in Iran. Critics say that this and other C.I.A. and intelligence council analyses helped create the view of Iran within the Reagan Administration that led to the arms-for-hostages scandal. In Senate hearings today, they contended that Mr. Gates suppressed dissenting views of other C.I.A. analysts.
1. The U.S. faces a grim situation in developing a new policy toward Iran. Events are moving largely against our interests and we have few palatable alternatives. In bluntest form, the Khomeini regime is faltering and may be moving toward a moment of truth; we will soon see a struggle for succession. The U.S. has almost no cards to play; the U.S.S.R. has many. . . .
2. The Twin Pillars of U.S. Policy. U.S. policy at present comes down to two major pillars.
*We will respond with force directly if Iran should undertake another terrorist outrage against the U.S.
*We seek to choke off all arms supplies to Teheran wherever possible.
3. Terrorist Attack: We can and must have some policy against terrorism. We must also recognize that this cannot represent the bulk of our policy toward Iran. Furthermore, radical forces in Teheran may welcome a direct confrontation with the U.S. -- including U.S. military retaliation -- in the hopes of replaying its extraordinarily successful gambit against the U.S. in the 1979 hostage crisis.
 
.. .

5. These two pillars of U.S. policy -- both sensible while Iran was in a vacuum and Khomeini was strong -- can no longer serve as the primary vehicle for U.S. policy toward Iran. Both are entirely negative in nature and may now serve to facilitate Soviet interests more than our own.
6. Some Broader Policy Considerations. Nobody has any brilliant ideas about how to get us back into Teheran. Nearly all tentative proposals require uncomfortable choices and clear-cut downsides. Nonetheless, we need to review a broad spectrum of ideas. I submit below a range of thoughts, carrots and sticks -- all of which are flawed -- but which might assist in sparking better and more refined positions to meet our needs.
a. Work with Iraq to bring Teheran to its knees. We could consider moving much closer to Iraq to bring the war to a quicker end -- particularly by way of encouraging crippling attacks on Kharg Island and key Iranian economic facilities. . . . Disadvantage: We have no knowledge about who would emerge victorious from such shambles; it could well be radical elements filled with hatred of the U.S.
b. Open up Iran to friendly state influence. We could tell all our European allies, as well as Israel, Turkey, Pakistan, China, Japan, Brazil and Argentina that Western influence must develop a paramount position during this critical period in Iran. We would remove all restrictions in sales -- including military -- to Iran. . . . Disadvantage: Possible encouragement for Iranian perpetuation of the war.
c. Go after Iran's radical allies. While direct U.S. assault against Iran could bring about the very thing we wish to avoid, i.e. Soviet domination of Iran, direct attack on Iran's radical allies, Syrian and Libya, would probably sober Iran and weaken its support from those quarters. . . . This "indirect strategy" would demonstrate U.S. resolve against radicalism without directly pushing Iran in the wrong direction. Unlike Iran, we have nothing to lose in Libya and everything to gain.
d. Battening down the hatches in Turkey and Pakistan. Assuming that we may be heading for a major Soviet gain in Iran, we may need to greatly step up our ties with Turkey and Pakistan. . . .
e. Getting the Message Through to Teheran.. . . There is room for such broad, public statement on a regular basis to ensure Iranian moderates -- and opportunists -- that we are not dedicated to the overthrow of the Islamic Republic or the collapse of Iran. . . .
f. Massive reassurance to Iran of U.S. intentions. . . .
g. Bargaining with the U.S.S.R. We have little leverage here.
7. On reflection I believe that the option most constructively oriented is that of inserting Western allies and friends into Teheran quickly through the arms door.
8. Our tilt to Iraq was timely when Iraq was against the ropes and the Islamic revolution was on a roll. The time may now have come to tilt back -- at least via our allies -- to ensure the Soviets lose both attraction and potential access to the clergy.
 
Chance of Soviet Invervention
 After the arms-for-hostages affair became public in late 1986, the C.I.A.'s chief Soviet analyst, Douglas J. MacEachin, reviewed the agency's own studies of Soviet influence in Iran and sent his conclusions to Mr. Gates.
1. . . . Attached is a package containing Key Judgments and summaries of various SOVA [Office of Soviet Analysis], joint NESA-SOVA and NIC or [National Intelligence Council] products since 1980 dealing with Soviet-Iranian issues. 2. The record shows that except for a "swerve" in 1985, . . . both the D.I. and community products have followed a pretty consistent line.
*The sharp increase in Soviet planning since 1980 for major military campaigns against Iran has been examined in great detail, . . . The judgment -- not just ours but the Community's -- has been that, on balance, the U.S.S.R. is unlikely seriously to consider intervening military unless the Soviets believe the U.S. is about to do so, or central power in Iran breaks down, or a leftist faction seizes power and appeals to the Soviet Union for help.

HEADLINE: Syrian Calls Bush's Plea on Israel Premature

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The Syrian Foreign Minister said today that President Bush's appeal to the General Assembly to repeal its 1975 resolution equating Zionism with racism was premature -- even as more nations joined Mr. Bush's appeal.
"The call for repealing this resolution requires, a priori, eliminating the substantial causes which prompted the United Nations to adopt this resolution," the Syrian, Farouk al-Sharaa, said in a speech to the General Assembly, "that is, to terminate the Israeli occupation of Arab lands and enable the Palestinian people to enjoy their right to self-determination." 
 President Bush made his appeal in his speech here last week, declaring that "to equate Zionism with racism is to reject Israel itself." Several nations, including Hungary today, have since expressed support for repeal of the resolution, which was adopted in 1975 at the urging of Arab and other third-world countries.
Syria's reply to Mr. Bush's appeal is the first by an Arab country in the two weeks of general debate.
In his speech, Mr. Sharaa also accused Israel of undermining "a historic opportunity" for peace by continuing to build settlements in the occupied territories. "It is a strange paradox," he said, "that Israel should demand from the United States financing to build new settlements in the occupied territories and claim, in the meantime, that it wants peace."
Mr. Sharaa's remarks on settlements echoed those here on Monday by the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Oman and reflected the obstacles still standing in the way of the Bush Administration's efforts to convene a peace conference this month. The Israeli Foreign Minister, David Levy, is scheduled to address the General Assembly on Wednesday.
In his speech to the Assembly, Prime Minister Jozsef Antall of Hungary said that two years after Eastern Europe emerged from Communist domination the "remnants of Communist-nationalist dictatorship" were struggling to suppress "the forces of democracy" in Yugoslavia. "The army has slipped out of constitutional control" by denying "the legitimate claims of nations and minorities," he said, referring to the secessionist republics of Croatia and Slovenia.
Cuba reiterated its call for an end to the United States' economic blockade of the island. In an angry condemnation of American policy toward his increasingly isolated nation, the Foreign Minister, Isidoro Malmierca Peoli, mocked President Bush as "the leader of all people of Planet Earth" for presuming to lecture Cuba on democracy and human rights.

HEADLINE: Facing Prison Time, Lawyer Vows to Pay His Victims Millions

 BODY:
A prominent Manhattan divorce lawyer who admitted bilking dozens of his friends, family members and fellow lawyers of millions of dollars has pledged to "mortgage the rest of his life" to repay his victims once he completes his prison sentence.
Alvin Ashley, a former partner at the firm of Colton, Hartnick, Yamin & Sheresky and past president of the New York chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, pleaded guilty on Sept. 24 to five counts of larceny. He faces a minimum of one to three years in prison, with a maximum term of three to nine years. No date has been set for the sentencing by Judge Herbert J. Adlerberg of New York Criminal Court. 
 The Manhattan District Attorney's office said Mr. Ashley enticed many people, including several of New York's most celebrated divorce lawyers, into giving him as much as $10 million of their money to invest. Mr. Ashley told them their money was going into his real-estate and fast food operations. In fact, no such enterprises ever existed; most of the money collected went to pay off prior investors, with the remainder spent on fine food, wine and clothing.
"I hope that even under the worst case scenario, I'll be able to get out of jail, make a new life for myself, and pay these peopIe back -- if not every penny, than at least to make a start," said Mr. Ashley, who is currently unemployed and who faces disbarment. "I grieve for everyone I've hurt," he said. "I stole money, but my heart is not a thief's heart."

HEADLINE: Helping Teen-Agers Avoid Pregnancy

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
A leading youth organization has shown that teen-age pregnancies can be greatly reduced by a simple but comprehensive program that arms teen-age girls with communication skills, information about sexuality and hope for a productive future, along with reproductive health services.
Participation in the program reduced by half the proportion of girls ages 12 to 14 who began having sexual intercourse and also cut in half the number of pregnancies among girls ages 15 to 17. 
 Unlike many other studies, this unusually comprehensive program was conducted under real-world circumstances, which make the results more generally applicable.
The study showed that such "high risk" characteristics as dependence on welfare, living in an inner city, residing in a fatherless household and having friends and mothers who became pregnant as teen-agers need not predestine girls to become teen-age mothers.
 
Social and Economic Problem
 The findings of the three-year study, conducted by Girls Inc. (formerly Girls Clubs of America), will be presented today at a news conference at the Capitol in Washington. The study was conducted among 750 girls from the ages of 12 to 17 at four Girls Inc. affiliates, in Dallas, Memphis, Omaha and Wilmington, Del., where members are at higher than average risk of becoming pregnant before finishing high school.
Corrian Spencer of Dallas, whose mother was a teen-age mother, said: "I would have been a different person" if not for the program. "I learned that I didn't have to go that way," she said. "I wanted to finish high school and have a different life for myself."
Miss Spencer, now 18 and a student at Dillard University in New Orleans, said she started a virgins' club among her high school friends.
Teen-age pregnancy is one of the nation's leading social and economic problems. According to the Center for Population Options, a Washington-based advocacy group on family planning issues, the United States spends $21 billion a year to support the families started by teen-age mothers.
 
More Than 'Just Say No'
 Each year more than one million teen-agers become pregnant, and half of those girls give birth. More than 80 percent of those births result from pregnancies that were unintended.
Joy G. Dryfoos, an independent family planning researcher, said the inexpensive grass-roots program devised by Girls Inc. could be applied by virtually all organizations that serve young girls, including Girls Scouts, Campfire Girls, Y.W.C.A.'s and 4-H programs.
Jane Quinn, a former project manager at Girls Inc., said in an interview, "Preventing teen pregnancies requires much more than a 'Just say no' approach." Mrs. Quinn, now with the Carnegie Foundation's Council on Adolescent Development in Washington, said that "young girls have to be taught how to say no without losing popularity."
"And the lessons have to start early, preferably by age 9," Mrs. Quinn said. "By ages 12 to 14, 25 percent of the participants in the study already had had sexual intercourse."
 
'Dosage Makes Difference'
 Dr. Heather Johnston Nicholson of Girls Inc. in Indianapolis, who directed the three-year project, said, "A significant support system is needed for teen-age girls who live in a society that continually bombards them with messages about how wonderful sex is."
The Girls Inc. study showed that attitudes and habits are not formulated in a four-hour program. "To teach skills effectively, you need to give it time," Dr. Nicholson said. "We showed that dosage makes a difference."
The research project included a control group of girls who did not participate. Although the girls were allowed to choose whether to participate or not, there was little difference between participants and nonparticipants with regard to characteristics associated with a high risk of early sexual activity.
 
Four-Part Program
 The project had four elements. Two of them, Growing Together and Will Power/Won't Power, were geared toward younger girls, all of whom had not yet become sexually active. The other two, Taking Care of Business and Health Bridge, were intended for older girls who may have been sexually active but had not yet become pregnant.
In Growing Together, five two-hour mother-daughter workshops were held to foster communication about sexuality and other sensitive issues. The participants were less than half as likely as nonparticipants to have sexual intercourse for the first time.
Will Power/Won't Power is an assertiveness training program designed by Mrs. Quinn to help younger teen-agers refuse to become sexually active without jeopardizing their friendships.
This program, delivered in six two-hour sessions, was most effective among those who participated in it for nearly its entirety. These girls were only half as likely as nonparticipants and less than one-third as likely as those who participated for a shorter time to become sexually active.
 
Looking to Future
 Taking Care of Business, held in nine two-hour sessions, sought to increase girls' desire to avoid pregnancy by fostering educational and career planning, helping them to set goals and teaching communication skills and responsible decision-making.
The idea is that girls who can see a future for themselves as educated adults or wage earners will be less likely to turn to motherhood for a sense of identity. Those who participated in nearly the entire program were about half as likely as nonparticipants to have sex without using birth control and one-third as likely as short-term participants to become pregnant.
 
Contraceptive Services
 The final component, Health Bridge, linked teachings about sexuality at the Girls Inc. centers with community-based health services that also provided contraceptive services.
Participants reported having sex without using birth control one-third as often as nonparticipants, and the participants were also less than half as likely to become pregnant.
Dr. Nicholson estimated that the full program could be offered for $116 a year per girl, whereas delaying a single pregnancy to beyond the teen-age years could save society $8,500.

HEADLINE: Memphis Campaign is Racially Divisive

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
Here in his hometown, Willie W. Herenton is a powerful symbol: a product of a broken home who was raised in poverty in the city's public housing projects, emerged from its segregated schools to earn a doctorate in education and became Memphis's first black Superintendent of Schools.
This year the 51-year-old Mr. Herenton seemed ready to add another chapter to that rags-to-riches story. He is running for mayor of this city of 610,000 people, one of the few large American cities with a black majority that has never had a black mayor. In the past, blacks never managed to unite behind a single candidate, but this spring several black organizations got together at what they called a People's Convention, excluding whites, to chose Mr. Herenton as their consensus candidate. 
 But as Mr. Herenton faces the conservative white incumbent, Richard C. Hackett, in the nonpartisan election on Thursday, the outcome is very much in doubt. The Herenton campaign is still dogged by divisions among black voters. To many voters, the issue is which candidate they will be most comfortable with; but some Herenton supporters say their candidate's struggle is a reflection of the sad racial history of this old Mississippi River city.
 
Fighting Anti-White Perception
 Mr. Herenton has been fighting a perception among many white voters that in his efforts to galvanize black voters, and because of the exclusion of whites from the People's Convention, his campaign has become anti-white. Consequently, he has attracted little visible white support, even in those white areas generally favorable to black candidates. And his opponent, who has been hard pressed to win black support in the past, has been getting some notable black support this time around, partly as a result of his appointment of blacks to jobs in his administration. .
"I wish some of my white friends would have publicly supported me, but that has not happened," Mr. Herenton said to a recent campaign gathering. "I had hoped, too, that blacks would have been unanimous in how they perceived what we needed, but regrettably that has not happened. I guess that is just Memphis."
 
Growing Out of Rural South
 Mr. Herenton's lament was a meditation of sorts on the city's tortured racial history, which many see being revisited and agonized over in the mayoral campaign. Memphis not only gained infamy as the city where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, but many of its black and white residents also say the city has been generally slow to embrace the model of the New South. There is a palpable impatience, and some embarrassment, among Memphis's blacks, who have seen other cities with black majorities, like Atlanta and Birmingham, as well as some with white majorities, like Denver, Seattle and Kansas City, Mo., have elect black Mayors.
Sidney Chism, head of the 2,000-member teamster local, and a Herenton supporter, said Memphis had only recently become more than a cotton and river town.
Although the city is now a fast-growing distribution center, Dr. Harry Moore, regional director of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, said its roots were in the poor rural life of the Mississippi Delta. At the same time, he said, its political life was shaped by nearly 45 years of domination by the political machine of Boss Ed Crump, who controlled the black vote through money and intimidation. All of this went a long way to stunting the growth of black political influence as well as prolonging the reliance of some whites on what Mr. Chism and Mr. Moore called "plantation politics."
But some political analysts outside Memphis suggest that the problem with Mr. Herenton's campaign is that it is relying too much on a sense of impatience among blacks and is not recognizing the need to find unifying factors.
Nationwide, there are 7,700 black elected officials, and black Mayors head five of the nation's 10 largest city's. As a result of those successes, Russell Owens, head of the Joint Center for Political Studies's National Policy Center, said, there might be understandable frustration among blacks here.
"I would be frustrated, too," Mr. Owens said, "but there are ways to build consensus without focusing exclusively on race as the unifying factor. And if there is a falloff in black participation because of this, it can be offset by the ability to attract white support."
 
Commercial Setbacks
 The election comes at a time when Memphis is still smarting from the loss of Holiday Inn's corporate headquarters to Atlanta and the bankruptcy of the management company that was to build the city's $52 million, pyramid-shaped sports arena into a major attraction. Mr. Herenton has tried to place the blame for these developments squarely at Mayor Hackett's feet.
The 42-year-old Mayor is a low-keyed man who cuts a workmanlike figure at City Hall and admits he is a bit "drab and dull." But in the last two years of his second term he has appointed a significant number of blacks, including the city's chief administrative officers.
Mr. Hackett, in an interview in his office, said he had stressed the "inclusiveness" of his administration in his campaign rather than attack Mr. Herenton or debate him. It is difficult to find him mentioning his opponent's name at all in his campaign. The nearest the Mayor comes to mentioning the city's racial makeup is in his campaign slogan, which touts him as "a steady hand for changing times."
 
A Liberal Corridor
 "The slogan is meant to suggest the racial change in the city, but also the economic changes and other changes," Mr. Hackett said. "And the inclusion we talk about is not only different skin colors but different opinions."
Mr. Hackett has never garnered many votes from the city's "Poplar Corridor," a white upper-middle-class swath that stretches across Memphis's midsection and draws its name from a major thoroughfare there. It is this area where a black candidate could usually expect to get a sizable white vote from among the comparatively liberal whites who have not joined the white flight to the suburbs,
"The Poplar Corridor has historically provided the majority of white votes that any black candidate got," said David Cocke, a resident of the area and former chairman of the city's Democratic Party organization. "But for whatever reason, this time around the Poplar Corridor will be voting for the white candidate in greater numbers than ever before."
Mr. Cocke and George Jones, who is black and is Mayor Hackett's campaign co-chairman, suggest that the reason is white anger over their exclusion from the People's Convention.
Mr. Herenton was named Superintendent of Schools in 1978 after a bitter, racially charged process and went on by most accounts to build a sound school system amid frequent fights with the school board over budgets. As with any urban school system, Memphis has its share of critics who lament declines in test scores, increases in dropout rates and ossified bureaucracies and budgets that inhibit experimentation and innovation.
In the 105,000-pupil system, which is 88 percent black, Mr. Herenton has won the trust and support of many black parents but has little or no constituency among whites, many of whom send their children to private schools.
The success of Mr. Herenton, who retired in June, could be measured by the fact that in the last three years he has been a top candidate for Superintendent of Schools in both Atlanta and New York City. His supporters acknowledge that there was one cloud over the later years of his tenure; He was involved in a sexual harassment suit, which was settled out of court in 1990 and the record was sealed.
Mr. Herenton said the local news media "blew it out of proportion and had a modern day crucifixion."

HEADLINE: Interior Panel to Study Logging Effect on Owl

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said today that he would convene a little-used Cabinet-level committee to determine whether logging in the Pacific Northwest should be allowed to continue despite its impact on a threatened species, the Northern spotted owl.
Mr. Lujan said he was reluctantly setting up the panel, but he added, "No solution to this problem could be found short of this action." He cited the economic impact of the ban on logging in the Northwest. 
 The Fish and Wildlife Service declared the owl a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in June 1990. The service, an Interior Department agency, said excessive logging of ancient forests in the Northwest was a major cause of the decline in the population of the owl. An estimated 3,000 pairs of owls remain.
Last month, another Interior Department agency, the Bureau of Land Management, asked Mr. Lujan to convene the special panel to consider exempting some logging in Oregon from the Endangered Species Act.
Without the exemption, the bureau said, timber harvests on bureau land in Oregon would fall by 75 percent. Industry leaders fear that overall owl protection would cost tens of thousands of jobs in Oregon, Washington and California.
But critics said the move was the Bush Administration's latest attempt to undermine Federal environmental laws. "If they grant the exemption, they will be leading the spotted owl further down the road to extinction," said Kevin Kirchner of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund.

HEADLINE: Boarding Schools Act To Win Back Students

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
A sharp decline in the number of students applying for boarding school admissions is forcing many schools, including the most prestigious, to adopt aggressive marketing strategies that would have sent shock waves through their sedate Gothic arches and leaded windows only a decade ago. But these new techniques seem to be starting to reverse the trend.
Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, one of the more prestigious East Coast boarding schools, whose alumni include Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut and Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive officer of the Walt Disney Company, has installed a toll-free telephone number to encourage people to call the admissions office. 
 The school has also appointed Lawrence L. Hlavacek Jr., a lacrosse coach and former house master, as director of off-campus operations, a new position that dispatched the engaging Mr. Hlavacek through the back roads of America like an itinerant preacher to spread the good gospel of the boarding school.
 
Unheard- of Tactics
 These sort of marketing techniques "would have been unheard-of 10 years ago," said Anne Rosenfeld, president of Public Information Resources Inc., a marketing firm in Boston that specializes in independent schools.
"In the old days," said Heather Hoerle, associate director for boarding schools at the National Association of Independent Schools, "you just sat and waited for families to come to campus because you'd be filled by April anyway."
That is no longer true. Soaring tuition rates, a shrinking pool of teen-agers, and the current recession all have hit boarding schools hard. According to the independent schools' association, enrollment among their member boarding fell to 7,729 in 43 schools by 1989-90, from 10,166 in 46 schools in 1981 -- about the time the schools started seriously to consider new marketing strategies. By the following school year, enrollments had begun to inch back up.
To help make this happen, some boarding schools have quietly started to open their doors a little wider, recruiting students they might have spurned or admitted only reluctantly before: those with weaker grades, mild learning disabilities or minor emotional problems and even those from abroad with only a creaky knowledge of English.
Admissions directors from 12 boarding schools recently took a collaborative trip to Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea especially for recruitment.
"Almost all boarding schools are becoming far less rigid about their entrance requirements," said Howard Greene, president of Howard Greene Associates, private education consultants in Connecticut and New York City.
So far, few have actually closed down. But at least two decided to become coeducational and three have changed from pure boarding to a mix of boarding and day students, where the demand for private education is still strong. Many are also working harder to generate more money for scholarship money.
The result is that boarding schools generally are becoming more accessible to a wider segment of the population, a change many of their administrators consider long overdue. Others argue that the shift toward a more diverse student body had been a goal for some time and the current crisis simply accelerated the process.
A major obstacle preventing people from choosing boarding school, of course, is the soaring tuition rates. These have been caused, administrators say, by rising costs of attracting and keeping good teachers, of buying advanced equipment like computers, and of keeping up the sports, library and arts programs needed to remain competitive.
 
School's Cost Rises to $17,800
 For instance, tuition, room and board at Kent Hills School in Readfield, Me., stands at $17,800 for the academic year 1991-92, compared with $9,900 in 1985 and $5,600 in 1981. This compares with a national median of $14,500 in 1990-91, more than double the $7,100 for 1981-82.
Many families can no longer shoulder such a financial burden, especially during a recession. That was a major reason why Kent Hills enrolled only 125 students in 1990-91, down almost 40 percent from the 200 students who attended four years ago.
The demographic trough has hit boarding schools particularly hard, admissions officers say, because the drop in the numbers of teen-agers has been particularly acute among the well-to-do families that traditionally patronized those institutions. Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass, for example, registered a 40 percent drop in the number of children of alumni eligible to apply from 1985 to 1990, as compared with the previous five years.
Some boarding schools have hired public relations and advertising firms to enhance their images. There have been the growing number of print, radio and television advertising campaigns, which many of these schools would have found horrifying only a few years ago. "Give your child the education you wish you had," urges one message attached to a snapshot of an introspective-looking preppie in wire-rimmed glasses, in an advertisement being run in a variety of national and regional magazines.
Most boarding schools are also stepping up their summer programs and turning to professional fund-raisers to build larger endowments and generate auxiliary income to increase scholarships and student aid. To retain students, Kent Hills, for example, now spends $425,000 a year on financial aid, or about $3,000 per student. This compares with $66,000 in 1980, or $500 per student.
On the national level, coeducation boarding schools spent an average of $5,994 per student in 1989-90, the latest year for which data are available, as compared with $3,748 in 1980-81.
But perhaps the most profound effect will come from international students, who are increasingly filling the breach. Statistics from the independent schools' association show that about 80 percent of the 1990-1991 rise in enrollment came from overseas students, in particular the nations of the Pacific Rim and Europe.
"Boarding schools now consider it part of their regular mission to educate future generations from many countries," said Ms. Hoerle, from the association. While it has been part of their long-term mission for some years, it has now also become a lifesaving strategy.

HEADLINE: Science and Math Get Most Support

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Major corporations that give money to support education in the United States are more interested in giving to mathematics and science projects, and are much less inclined to give money for programs to serve early childhood needs or to keep drugs out of schools.
These preferences emerged in a survey of leading companies' responses to the six national education goals set forth in 1989 by President Bush and the nation's governors. The survey was made by the Conference Board, a research and information organization based in New York City, which sent questionnaires to 1,600 companies and received 176 replies. 
 The country's major corporations have been urged by the Bush Administration to support the educational-improvement strategy coming from Washington. The business community has been the major supplier so far of money and leadership for the New American Schools Development Corporation, recently formed at the President's request to help create and finance new school models, from kindergarten to high schools.
Giving to projects at the elementary and secondary school level would be a radical shift from the traditional role of business as a supporter of colleges and universities. Corporations in 1990 contributed $5.9 billion for education, mainly to higher education. A slow but steady increase in assistance is now going to pre-college education, but it is proportionately small. American corporations last year gave $400 million in cash and equipment to schools covering kindergarten through 12th grade, according to the American Association of Fund Raising Counsel's publication, "Giving USA."
The widespread preference of business leaders, the survey showed, is to devote corporate dollars toward programs that help meet their work force needs and serve American companies well in global economic competition. This was reflected in the survey's showing a marked preference for the national goal that states, "By the year 2000, U.S. students will be the first in the world in mathematics and science." The survey also found a strong preference for supporting measurable academic achievement, such as achieving literacy.
By contrast, corporations reported that they were less enthusiastic about using their financial or technical help to attack social problems. Such investments often do not yield immediate benefits, or are not readily measured.
The survey showed that companies gave the lowest priority to the kindergarten-readiness goal, which states, "By the year 2000, all children will start school ready to learn." Next-lowest on the list of where they would choose to put their money and technical assistance was the goal that "by the year 2000 every school will be free of drugs and violence and offer a disciplined environment."
Ronald E. Berenbeim, a senior research associate of the Conference Board, who directed the survey, said: "Early childhood education comes at the bottom of the list, because it takes 10 or 12 years to measure results, and also businessmen find it is not easy to relate small children to the company's definition of self-interest."
 
A 'Government Problem'?
 Drug abuse and the needs of children are regarded as a "government problem" by many companies, Mr. Berenbeim said. "And yet when we ask people who work at the operating level in companies and have first-hand exposure to communities what they would do to improve education, they all say the same thing: start earlier."
The preference for math and science projects is understandable since they relate to many company operations, particularly in manufacturing, said Dr. Leonard Lund, program director of business education research at the Conference Board. "Science and math have a constituency among corporate leaders, because so many of them have been trained in engineering," he said. "The problems of disadvantaged children are of concern, but only remotely so."

HEADLINE: HELP FOR JOBLESS CLEARS LAWMAKERS BUT MAY BE VETOED

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Both houses of Congress voted today to spend $6.4 billion on extended unemployment benefits for about three million Americans who have been out of work at least half a year, but the margin in the Senate was too narrow to override the veto President Bush has threatened.
Republicans accused the Democrats of fiscal irresponsibility and of pursuing a political issue rather than offering real help for the unemployed. Democrats said the Senate majority on the bill giving workers up to 20 additional weeks of benefits fell two votes short of being veto-proof because of White House pressure. The Democrats said the pressure showed that the Administration cared little for Americans in distress. 
 Five Republican Senators who had backed an earlier version of the bill voted against it today, saying that the language adopted Thursday by House-Senate negotiators undermined last year's budget agreement.
In the end, 8 Senate Republicans and all 57 Democrats voted for the bill, while the 35 other Republicans voted against it, leaving the tally at 65 to 35, two votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.
 
Waiting for Jobless FiguresFriday
 The 300-to-118 House vote was easily enough to override a veto. Fifty-five Republicans joined 244 Democrats and one Independent in voting for the bill. Eleven Democrats and 107 Republicans opposed it, and 15 members did not vote. [Senate and House roll-calls, page D20.]
Democrats refused to concede thebill's ultimate defeat. They said they hoped Mr. Bush would change his mind and sign it. Or, they said, possible bad news in unemployment figures due out Friday and pressure from constituents, which they hope to organize, might lead two Republican senators to change their votes.
 
Republican Alternative
 In particular, the Democrats were zeroing in on Senators John Seymour of California and Christopher Bond of Missouri, who are up for election next year. The other three Republicans who switched their votes to oppose the bill today were Senators Conrad Burns of Montana, John C. Danforth of Missouri and David Durenberger of Minnesota.
But Republicans said they hoped thatonce the bill was vetoed and the veto sustained, Democrats would support a $1.9 billion measure sponsored by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader. That measure provides up to 10 additional weeks of benefits. In most states, the unemployed are now eligible for benefits for up to 26 weeks.
Republicans said the Dole bill would be more fiscally responsible than the Democratic measure, which would add to the budget deficit over five years. The Dole bill, while bringing no money into the Treasury in 1992, would eventually pay for itself from proceeds of auctions of unused radio frequencies and by continuing current tax laws allowing unpaid student loans to be taken out of tax refunds by the Internal Revenue Service.
 
Partisan and Angry
 The exchanges among lawmakers in both houses were partisan and angry. Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who heads his party's Senate campaign committee, said the Democratic bill was a "political sham," because proponents "are not willing to pay for it by taking the money from something else."
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who is head of the Joint Economic Committee, said that under current law, in only one state, Rhode Island, are workers eligible to receive money from a $7.7 billion trust fund for extended benefits. That, he said, "is the political scam, to have employers paying these monies into the trust fund for the purpose of extended benefits and not to use the money."
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who sponsored the measure, attacked the Dole bill for making it harder for veterans to collect uenmployment benefits if they have "finished their tour of duty with Desert Shield and Desert Storm and then honorably discharged and find themselves without a job." The Democratic bill makes more benefits available to veterans than current law allows; the Dole bill would reduce them by making veterans whose enlistments are up ineligible for jobless benefits.
In the House, which took up the bill after the Senate vote, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, said that if the Democrats would accept the reality of the veto situation and pass the Dole bill, "the unemployed would get real checks; they wouldn't just get press releases."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, renewed a major Democratic theme, that Mr. Bush is prepared to declare emergencies to permit extra deficit spending for foreigners like Kurds or Bangladeshis and get around last year's budget act, but is unwilling to see emergencies at home. "Working Americans have no place in the President's New World Order," he said.
Last year's budget act, and the roles of the President and Congress, figured heavily in today's argument. In August, at Senate insistence, Congress passed a two-step measure. Under it, Mr. Bush signed the bill, saying he wanted to show sympathy for the jobless, but then refused to issue a separate declaration of emergency that would have allowed checks to go out, saying he did not want to "bust the budget."
That provision, requiring separate Presidential and Congressional decisions that an emergency existed, was scrapped in conference. If Mr. Bush signs this bill, or it is passed over his veto, it will take effect without any additional step -- in effect declaring the emergency for him.
Senator Danforth cited this change, made in the House-Senate conference, as his reason for switching to opposition of the bill. "The budget agreement of last year requires that we make choices among worthy programs," he said. "The deal last year was that we begin to live within a budget. I believe the conrols on Federal spending must be maintained."
The bill adopted today would be in effect until next July and temporarily replace the existing extended-benefits system. That system provides extended benefits up to 13 weeks after a worker has exhausted regular unemployment benefits, which average $167 per week. The current program is paid for equally from state and Federal funds.
Extended benefits are now paid when joblessness among a state's workers who are covered by unemployment insurance reaches 6 percent, or when the rate reaches 5 percent if the level of jobless covered by insurance exceeds by one-fifth the average level in that state over the last two years. But even though the national unemployment rate was 6.8 percent for August, workers in only one state, Rhode Island, and in Puerto Rico are now eligible.
Under the bill passed today, the standard would be total unemployment. Democrats argue that total unemployment is the better gauge, because when there is widespread joblessness of any sort in a state, it is harder to find a job. Only about half of all workers are covered by insurance.
Under the bill approved today, all benefits would be paid from Federal funds. In states with 8 percent unemployment, averaged over the last six months, up to 20 weeks of additional benefits could be paid. Workers in Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi and West Virginia would be added to those in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico as eligible.
In states with 7 percent unemployment, 13 additional weeks of benefits could be paid. California and New York, the nation's two most populous states, are in that group. In all other states, seven weeks of additional benefits could be paid.
Two of the eight Republican senators who voted for the bill, William S. Cohen of Maine and John J. Chafee of Rhode Island, represent states whose workers would be eligible for 20 additional weeks. Three of them, Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and James J. Jeffords of Vermont, represent workers who would be eligible for 13 additional weeks. The other three, Mark O. Hatfield and Bob Packwood of Oregon and Bob Kasten of Wisconsin, represent workers who would be eligible for an extra seven weeks. Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Packwood, Mr. Specter and Mr. Kasten are up for election next year.
The bill's reach would be temporary, extending only until next July, except for a provision affecting people who leave the armed services. A permanent change would make them eligible for 26 weeks of benefits, instead of the current 13 weeks. They would be able to start collecting after one week of being out of work, instead of the current four. Both changes would put them under the same rules as people who leave civilian jobs.

HEADLINE: Review/Theater;
Saroyan's 'Time of Your Life,' at Arena Stage

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
In these rough economic times, one might expect Arena Stage, the premier resident theater in the nation's capital, to use its art to prod politicians into action. But Arena is instead opening its new season with William Saroyan's San Francisco barroom reverie of 1939, "The Time of Your Life," surely the most comforting American play to emerge from the Depression, and will soon follow it with a musical adaptation of Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life," another work that champions the power of fundamentally decent Americans to vanquish any misfortune single-handedly. Far from challenging Washington's conventional wisdom, Arena's 41st season -- the first under the artistic direction of Douglas C. Wager, Zelda Fichandler's successor -- seems eager to chime in with its own program for a thousand points of light.
The wattage will have to be a lot higher than it is in Liviu Ciulei's staging of "The Time of Your Life" if Arena is to convince anyone that the country is as full of good Samaritans as its chosen scripts would have audiences believe. Mr. Ciulei, a Romanian-born director and designer capable of startling visions of classics, would seem to have a special fondness for Saroyan's play; though he has now been working in the United States for nearly two decades, it is the first American play he has chosen to direct here. 
 Yet, with the exception of one major performance, by Casey Biggs as Joe, and a few minor ones, this production is sloppily acted as well as flaccidly paced, running three hours despite textual trims. Mr. Ciulei's approach to the work is pure stock -- even his saloon set looks as pre-fab as a Pizzeria Uno franchise -- and his only bold directorial gesture is to change the play's favored jukebox tune from "The Missouri Waltz" to "You Go to My Head."
It would be easy, but wrong, to blame the evening's failings on Saroyan. The standard line on this writer, who died a decade ago, has long been that he is a sentimentalist whose literary string ran out when World War II rendered his sunny world view obsolete. But he has never lacked for critical defenders -- Edmund Wilson, Mary McCarthy and Harold Clurman have been among them -- and in truth "The Time of Your Life" seems less dated than many other touchstone American plays of the same period.
Unburdened by ideology, the work has none of the antiquated preachiness of Odets; bereft of structure, it is free of the creaking plot mechanics of Kaufman and Hart. Yes, the play's characters, from the philosophical longshoreman to the lovable cop to the whore with a heart of gold, are too good to be true, but they have their own poetic reality. Saroyan's off-center vignettes about his ethnic cross-section of drifters and his shaggy, unforced sense of humor make his play, initially titled "The Light Fantastic," as brightly colored and animated as the pinball machine at center stage.
For the show to fly, each character's turn has to be supercharged with theatrical personality, not naturalistic acting, like succeeding comic acts in a vaudeville bill or a circus. Though "The Time of Your Life" was written in the same year that O'Neill wrote "The Iceman Cometh," the denizens of its bar dream attainable dreams, not pipe dreams, and the play upholds magical illusions rather than spreading disillusionment.
In an Arena cast exceeding two dozen, the light fantastic is tripped only by Joey McKneely, who brings a Dead End Kid's tattered innocence and a hoofer's grace to the role of an erstwhile "natural born dancer and comedian" originally played on Broadway by Gene Kelly, and, to a more incidental degree, by Jeffery V. Thompson as the bartender, Nick, and Teagle F. Bougere as an itinerant honky-tonk pianist.
Among the more central and damaging performances are those of Pamela Nyberg, who acts Kitty, the sweet and distraught prostitute, as if she were a cross young suburban matron, and Kevin James Kelly, who goofily and sexlessly caricatures the young man smitten by her. In a class apart is Richard Bauer, outfitted in long whiskers and full Buffalo Bill regalia as a mock frontiersman who calls himself Kit Carson. A mountain of mannerisms -- odd crouches, vocal twangs, stomach pattings, whisky-eyed winks -- he pays attention to the other actors only if they threaten to upstage him. During his longest soliloquy, the cast surrounds him in worshipful, open-mouthed poses (a prostrate posture of adulation mimicked by a minority of the audience) while Mr. Ciulei spins the revolving stage to show off his prize specimen of ham from every angle.
As Joe, the mysteriously wealthy, Champagne-sipping philanthropist who functions as the play's unofficial stage manager, Mr. Biggs is a most elegant antidote to such shenanigans. This is a very, very fine performance in an impossible role: the wry, distanced Joe could seem bland next to the barflies around him, and he often seems to be Saroyan's stand-in for God. An urbane figure in a gray suit, Mr. Biggs wears his halo lightly. He is serene without being unctuous, a martini-dry rather than syrupy-sweet humanitarian. He sounds the dark notes in the play -- the European drums of war, most notably -- without being portentous, gently nudging the audience to recognize that Saroyan had more on his mind than the wonderfulness of little people. In the compassionate, troubled undertow of Mr. Biggs's Joe, which recalls the world-weary tone of the wartime Hollywood performances of Claude Rains, one feels the brunt of the play's principal refrain, recited by an unnamed Arab: "No foundation all the way down the line."
One does not want to make too much of Saroyan's seriousness even so. "In the time of your life, live" is the play's main, and lightweight, message, and it is as a fantasy, an entertainment, that the play must live, not as any kind of exercise in social realism. From its first production, there have been arguments over how best to realize the piece -- Saroyan drove away the original, fabulist-inclined director, Robert Lewis, and designer, Boris Aronson, during the New Haven tryout -- and one can see why. If "The Time of Your Life" never had much to add to political debates, it remains a fertile ground for esthetic debate and experimentation in the theater. But the play's dream world of 1939 is no more present at Arena Stage than the real world of 1991. Milking Saroyan merely for his hokiest jokes and cheap nostalgia, Mr. Ciulei has reduced an artist's genuine feat of escapism to a truly irrelevant, and synthetic, heap of corn.

HEADLINE: Guggenheim's Orbit May Take In Spain

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Officials of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which in the past several years has been hatching plans to expand from SoHo to Salzburg, Austria, are meeting in Manhattan this week with representatives of Bilbao, the fourth largest city in Spain, to work out the final details on yet another branch: the Guggenheim Museum/Bilbao.
A design for the new museum -- a sprawling, riverside structure of sand-blasted steel and concrete by the American architect Frank Gehry -- has already been approved. 
 Juan Ignacio Vidarte, the director of finance for the region of Biscay, which includes Bilbao, said in a telephone interview the other day that the project was expected to cost $100 million, and was part of a redevelopment plan for the city that calls for an investment of more than a billion dollars over the next 25 years.
Thomas Krens, the director of the Guggenheim Museum, was not willing to discuss current negotiations, but said that his museum would provide "exhibitions, our collection, expertise and administration, but none of the costs."
"There will be no drain on the Guggenheim Foundation in terms of capital or costs of operation," he continued. "You can be sure that the 28 members of our board will want to be satisfied on that before we go forward."
Meanwhile, the peripatetic Mr. Krens is overseeing the $24 million renovation and expansion of the spiral museum designed by Frank Lloyd Wright at Fifth Avenue and 89th Street; supervising the creation of a $5.5 million branch museum in SoHo; presiding over temporary offices in midtown Manhattan; directing the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice; lobbying for the last-minute reprieve of Massachusetts state seed money for the proposed $87.5 million Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (known as Mass Moca) in North Adams, Mass., which the Guggenheim has offered to operate, and concluding a deal with the city of Salzburg for the construction of a $90 million Guggenheim Museum in that city.
How is he managing all of this when the country is still in the grip of a major recession?
"It comes to having faith in the art, faith in the architects, faith in the cities and faith in the internationalization of the art world," said Mr. Krens in an interview last week at the gutted building at 575 Broadway, at Prince Street, that is soon to house the Guggenheim SoHo Museum.
He paused, and added with a subtle narrowing of his large eyes, "Maybe there's also a modest act of defiance here."
It was the Salzburg project, which has received wide publicity in Europe since it was announced in 1989, Mr. Krens said, that attracted the proposal from Bilbao.
What made him take the proposal seriously was learning that Bilbao, an old steel town on the Bay of Biscay, plans over the next 25 years to transform itself into a modern financial center.
So one day last April, Mr. Krens found himself circling Bilbao in a helicopter scouting a possible location for the new musuem. He chose one on the banks of the Nervion River, which bisects the city.
Mr. Gehry, speaking from his office in Los Angeles, said, "The space has enormous sculptural appeal, in a river valley with surrounding hills and the city." The museum is to open in September 1995.
Even before the Bilbao museum was announced, Mr. Krens was criticized for stretching himself, his staff and resources too thin. "The Metropolitan Museum does $80 million a year in their merchandise operation and nobody says that distracts them," he said when the criticism was mentioned. "It all depends on whether you're running a holding action or looking forward."
As for wear and tear on the collection that is intended to rotate from one Guggenheim museum to another, Mr. Krens said that in the past about 97 percent of it had to be kept in storage. "The art is only effective if it can be seen," he said. "We want to balance access with security, care and conservation, and we can do all of that most effectively with multiple sites under the supervision of a single staff."

HEADLINE: U.S. Suspends Assistance to Haiti And Refuses to Recognize Junta

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The United States today suspended economic assistance to Haiti, said it would not recognize the military junta that ousted the democratically elected government there and joined with other Latin American and Caribbean nations in organizing a pressure campaign to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
President Aristide, who was bundled off to Venezuela early today by the coup leaders after the American ambassador negotiated for his life, defiantly declared at a news conference in Caracas that the rebels were "power mad" and that he would do all he could to reinstate his seven-month-old government -- the first to be elected by a democratic vote in Haitian history. 
 American officials said President Aristide was planning to fly to Washington to take part in an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States Wednesday to decide on a collective response to the Haiti coup.
 
Sanctions to Be Sought
 The officials said President Aristide will ask for sanctions and possibly even some form of international intervention to reverse the coup, which Administration officials are describing as the first real test to the new democratic order that has emerged in the Carribean and Latin America over the last 15 years. Except for Cuba, virtually every government in the region is now democratically chosen.
Haiti's representative at the United Nations expressed disappointment today over the failure of the Security Council to discuss the coup. The Haitian official, Fritz E. Longchamp, told a news conference he was disturbed by the Security Council's reaction, which he described as "unfair and a denial of Haitian rights." The president of the Security Council had informed him that a majority of the delegations felt there should not be a meeting on what was seen as "an internal matter."
The elections that brought President Aristide to power, said Bernard Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American affairs, "were held under unprecedented international supervision. The O.A.S. and the United Nations both oversaw them. Therefore, they have a legitimacy not just in Haiti but internationally. So it is very important in our point of view that they be defended."
Secondly, added Mr. Aronson, "every time democracy is threatened by the military in this hemisphere it sends off potential shockwaves and we want to make clear that this kind of behaivor has a terrible price. We are going to isolate them, and we hope that the hemisphere is going to isolate them until democracy is restrored."
For now, though, Washington and its allies appear to be confining themselves to diplomatic and economic pressures to reverse the coup, and it remains unclear whether military action may be considered. The O.A.S. members have traditionally spurned interventionist actions.
 
100 Deaths Reported
 The Reuters news agency reported from Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, that troops loyal to the military Government were patrolling the streets on foot in and cars, spraying crowds with random machine gun and rifle fire, according to witnesses. It quoted the Caribbean Human Rights Network, based in Barbados, as saying preliminary counts indicated more than 100 people have been killed since the coup began late Sunday. By late today, though, the American Embassy in Port-au-Prince, said the streets were "tense but calm," as the military imposed a 6 P.M.-to-6 A.M. curfew.
The three-man-junta led by the army's commander, Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras, was trying to consolidate its hold on power. General Cedras broadcasst a statement on the Government television station tonight saying the coup was necessary to halt human rights abuses and violations of the Constitution by President Aristide's Government, The Associated Press reported. In his statement, General Cedras called President Aristide an "apprentice dictator."
 It is still not clear exactly who is involved in the coup or what ideological positions they represent.
 "There is a general who is trying to rob the people of democratic power and I am sure that with the support of the international community we can overthrow him," said President Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest, at his news conference at the palace of President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela in Caracas. "The democratic process which we have been experiencing in Haiti cannot be stopped by this coup d'etat."
The United States had appropriated $84 million in economic and food aid for Haiti, and $1.5 million in military aid, for the 1991 fiscal year. State Department officials, however, could not say how much of this had already been paid out and how much would be affected by today's suspension in aid. The 1991 fiscal year ended Monday.
Besides suspending this year's economic assistance to Haiti, the State Department is also going to hold up its request to Congress for $88.6 million in economic aid and $2.2 million in military aid for the 1992 fiscal year. For a country as poor as Haiti, even these relatively small amounts of aid could have an impact on the junta, particularly when they are combined with aid cutoffs from other donors.
In addition to freezing assistance to Haiti, Washington joined other members of the O.A.S. in calling an emergency foreign ministers meeting to organize collective diplomatic pressure to restore constitutional rule in Haiti.
The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, speaking of the coup, said "this outrageous action by elements of the Haitian armed forces is an attack on the democratic aspirations of the Haitian people. Yesterday, the United States joined the member nations of the Organization of American States in condemning this action and in demanding, 'respect for the Government legitimately established through the free expression of the popular will of that country.' The United States government does not recognize this junta."
Bush Administration officials are anxious to quickly demonstrate that the coup cannot work and should not inspire military coups elsewhere.
"Right now virtually every nation in this hemisphere is freely elected, and every democratically elected president in this hemisphere has a stake in making sure that that the military in Haiti fail," said Robert A. Pastor, an Emory University expert on Latin America and one of the observers at last December's Haitian elections. "The real question is whether they have the courage to act with enough collecitve punch to put Aristide back in the National Palace."
At the last O.A.S. foreign ministers meeting, held in Santiago, Chile, in June, the organization agreed to a new method for preserving democratic Governments from military coups. It decided that whenever democracy was disrupted in any member state, O.A.S. foreign ministers would be authorized to adopt "any measures" deemed appropriate to restore constitutional rule.
France and Canada also responded to the coup by suspending all their aid programs and refusing to recognize the junta. French aid amounted to about $36 million and Canada's assistance to $8.8 million. It was also expected that aid programs instituted after Haiti's democratic elections by the Organization of American States, the European Community and the World Bank -- which last July raised $350 million in pledges for Haiti at a meeting in Paris -- would be suspended.
Haiti's international airport has been closed since Monday afternoon, when the coup plotters seized Father Aristide at the National Palace. Venezuelan, French and United States diplomats negotiated with the coup plotters for the President's life, and the American Ambassador, Alvin Adams, escorted Father Aristide to the airport. The Haitian President had been planning to visit Washington later this week for a meeting with President Bush.

HEADLINE: CALLS TO REVIEW BUDGET PACT RISE

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, today joined a growing chorus of leading Democrats seeking to reopen last year's budget agreement after President Bush's announcement that he would destroy thousands of nuclear weapons.
Mr. Foley, a Washington Democrat, said the President's action and changes in relations with the Soviet Union brought on by the failed coup in August should be reflected by a shift in the way Congress views the Pentagon budget. 
 The budget agreement set limits on three categories of spending -- military, foreign and domestic -- and barred shifting money among them. At the time, political leaders did not foresee large changes in any category. Now that the possibility of a larger-than-expected military budget cut is being discussed, Mr. Foley and other Democrats are frustrated that the budget agreement dictates that any savings go to reduce the budget deficit and not to supplement domestic spending.
 
'Conditions Have Changed'

 "The budget agreement was undertaken last year in good faith by all of the parties," Mr. Foley told reporters. "The President's initiative last week is a dramatic example of how conditions have changed within the last year."
He said Mr. Bush's arms initiative "would have been considered totally irresponsible a year ago" when the five-year budget agreement was reached, and added, "Under those circumstances, it is difficult for me to believe the budget shouldn't be open to some review."
Mr. Foley and other Congressional leaders were briefed on details of the President's Pentagon plan today at a White House meeting with Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
If Mr. Bush opposed setting aside the budget agreement, it would take a majority of both houses to alter it. But in calling for a review of the agreement, Mr. Foley stopped well short of a call for legislative action.
Mr. Bush's initiative has become a factor in talks between House and Senate negotiators who today resumed their efforts to reconcile differences on the $291 billion military budget for the fiscal year that began today. Members of both parties said the initiative strengthened the Democrats' view that even deeper cuts could be made in military spending.
Echoing comments made Sunday by Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the committee, said the Bush plan had "weakened" his bargaining position to preserve funding for the B-2 bomber and the anti-missile defense system known as "Star Wars." The House rejected the B-2 altogether and financed "Star Wars" at lower levels than the Senate.
"At this moment, we're seeing what we can do to reconstruct the Senate position, and hold on as tenaciously as we can to B-2 and 'Star Wars,' " Mr. Warner said.
 
Who Gets the Money?

 Mr. Foley's remarks about the budget agreement reflected a partisan tinge that was elaborated on by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, who also attended the White House session today.
"The President would like to keep the money in Washington," Mr. Gephardt said in an interview. "We would like to see if we can return some of the money to the American people. We're looking at a change in priorities."
Congressional Democrats have tried to steer the White House into a debate over domestic priorities that will help them mount a credible Presidential challenge in 1992. The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, had first urged that the budget agreement be reopened early last month when the Senate returned from its August recess.
Today's statements appeared to be the latest salvo in that battle.
Mr. Foley emphasized that Mr. Bush's plan on military spending had bipartisan support and that there was a tentative understanding that the budget agreement would remain in force at least for the 1992 fiscal year. He said Mr. Bush used the meeting today to issue a "plea" that Congress stay within the confines of his Pentagon spending plan for at least this fiscal year.
Some lawmakers, including Representative Willis D. Gradison Jr. of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, said Mr. Bush was unlikely to agree to any change in the agreement before the 1992 election.
 
Debate on Agreement
 The agreement that Mr. Bush and Congress struck last fall resulted in the first comprehensive deficit-reduction plan in American history. Politicians and economists still disagree over whether the deal was, on balance, good or bad, but nearly all agree that if the agreement is adhered to the deficit will be nearly $500 billion lower by 1996 than it would otherwise be.
Both sides paid a large price. Mr. Bush was forced to renege on his no-new-taxes pledge and found himself portrayed by Democrats as paying more attention to the rich than to ordinary citizens. Democrats gave up for several years what may have been their strongest political suit: the argument that the Government needs to spend more money for health, education and other popular domestic causes and less on the military.
The agreement caps military spending at $291 billion, representing about a 1 percent decline from 1991.
The Senate and the House have several options for altering the budget agreement. In the House, members could try to eliminate the spending caps among categories by shifting priorities within an appropriations bill. Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, tried that last week by suggesting that defense spending be cut by 3 percent and the money diverted to foreign aid and domestic programs. The effort failed in committee.
In the Senate, lawmakers would have to agree to a formal resolution to waive the budget agreement before acting on a bill that contained domestic or Pentagon spending. Senator Tom Harkin, a Democratic Presidential candidate from Iowa, tried that approach last month by proposing to divert $3.1 billion in Pentagon spending to education and health programs contained in an appropriations bill. That too failed.
Democratic conferees on the military spending bill could barely contain their glee today at the sudden turn of events.
"The House is feeling much more empowered on their position of no more B-2's," said Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado.
But other lawmakers and their aides voiced a cautionary note that Congress would not be able to muster the will or the energy to tackle such drastic reductions this year.
"I don't think the impact on the conference will be as great as it will be the longer term," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina.

HEADLINE: How to Avoid Another Bank Bailout

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Don't Deform Bank Reform" (editorial, Sept. 23) cites my core bank proposal as useful, but labels three aspects of it as overreaching:
(1) You criticize the proposal's effort to limit the exposure of the bank insurance fund by limiting coverage to core banks.
Many of the problems plaguing this country's banks have the same root cause as the savings and loan institution crisis -- unlimited access to federally insured "free money." Preventing a repeat of the savings and loan crisis should be the sine qua non of this year's banking bill.
(2) You fault the proposed cap on individual loans because it will not make core banks completely safe.
Of course not. But is that reason to forgo efforts to make them much safer through loan caps and floating interest-rate ceilings? Core banks could still affiliate with uninsured institutions that would be less restricted, provided they raised such funds in the markets and did not use insured Federal dollars.
(3) You express concern that core banks would be vulnerable in the event of a market crisis.
In my proposal, regulators would have the authority (and in practice would exercise it) to waive rate ceilings temporarily in the event of interest rate spikes, regional downturns or other economic crises.
The core bank proposal would compel banks to become healthy and strong by forcing them to go to the markets to raise more of their funds. By contrast, the Administration's insistence on continuing to insure all deposits will only push banks further down the road to another taxpayer bailout.

HEADLINE: Report Card on Educational Goals: At This Rate, the Nation Is Flunking

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
Monday's report card assessing progress toward meeting educational goals for the year 2000 points to an inescapable conclusion: the nation cannot reach these goals at the rate it is now moving.
What to do about that, and whether enough is being done now, are important questions that remain unanswered. The report of the National Education Goals Panel, made public on Monday, offered the first chance to grade three sets of people on their actions so far to improve education -- the President, the governors and the American public. Although the report did not directly evaluate their efforts, the fact that the goals still appear so far out of reach was damning indeed. 
 The education goals, drawn up by President Bush and the nation's governors, include making American children the best in the world in mathematics and science achievement, raising the high school graduation rate to 90 percent, insuring that all children start school healthy enough and intellectually stimulated enough to be "ready to learn," equipping every American adult with work, citizenship and literacy skills, and keeping schools free of drugs and violence.
One reason America's educational woes are so hard to fix is that they are entangled with a number of other enduring problems that the report hinted at, but did not fully address -- family disintegration, racial polarization, poverty and public complacency about educational achievement.
 
Quick Response From Critics
 The report was hardly out before critics rushed to complain of misleading or incomplete data and of a failure to evaluate whether current efforts to reach the goals were sufficient.
Many critics were Democrats eager to challenge Mr. Bush on domestic policy and confident that he is vulnerable on his pledge to be the "education President."
But some educators contend that the compilation of the report is in itself a sign of progress and a ray of hope. The panel's report is different from other gloomy pronouncements, they say, because it offers for the first time a clear set of statistics that will enable the public to track progress toward achieving these goals and may force Americans to confront the dimensions of the problem.
For those looking for guidance on what to do now, Education Secretary Lamar Alexander said the report made it clear that a "quantum leap" is necessary if the goals are to be reached.
"We've got to transform the way our schools are organized and what they're doing, what they're teaching, how teachers are trained, what schools look like and how they're staffed," he said. "We've got to transform the schools and the way we do things outside the schools."
Mr. Bush has offered his answer in the "America 2000" education strategy made public last spring, which calls for national standards, national tests, new kinds of schools and a commitment by every American community to draw up a plan to change schools. But several educators argue that the Bush plan fails to address severe underlying social and racial problems.
"There is no goal that calls for equal education for rich and poor children," said Jonathan Kozol, author of "Savage Inequalities," a recently published book that condemns public schools as segregated and contrasts impoverished city schools with those in affluent suburbs. "No goal breathes a whisper of the abiding American embarrassment of racial segregation. I can't understand why these two matters aren't on the agenda."
Partisan debates are already being joined on how to transform schools and what the Federal Government's role should be. A long section of the report offered one of the most complete breakdowns to date on how much money the Federal Government is spending on efforts to meet the goals. The report offers a total of $59 billion, up by 13 percent after inflation since the President and the governors agreed to set national education goals in 1989.
But several Democrats, including the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said the panel had improperly counted programs like airplane flight training in the Defense Department to artificially swell the total. And a Senate Democratic aide said that the Administration was taking credit for money that had actually been appropriated by Congress.
"The money is going up," the aide said, "but the Administration has no business claiming that it is going up because of them."
One example is Head Start, the preschool program for poor children, which has a demonstrated record of success and bipartisan support since its inception in Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society.
Mr. Bush has pledged to fully finance the program, which now serves only 28 percent of those eligible, according to Congressional estimates. Congress has consistently appropriated more money than the President requested, the Senate aide said, and will do so again this year. Mr. Bush has requested a $100 million increase, to $2.05 billion, and Congress will probably allocate about $2.2 billion.
Several other educators also criticized the report, saying it evaded difficult issues raised by the first national goal -- insuring that children are ready to learn. The report said there was no direct way to measure that, although in supplementary data at the end it pointed to some disturbing statistics about low-birth-weight babies and widespread lack of prenatal care for pregnant women.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, accused the panel of ignoring several concrete recommendations made by its own task force on the first goal, school readiness.
Samuel B. Husk, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, a group representing the major cities' school systems, said: "I think the fact they ducked the first goal is the most telling thing about the report. The most critical data, including low birth weight, is in the back of the book. It's an indication that we have a health system in trouble, and we're not paying attention to that."
Mr. Husk said the nation's major cities spend an additional $205 million a year for special education, teaching children with preventable disabilities.
 
Need for 'Populist Uprising'
 But other educators and business leaders said more money was not the answer. Spending on education has increased by more than one-third after inflation in the past decade, they say, without dramatic progress. Public attitudes, students' study and television-watching habits, and the stakes of school success must change first, they say. This is why the President's education strategy calls for national standards and national tests that would prod students to meet those standards.
"We need a purposeful populist uprising, in the sense that people buy into behavior changes that range from what schools do to what employers do to how people spend their evenings at home," said Chester E. Finn Jr., an architect of the President's education strategy. "
There is ample evidence that Americans so far have failed to grasp that their schools and their children are the ones in trouble. A Harris Poll released the other day by the National Education Goals Panel and the Business Roundtable, a group of corporate leaders, found that parents and students think they are doing fine, but employers and college and vocational-school educators think they are not.
"I don't think we're there yet in terms of a national political will to do the things we need to do to reach these goals," said William H. Kolberg, president of the National Alliance of Business, a business consortium.

HEADLINE: Forget the Dress, the Flowers, Mendelssohn. Just Run Away!

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
SHORTLY after her engagement last year, Letechia Shevik was overwhelmed by a feeling familiar to many brides-to-be.
Terror.
"I just couldn't handle it," said Mrs. Shevik, who is 29 years old, lives near Chicago in Buffalo Grove, Ill., and works as an administrative assistant at Clairol Inc. "All that stress, the planning, the walking up the aisle, turning around and seeing everyone looking at me. 
 "People I know who got married usually say that if they could do it over again, they would have eloped. So, that's what we did."
To many Americans, the notion of eloping may sound anachronistic if not mythical, a vestige of a romantic time when impetuous Romeos climbed ladders to bedroom windows and stealthily swept away their beloveds for impromptu private weddings, sometimes in another state. Never mind that the deed was probably inspired by a premature pregnancy, parental disapproval or an under-age bride.
Nowadays, thanks to a rising number of older brides and grooms, a spate of second marriages, a steady stream of immigration-related "green card" weddings and the new 1990's cheap-is-chic ethos, elopements of one sort or another are almost as common as the traditional ceremonies in churches and banquet halls. Indeed, for many contemporary couples, one of the first lines they might hear at their wedding service would come not from a minister ("Dearly beloved, we are gathered here. . . .") but from a city clerk ("Next in line, please. Hablas Ingles?")
Even Martha Stewart, the high priestess of home entertaining whose many life-style bibles include "Martha Stewart: Weddings" (Potter, 1987) has noticed the trend away from giving a $50,000 celebration, which is how much an average ceremony and reception for 200 costs in Manhattan. "Instead of paying runaway prices," she said, "people are running away."
Of course, nuptial purists may quibble about the word "elopement," which is derived from the word "lope," as in loping away. They would never use the word for small civil ceremonies or jaunts to exotic locales that are designed merely to merge the wedding into the honeymoon. To elope, they argue, the service must be shrouded in secrecy and scandal. "I can't recall the last time I heard someone say 'elope,' " said Cele Lalli, the editor in chief of Modern Bride magazine.
Others believe that it is only the term, not the activity, that has fallen out of favor. "I don't think people call it eloping anymore, but what else would you call it when someone pulls up and gets married in the back seat of their limousine, or someone flies in from Los Angeles and then turns around and flies back?" said Charlotte Richards, a minister who owns four Las Vegas wedding chapels, including the famous Little White Chapel, which features a drive-in window.
"Just yesterday I had 20 people who came in and said they came to Las Vegas to get married and didn't want the big wedding," added Ms. Richards, who is often referred to as the Wedding Queen of the West because, she says, she has performed more than 500,000 weddings in the last 30 years. "I'd call that eloping."
Statistics on the subject are as elusive as the perfect spouse. Figures from the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsviile, Md., however, suggest that a growing number of couples are abandoning the concept of formal weddings in favor of what, loosely speaking, would be considered an elopement.
For example, from 1973 to 1988, the number of weddings held in states where neither the bride nor the groom resided increased by 4 percent in the 41 states from which the center obtains such records. Moreover, in the same period the mean age of bridegrooms has risen to 31.3 years from 28.8 years, and for brides to 28.2 years from 25.5. This, in all likelihood, raises the chances that the parents of the bride will decline to pick up the wedding tab. For couples still struggling with their finances, the specter of paying for their own wedding can be an amazing incentive for an elopement.
If more proof were needed, there are roughly 2.4 million marriages performed each year in the United States and in 1988, 46 percent involved either the bride or the groom remarrying; in 1973, the figure was 35 percent. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, anyone remarrying is much more likely to have a civil rather than a religious ceremony. Indeed, the percentage of civil ceremonies rose to 31 percent in 1988 from 26 percent in 1973.
Sociologists like Andrew Cherlin at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore say that a decline in religious ceremonies among people who are remarrying might be attributed to the bride and groom having less in common with each other than they would if they were marrying for the first time. "A lower percentage have the same religion, education or are the same ages," he said.
Ms. Lalli said that the growing diversity in American culture probably increased the pressure to elope, especially when people from different ethnic groups or economic classes were marrying. "When you try to put a symbolic rite of passage together and you can't because the backgrounds are so dissimilar, one of the solutions is to have a private, simple ceremony," she said.
A no-wait, no-witness, one-minute wonder performed by a civil servant seldom matches the extravaganzas of the blessed affairs depicted in newspaper society pages or in bridal magazines. Sometimes the brides approach the altar in business suits, blouses or blue jeans instead of gowns, and sometimes the grooms wear ancient blue blazers, leather jackets or sweatshirts instead of morning coats. Sometimes, the couple doesn't even verbalize a vow of love and commitment. In some quickie states, like Maine, saying "I do" or "I will" isn't required, making the ceremony even less interactive than registering to vote, which at least demands that one hand be raised.
And for those who are eloping to satisfy immigration officials, the ceremony can be even less romantic. The marriage clerk at the New York City marriage chapel in the Municipal Building, Laurence A. Israel, estimated that 30 to 50 percent of the ceremonies performed there (60,700 in 1980, 71,000 in 1990) are designed solely to obtain a green card.
How can he tell? "They don't have a ring; they don't kiss; sometimes they don't even speak the same language," Mr. Israel said, noting that he can perform a ceremony in 16 languages.
Mr. Israel said that the resurgence in elopements is obvious in his chapel, where the ceremony costs $25, in addition to the $30 fee for a marriage license. "A lot more are coming in not just for the license but the ceremony, too," he said. "They're coming in and after the ceremony saying, 'Now, don't you tell anyone.' "
Of course, not all the weddings performed in city clerks' offices are conducted to appease the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Tight budgets are another popular reason. "If I had the money for a big wedding, I wouldn't be here," said Luis Ramos, 33, an unemployed postal worker from Staten Island who last week married Lourdes LeBron, 23, in a ceremony performed by Mr. Israel. "But we're planning on having a big party sometime later on."
Denise Shaw, a graphics artist from Manhattan, said she married Espen Fjermeros, a computer salesman from Norway, in New York's marriage chapel because she had been married previously. She also was turned-off by the "money-making aspect" of a large ceremony, saying, "I prefer not to have a big wedding."
Then there are couples like Ms. Shevik and her husband, Gary, who eloped last December to Cancun, Mexico, not only because of stress over the ceremony but because of the bride's aversion to her hometown. "I've lived in a lot of neat places -- San Francisco, Atlanta, Greenwich, Connecticut," she said. "I don't want to get married in Rockford, Illinois. Why get married in a boring little town?"
The Sheviks even found a service, Far Away Weddings of Dallas (800-882-9337), that arranges elopements. "My clients want a memorable and romantic wedding experience without the complications involved in planning a traditional wedding," said the director of the four-year-old company, Pamela Robinson. "Mexico, the Caribbean and Hawaii are popular, as are places in Europe."
Elopements do raise a new set of questions about etiquette. What about presents? (Couples should still expect them, along with gracious notes of congratulation, said Letitia Baldrige, the author of "Letitia Baldrige's Complete Guide to the New Manners of the 90's," published by Rawson) Announcements? (Ms. Baldrige suggests handwritten letters to family and friends.) Are apologies ever called for? (Yes, if the couple elopes after either family has been preparing for a large wedding.) Who gives the party afterward? (Preferably, the family and friends of the couple, but the bride and groom may do it themselves.)
For engaged couples considering elopement, Ms. Lalli added a cautionary note. She said that one of the most requested ceremonies these days is the reaffirmation, whereby married couples spend a great deal of time and money giving a highly ritualized mock wedding, replete with bells, gowns and lavish receptions. A sizable percentage of those couples, she said, eloped the first time around.
"They say that they wished they hadn't," Ms. Lalli said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene: No-Fault Rises From the Ashes

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE high price of auto insurance got you down? Join the throng. Premiums rose at three times the rate of inflation in the 1980's. And in many states -- most recently, New Jersey -- politicians and voters have declared war on insurers, demanding that they charge less than the market will bear.
 Squeezing the insurers might work, argues Jeffrey O'Connell, a University of Virginia law professor and an early champion of "no fault" insurance. But not for long. The right point of attack on insurance inflation, Professor O'Connell says, is its bloated underbelly -- the 13 cents of every insurance dollar spent fighting over legal liability in accidents, along with the 23 cents awarded a tiny minority of victims for pain and suffering. 
His latest fix is a variation on no-fault insurance, which has generated disappointingly modest savings in the past. But the O'Connell plan offers a distinction with a big difference -- one that could cut average premiums by a whopping 30 percent, yet preserve the rights of those determined to have their day in court.
 The prime reason auto insurance is expensive is that accidents are expensive. "Cars cost a lot of money to repair," Professor O'Connell points out, "and so do humans."
 Fiercer regulation might force the most torpid insurers to trim costs and the most efficient to settle for smaller profits. But there simply is not enough fat in auto insurance, he says, to pacify long-suffering policyholders: According to a 1990 study by McKinsey & Company in San Francisco, increases in insurers' administrative costs and insurers' earnings have actually trailed inflation. The practical alternative, Professor O'Connell argues, is to allow drivers to protect their incomes and property without relying on the hit-and-miss justice of the tort liability system.
 That is what no-fault has always been about: accident victims are compensated for tangible losses without regard to fault, and can go to court for more only if they pass a threshold of severe injury. But Professor O'Connell notes that no-fault has not fully delivered on its promise to save money because the barriers to suits can still be breached by determined plaintiffs. And once breached, the rewards of going to court can be very, very large.
 Under the system proposed by Professor O'Connell, drivers would have the choice of sticking with liability insurance-as-usual. But they could opt for much cheaper no-fault policies. These would guarantee compensation for economic losses up to the limits of the coverage, while eliminating the biggest bonbon in the trial lawyers' candy box, the right to collect for pain and suffering.
 In any accident that involved at least one driver with old-style insurance, the old liability rules would apply. Where both parties carried no-fault, however, they would make claims against their own insurance carriers for medical bills, damaged property and lost wages. Victims would still be able to sue for economic losses -- but only losses beyond the limits of their own policies.
 If, as Professor O'Connell expects, 90 percent of drivers choose the no-fault option, the savings on bare-bones coverage would range from an estimated 56 percent in Arizona to a spectacular 70 percent in Chicago. Even drivers who choose to sheath themselves in hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of no-fault protection could expect to save 30 percent.
 Who could object to a reform that simply gave drivers the chance to waive their rights to sue for intangible losses? Start with trial lawyers. Some no-fault cases would still get to court, as victims sought compensation beyond their coverage limits. But with pain and suffering out of the picture, multimillion-dollar paydays would be only a memory for the trial bar.
 Then there are consumer lobbies. Some consumer groups do support no-fault -- in California, they stand behind a tough no-fault reform initiative. But Ralph Nader, the godfather of consumerism, wants no part of any change giving drivers a financial incentive to limit their rights in court.
 The one state effort to get voters to approve an O'Connell-style no-fault system went down in flames last year in Arizona. Professor O'Connell says the best hope for giving drivers a choice lies in Washington, where trial lawyers have less influence and politicians are searching for ways to please Joe and Josie Sixpack without raising their taxes.
 Conservatives are leery of Federal legislation requiring states to do anything in particular about auto insurance. But a law that merely insisted that drivers be given a choice ought to be more palatable -- and would certainly mesh with the Bush Administration's drive to streamline liability laws.

Aid to developing countries from major industrial nations rose by $7.4 billion last year. But as a share of economic output, the level of assistance was no higher than in the late 1970's, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today. Aid rose to $54.1 billion, from $46.7 billion in 1989. The United States regained its position as the largest single donor, with $11.37 billion, followed by France and Japan.

Mercedes Sales Outlook

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Mich., Oct. 2

 BODY:
The chief of Daimler-Benz A.G.'s American automotive unit expects 1992 sales of the Mercedes in the United States to increase by more than 6 percent, to at least 69,000. Erich Crampe, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., said 1991's sales of 65,000 cars will be down about 16.6 percent from 1990 sales of about 78,000. He attributed the decline to the sluggish economy, competition from Japanese luxury cars and the United States luxury tax, which reduced the company's 1991 sales by about 3,500 cars.

Tucson Electric Seeks Lower Rate

 BODY:
The Tucson Electric Power Company, one of Arizona's primary utilities, has hired Bear, Stearns & Company to advise it on ways to lower the high interest rate on $117.5 million of Pima County industrial-development revenue bonds.
Called periodic auction reset securities, the bonds are repriced through Dutch auctions every 28 to 35 days. The bonds now carry an interest rate of 12.58 percent. 
 The bonds bear triple-A ratings from Moody's and Standard & Poor's because they are backed by a surety bond granted by Financial Security Assurance, a unit of U S West Inc., the telephone company.
"The recent auctions have failed, unfortunately, despite the good credit rating and the surety bond backing the bonds," Joseph S. Fichera, a managing director of Bear, Stearns, said on Tuesday. He said the auctions have failed since mid-1990, before which the bonds traded to yield about 8 percent.
Interest is current and being paid by the guarantor. But the high rates have reflected the troubles of Tucson Electric, which faces an involuntary bankruptcy petition.
Under rules of Dutch auctions, the rate is automatically set at a high level as a result of a failed auction. The failure of the auctions has meant that some owners of the bonds who wished to sell them at face value were unable to do so.
The advice that Bear, Stearns might give, according to Tucson Electric, could include converting the interest rate on the bonds from a floating to a fixed rate and then remarketing them. Mr. Fichera said he expected the new rate to be substantially below 12.5 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Quiet Trading; Gold Advances Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined in quiet dealings on world currency markets yesterday.
Gold prices advanced worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $355.60 a troy ounce, up $1.40. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $1 an ounce, to a late bid price of $355. 
 The dollar sold off in foreign markets overnight and opened on a soft note in domestic trading. But a Government report showed new-home sales jumped 6.7 percent in August and the larger-than-expected rise set off a technical rally.
"It caused a few people to hold back from selling the dollar further," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. The market had been anticipating a gain of about 1 percent in home sales, he noted.
Still, the dollar settled lower for the day. Trading was quiet over all as it has been all week as dealers await the Labor Department's report tomorrow on employment in September.
"People think this may be the straw that breaks the camel's back in terms of the Federal Reserve having to ease monetary policy," Mr. Donney said. Many market watchers believe weak employment data will prompt the Fed, which trimmed interest rates as recently as Sept. 13, in a bid to stimulate the economy, to lower them further, a move generally bearish for the dollar.
Until the report is released, however, most investors are expected to remain on the sidelines, Mr. Donney said.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.07 yen, to a closing 133.11 Japanese yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 132.55 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 132.60 yen, down from 133.40 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7519, from $1.7485 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.7497 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.7465.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6660 German marks, down from 1.6685; 1.4565 Swiss francs, up from 1.4550; 5.6765 French francs, down from 5.6845; 1,246.00 Italian lire, down from 1,247.75, and 1.1308 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1314.

Tax-Free Fund Yields Up; Taxables Down

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields of tax-free and taxable money market funds continued to move in opposite directions for the week ended yesterday, with tax-free yields moving up and the yields on taxables heading down.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, which monitors the funds and issues the Money Fund Report, said that "the prices of tax exempts are coming down and yields are going up." 
 "There is a shift of money from the short-term money funds into longer- term municipal bond funds," he said, "and the effect has been to drive down prices of the short end of the tax-exempt market and to strengthen prices of longer-term municipal funds."
 
Tax-Exempt Yield: 4.49%
 Mr. Frank said total assets of tax-exempt funds dropped again, by a more substantial amount this time, down by $779 million following a drop the previous week of $308 million. Total assets now are $86.3 billion, and portfolio holdings of the funds averaged 59 days, compared with 60 days a week earlier.
The seven-day compounded average yield for the tax exempts rose to 4.49 percent, up from 4.43 percent a week ago, while the simple yield rose to 4.39 percent from 4.33 percent. Both increases were 6 basis points; a basis point is one hundredth of 1 percent.
Yields for the 30-day period were also up 6 basis points: to 4.34 percent, from 4.28 percent for the compound yield, and to 4.25 percent, from 4.19 percent for the simple yield.
The highest-yielding fund among those with assets over $100 million continued to be the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, with a 7-day compound yield of 5.37 percent, up from 5.32 percent.
 
State Fund Leaders
 Among funds investing in individual states, in New York State the Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market fund continued to head the list, with a 7-day compound yield of 5.05 percent, up from 4.98 percent.
In Connecticut, the Prudential Connecticut Municipal Money Market Series again led with a 5.32 yield, up from 4.76 percent in terms of the 7-day compound yield -- an increase of 44 basis points, largely because of capital gains.
In New Jersey, the leader again was Calvert N.J. Tax-Free Reserves, reporting a 7-day compound yield of 5.16 percent, up from 5.00 percent a week earlier.
 
Taxable Yield Dips to 5.29%
 Among the taxable funds, Mr. Frank said, the average 7-day compound yield dropped to 5.29 percent from 5.31 percent, and the simple yield was 5.16 percent, down from 5.18 percent.
The 30-day compound yield dropped to 5.35 for taxable funds, down from 5.38 percent, and the 30-day simple yield was down to 5.21 percent from 5.24 percent.
Assets of taxable funds declined by $4.1 billion, a much larger drop than the $900 million last week. Assets now total $452.0 billion. Institutional investors accounted for $1.3 billion of the decline, which Mr. Frank described as "an accelerated continuation of the swing from money funds to bond funds."
Average maturities of portfolio holdings of the taxable funds moved up by a day to 61.
The taxable fund with the best return was the Value Line Cash Fund, with a 7-day compound yield of 6.49 percent, helped by a year-end distribution.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, a main competitor of money funds, dropped from 5.06 percent to 5.02 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

Prices of Treasury Issues Drop

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell in a quiet session yesterday, weighed down by a Government report showing a surprising jump in home sales in August, an indication that the real estate sector is picking up.
But the downward move was tempered by anxiety about the key unemployment report due tomorrow, which will provide the first official look at the economy's performance in September. Economists have said that if the jobs report is especially weak, the Federal Reserve could be prompted to cut interest rates to spur the recovery. The August unemployment rate was 6.8 percent.
 
Waiting for Numbers
 "Everybody is waiting for the jobs numbers Friday, which may or may not give the Fed an excuse to ease," said Jay Goldinger, a fixed-income specialist at Capital Insight, a Beverly Hills, Calif., investment firm. 
 The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32, or $3.75 for $1,000 face amount, to 103 14/32, raising the yield to 7.82 percent, from 7.79 percent Tuesday.
In the corporate sector, new-issue activity picked up as corporate treasurers scrambled to lock in low rates before tomorrow's employment numbers.
There were five major new deals for a total of $950 million from good- quality debtors. The new-issue activity was led by the triple-A-rated Pfizer Inc., which set a $250 million five-year senior note deal at a yield of 7.18 percent.
The Treasury market began the day on a weak note after the Commerce Department reported new-home sales shot up an unexpected 6.7 percent in August -- the strongest sales pace in more than a year. Economists said lower mortgage rates spurred home-buying interest.
Most credit-market participatns had expected a small decline. But economists said that the housing industry was one of the two strongest sectors of an economy struggling to recover after a yearlong recession. Manufacturing is the other.
 
Report on Greenspan Views
 The market was also weighed down by a report late Tuesday by a Washington consulting firm, Johnson Smick International, which said that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, was cautious about easing interest rates.
The report said Mr. Greenspan's stance contrasted with other Fed policy makers, who favored a more aggressive effort to force down rates.
Recent Government reports have shown the economy to be on an uneven rebound, hampered by consumer caution in spending because of worry about the job outlook.
The most recent survey of consumer views, a private report by the University of Michigan, showed consumers grew slightly more optimistic about the state of the economy in September.
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 83 in September from 82 in August, market sources who saw the report said yesterday. The figure compares with a base of 100 in 1966.
But Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University, said: "I think the consumer is very nervous right now. They're not sure the economy's improving."
That appeared to be the prevailing view in the bond market, where traders were optimistic about further price gains and lower interest rates ahead.
"The market retains the view that the economy remains weak and further easing in monetary policy is likely," said Henry Engler, an economist at the Chemical Bank.
Traders said that the Treasury's announcement of a $9.25 billion seven-year note auction, for next Wednesday, helped encourage switching out of the 8 1/4 percent note outstanding. That note closed down 6/ 32 lower at 105 6/32, yielding 7.27 percent.
Among other issues, the three-month Treasury bill ended at 5.09 percent, and the six-month bill at 5.15 percent. The two-year note yielded 6.01 percent and the 10-year note fell 8/32, to 102 24/32, yielding 7.48 percent.

New-home sales surged 6.7 percent in August to their highest level in a year, according to a Government report today that showed the housing recovery apparently back on track after a brief retreat.
Most analysts said home buyers took advantage of falling mortgage rates to re-enter the market. The renewed sales, the analysts contended, should create more housing starts and permit the industry to continue its traditional role of helping to lead the economy out of recession. 
 All regions increased sales except for the West, where home sales were flat. Sales in the Northeast, which had jumped in July, slowed, while sales in the Midwest, which had plunged in July, rebounded strongly and more than made up their loss.
 
July Rate Revised
 Nationally, sales of new single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 540,000, up from a revised 506,000 rate a month earlier, according to the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development. The August increase was larger than many analysts had expected.
The department originally estimated July sales to have fallen 8.5 percent but changed that to a 2.7 percent drop in today's report. At the same time, they lowered June's initial 4 percent advance to a 2.6 percent gain.
The July decline was the first since sales fell to a 414,000 rate last January, the trough of the housing recession. The August rebound raised the rate to the highest level since a 541,000 sales pace in July 1990.
"Quite clearly, mortgage rates continued to decline in August and that brought buyers off the sidelines and back into the market," said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association.
Interest on 30-year, fixed-rate conventional mortgages has continued to fall, averaging 8.92 percent during the week ended last Friday. That was the lowest level in 14 years, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
But despite the favorable mortgage rates, most analysts agreed the housing recovery would remain moderate.
Thomas Holloway, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, said sales would be restrained by "sluggish economic growth and thus sluggish employment growth, and problems with consumer confidence."
David F. Seiders, economist at the National Association of Home Builders, agreed. He is forecasting new-home sales to total just 500,000 this year, down from 534,000 last year and the lowest since 412,000 in the recession year of 1982.
The sales pace for the first eight months of 1991 was 10.1 percent below that of the corresponding period last year.
The Government report said a seasonally adjusted 290,000 new homes were on the market at the end of August, representing a supply of 6.6 months at the current sales rate. That was down from 9.3-month supply in January and the lowest since a similar supply in November 1989.
 
Expecting New Construction
 Analysts said the lean inventory should spur new construction -- if builders obtain financing in a market dominated by restrictive lending practices.
If not, Mr. Seiders warned, inventories will be drawn down even more, resulting in "strong increases" in prices. The median price of a new home was $122,000, up from $120,200 in July. The median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
Regionally, sales soared 24.7 percent in the Midwest, to a 101,000 annual rate, and wiped out the 15.6 percent drop a month earlier. Mr. Holloway said the July decline was a "statistical anomaly that was washed out" in the August report.
In the South, sales rose 5.7 percent, to a 221,000 rate, after falling 1.4 percent in July. Mr. Seiders said the pace was led by sales in the Southwest.
The Northeast posted a 3 percent gain, to a 69,000 rate, slowing from a 13.6 percent advance the previous month. It is another sign "the market there has truly bottomed out," Mr. Seiders said.
But sales were unchanged at a 149,000 rate in the West after falling 2 percent in July. Mr. Seiders said the region was the "last part of the country to weaken" during the slump and "still has a bit of healing to do."

HEADLINE: American Express Sets Reserve for Card Losses

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
With many of its once-affluent customers driven into bankruptcy by the recession, the American Express Company yesterday took its most striking action to date to protect its business from a ballooning number of defaults on its credit cards.
The company said it was setting aside $265 million for the expected defaults and to pay for a reorganization of its flagship charge-card business, including the loss of 1,700 jobs. 
 The move principally reflects major problems with the company's four-year-old Optima credit-card program, which has encountered an unexpectedly large number of delinquencies among its well-to-do clientele. Unlike the company's core business in charge cards, whose balances must be paid monthly, the Optima card, like Visa and Mastercard, extends credit in exchange for a fee and a finance charge.
 
Travel Unit's First Loss Ever
 The $265 million in expenses and expected defaults will yield the first loss ever for the company's Travel Related Services division, which has long been the money machine for the entire company. American Express estimated that the division would post a third-quarter loss of $50 million to $75 million, but made no estimate on the company's overall earnings.
The pressures on American Express, long a dominant force in the financial services industry, stem from a tide of consumer defaults on personal credit lines and underscores the harsh impact the recession has had on the white-collar workers who make up the backbone of the company's credit-card business.
Company officials said the troubles also reflect the frustration of dealing in the credit business in an era when racking up unpayable debts has become increasingly common.
"Societal factors are now making bankruptcy more acceptable, with some raising bankruptcy to a fine art," said Harvey Golub, the company's vice chairman.
But American Express officials also conceded that their strategy for the credit-card business was flawed. "We haven't very successfully run a revolving-credit business," said James D. Robinson 3d, chairman and chief executive.
With credit tight throughout the economy, American Express said it would shift its strategy in the business by increasing its requirements needed to qualify for credit. The company also plans to provide incentives to reward borrowers who consistently repay their debts.
By tightening its credit standards, American Express is signaling its bearish outlook on the economy. "We are not very optimistic about the likelihood of an economic recovery in the near future," Mr. Golub said.
Analysts said the problems at American Express stem in part from its own rapid growth. "This has been a very well-run company, but the entropy has finally caught up with them," said John Keefe, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Securities. "The company got to be too big to avoid economic cycles, and now they are in the soup with the rest of us."
But analysts also praised the reorganization plan, saying it would help strengthen the company's primary business. Indeed, American Express said it expected to save $100 million a year from the reorganization and that it planned to plow that money back into the Travel Related Services division, with programs to ease relations with merchants and entice customers into using the charge card more.
 
Costs Relatively Low
 Even with the waves of defaults, analysts say that Optima, which was introduced in 1987, has still been a net money winner for the company. "Their costs of operation were relatively low," Mr. Keefe of Lipper said. "This has actually been a fairly economical investment for them."
American Express hoped to make money from the Optima card from the combination of fees and monthly charges for credit balances. But the plan became too much of a good thing for consumers, as the balances grew and delinquencies rose, eroding the company's profits.
The ailments in the Optima card operation have not spread significantly to the company's charge card lines -- its green American Express card or its Gold or Platinum cards. Those card holders are a much more diversified group than the Optima holders, who are concentrated on the East and West Coasts, where the recession has hit particularly hard.
To put itself on a stronger financial footing, American Express is cutting the costs of its entire card and travel business, by shutting down some operations and trimming its work force. About 1,700 of American Express's employees, or 3 percent of the work force, will lose their jobs, with about 1,500 of those in the New York area.
The shutdowns, severance for the layoffs and expenses for other aspects of the reorganization will cost American Express $110 million.
American Express said that losses from bad credit, most of which was extended through the Optima card, will cost it $155 million more than it had anticipated. Also included in that amount is $24 million of write-offs from defaults by customers that were not properly reported by American Express for three quarters because of accounting problems.
The accounting errors resulted in some incorrect documents being filed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by the company's Centurion Bank, which issues the card. The company has contacted Government officials to inform them that corrected records will be submitted.
 
Signs of Troubles
 After decades of growth, the first sign of the severe troubles at American Express came in the first quarter of this year, when the company set aside $50 million to cover bad loans through the Optima card and other credit programs.
Those losses came as American Express was challenged in its bread-and-butter charge-card business by upstart rivals including A.T.& T. and Sears, Roebuck & Company, as well as traditional competitors like banks.
Even as it began to hurt from the increasing competition, the company's pursuit of a wealthier clientele was proving to be a problem, as the recession produced more and more layoffs among well-paid white-collar workers.
With troubles in its credit business, American Express plans to refocus its business around its premier product, the charge card.
The results of the restructuring will include the abandonment of some of its roots. For example, the company will close a regional operating center in New York City, which was the first major charge-card operations center of American Express.
In a memorandum to employees yesterday, Mr. Golub said the company decided to close the center because the cost of upgrading it was much larger than shifting business to other, larger offices.
 
Closing Merchandise Center
 The company will also close a merchandise center in Great Neck, L.I. The center is used for operations connected to the American Express card in which customers can order merchandise through the company.
About 240 employees in the New York area will be transferred to other posts in New York. Those not transferred will be relocated or given severance payments and help in finding another job, Mr. Golub said in the memo.
American Express said the the $100 million it expects to save from the reorganization will be used for several programs related to its card business, like enhancing the relationships between American Express and service establishments, like restaurants. Those relationships have been badly strained over the last year as a number of restaurants protested the comparatively high fee the company charges them for accepting the card.
American Express has already introduced some programs for the benefit of clients like restaurants, partly in response to the protests. In one program, American Express will give fee discounts to merchants who use electronic data systems for charge cards. Such systems send information about a transaction to American Express electronically, eliminating the need for paper slips.
American Express said it would also use the money saved in the reorganization to increase the number of services provided to card members, and to focus more resources on frequent travelers.

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Excerpts From Senate Hearing on Nomination of C.I.A. Chief

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's hearing on the nomination of Robert M. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, as transcribed by the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service. Among the Senators on the panel were David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma; Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire; John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island; John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, and Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona. Among the witnesses were Jennifer L. Glaudemans, former Central Intelligence Agency analyst, and Douglas MacEachin, Chief of the Arms Control Intelligence Staff for the C.I.A., who both gave opening statements today, and  Harold P. Ford, a former member of National Intelligence Council who is now a C.I.A. contract employee, and Melvin A. Goodman, a former C.I.A analyst, who both gave opening statements on Tuesday. 
 
COMMENTS BY SENATOR BOREN
 The American people, in many ways, are getting their first real glimpse into the intelligence community through these hearings. They're seeing, perhaps in a more detailed way, how the intelligence community really operates than they've ever seen before. They've learned about the fact that, in many ways, the C.I.A. is not one agency, but two -- that there's a very distinct difference between the operations side of the agency and the intelligence analysis side of the agency. 
 They've learned that even within the analysis side of the agency, there are various bodies that form -- come together to form intelligence analysis, that come to the decision makers.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
STATEMENT BY MS. GLAUDEMANS
 . . . I take no satisfaction in sharing with you the basis of my conviction that Mr. Gates politicized intelligence analysis and is responsible for an overall degradation of the analytical process. During the period when American policy makers deserved and demanded unbiased, objective analysis about Soviet foreign policy in the third world, I believe that they instead at times received distorted studies. Tragically, these slanted studies became the foundation upon which the executive and legislative branches of our Government deliberated momentous foreign policy decisions.
Unfortunately for the C.I.A., another result has been the continued exodus of many good Sovietologists and the loss of an esprit de corps that can only exist in an atmosphere and a culture devoted to the highest standards of excellence.
Let me be clear. I am here today at your request. As you may know, I walked away from this mess nearly two years ago. I find the re-examination of old scars and the publicity surrounding this hearing personally difficult. Until several weeks ago, I had expected that someone else would be testifying in this seat instead of myself . . . I did not wish to bad-mouth the agency in general. There are still too many people working there whom I respect. In fact, I take great comfort in the offers of support I have received from a number of analysts, young and some not so young, still working in the C.I.A. who did not feel that they are at liberty to come before you to speak publicly but did not welcome the prospect of Mr. Gates returning to the C.I.A.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Much of what I describe . . . resulted as much from careless and perhaps deliberate inattention to the maintenance of a culture devoted to truth as it did from a calculated effort to advance the views known to be consistent with the preconceptions of senior policy makers. . . . One cannot be seen as any less troubling than the other. Together, they continue to contribute to the culture of fear and cynicism among frontline analysts. Solving one without the other solves nothing.
There was, and apparently still is, an atmosphere of intimidation within the Office of Soviet Analysis. Many, including myself, hold the view that Mr. Gates had certain people removed because of their consistent unwillingness to comply with his analytical line. Even today, I am aware of a perception in SOVA that managers could risk their positions if they are not sufficiently pliant. There were times when insufficient evidence was irrelevant as long as the judgment was consistent with what Mr. Gates wanted . . .
In the analyst training courses, the C.I.A. taught me that my responsibilities were to be independent. I was taught that there's a tremendous responsibility in weighing evidence and that I had a duty to have a very good working relationship with my collective counterparts so that I could inform them of my intelligence gaps and seek to get what I needed. I also was taught that I had a duty to state that I didn't know certain things in my research. I was taught that intelligence scenarios were meant to explain inconsistencies in evidence or uncertainties because of a gap of evidence.
We were first told in late May 1987, after Mr. Goodman was removed from his office, that the way we did analysis was going to have to change, that the way we packaged and presented our message had to change. We were also subsequently told in a formal memorandum to the Third World Division in May of 1986 that the way we presented our analysis had to change. I was specifically told -- and it also came out in conversations and discussions -- that we were supposed to just describe evidence, that we were not to come to a conclusion, that we were to leave our analysis open-ended so that readers could come to a conclusion themselves.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I heard terms such as "soft on the Soviets" and "Soviet apologist" thrown in certain people's direction. And in the environment such as the C.I.A.'s, where employees must pass a polygraph question about their loyalty to the United States, that can be an extremely inhibiting managerial tool . . .
Because he was so public in his views, I believe Mr. Gates had a special obligation to uphold and protect the independence of C.I.A.'s analysis. His objectivity never came through. Moreover, I believe he had an obligation to clearly distinguish what were his personal views from what were C.I.A. or intelligence community views . . .
When I resigned I told my branch chief, my division chief, my group chief and the deputy office director of SOVA why I was leaving. The only answer I have heard to this perception problem was from Mr. Gates himself a few days ago to this committee. He said that when he was a junior analyst, and his views were not accepted, that he too thought this was politicization.
Senators, I think that answer is the most smug, condescending, and callous answer to such a sensitive question I could possibly imagine. And I believe it offers an insight into Mr. Gates's managerial style. I shudder to think what he might do if he is confirmed as D.C.I. and he gets his hands on those SOVA MAG [Management Advisory Group] reports that you now possess.
I know that as a former employee of the C.I.A., who left at the GS-13 level, I am irrelevant. To the C.I.A. and to its future. But on behalf of those analysts with views that are reflected in the MAG reports you now have, and whose views are reflected in the Memorandums for the Record that your committee staff has compiled, I ask you not to give them the back of your hand. Even if you conclude that the basis for their perceptions -- that analysis has been politicization -- are unfounded, please take care to see that this perception is alleviated in a manner that also sends a clear, loud, and strong signal as to what the analysts' mission really is.
I believe those people deserve a better answer than the one they have been given by Mr. Gates thus far.
 
STATEMENT BY MR. MacEACHIN
 This is very awkward appearance for me. I've tried to be a little light here to start off, but I have to tell you that this is, without question, the worst day or the worst couple days in a 26-year career, for reasons I'll describe. It's also very awkward for me to be here today. I am absolutely, clearly in a no-win position. If Mr. Gates is confirmed he will be my direct supervisor . . . Anything I say in his favor will be viewed by some as statements of a bureaucrat taking care of his career. Anything I might say which is not viewed as favorable will be seen by others as taking care of my career in yet another way.
All I have to hold on to, Mr. Chairman, and I hope at least to have some of it left, is -- after this hearing -- is the credibility I think I've demonstrated over some 26 years as being willing to challenge the conventional view and take whatever flak comes with it. I've made many mistakes in this process: mistakes of substance, mistakes of process. And I paid my share of the bureaucratic penalties for doing so . . .
And I sincerely hope, Mr. Chairman, that the committee does probe into the specific evidence behind all of the assertions that have been made here. Because listening to these proceedings I've been struck by how much they reflect the same approaches and contests and clashes of egos that I have listened to for now more than 26 years. The same characteristics are all there: an emphasis on pieces of evidence that support one case; I think rather careless sourcing; position advocacy rather than balanced assessments. It's going to be left to the committee to sort this out and be the honest brokers.

 	 	 		. . .	 	It is a simple fact that should not have to be recorded that for a large part of the major intelligence issues, the information from which the judgments must be drawn does not permit unambiguous conclusion. Far more often than we'd like, the evidence is quite legitimately subject to different interpretations. . . .
A second fundamental point I'd like to emphasize -- and one that I think should be equally obvious, but I find myself continually repeating it, including in testimony before this committee earlier -- is that the audience for the intelligence product is a very, very tough audience.
It includes senior officials of the executive department and members of Congress and outside experts. And if an intelligence product offers a judgment contrary to a particular policy view, whether a policy which is currently in effect or a policy which is being advocated by someone, it will be challenged, and it will be challenged by people of consequence, who have access to a wide spectrum of views and expertise. . . .
Mr. Chairman, I am going to digress and give you an example. Last Friday, at a meeting one of my staff was attending, at a policy agency . . . agency meeting, a paper which had been published about a week earlier, a paper with which, frankly, I had problems, not because of the bottom line, I had problems with the paper because I thought it didn't offer anything new and didn't really get at the question that was asked, nonetheless, this paper was pointed out to my colleague as being "unhelpful right now," it's unhelpful while we are trying to persuade so-and-so -- I had better not go any further than that. And all we could think of that night is, isn't anybody paying attention to what's going on? . . .
One thing I have a hard time figuring out, Mr. Chairman, is why there are people who find it remarkable that when you go to your boss with a judgment that contradicts the boss's view or which gets your boss crossways with his boss, that you really have to have your act together. It just doesn't surprise me . . .

 	 	 		. . .	 	But the charge of politicization -- as I said, my original studies were in economics and literature, so if I resort to literary examples, excuse me -- but it's right straight out of Franz Kafka, because once you are accused, the Inspector General will never come back and say, "You're absolved." You'll never be definitively acquitted. They will never say, "No, that is not the case," they will say, "We found no evidence to substantiate it."

 	 	 		. . .	 	And I'd like to end this with the note I started on, that what we need here is a professional ethic. And I think that the people asking "What will Bob Gates do?" in the very trying times we have ahead for ourselves, major changes in a major new world, I would put that one right very much at the top of the list, and I think he will, too.
 
QUESTIONS FOR PANEL OF WITNESSES
 MR. BOREN: You've now reached a conclusion that Mr. Gates should not be confirmed. . . . What is it that caused you to change your view? . . .
MR. FORD: Why did I change my mind? One, because I began to do some research, looking at the record. My attention was called to the 1985 Iran estimate. I re-read that. I read the subsequent ones. . . . Over the years all kinds of people, largely from the D.D.I., whose abilities and character I respect, had given me all kinds of stories of very unprofessional conduct and of rather dreary consequences.
I purposely pursued this latter kind of thing in the intervening time. Some have had a big effect upon me . . .

 	 	 		. . .	 	Also in the intervening time, more of my colleagues have come to me, not at my initiative, but at theirs, and it's a combination of these things that have led me with, as I said, great pain to come down on the side that I feel he should not be confirmed. I was guilty of a great intelligence error myself, speaking personally. I did not think he would be renominated. I was wrong on that . . ..
SENATOR RUDMAN: Mr. Goodman, you accused Gates of suppressing analysts with whom he disagreed on whether or not the Soviets would send MIG aircraft to Nicaragua. And you quoted that "lead with the chin" quote . . . I think it is unhelpful -- unhelpfully leading with our chin to make a prediction when we really don't have anything to go on. . . .
. . . To use that memo about leading with our chin in that closed session -- and, again, I might point out that your testimony in closed session is at variance with your testimony in open session, and I suggest the committee read both, because let me point out: we went in Thursday night never knowing there would be a public session. The whole case might have rested on that closed session, were it not for the insistence of a number of members, mainly the chairman, that this be taken public.
But the fact is you cited that as an example of politicization. Don't you think that's stretching it a bit?
MR. GOODMAN: No, I don't, because I think when analysts are told not to lead with their chin, and the message comes down very strongly, it does have an inhibiting, if not an intimidating, effect on the kind of analysis you do. I don't think what's appreciated here is the courage it takes to come up against the conventional wisdom on all of these issues.

 	 	 		. . .	 	SENATOR HOLLINGS: . . . I've got a lot of confidence in what each of the witnesses have said. I don't have to cross-examine them, like the press is trying to write, "you don't know how to cross-examine." If we had time we could cross-examine and break down, in a sense. But I want honest reaction as to the agency out there and the politicization.

 	 	 		. . .	 	What would you do if you were given Gates's job -- to correct all of this situation? Is it correctable by Mr. Gates?
MR. FORD: Yes, it is correctable. But I don't think it is correctable, sir, by Mr. Gates. Who, as I said earlier, I think is part of the problem and not part of the solution.
There wouldn't have been all these investigations carried on by the C.I.A. itself -- and there have been several -- if there weren't some smoke in the room. The detailed facts is another thing.
But I think it is quite correctable. And what is needed, in my personal view, is a director of national stature. And there are many such people in American life.

 	 	 		. . .	 	. . . Under Mr. Casey and Mr. Gates, I think there's been a retreat from . . . listening to everyone and faithfully recording their views, recording what is fact and -- and what is -- what is not, recording what is hard evidence and what is -- what might be, and we've had, I think, too much in recent years of a few people making big decisions, especially in the D.D.I., so that everyone's views were not listened to.
Now, the details and who's got whom I'm not familiar at the present tense, but the fact that such a malaise -- malaise exists, I think there's no question about it . . .
SENATOR HOLLINGS: . . . Would any other witnesses want to comment very briefly on the morale or the malaise or anything else further than what's been attested to?
You do, Mr. Goodman?
MR. GOODMAN: Yes, Senator, I feel compelled to do so.

 	 	 		. . .	 	When I arrived at the agency in 1966, we had three separate institutions that dealt with analysis . . .
They were three separate entities. They all looked at problems from three separate viewpoints. They had three separate hierarchies. They argued, they debated . . .
And I think there needs to be some re-examination of the way we used to do business in the C.I.A. and the way it was done under Bob Gates when he was allowed to head all political analysis. No political analysis could get out of the C.I.A. from 1982 until 1986 without going through one filter. Now, whoever that man is -- I don't know how wise he can be, how busy he can be, how courageous he can be -- it's too much. We need three institutions, three hierarchies, three leaders, and we need multiple levels of advocacy. . . .
SENATOR CHAFEE: . . . I was curious who these individuals are that you give such weight to, other than -- in other words, going beyond that of Admiral Inman [Bobby Ray Inman, former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence].
MR. FORD: I appreciated when I came to the committee in closed session that I was up against tough competition. These are senior, respected people who have testified on behalf of the Director -- on behalf of Mr. Gates. I will say it's much easier for someone to testify in favor of someone because they don't have to make their case. They can make a general statement, and everyone leaves them alone. If you've got criticism, then you have to be put in the penalty box, and I think that that's the way we're being treated today, sir. . . .
But to return to your question. . . .
I could give the committee -- I'd rather not give them in . . .
SENATOR CHAFEE: O.K. Mr. Goodman, in answer to one of the agency's in-house studies on the papal assassination, you stated under oath last week, quote, "It concluded the analysts were manipulated by Bob Gates." You said that's what the study showed.

 	 	 		. . .	 	MR. GOODMAN: Oh, I'd be very glad to help you with that one, Senator. You want to go to the -- remember, there were two in-house studies, Cowey and Hibbits. If you go to the Cowey inside -- in-house study, and go toward the back of that study, you will see reflected in there the perception in the building that the analysts were manipulated by the seventh floor.
Now, when I read a message like that -- now --
SENATOR CHAFEE: The seventh floor, we've got to remember, is -- not all Mr. Gates.
MR. GOODMAN: . . . except when a . . . when a D.I. analyst talks about the seventh floor -- believe me, Senator, I worked in that building for 24 years -- when a D.I. analyst talks about the 7th Floor, he is talking about the D.D.I. No in-house study is ever going to name the D.D.I. No I.G. study is going to be very sensitive -- is going to reveal very sensitive messages about upper management.

 	 	 		. . .	 	SENATOR DeCONCINI: When the committee did interview Mary Desjeans, one of the authors of the 1985 report [papal assessment], she said she was told not to talk about it with anybody or tell anybody what I was working on. So, Mr. MacEachin, is that normal, by any means?
MR. MacEACHIN: Oh, no, sir.
SENATOR DeCONCINI: No, sir. And do you know who might have issued that order not to talk to anybody and tell her what she was working on? Did you issue that order?
MR. MacEACHIN: The -- I certainly did, because that was the order that was given to me.
SENATOR DeCONCINI: And who gave you that order?
MR. MacEACHIN: That paper -- that was by Mr. Gates.
SENATOR DeCONCINI: Mr. Gates --
MR. MacEACHIN: Sure.
SENATOR DeCONCINI: -- gave you that order. Thank you.
MR. MacEACHIN: Senator, that is not unusual for a sensitive subject --
MR. GOODMAN: I . . . that is not true.
MR. MacEACHIN: That's -- that's --
MR. GOODMAN: I was in the building for 24 years, and --
SENATOR BOREN: [Sounds gavel.] I'm going to have to ask -- I'm going to have to ask . . .
MR. GOODMAN: . . . that was very unusual.

 	 	 		. . .	 	SEN. DECONCINI: What was your position under Mr. MacEachin?
MR. GOODMAN: At that time I had been removed by Bob Gates as the Chief for Soviet Third World Division --
SEN. DECONCINI: So actually, when --
MR. GOODMAN: And to be fair to Doug, Doug said that Gates wanted me out of the D.I. And Doug --
SEN. DECONCINI: So there was good reason for him not to --
MR. GOODMAN: No, Doug --
SEN. DECONCINI: -- not to tell you, then, because you had been --
MR. GOODMAN: No, he made me the senior analyst in the office, and that's important.
SEN. DECONCINI: Okay, let me get this right. At the time that Mr. Gates went to Mr. MacEachin and said, "Do this secretly" or "limitedly," whatever you want --
MR. GOODMAN: March 1985.
SEN. DECONCINI: At that time, March 1985, were you his chief analyst, or had you been removed?
MR. GOODMAN: I was the chief of the Soviet Third World Division until March 15, 1985. On that day I became --
SEN. DECONCINI: So you were not his chief analyst then?
MR. GOODMAN: On that date I became his chief analyst. And I think if I were the chief of that office I would have wanted my chief analyst, who he respected -- and he's already on record and I thank him for that -- to show it to him. Because I do think that Doug respects my judgment, just as I respect Doug's.

 	 	 		. . .	 	SENATOR WARNER: . . . To Mr. MacEachin, and I ask it in a very concise and pointed way, did Bob Gates ever, to you, slant intelligence?
MR. MacEACHIN: No, sir.
SENATOR WARNER: Did he ever, in any way, try and suppress facts that were essential to an intelligence report?
MR. MacEACHIN: Suppress facts, no, sir. He, as has been discussed, sometimes killed a paper from publication, but that was the opinion or the judgment . . . All the D.D.I.'s do that.

HEADLINE: Senators Yield to Bush on the Israeli Aid Request

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
In an expected yet unusual setback for Israel and its advocates on Capitol Hill, Senators today formally acceded to President Bush's request for a 120-day postponement in considering Israeli loan guarantees.
While an overwhelming majority of 70 Senators sponsored the proposal to offer the $10 billion in guarantees to help resettle Soviet Jews, Senators Bob Kasten and Daniel K. Inouye declared that they would not force an embarrassing showdown with the White House. The number of sponsors would have been enough to override a veto threatened by President Bush. 
 "It is clear to us that our colleagues do not wish a confrontation over the issue of delay," Mr. Kasten, a Wisconsin Republican, asserted on the Senate floor. He added that "the President and other high officials of the Administration have been, by and large, positive on the substance of absorption guarantees."
Mr. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, said, "We believe that the President recognizes the urgency of resettlement."
In a statement pledging support for Israel, House and Senate Democratic leaders said they would give "careful consideration" to the matter when Congress convenes early next year.
 
The President's Argument
 Yet the lawmakers' decision not to challenge Mr. Bush could mean that he would get his way in imposing economic conditions on the loan guarantees. The President had pressed for the delay in weighing the guarantees, arguing that a debate over them would hinder the Administration's plans for a Middle East peace conference next month.
Mr. Bush pointedly accused lawmakers opposed to the delay of trying to please their Jewish constituents, while his critics said he was retaliating for Israel's continued expansion of settlements in the occupied territories.
Margaret Tutwiler, a State Department spokeswoman, said the delay by Congress was "a welcome affirmation of the President's judgment that a pause" would be "in the best interests of the historic opportunity for peace that lies before us." The Administration, she said, would support the guarantees next year, "provided terms and conditions acceptable to the Administration are worked out."
Groups that lobby on behalf of Israel today emphasized the widepread support for the gurantees in the Senate rather than the lawmakers' decision to agree to the delay.
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the most potent pro-Israel lobby, which usually tries to keep a low public profile, took the unusual step of issuing a statement praising today's developments. "We're extremely pleased with the overwhelming bipartisan support in the Congress for securing the refugee guarantees," said Toby Derschowitz, a spokeswoman for the group.
Alfred H. Moses, president of the American Jewish Committee, disputed in an interview that the delay was a significant setback.
 
Avoiding a Confrontation
 "The Jewish community is not looking for a confrontation with the Administration," he said. "That would be a lose-lose situation. What we're hoping for is that the Administration in January will support the loan guarantees."
While groups and lawmakers that champion Israel often wield significant political influence, they said they backed down from taking on the President this time because they were subjected to White House pressure more intense than many had ever experienced before.
"It's in no one's interest to have a shootout at O.K. Corral," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican who had pressed for immediate consideration of the guarantees. "One has to recognize the pragmatic side of what a losing effort might bring about."
Sponsoring the Kasten-Inouye measure was a relatively risk-free move by Senators because pivotal lawmakers made it clear several days ago that they would not force a vote on the matter.

HEADLINE: BUSH VOWS TO VETO NEW JOBLESS BILL

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Vowing to veto a new bill extending jobless benefits, President Bush said today that he was "a little annoyed at the constant political pressure" about unemployment, civil rights and other issues, telling everyone that he still had not formally announced for re-election.
As he left the White House today on a three-state day trip mixing political fund raising with official events intended to promote his domestic policies in preparation for the 1992 campaign, Mr. Bush seemed irritated that he was being increasingly treated as a candidate by the Democrats and in news reports, even though he has not declared himself in the race. 
 "We want to help the unemployed, put forward a sound crime package and all of a sudden, everyone says it's political," Mr. Bush said. "Now I assume that's just because we're getting close to 1992."
Mr. Bush later criticized the unemployment bill in a similar way, saying: "The Democratic leaders, I think they sense a political issue they can use next year against all of us. They were determined to pass and ram down my throat a budget-busting bill. Every taxpayer in the country will be burdened by their approach. I will veto the bill."
 
Air of a Campaign
 In recent weeks, Mr. Bush's domestic trips have increasingly taken on the air of a campaign. But his advisers say he remains reluctant to announce his candidacy and has even delayed forming the financial committee that he said he would put together in September, because he would prefer to avoid the disadvantages of being a candidate for as long as possible.
Once he declares, Mr. Bush will be under greater pressure to respond to the Democrats seeking their party's nomination and will be more subject to accusations of using Presidential travel to campaign.
"Yes, I expect people to say it's political, but that's just the time of year -- that's just the season" Mr. Bush said on the White House lawn before leaving Washington. He added: "So I'm not going to be worried about it, nor am I going to be deterred by it. Nor am I going to let a handful of Democrats announce -- and I'm not announced -- set the agenda for this country. They weren't elected to do something. I was, and I'm going to keep on trying to do it."
Today, he went to Pittsburgh for a fund-raising event for Dick Thornburgh, the former Attorney General who is running for the Senate in Pennsylvania and then traveled to Louisville, Ky., for a conference of citizens who try to help the police catch criminals, known as Crime Watchers. He also attended a fund-raising event for Representative Larry J. Hopkins's campaign for governor before flying to Nashville for the annual awards of the Country Music Association.
 
Criticism of Rights Bill
 Along the way, he blasted the Democrats on the debate over a civil rights bill that is pending before Congress. "I want to sign a civil rights bill, but I want to sign a good bill," he said, referring to his criticism of a Democratic civil rights bill as establishing employment quotas.
He also joined Republicans who accused the Democrats in Congress of using the unemployment issue for political gain.
"They know very well I can't sign it," Mr. Bush said of the new unemployment measure. "If they want to help the unemployed and those who have no benefits, they ought to work cooperatively with this Administration."
Although the Senate vote on Tuesday for the unemployment bill, 63 to 35, was two votes short of the two-thirds majority that would be needed in the Senate to put the bill into law over Mr. Bush's objections, the President seemed clearly irked today to be challenged again by a Congress with which he has been fighting a duel of legislation and vetoes since he took office. The House vote earlier on the same $6.4 billion bill was more than enough to override a veto.
Mr. Bush said that the bill would break last year's agreement on reducing the budget deficit and that Congress should consider a $1.9 billion bill sponsored by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader.
The Democratic bill would add to the budget deficit, while the Dole bill would eventually pay for itself.
Mr. Bush said: "What I want is a bill that doesn't bust this budget. I've made that very clear from Day 1. We're prepared to extend unemployment benefits. In fact, I'd like to see it done, but I'm not going to go out and put the burden on all the rest of the people in this country."

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Battle Over World View

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The internal intelligence feuds over Nicaragua, Iran and papal assassination laid bare in Congress this week were but skirmishes in a struggle during the 1980's to shape the lens through which American intelligence viewed the Soviet Union: as an implacably evil force or an empire in retreat and flux.
For the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the central question is whether Robert M. Gates, the hard-line Soviet expert who now seeks to become Director of Central Intelligence, played an intellectually honest role in that struggle, or was driven purely by ambition and political loyalty.
 
How to Promote C.I.A.
 The battleground was the Central Intelligence Agency's analytical division, the Directorate of Intelligence, which Mr. Gates and his boss, William J. Casey, thoroughly shook up from the first days of their arrival in 1981. The two men were the avowed leaders in a crusade to restore American intelligence, and especially the C.I.A., to a front-line post in the cold war and a first-tier seat in the councils of the White House. 
 But scores of analysts in the Intelligence Directorate, and especially in its Soviet section, took a far more benign view of the Soviet threat and were uneasy with the ideological fervor and pessimism of Mr. Casey and Mr. Gates, said current and former intelligence officials and Administration policymakers.
The result was a clash not just of philosophies, but of fundamental world views, in the C.I.A. department that produced some of the Government's most sensitive and important analyses of foreign issues.
Some combatants in this struggle turned up this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee, bringing accusations that Mr. Gates and Mr. Casey perverted their judgments on Soviet affairs into a gloomier, more threatening picture of Moscow's intentions and abilities. Mr. Gates has cast himself as a champion of hard-headed, but independent analysis, and has previously denied ever shading any intelligence analysis for political gain.
The foremost casualty may have been a more accurate picture of the true Soviet Union in the early to mid-1980's, a time when both the intelligence agency and the White House depicted Moscow as a dangerously expansionist power with a slowing but still powerful economy, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, after he assumed power in 1985, as a historical fluke who was unlikely to have a lasting impact on his country.
An internal C.I.A. review released by the committee this week concluded that at least one controversial analysis was affected by the pervasive belief that the agency's top officials held strong views on the subject, and that some analysts had been "apprehensive about whether their views would be well-received up the line" since 1981.
"I know many people felt that the direction of the line under Casey made it more difficult to stay there and remain true to their version of the facts," one Bush Administration official, a Soviet expert who witnessed some of the debates, said today. "There was a definite feeling that the leadership was actively promoting a harder line and that the way to get ahead was to follow it."
Within the agency's Soviet division, the hot spot of analysis and the prestige job in the Directorate of Intelligence, at least a half-dozen ranking analysts left their jobs in the early and mid-1980's, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. There is little doubt that morale was low among the agency's Soviet hands and that Mr. Gates, who headed the directorate from 1982 to 1986, shares responsibility for that. Mr. Gates carried out an overhaul of the entire analysis division that split the Soviet office from its Eastern Europe counterparts and threw together experts on an array of subjects, sparking turf fights and some confusion.
As memorandums made public this week also show, he could be a pitiless critic of subordinates, lecturing them on Soviet history and belittling them for what he saw as a naive view of Moscow's intentions.
But intellectual brawls are nothing new within the C.I.A.'s analytical division, and, in fact, are officially encouraged as a way to weed out weak ideas and sloppy thinking. The agency teaches analysts to argue their views in special courses and runs a working group on ethics and intelligence analysis to encourage analysts to resist political pressure to alter their views.
The bitter feuding revealed this week in the Senate, "independent of the political context, is probably the norm at the C.I.A. and probably something to be hoped for," said Allan Goodman, a senior aide to President Jimmy Carter's Director of Central Intelligence, Stansfield Turner. "When I was at the agency, my stuff was reviewed more closely than any academic publication I ever submitted," Mr. Goodman said. "That's what they're paying people to do."
It is also true that some intelligence experts who are less passionate than Mr. Gates about the Soviet Union believe that Mr. Casey may have had a point. The C.I.A.'s Soviet office in the early 1980's harbored the most optimistic view of Moscow's intentions of any intelligence agency in the Government, they say. Their judgments sometimes were sought out by Administration policy makers seeking to thwart policies they believed wrongheadedly anti-Soviet.
The question clouding Mr. Gates's nomination to head the agency is whether he acted as an honest reformer at the C.I.A., seeking to raise fresh questions in a group of experts whom he believed had become too orthodox, or whether he simply acceded to demands of superiors to produce intelligence that would support the Administration's anti-Communist crusade.
"You have to realize that the moment the analyst gets wind of the fact that only a certain view is politically correct, then you don't have to make that point more than once, and then the whole process is skewed," said Mr. Goodman, now dean of Georgetown University's graduate school of foreign service. "If they think it had a chilling effect, something was wrong. If they thought there was an atmosphere of politicization, then something is wrong."
The internal C.I.A. documents released this week reinforce that view. Because Mr. Casey was so publicly anti-Soviet, and other officials like Mr. Gates shared his ideology, one paper suggested there may have been a perception that intelligence had to be slanted, whether in fact that demand existed.
 
Wrangling Over Embargo
 Some officials believe that those strong views at the top only made analysts more determined to resist pressure. The Bush Administration official recalled today, for example, that Mr. Casey pressed vigorously for evidence to support the Reagan Administration's decision, in the early 1980's, to call for an embargo of Western goods and technology to a Soviet gas pipeline then being built. But the C.I.A.'s own views on the embargo -- that it would not work -- appear not to have been swayed, he said.
David Whipple, a retired C.I.A. officer who was Mr. Casey's chief terrorism analyst from 1983 to 1985, today recalled attending Congressional briefings with his boss and hearing Mr. Casey attribute many of the world's bombings and assassinations to the Soviet K.G.B.
"Then he'd have to be excused to go back to work, and the committees would ask me to stay on for the afternoon session,' he said. "And I would, as tactfully as possible, try to leave the committee with the right impression -- that you can't prove Soviet involvement, that it's likely the Sovs weren't involved.
Mr. Whipple, now head of an association of former intelligence officers, said that several times he consulted Mr. Gates for advice on how to deal with the situation, and was told by Mr. Gates, "Stick to your guns."

HEADLINE: Vietnam Agrees to Forced Return Of Its Citizens From Asian Camps

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Vietnam has tentatively agreed to accept the forced return of tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees now held in camps throughout Southeast Asia, diplomats and refugee workers said today.
The decision, a major policy reversal for Vietnam, would allow nations housing Vietnamese refugees to send them home by force if they are determined to have fled their country for economic reasons, rather than out of a well-founded fear of persecution. 
 "The first of them may be forced onto planes or boats and sent home by the end of the year," a Western diplomat said. "The saga of the Vietnamese boat people would be all but over. It could be a rather ugly ending."
The Vietnamese offer reported today had been sought by Britain, and would doubtless be welcomed by several Southeast Asian nations that are now sheltering boat people and have sought for years to send them back to Vietnam. But the United States brought a halt to a similar Vietnamese plan two years ago, and may try to derail that proposal.
[In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department said American officials had not yet received details of the proposal but noted that the United States has long been opposed to forcible repatriation of the boat people.
["Our position on involuntary repatriation is well known," said Joseph Snyder, the spokesman. Mr. Snyder said that American diplomats had been in contact with the British and United Nations officials responsible for the new proposal but as yet have not received all the details.]
More than 100,000 Vietnamese refugees are living in refugee camps in Southeast Asia -- about half of them in the British colony of Hong Kong and the rest mainly in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.
Until now, Vietnam has opposed mandatory repatriation of the refugees, in part because it lacks the money and other resources needed to resettle them.
More than 6,000 boat people have gone home to Vietnam under a two-year-old voluntary repatriation program in which they are given living allowances drawn from an international fund for refugees and are monitored by representatives of the United Nations to be certain they are not persecuted.
Diplomats said the Vietnamese offer to accept forced repatriation of the boat people had been made in discussions over the last two weeks with British and United Nations officials.
 
Ending U.S. Embargo
 But the offer has not been formally announced in Hanoi, and diplomats warned today that it might be quickly withdrawn if there were strong objections from the United States, which the Vietnamese Government is reluctant to offend.
Vietnam has sought to restore diplomatic relations with the United States and to end a punishing American economic embargo on this impoverished nation.
The United States expressed outrage when, in December 1989, the authorities in Hong Kong forced 51 Vietnamese refugees, many of them kicking and screaming, onto a plane in the middle of the night and flew them to Vietnam. There have been no forced repatriations since.
The exodus of Vietnamese began shortly after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Vietnamese, some seeking to flee political persecution, many others trying simply to escape the wretched poverty of their homeland, took to rickety boats, and tens of thousands died in the treacherous journey across the Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea.
 
'Economic Migrants'
 Under a 1989 international agreement intended to end the exodus, Vietnamese refugees who cannot demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution are labeled as "economic migrants" and must be returned to Vietnam.
More than 80 percent of the Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Southeast Asia are estimated to fall into that category, refugee workers say.
But since the Governments of Vietnam and the United States object to forced repatrition, it is not being carried out, even as hundreds of new refrugees flee from Vietnam each month.
The authorities in Hong Kong, where the crisis is most severe, maintain that most of the Vietnamese in its camps are illegal aliens and should be sent home without delay.
 
'Trying to Escape Poverty'
 "The international community is returning to forced repatriation because it has to," said a diplomat who is sympathetic to Hong Kong's situation.
"The boat people who are leaving Vietnam today are not searching for political freedom so much as they are trying to escape poverty," he said. "At some point, we have to ask ourselves why the Vietnamese should receive privileges that we do not extend to others who are also trying to escape poverty."

HEADLINE: CROATIAN APPEALS FOR A CEASE-FIRE

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Yugoslavia, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Croatia's president appealed to the federal army today for a new cease-fire in the Yugoslav civil war, offering to lift the blockade of federal army barracks in Croatia if the army will call off an offensive against the breakaway republic that began Tuesday.
The appeal by Franjo Tudjman came as Yugoslav army and Serbian irregulars kept up a steady artillery barrage from positions extending from Vukovar, on the eastern panhandle near the border between Croatia and Serbia, down to the medieval city of Dubrovnik on the southern Adriatic. 
 There was no direct response from the Yugoslav army to the appeal by Mr. Tudjman, but federal army officers in Belgrade earlier appeared to reject any new initiative. "The time for talking is definitely finished," the army commanders said in a statement issued before Mr. Tudjman's appeal. "We no longer believe in words."
 
Letter to Bush
 Mr. Tudjman also sent a letter today to President Bush pleading for aid for Croatia and calling on Washington to send military observers to monitor the fighting there.
"The Yugoslav army is preparing its final attack on cities in the Republic of Croatia," Mr. Tudjman said in his letter, adding that the army's actions have endangered Croatian cultural monuments.
The best known of those monuments is the walled limestone city of Dubrovnik, a major tourist attraction whose alleys, terraces and plazas echo Venetian and Byzantine influences. Dubrovnik has been under seige by Serbian forces and the Yugoslav navy since last weekend.
Recent reports say that no major damage has been done to the historic section of the city, but that hotels on the perimenter have been hit by shells and a fire is raging in a forest south of the town. Electricity, water and telephone service has been cut off to the city and jet fighters today reportedly knocked out television and radio transmitters.
The latest cease-fire appeal came following a meeting in Rome between Mr. Tudjman and Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis of Italy.
Mr. Tudjman traveled to Italy to lobby for diplomatic recognition for Croatia, economic sanctions against both Serbia and Yugoslavia's federal government and for a peacekeeping force to be sent to Croatia.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has No Plan to Ask for Direct Aid for Soviets

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The Administration has no plans to ask Congress for any direct assistance to the Soviet Union other than humanitarian aid and technical advice over the next year, a State Department official said today.
Remarks by Robert B. Zoellick, the Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs, before the House subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East appeared to indicate that the United States would not support such ventures as a special fund to make the ruble freely convertible into other currencies. Echoing President Bush, Mr. Zoellick added, "On the humanitarian side, we will be there as necessary." 
 Mr. Zoellick declined to specify what if any additional help the United States would provide if the Soviet Union adopted the policy changes urged by the United States, like a move toward a freer economy.
Without a separate request to Congress for additional direct assistance, the Administration must seek money from existing programs that already have their own spending plans, Mr. Zoellick said.
 
Report on Soviet Changes
 In a report on the Administration's views of changes in the Soviet Union, Mr. Zoellick also made these observations in his testimony:
*There was a danger that just as the Soviet Union had broken apart into many republics, the republics themselves might fragment into smaller areas, "if the new leaders fail to establish legitimacy through democracy with respect for minority rights."
*The International Monetary Fund will likely sign a document in Moscow this weekend giving special associate status to the Soviet Union. I.M.F. officials said privately that the fund's Managing Director, Michel Camdessus, was likely to go to Moscow but that no final agreement had been reached on the special status, which would allow the Soviet Union to receive technical advice but not large loans from the fund.
*While the Soviet Union is easily able to service its $60-$65 billion foreign debt over the long run, it faces a temporary cash shortage and the Group of Seven major industrial nations is studying ways to provide short-term help with the debt.
*A recent estimate that the Soviet Union's remaining gold reserves are worth only $3 billion appears credible.
*Although widespread famine is unlikely in the Soviet Union this winter, food shortages will cause hardships, especially for old people, young people and republics like Armenia that are farthest from places where surplus food is grown or imported. The United States is considering shipments of baby food and milk directly to the republics to insure that the neediest families receive it.
*The United States is likely to expand its program of humanitarian medical aid, which has sent $11 million to the Soviet Union since December.
Also today, John D. Macomber, the president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, said that the Federal agency now requires that any projects it may finance in Russia or the Ukraine be guaranteed by the governments of these republics and not just by the central Soviet government.
The bank is also prepared to begin financing energy projects in the Soviet Union, Mr. Macomber said.
In a separate announcement the bank said that it had used up its entire budget authorization of $10.6 billion in insurance and loan guarantees, the first time it had done so since a limit was set on these categories in 1981.

HEADLINE: THE O.A.S. AGREES TO ISOLATE CHIEFS OF HAITIAN JUNTA

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The Organization of American States agreed late tonight on a campaign of diplomatic pressure to isolate the new military junta in Haiti and restore the elected Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
O.A.S. officials said they had agreed on a resolution calling for a suspension of all economic, commercial, diplomatic and military assistance to the coup leaders. They also agreed that if these steps did not lead to a restoration of democracy, they would consider other measures, which they declined to specify at this time. 
 The officials said they had agreed to send a delegation to Port-au-Prince, possibly as early as Thursday, to make it clear to the new leadership how isolated they are and how economically deprived their Government will be if it does not immediately restore President Aristide to power.
 
Opening Address
 Father Aristide, a 38-year-old leftist Roman Catholic priest who was inaugurated in February, opened a special meeting at the Western Hemisphere organization's headquarters here.
In a passionate speech, he appealed to the 34-nation group to immediately send a delegation to Port-au-Prince to try to explain to "the criminals who have taken power" what economic price they will pay and what other measures "have been taken and could be taken" if they do not step aside.
Bush Administration officials said they were determined to reverse the coup in Haiti, having spent a great deal of time and energy over the years trying to produce a democratic government in Port-au-Prince, but President Bush said he was not inclined to use American military force.
 
Prefers Not to Use Arms
 Mr. Bush left open the possibility that Washington might support the dispatch of a multinational force organized by the O.A.S. or the United Nations, but not including American combat troops. Officials seemed to hope that diplomatic and economic pressure would be sufficient to persuade the new military leaders to step aside.
The situation in Port-au-Prince, where more than 100 people have been reported killed in fighting since the coup began Sunday night, was reported to be calm but confused. The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said that "scattered firing has died down," but that "there does not appear to be any central government in control."
The airport in Port-au-Prince remained closed.
The Associated Press reported from Port-au-Prince that the leader of the junta, Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras, said today that the military would give decision-making power to the elected National Assembly, but did not indicate that executive authority would also be handed over.
General Cedras told a news conference that the military uprising began among the rank and file, not senior officers, and that he and other army commanders had intervened to save Father Aristide's life. "I personally protected the President," the general was quoted as saying.
He added that the mutiny was a reaction to flagrant abuses of power by President Aristide, adding that the last straw was the formation of a presidential guard under Father Aristide's direct command.
General Cedras further asserted that Father Aristide had not been toppled, but had resigned, The A.P. reported. When pressed for details of the resignation, General Cedras dismissed this as a "stupid" line of questioning. He also dismissed suggestions that he step aside. "I personally do not believe it's a good idea for Aristide to return," he said.
Father Aristide flew to Washington from Caracas, where he fled early Tuesday aboard a Venezuelan Government aircraft hours after being toppled.
 
Emigres Turn Out

Today, while he spoke, hundreds of Haitians gathered outside the O.A.S. building, beating drums, ringing cymbals and waving signs saying: "We Want Aristide Back in Power."
The ousted President began his speech by telling the foreign ministers how the coup evolved, saying that rumors of an impending mutiny started to reach him on Saturday. He said he confronted General Cedras and was repeatedly told that there was nothing to the rumors. Two days later, though, as the mutiny spread throughout the army, Father Aristide said General Cedras confronted him at the National Palace and said, "Now I am President."
Father Aristide said the general then turned to a group of Haitian soliders and asked what they wanted to do with him. Some said to kill him, others said he should be spared so as not to have trouble with Western powers. Eventually, Father Aristide said, it was decided to let him flee the country with the help of the French, American and Venezuelan envoys.
Father Aristide called on all Haitians to "stay mobilized" against the coup, but to use only nonviolent means. The O.A.S. ministers gave him a standing ovation
The organization, at its meeting in Santiago, Chile, in June, agreed for the first time that since every member was now more or less a democracy, its foreign ministers would be authorized to "adopt any measures deemed appropriate" to restore constitutional rule if democratic processes in any member country are overturned.
As the foreign ministers worked out their response to the coup, Pentagon officials said a contingent of 300 to 400 marines had been dispatched from Camp Lejeune, N.C., to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba to prepare for a possible evacuation of the roughly 8,000 Americans living in Haiti -- if the Administration determines that their security is in danger.
Officials said they would go into Haiti with planes or heavy-lift helicopters to bring out Americans if the order was given.
But President Bush made clear that the United States was not inclined to intervene on its own in an attempt to restore the Aristide Government.
"I am disinclined to use American force," he said. "We've got a big history of American force in this hemisphere, and so we've got to be very careful about that. But I will see how others feel at the O.A.S. There might be some talk over there now about a multinational force of some sort, so we'll have to wait and see."
Mr. Bush also said he was not inclined to impose economic sanctions, like a trade boycott, to reverse the coup because "the problem with that one is you start hurting the Haitian people."
The State Department suspended all economic aid to Haiti on Tuesday and refused to extend diplomatic recognition to the coup plotters.
Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country, was scheduled to receive $84 million in American economic help and $1.5 million in noncombat military aid this fiscal year, which ended Monday. About $66 million still has not been allocated to the hemisphere's poorest country. In the new fiscal year, it is supposed to receive $88.6 million in economic and food aid and $2.2 million in military assistance.
Some experts questioned whether the aid cutoff, an action that has also been taken by the European Community, France and Canada, would be able to reverse the coup.
Robert A. Pastor, an Emory University expert on Latin America and a member of the international commission that observed the Haitian elections this year, said:
"Unless the O.A.S. goes further, they may be repeating the mistakes made in Nicaragua and Panama -- of sending a delegation to negotiate with a military dictator without sufficient leverage to assure the desired outcome. My view is that you really need to put together a package of sequenced sanctions and get them all publicly accepted at the beginning to send a clear message to the military of the consquences of its failure to step down."
American officials said that while they cannot simply let the Haitian coup stand, they should not get ahead of the O.A.S., which has repeatedly denounced American military interventions in the hemisphere.
The question of intervention has bedeviled and paralyzed the organization for the 40 years of its existence. It has been caught between its support for representative democracy and its adherence to the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of members.
When the O.A.S. was dominated by dictatorships, the principle of nonintervention held sway. Now, with the rise of new democratic leaders in the hemisphere, American officials question whether the organization will take a more active approach in the coming weeks.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, in his address to the group, declared: "It is imperative that we agree for the sake of Haitian democracy and the cause of democracy throughout this hemisphere, to act collectively to defend the legitimate government of President Aristide. Words alone are not going to suffice. This is a time for collective action."
He added that until President Aristide's government is restored, "this junta will be treated as a pariah throughout this hemisphere, without assistance, without friends, and without any future."
If diplomatic and economic efforts to isolate the Haitian junta "do not succeed," the Secretary of State said, "then we must consider additional steps," but he did not elaborate.

HEADLINE: Doctor Acts to Heal Romania's Wound Of Baby Trafficking

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Dr. Alexandra Zugravescu has spent most of her life in Bucharest hospitals, tending to the health of Romanian children. Now, this 66-year-old pediatrician is tending to the well-being of her country, trying to cure one of its most publicized scandals: the selling of babies for adoption. Her task, as she explains it, is to wipe out "the dirty business of baby trafficking."
Efforts by Dr. Zugravescu and the new Government agency that she heads, the Romanian Committee for Adoptions, will affect a great many families in the United States. In the last year, Romania, which has a large population of abandoned and orphaned children as a legacy of the Communist dictatorship that was deposed in 1989, has overtaken South Korea as the leading source for foreign adoptions by Americans. 
 A ban on abortion and contraception under the old regime and grinding poverty that left many people unable to support a family turned children into a commodity that was sometimes sold on the streets.
As a first step in carrying out a new law to control adoptions, Romania has temporarily halted adoptions by foreigners. Those adoptions will not resume again until January, at the earliest, Dr. Zugravescu said here last week.
Dr. Zugravescu completed a 10-day visit to Washington, during which she met with Government officials and child-welfare experts, just as her country was thrown once again into political turmoil. The Prime Minister resigned last Thursday after violent protests against the Government in the streets of Bucharests led by miners upset over economic hardships.
Officials at the State Department and the Romanian Embassy said that despite the sudden political uncertainty, they did not expect the new adoption law, which went into effect in July, to be affected.
According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 2,287 Romanian children were adopted by Americans from Oct. 1, 1990 to Sept. 4, 1991. In that period, Americans adopted 1,534 Korean children; until a few years ago, South Korea provided more than half of all foreign babies adopted by American families. But that country, while the No. 2 provider of children for adoption in the United States, has drastically reduced the number of babies released for overseas adoption.
"It is a tremendous turnaround," said William L. Pierce, president of the National Committee for Adoption, an advocacy group. "In two short years, Romania has eclipsed the world's most active country in terms of adoption."
Dr. Zugravescu said the purpose of her country's new adoption law was twofold: to eliminate private adoptions and to give priority to Romanian families to encourage domestic adoptions. In effect, Romania is trying to establish an organized, Government-controlled system patterned after those of other major sources for international adoptions, as in South Korea and Colombia.
When international adoptions resume in Romania, foreigners will be required to go through agencies in their own countries that have been selected to work with Romania's adoption committee. The adoption committee is now reviewing applications of licensed agencies in the United States, Canada and many European countries. No agencies have been selected yet. Dr. Zugravescu said Romanian courts would not consider any case that did not originate with an accredited agency.
The new law also requires a six-month waiting period before an international adoption can occur. During that time, efforts will be made to find a Romanian home for an abandoned or orphaned child. Romanian families seeking to adopt a child will not be subject to the waiting period.
Dr. Zugravescu said several dozen foreigners in Romania had ignored warnings of the impending change in the adoption law and were now caught in a legal nightmare. They have custody of children, but the courts have not approved the adoptions because they presented their papers on July 17, the day the law changed. As a result, they cannot leave Romania with the children.
Dr. Zugravescu said at least 7 American families and nearly 50 from Canada and Europe were in that situation "in a hotel in Bucharest with the children." She said she could not predict what would happen because her committee had no authority in those cases. "Only the courts can decide," she said.
Some people smuggled babies out of Romania and completed adoptions in neighboring countries, Dr. Zugravescu said.
The penalty for breaking the new law is one to five years in prison. United States immigration officials have issued an advisory warning Americans that they may be subject to criminal prosecution if they try to evade the Romanian law by trying to take children out of the country.
Romania's adoption industry sprang up after the overthrow of the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu in December 1989, when the plight of tens of thousands of children in squalid public institutions received widespread publicity.
Americans, Europeans and Canadians flocked to Romania in search of children to adopt. Unwanted children were suddenly a valuable commodity, and entrepreneurs sold babies to raise hard currency.
There will be fewer Romanian babies available for adoption in the future, Dr. Zugravescu said. The birth rate has decreased sharply with the legalization of abortion and contraception.
Nonetheless, more children may become available for adoption from other Eastern European countries, said Dr. Pierce of the National Committee for Adoption. Stories about orphans "in desperate straits" in Albania are starting to circulate, he said.
Information on the status of Romanian adoptions can be obtained from the State Department, which provides a recorded telephone message. The phone number is (202) 647-3444.
Even now, Dr. Zugravescu said, she finds it hard to believe that her country has made a name for itself as a baby bazaar.
"It pains me that this could happen," she said. "There were such abuses. Who could have imagined such a thing?"

HEADLINE: SENATE PASSES BILL SETTING UP LEAVES FOR FAMILY NEEDS

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to require many employers to grant up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for workers to attend to family emergencies like the sickness of an elderly parent or the care of a newborn or newly adopted child.
The 65-to-32 margin indicated that the Senate could apparently vote to override the veto that President Bush has threatened. 
 Adding to the bill's prospects was the fact that among the senators who did not vote were two of the bill's Democratic co-sponsors, Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa, who were making Presidential campaign appearances. Democratic leaders also said Senator David Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat who was the third member who did not vote, would have supported the bill if he had been on the floor and would vote to override a veto. [Roll-call vote, page A20.]
 
Second Challenge to Bush
 But Congressional officials said it was doubtful that the House, which is expected to vote on the measure as early as next week, could pass the legislation by the same two-thirds majority.
It was the second Congressional challenge in two days to the President, who has also said he will veto a bill to provide extended unemployment benefits to those who have been out of work for six months. Both houses passed that bill on Tuesday.
Republican opponents of the family leave bill accused Democrats of catering only to those who can afford to take time off from work. Democrats said they were trying to make family life more secure and grant American workers a benefit similar to those already enjoyed in Japan, Germany and other industrialized countries.
After the vote, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who has sponsored family-leave legislation for five years, said: "I'm very interested in working with the Administration to work out a compromise the President can live with. The door is open and the phone lines are free.
 
Slight Change From Vetoed Bill
 The bill, which has been vigorously opposed by business lobbyists, is slightly different from one passed by Congress last year and vetoed by Mr. Bush. Democratic sponsors forged a compromise with Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, to exempt essential employees, who are the highest paid 10 percent of the work force, and part-time workers who worked fewer than 1,250 hours the previous year.
Despite the revisions, President Bush this week repeated his intention to veto the bill, suggesting that it would impede economic recovery and inappropriately extend the power of Government over the workplace.
The bill passed today would potentially cover 46 million employees -- those who work for companies that employ more than 50 workers. It requires employers to provide up to three months unpaid leave per year for the adoption or birth of a child or a serious illness suffered by an employee or a member of the immediate family and to guarantee the worker a job after the leave. It requires employees to provide medical certification of the illness to the employer.
Conservative groups devoted to family issues have criticized the proposal as "a yuppie bill" that would benefit upper-middle-class careerists but do nothing for traditional mothers who stay at home with their children. Business groups have charged that the bill would reduce the flexibility employers need to tailor benefits for employees.
Senator Wendell H. Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, said the bill would "insure that workers will not have to choose job over family in times of emergency." He noted that 11 million children have mothers who work full time whom they depend on when illness strikes.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said he approved of the benefits outlined in the bill, but added that they should be voluntarily granted by business, not mandated by Government. "It's easy to create mandates," he said, "but it's very difficult to stop mandating once you start." He also suggested that the bill would make the United States less competitive on world markets.
Mr. Hatch proposed a substitute measure supported by business that would provide up to six years of unpaid leave for parents "to bond" with their newborn children and up to two years to care for seriously ill family members. Employers would be obliged to rehire the worker only if his job or a similar job was open, but would also be required to notify the employee when another position opened. Mr. Hatch's amendment was defeated 65-32.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
U.S.O.C. Seeks Funds Using State Lotteries

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Ever eager to find new ways to support athletes, the United States Olympic Committee is turning to an unlikely source for revenue: state lotteries. In effect, the committee is using the five Olympic rings, once a symbol of amateur idealism, to help sell a game of chance.
A test program in at least 15 states, scheduled next year around the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and the Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain, could raise as much as $2 million, Olympic Committee officials say. And that could lead to subsequent programs that officials expect could generate as much as $25 million by the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. 
 "Any number of national Olympic committees fund a very substantial part of their Olympic activities with a national lottery," said John Krimsky, the U.S.O.C.'s deputy secretary general and chief marketing strategist. "This gives the opportunity to use a device to supplement our income that, quite frankly, has not been available to us before."
 
Scratch Off and Win
 Until now, the bulk of the committee's revenues, feeding a four-year budget of $300 million, has been produced through corporate-sponsored programs and the sale of television rights. The only direct public program, an income-tax checkoff in nine states, has generated only $3 million since 1986.
Scientific Games Inc. of Atlanta, the country's largest producer of instant lottery tickets and the U.S.O.C.'s partner in the new deal, has already signed 15 states, which have agreed to buy a total of 378 million tickets with instant-win scratch-off games bearing the Olympic design.
Massachusetts alone has agreed to buy 100 million, California and Illinois 60 million each. The other states taking part in the program are Delaware, Maine, Iowa, Arizona, South Dakota, Missouri, New Hampshire, Vermont, Washington, Idaho, Ohio and Indiana.
Scientific Games is tailoring the game to the state, using a theme of "Winning Spirit" for the Albertville Games and "Golden Glory" for Barcelona, each with an Olympic logo.
The company has not completed the prize structures, but in general, buyers will be able to win anything from $1 or a free ticket to as much as $5,000, $10,000 or $50,000, depending upon the size of the state and ticket sales.
Discussions are under way for distribution in at least five other states -- New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Minnesota -- and that would give the U.S.O.C. exposure in more than half of the 34 lotteries in the United States. If sales next year are encouraging, the Olympic committee plans to expand the program in time for the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, with more states participating.
Under its contract with the U.S.O.C., the states pay the Olympic committee through Scientific Games, a flat rate of about $3.50 for each 1,000 tickets sold to the states, Krimsky said. In each state where the tickets are sold, the money would be counted toward the fund-raising projections for the year made by national and state Olympic officials and that money, in turn, would be funneled back to support programs for athletes in training. The U.S.O.C. will receive none of the income from the sale of lottery tickets by vendors to the public nor will it have anything to do with the payouts.
"The U.S.O.C. does not do anything to disrupt education, wild life, parks programs or anything else state lotteries support," Krimsky said. "We get our money from the other end."
 
A Tax Safeguard
 While state lotteries are viewed in some circles as exploitive for attracting buyers with limited disposable income, the games have nontheless proved to be popular with buyers and invaluable as sources of financing for a vast assortment of projects and safeguards against tax increases.
Duane Burke, the publisher of Public Gaming International, a monthly magazine, said that the lotteries in 33 states and the District of Columbia would produce $19 billion in revenues for the 1991 fiscal year, a 5 percent decline from the year before, which he attributed to the current recession.
But citing the two previous recessions, after which eight states each time instituted lotteries, he predicted that as many as 10 more states would have lotteries by 1994.
"Lotteries are producing as much as 5 percent of a state's budget," he said in an interview. "I don't think any governor in his right mind is going to give up hundreds of millions of dollars."
"The key thing for us is the money we can raise for the athletes," Krimsky said. "It gives the U.S.O.C. the opportunity to advertise itself and gives the American public a chance to support Olympic athletes."

HEADLINE: A Standoff Won't Help the Jobless

 BODY:
The distress of America's long-term unemployed offers a strong argument for reworking last year's Federal budget pact. But unless the Democrats are prepared to brace the overall budget issue head on, their $6.4 billion bill to extend unemployment benefits won't fly.
President Bush and Congress agreed in good faith to abide by specific caps on defense and non-defense spending, and not to increase either category without offsetting cuts or new revenues. Nor may they rob one category to fatten the other. 
 With Communism's collapse, defense savings could be applied to domestic needs without worsening the deficit. But absent a renegotiation that the Democrats seem reluctant to broach, the budget agreement still holds: If you want more domestic spending, find the money to pay for it.
The Democratic unemployment insurance bill approved by Congress provides up to 20 weeks of additional coverage beyond the basic 26, and expires next July. The proper way to pay for it would be to raise the tax employers already pay for the basic program. The President favors fewer additional weeks, and other funding. But the Democrats' bill skirts the issue by declaring an emergency, not subject to pay-as-you-go.
The Democrats tried a similar device in an earlier bill, extending benefits if the President declared an emergency; Mr. Bush refused to take the bait. With the emergency declaration now built in, he says he will veto the new bill.
House support for this bill was easily enough to override the veto, but the Senate's majority was two votes short. It remains to be seen whether Republicans who voted against the measure can be persuaded to switch. The September unemployment report, due Friday, could affect the vote.
The larger issue -- renegotiating the budget pact in the light of fundamentally changed circumstances -- will take time to resolve, when and if it is joined. The immediate issue is to provide for the unemployed within the existing rules. The worst of the recession may be past, but with new layoffs coming every day, the outlook for workers laid off months ago remains bleak. If the President's veto sticks, they will still need help.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Courage and Vision

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
Watching President Bush announce those sweeping nuclear weapons reductions and restraints last week -- some of which seemed beyond hope a year ago -- I had mixed but largely jubilant feelings.
To one of my generation -- whose memories of the Cuban missile and Berlin crises are clear and traumatic -- these changes seemed at least as remarkable as those that have engulfed the Soviet Union. My generation had, after all, lived our adult lives in the constant awareness not only of the cold war but of the mushroom cloud. Now the one seems as remote as Guadalcanal, the other a lesser threat than global warming. 
 There also was a certain satisfaction in hearing at last, in a President's words, propositions that Americans once were derided and denounced for advancing -- such as the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from Europe.
Mr. Bush said that changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe mean that an invasion of Western Europe is no longer a realistic prospect. In view of long-evident Soviet economic weakness, the predictable unreliability of Warsaw Pact military forces, obvious Western defense advantages and the Soviet-American power equation overall, that might have been said years ago -- and was, by some Americans -- and the withdrawal ordered much earlier.
To those who had opposed the MX missile from the day President Carter proposed converting Nevada into one vast warren of launchers and silos to house the hydra-headed monster, andeven after President Reagan had ludicrously renamed it "the Peacekeeper," Mr. Bush's announcement of its demise promised one of the "few good funerals" the world so badly needs.
Nuclear cruise missiles also are to be taken off Navy ships -- a once-unthinkable step that those who understood the difficulty of establishing adequate controls on these weapons have long advocated.
Most of all, as Mr. Bush spoke, it seemed that in regard to the horror of nuclear weapons, the world might be moving at last toward quasi-disarmament. From John Foster Dulles, who argued that the U.S. should make no distinction between nuclear and conventional weapons, to Ronald Reagan, who said that a nuclear war "could not be won and must never be fought," an arduous struggle has been waged between those who believed more terrible weapons would keep an uneasy peace and those who feared these arms threatened inevitable holocaust.
Now George Bush had promised, in addition to the significant actions he announced, more attention to the ominous problem of nuclear proliferation; Moscow seemed likely to be forthcoming in response (and now has promised to be); and President Mitterrand of France is proposing a five-power summit to talk about the future of nuclear weapons. If the terrible genie can't be put back in the bottle, perhaps it can be more stringently safeguarded and made an international pariah.
The millennium has not arrived. Mr. Bush did not mention intercontinental missiles, save to make the welcome proposal that they should carry only one warhead. He wants American submarines to retain multi-warhead missiles, and thus an existing advantage. He did not propose to halt nuclear testing. He called -- incongruously and illogically -- for greater investment in the B-2 bomber, Star Wars, ground-based anti-missile systems and renegotiation of an ABM treaty that, not "broke," doesn't need fixing.
The President warned against converting reduced military spending into greater non-military spending. Such a restriction would perpetuate perhaps the single greatest cause -- inflated military budgets -- of the nation's decline in standard of living and international economic position. Democrats in Congress, fortunately, don't seem inclined to heed Mr. Bush.
All that said, and granted that he seized on some Soviet initiatives previously spurned (such as the elimination of tactical nukes), hoped in part to head off Congressional and allied pressures for even greater arms reductions, and no doubt will profit politically by the measures he announced -- still, Mr. Bush abandoned some of the sacred texts of 40 years of cold war, was willing to reverse several of his own stands and risked the disapproval of his party's powerful right wing.
That took courage, as well as the vision that George Bush is often accused of lacking. He could hardly have chosen a subject of greater importance for his demonstration of both.

HEADLINE: How C.I.A. Invented Soviet Military Monster

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A Sept. 26 front-page article reports the accusation before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence by Melvin Goodman, former Central Intelligence Agency analyst, that Robert M. Gates, the nominee for Director of Central Intelligence, suppressed dissent within the agency and slanted intelligence conclusions to support Administration policies. 
 Professor Goodman's revelations come as no surprise to me; indeed, they suggest an answer to puzzles raised over the last 15 years in my studies of C.I.A. estimates of Soviet military spending.
The C.I.A. estimates have been, in my opinion, continually slanted upward to make Soviet military spending appear larger than careful analysis of the data suggests, thereby supporting the Reagan-Bush-Pentagon military buildup policies.
It was clear to me that the decisions to slant the conclusions were made at the highest levels because the techniques used were so unacceptable on scholarly grounds. In my work on military spending, I have come to know many of the C.I.A. analysts who prepare these estimates, and I believe that, had they been free of political pressure, the estimates would not have been distorted. Let me offer a few examples.
* The accepted method of comparing United States-Soviet gross national product and any of its components is to take an average of comparisons in ruble prices and in dollar prices. For example, C.I.A. analysts summarized a comparison of United States-Soviet consumption levels thus: "In 1976, per capita consumption in the Soviet Union was 34.4 percent of that in the United States: this value is the geometric mean" -- average -- "of comparisons in rubles (27.6 percent) and in dollars (42.8 percent)."
Note that the dollar comparison exaggerates Soviet consumption, the ruble comparison exaggerates United States consumption. This is always the case and is why the C.I.A. almost always makes the two comparisons and uses their average. The major exception is the military spending comparison with the result that, as estimated by the C.I.A., Soviet military spending has always been grossly exaggerated compared with that of the United States.
* In 1979 the C.I.A. raised its estimate of the percentage of Soviet military spending in G.N.P. from 12 percent to 13 percent. The reason given was that since 1976, military spending had been increasing annually 4 percent to 5 percent, whereas the increase in G.N.P. had declined to 2 percent. In 1983, the C.I.A. admitted that military spending had been growing since 1975 at only 2 percent a year. Yet it did not make the appropriate reduction in the ratio of military spending to G.N.P. from 13 percent to 12 percent. Consider also that it took the agency eight years to admit it had been substantially exaggerating the annual growth of Soviet military spending.
* The Soviets introduced a price reform in 1982, the first in 15 years. In 1986, the C.I.A. switched its estimates of Soviet military spending and G.N.P. to the new 1982 prices. The percent of military spending in G.N.P. took a 3 percent jump upward because, according to the C.I.A., prices of weapons had increased much faster than prices of civilian goods. This was a lie or guesswork.
In November 1987, a year and a half later, the C.I.A. published "A Guide to Monetary Measures of Soviet Defense Activities," a pamphlet that stated: "Recently the C.I.A. shifted its base year to 1982, the year of a major price revision. It is not yet known in the West if or how the Soviets adjusted the prices of their weapons systems in that year." Further substantiation that military prices were unavailable is found in the answer of Jerome Weinstein of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency to Senator William Proxmire's query in 1988 on the inflation in military prices: "Sir, that's a very soft figure. There is no hard evidence on what the inflation actually is."
Basic responsibility for the crude distortions could not be attributed to the competent analysts who develop C.I.A. estimates. Top officials like Mr. Gates undoubtedly call the tune on these matters. Whoever was responsible did this nation a disservice by contributing to our enormous and excessive military buildup over the last 15 years.

HEADLINE: How C.I.A. Invented Soviet Military Monster;
Record of Failure

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The search for a smoking gun in the Robert M. Gates confirmation hearings for Director of Central Intelligence is pointless. It is clear that, if Mr. Gates did not know about the Iran-contra affair, the reason was he deliberately kept himself ignorant. 
 However, lying is no longer considered a serious transgression in American public life. President Bush said that Clarence Thomas was the best qualified person in the United States for elevation to the Supreme Court, and Judge Thomas himself said that he had no opinion about abortion and Roe v. Wade. No one believes these statements, but neither speaker will be penalized. Why do we care whether Mr. Gates is lying or not?
The real issue is what kind of intelligence service the United States needs in the coming years. If we think we want the same kind of Central Intelligence Agency we have had, then Mr. Gates is the best possible candidate; if we think we need something different, he is the worst.
On most of the issues that count -- those related to the broad political, social and economic currents of the times -- the C.I.A. has had a spectacular record of failure. On Cuba, Iran, Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, the C.I.A. has always been wrong. (On Saddam Hussein, where a little old-fashioned spying might have done the trick, the C.I.A. also missed the boat.) It is likely to continue to be wrong if it is staffed with ideologues whose favorite activity is hatching secret plots, and if it is overseen by a Congressional committee that also likes that sort of thing.
We can safely relegate both traditional spookery and high-tech reconnaissance to tasks such as exposing double agents and tracking military placements. If, on the other hand, we hope to predict world movements truly important to the security of the United States, that can only be done entirely in the open by politicians, diplomats and scholars of all kinds, including economists, political scientists, sociologists and physical scientists. In other words, it will take the same kind of effort that we would apply to any difficult interdisciplinary problem.
Much of this should take place at the State Department, at universities and think tanks, and it should involve studies, meetings, publications and extensive international visits. Perhaps if we devote enough effort to this task, we shall be somewhat less surprised at the next cataclysm in world affairs.

HEADLINE: Income Figures Show No Gains by Blacks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The affirmative action debate associated with Judge Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings confuses person with population. Both conservative and liberal presentations of personal portrayals miss picturing the condition of populations. The position of African-Americans relative to whites has eroded since 1975. 
 Look at the percent change in the ratio of black-to-white median family income from 1975 to 1989. In 1975, the ratio was 62 percent. In 1982, it was 55 percent. For 1989 it was 56 percent, down from 57 percent in 1988. Gains and losses over those 15 years show black median family income dropped 6 percent relative to whites. In the same period, cumulative gross national product increased 19 percent.
If African-Americans are successful and have been taking opportunities from whites, their incomes relative to whites should increase, but they have not.

HEADLINE: Lloyd K. Garrison, Lawyer, Dies; Leader in Social Causes Was 92

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
Lloyd K. Garrison, a lawyer from a distinguished family who built an extraordinary record of individual achievement and public service, died at his home in Manhattan. He was 92 years old.
He died of heart failure, his family said. 
 Mr. Garrison was the great-grandson of William Lloyd Garrison, the abolitionist, and the grandson of Wendell Phillips Garrison, the literary editor of The Nation. His father, Lloyd McKim Garrison, a lawyer, and his mother, Alice Kirkham Garrison, were pillars of New York society.
Mr. Garrison was schooled at St. Paul's and at Harvard and Harvard Law School, where his brilliance and social connections brought an offer from the law firm of Elihu Root, one of the leading figures of the country's elite establishment.
 
Leading Social Causes
 But Mr. Garrison's interests, seemingly indefatigable energy and commitment to progressive social causes took him far beyond the life of the Wall Street lawyer.
Mr. Garrison, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, was a very successful Wall Street lawyer. But he was also at various times a law school dean, a crusading and innovative Federal investigator and administrator, a civil rights and civil liberties advocate, a close adviser to a Democratic Party standard-bearer, and a political reformer who took on and bested the Democratic Party machine in New York City.
Mr. Garrison was a friend of some of the most powerful establishment figures in 20th century America -- Root, Judges Augustus and Learned Hand, Adlai Stevenson. He was called to government service several times by Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his successor, Harry S. Truman. He served on numerous Federal agencies and commissions.
Yet Mr. Garrison was a stalwart champion of expanding economic opportunity and increasing citizen participation in political life. He was influential in an early and landmark National Labor Relations Board ruling that required employers in collective-bargaining negotiations to bargain exclusively with the representatives selected by a majority of employees. The ruling was later made part of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935.
In the early 1950's, Mr. Garrison, as a member of the Democratic Reform Movement in New York City, played a significant role in ousting Carmine DeSapio as the county Democratic leader. In national politics he was a stalwart supporter of the Presidential candidacy of Mr. Stevenson, a longtime friend.
Mr. Garrison joined the National Urban League in 1924, which he said opened his eyes to the realities of racial discrimination in America, and was its president from 1947 to 1952.
That commitment remained through the decades.
In 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Garrison wrote a letter to The New York Times in which he stated that Dr. King "in the last years of his life" realized that "civil rights legislation and court decisions were not enough to wipe out discrimination and inequality; that the ravages of poverty had to be dealt with on a massive scale; (and) that the cleansing and transformation of the our inner cities was the first order of business and the establishment of peace was indissolubly linked with these objectives."
In the early 1950's, Mr. Garrison, a longtime member of the American Civil Liberties Union, defended the poet Langston Hughes and the playwright Arthur Miller when they were summoned by Senator Joseph McCarthy before the House un-American Acitivities Committee. And he defended J. Robert Oppenheimer when the Atomic Energy Commission -- for whom Mr. Garrison had been a special consultant in the 1940's -- sought to remove Mr. Oppenheimer's security clearance.
Mr. Garrison lived a super-charged life. But his friends invariably described him as a somewhat shy man with a self-effacing manner.
"I've never planned my life," he said in the early 1960's. "I've taken things as they've come along. For me life has been a series of accidents."
"I like to be of use," he went on, "but I don't consciously go out to serve."
Others recognized what Mr. Garrison, in his modesty, would not acknowledge, and he was constantly called upon to be "of use:" " as a partner of Paul, Weiss, which he joined in 1946, and in a broad array of volunteer activities.
The calls began early in his career. After college, interrupted for service in the Navy, law school and his settling on Wall Street, Mr. Garrison was asked by the City Bar Association in New York to investigate incidents of "ambulance chasing" and bankruptcy fraud by lawyers.
 
Bankruptcy-Fraud Inquiry
 His work gained such prominence that President Herbert Hoover appointed him to a special Federal commission investigating bankruptcy-fraud across the country.
That began a career of Federal service in the 1930's -- including helping start the National Labor Relations Board. Mr. Garrison at the time was actually employed outside the Government, as dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School, where his efforts at improving the school's standing drew widespread praise.
Among his many activities over the years, Mr. Garrison was a member of the Board of Overseers of Harvard University, and a trustee of Sarah Lawrence College, and Howard University, and a member of the Council of Foreign Relations and the City Bar Association.
He is survived by his wife, Ellen; two daughters, Clarinda Garrison and Ellen Shaw Kean, and a son, Lloyd McKim Garrison, all of Manhattan, and 11 grandchildren.
A memorial service will be held on Monday at 12:30 P.M. at All Souls Unitarian Church, at 80th Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Banker Held

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I. Oct. 3

 BODY:
A bank vice president was arrested today on charges of helping doctor the books of his small institution months before its collapse touched off Rhode Island's banking crisis.
Prosecutors said Peter J. Iannuccilli, vice president and a director of the Heritage Loan and Investment Bank, altered bank computer records to make it appear that more than $1 million in payments had been made on 12 loans now suspected of being fraudulent. 
 The arrest was the first of a high-ranking banking executive since a private deposit insurer's failure forced 45 banks and credit unions in Rhode Island to close Jan. 1.
Heritage's president, Joseph Mollicone Jr., has been missing since November 1990, when state officials discovered Heritage was teetering on collapse. He has been charged with embezzling $13 million from the bank and a Federal fugitive warrant has been issued for his arrest.
Mr. Iannuccilli was charged with one count of fraud. He was arrested at his Cranston home today and led into the Attorney General's office in handcuffs. After a hearing, he was released on $50,000 personal recognizance.
Prosecutors charge that he altered bank records to show that Mr. Mollicone had validly obtained the loans and made payments on July 13, 1990. But there was no collateral or other standard documentation to support the loans.
When Heritage failed, its private deposit insurance fund had to pump millions of dollars into it to cover guaranteed deposits. That subsequently caused the collapse of the insurer, the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
How Much to Cut Arms Spending?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WHAT will be the economic consequences of President Bush's unilateral decision to eliminate all tactical nuclear weapons on land and at sea in Europe and Asia?
The near-term effect on military spending and the Federal budget will be slight. Mr. Bush, announcing his initiative last Friday, immediately sought to spike expectations of a "peace dividend" -- dollars saved from the military budget that could be used to meet domestic needs. "Some will say these initiatives call for a budget windfall for domestic programs," he said. "But the peace dividend I seek is not measured in dollars but in greater security." 
 Indeed, in the near term, he added, some of the steps he was proposing "may even cost money." And, given the "ambitious" plan he had already proposed to Congress for cutting military spending by 25 percent over the next five years, he said, "We cannot afford to make any unwise or unwarranted cuts in the defense budget."
Military analysts estimate that the President's decision to give up short-range nuclear weapons will, in itself, facilitate modest savings over the next five years. Before his new initiative, the President's plan called for reducing budget authority for tactical nuclear weapons to $1.5 billion in 1996 from $2.4 billion in 1990. That would have scaled back tactical nuclear deployments to 2,500 warheads from 4,600, and brought down total military budget authority by a scant one-third of 1 percent.
Assuming that such deployment will be cut to fewer than 500 warheads from 1993 on and that all the costs of removing the tactical nuclear missiles are absorbed in the 1992 operating budget, analysts see estimated savings of $1.2 billion a year, or $6 billion over the five-year planning period. With the additional costs of decommissioning and safe disposal of the warhead material, net savings might be closer to $5 billion in constant 1992 dollars.
The tactical nuclear weapons are the main components affected by the President's initiative. One budget expert said he did not think the taking of long-range bombers off ready alert would save any money, although, he said, it would mean "happier families." But significantly bigger savings will result if Moscow accepts the President's proposal to negotiate sharp reductions in intercontinental ballistic missiles.
The crucial issue on which Mr. Bush's initiative has now opened the door goes far beyond the potential savings on tactical or strategic nuclear weapons. For, in stating the logic for his elimination of tactical nuclear weapons as the opportunity created by the end of the cold war and the turn of the Soviet peoples "to democracy and freedom," the President has kicked off what is likely to be a continuing debate in Congress and in the coming election campaign on how much the total military budget can be cut -- and what should be done with the savings.
This will be a complicated issue for both Democrats and Republicans, for the chance to cut military spending comes when the American economy is still in purgatory, between recession and recovery, and unemployment appears likely to hang on through the election year. Mr. Bush has sharpened the issue by threatening to veto the Democrats' bill to extend unemployment compensation for 20 weeks, saying that he had to think of taxpayers and not just the unemployed.
No one can know how long the economy will have to endure the pain for its sins of excess during the 1980's; meanwhile, however, the military budget is regarded, by members of both political parties and their local constituencies, as a barrier against worse unemployment. Economists may stress the economic benefits of reducing military spending, whether the proceeds are used for deficit reduction or domestic programs, till the cows come home, but voters focus on the loss of jobs immediately linked to closing bases and plants.
According to Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney's five-year plan for trimming the military budget, active forces would be gradually brought down to 1,653,000 troops in 1995 from 2,070,000 in 1990. Military reserves would be cut to 906,000 from 1,128,000, and civilians employed directly or indirectly by the Department of Defense would be reduced to 940,000 in 1995 from 1,068,000 in 1990. In all, this means eliminating 22 percent of active military personnel, reserves and civilian workers.
It may require a much more vibrant economy to persuade a majority of Congress to press for steeper cuts in the military. And the President is likely to continue to fight for his present military plans, including the B-2 bomber, the Strategic Defense Initiative, new attack submarines, two new aircraft carriers and much else, whether to repel military or political-economic threats.

HEADLINE: Orders to Factories Fell 1.9% in August, After a July Surge

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Orders for manufactured goods, unable to sustain their biggest increase in 21 years, fell 1.9 percent in August, the Government said today.
Some analysts question whether the industrial sector can continue to lead the recovery without stronger participation by consumers, who represent two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
 "Saying the manufacturing sector will turn the economy around is like saying the tail is going to shake the dog," said Paul Getman, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
Orders for durable and nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $243.3 billion, down from $248.1 billion in July, the Commerce Department said.
The drop was the largest since a 2.9 percent decline in March. It followed a slightly revised 6.1 percent jump in July, the biggest since a 6.6 percent advance in December 1970. The July increase had originally been estimated at 6.2 percent.
Most analysts had expected the industrial sector, representing one-fourth of the nation's economic activity, to give back part of the July gain.
Still, Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York, noted that even with the drop, orders were 4.1 percent above the June level. "We're looking at an ongoing industrial recovery," he contended.
In another report today, the Labor Department said the number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped to 430,000 in the third week of September, down 10,000 from the previous week.
But the decline was not considered large enough to indicate any meaningful improvement in hiring practices and was not enough to offset the surge of 37,000 new claims a week earlier. And the average number of new applications for the four weeks ended Sept. 21, was 423,250, the highest since the four weeks ended July 20, when the average was 403,000. Many economists consider the four-week average to be more significant than the weekly data.
The Commerce Department report showed that factory orders for durable goods fell 3.9 percent in August, to $125.7 billion. The decline had been estimated at 3.8 percent.
 
A Big Gain Is Reversed
 Durable orders had soared 11.7 percent in July, the largest increase since the department began keeping records in 1958. Durable goods are relatively expensive items, like computers and cars, that are expected to last more than three years.
The drop more than offset a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in nondurable goods, to $117.6 billion; that category had risen six-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Inventories continued to fall, down three-tenths of 1 percent, the eighth decline in nine months. The declines could mean increased production and jobs if demand increases.
Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, suggested that some inventory rebuilding may already be under way.
He noted that inventories of finished goods -- as opposed to raw materials and goods in the process of manufacture -- rose three-tenths of 1 percent. At the same time, he said shipments rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, their fifth consecutive gain.
Unfilled orders, often a barometer of how busy industry will be in coming months, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the second consecutive increase.
Transportation orders contributed the most to the drop in durable-goods bookings. They fell 8.8 percent as a large decrease in aircraft more than offset increases elsewhere. The overall category had jumped 27.1 percent the previous month.
Excluding this sector, orders were still off seven-tenths of 1 percent in August as all major categories posted declines.
The often-volatile military category posted a 15.8 percent gain, exceeding the 13.3 percent increase in July. Excluding the military sector, orders were down 2.6 percent.
Nonmilitary capital-goods orders excluding aircraft -- a barometer of industry's plans to expand and modernize -- fell 2.5 percent.

Alcoa and Kobe Steel To Form 2 Ventures

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The Aluminum Company of America and Kobe Steel Ltd. of Japan said today that they had agreed to form two joint ventures to make aluminum for cars and light trucks and other uses in the transportation industry.
The ventures, one in Japan and one in the United States, are meant to capitalize on auto makers' efforts to make lighter, more fuel-efficient cars by using more aluminum parts. 
 The new joint venture in the United States, to be operating by 1994, will be the first American-Japanese joint venture to manufacture, market and sell automotive aluminum products in North America. It will serve American and Japanese auto makers in the United States, the companies said.
The joint venture in Japan, to be established in January, will research, manufacture, market and sell sheet aluminum. It will also research the production of shaped aluminum parts, such as those made through casting.
Kobe and Alcoa formed an alliance in September 1990 to pursue worldwide business opportunities in aluminum. The first venture was KSL Alcoa Aluminum Company Ltd., a 50-50 joint venture formed in Japan in January to make and market aluminum can stock.
The amount of aluminum in the average American car has almost doubled in the last decade, to nearly 159 pounds, or 5.4 percent, of the car's weight in 1990, according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association. Steel represented 54 percent of the weight, and plastic about 7.6 percent, the trade group said.
About 1,000 pounds of aluminum auto parts could be combined in one car, making the vehicle about 24 percent lighter than the average car today and increasing fuel economy by 20 percent, according to the Aluminum Association, another trade group.

HEADLINE: 10-Day Vehicle Sales Up

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Strong sales of 1992 models to fleet buyers and sizable rebates on leftover 1991 models helped increase sales of American-made cars and light trucks by 5.8 percent in late September over the comparable period a year earlier, according to figures released by the auto makers today.
Analysts said the figures overstated actual consumer demand, which remains sluggish but is showing signs of gradual improvement. 
 On a seasonally adjusted basis, domestic cars were selling at a 7.2 million rate for the Sept. 21-30 period, compared with an 8.2 million rate at this time last year. Car sales were 226,602, compared with 236,375 last year, a drop of 4.1 percent. Light-truck sales posted a strong gain to 150,213, an increase of 25.3 percent.
Analysts said the final 10-day sales period in September was not a reliable indicator of the auto industry's health because rebates on last year's models and fleet sales tend to skew the numbers from year to year.
 
Gradual Improvement in '91
 But Harvey Heinbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, noted that the annual selling rate in 1991 has shown a gradual improvement from quarter to quarter, and should therefore calm fears that the auto industry was heading into a prolonged slump after a strong showing this summer. "That's consistent with the gradual recovery thesis," he added.
Another economic report today also proved moderately encouraging to analysts. The Government said August factory orders fell 1.9 percent, but that was still higher than the June level and analysts had expected the industrial sector to give back part of a big July gain. [Page D4.]
Of the auto makers' figures, Mr. Heinbach said the annual rate was 6 million cars in the first quarter and has increased steadily each quarter since to 6.4 million units. The seasonally adjusted annual rate last month was 6.3 million cars, about the same as in August.
The sizable increases in domestic truck sales were attributed to heavy marketing pushes by the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation in competing for the title of America's best-selling pickup. Ford proclaimed itself the winner today, due in part to sales of its F-Series pickups, which jumped to 38,601 units in late September, from 14,574 in the period last year.
Herbert Abramson, owner of Silver Lake Dodge in Wellesley Hill, Mass., hopes that new incentives announced today by the Chrysler Corporation, which extended rebates on leftover models and slapped them on selected 1992 models, will draw buyers to showrooms. The rebates are "unbelievably heavy" for new models, Mr. Abramson said. "They're really stepping out ahead of the market on these."
The number of domestic vehicles sold by the Big Three was up 6.1 percent in late September, and the number sold by Japanese "transplants" was 3.7 percent higher. Thus, the Big Three's share of sales resulting from domestic production rose to 87 percent percent, from 86.8 percent in the 1990 period.
In car sales, General Motors sold 93,449 American-built units in the late September period, down 9.2 percent from a year earlier; Ford Motor sold 61,584, down 10.8 percent, and the Chrysler Corporation sold 31,422, up 15.2 percent, based on estimates by Ward's.
 
Gains by Honda
 Of the Japanese auto makers with American plants, the Honda Motor Company sold 17,612 cars, an increase of 22.5 percent; the Toyota Motor Company sold 9,585 cars, a drop of 10.1 percent, and the Nissan Motor Corporation sold 5,733 cars, a drop of 18.5 percent.
In light-truck sales, G.M. sold 55,677, an increase of 18.2 percent; Ford sold 65,326, a jump of 66.6 percent; Chrysler sold 20,515, a drop of 13 percent.
For the entire month of September, sales of all cars and trucks, imported and domestic, fell 7.2 percent, to 1.03 million, from 1.11 million in September 1990. Car sales were down 13.1 percent, to 662,951, and truck sales rose 5.6 percent, to 371,016.
The Big Three's total vehicle sales in September, including imported models, fell 8.7 percent; the Big Three captured 70 percent of the market, compared with 71.2 percent a year earlier. Sales by Japanese car makers, including vehicles built in the United States, rose six-tenths of 1 percent, and captured 24.4 percent of the market in September, compared with 22.5 percent a year earlier. Vehicle sales by importers outside Japan fell 18.4 percent; the market share of these non-Japanese importers was down seven-tenths of 1 percent from a year earlier.
 
U.S. Manufacturers Slip
 G.M. sold 222,416 American-built cars in September, a drop of 18.7 percent from a year earlier; Ford sold 129,501, a decrease of 18.1 percent, and Chrysler sold 57,222, down 15.8 percent.
G.M.'s total market share for cars in September was 35.8 percent, compared with 38.1 percent in September 1990. Ford had 20.6 percent, compared with 21.7 percent a year earlier. Chrysler's total market share was 9.3 percent, compared with 9.4 percent. Toyota's market share was 7.3 percent, compared with 6.3 percent, and Honda's market share 10.7 percent, compared with 8.3 percent.

RJR Plans To Reduce Debt Load

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
RJR Nabisco Inc. announced plans yesterday for large offerings of common and preferred stock that would help the company retire some of the debt it incurred in 1988 when Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company bought the company in a deal worth $25 billion.
Because the financing will add more than 300 million shares to the 1.1 billion common ones that already exist, RJR's stock fell 62.5 cents yesterday, to $11 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange after the announcement. 
 The proposed issue of preferred stock, which is convertible into common, would be the second public offering by RJR this year. In April, the company sold 100 million shares at $11.25 each.
 
More Freedom Seen
 But over the long term, analysts said, the move will benefit RJR Nabisco by allowing it to renegotiate its bank loans so it has more freedom to make investments and acquisitions.
"Changes in the bank-loan agreements are very important to RJR's plans to become a more aggressive competitor in overseas markets," said Jennifer Coury, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. She noted that tobacco sales were growing faster overseas than in the United States, and that RJR, like other tobacco companies, was planning to make investments and acquistions in foreign markets.
By getting its debt below $15 billion and increasing its equity, or shareholders' capital, to about $8 billion, RJR expects that it bank loans will no longer be labeled a "highly leveraged transaction" by banking regulators.
 
Shedding a 'Straitjacket'
 Karl von der Heyden, RJR's chief financial officer, said yesterday that even though the company's credit quality had improved since the Kohlberg, Kravis takeover, the "highly leveraged" label was a roadblock to a new agreement "because the banks are unwilling to amend the agreement or to lend more money" to companies with that label. They have been responding to regulators and investors who see a high potential for loss from such borrowers.
"Under the existing agreement, our excess cash goes to reduce the bank loans, and we are in effect unable to make acquisitions or major investments without getting the approval of the banks," Mr. von der Heyden said. "With a new agreement, we would not be in such a financial straitjacket."
In the new agreement, Mr. von der Heyden said the company was hoping to reduce the interest rate on its loans to 75-hundredths of a percentage point above the offered rate for interbank deposits in London, down from the current 2.75 percentage points.
 
Getting Money Cheaper
 He added that a new agreement might allow RJR Nabisco to borrow low-cost money from banks to retire or refinance debentures that carry interest rates as high as 17 3/8 percent. The company might also used its new bank credit line to pay cash interest on some debentures, known as pay-in-kind securities, which pay interest in the form of additional debentures.
Several rating agencies said the proposed cut in RJR Nabisco's debt could cause them to lift their ratings on the company's senior debt out of the high-risk junk bond category and into the bottom of the lower-risk investment grade category.
The debt reduction will result from an exchange offer of common stock for $1.8 billion in preferred stock to be handled by Goldman, Sachs & Company. A companion offering of 160 million shares of a relatively new kind of security called Preferred Equity Redemption Cumulative Stock, or Percs, will be handled by Morgan Stanley & Company, which developed the security earlier this year.
The Percs offering is expected to raise about $1.9 billion.

HEADLINE: Advertising;
Commercial Clutter Up On Big Three Networks

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
If you think you have been seeing more commercials on television lately, a report issued yesterday confirms that impression.
The report, released by two leading organizations representing advertising agencies and advertisers, concludes that once again the nation's television networks have increased the amount of time devoted to things other than programs. 
 The prime-time count of commercials, network promotions and public service announcements in March 1991 was compared with the count in November 1990. On ABC, the count rose by 2 seconds, to 10 minutes and 16 seconds a hour; on CBS, by 20 seconds, to 11 minutes and 6 seconds, and on NBC, by 20 seconds, to 11 minutes even. Only on Fox, which still had the most commercial time, did it decline -- by 20 seconds, to 12 minutes and 3 seconds.
Prime time, however, is the time of the day with the fewest commercials, averaging slightly more than 20 an hour for each network, according to the report. Daytime has the most, an average of 37 an hour.
"The networks have been increasing their clutter year in and year out," said O. Burtch Drake, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, which co-sponsors the annual Commercial Monitoring Report with the Association of National Advertisers, also in New York. "And they don't pay attention to people who say it's nuts."
 
Blind but Not Deaf
 DeWitt F. Helm Jr., president of the advertisers association, alluded to "Three Blind Mice," a recently published book that excoriates the networks' business practices, when he said that among their executives, "maybe there are a lot of blind mice, instead of three blind mice."
Every year following the report's release, the trade organizations meet with top executives at the networks to complain about creeping clutter. "It's all right to have blind mice, as long as they're not deaf," Mr. Helm added.
Clutter is a continuing worry for agencies and advertisers because of the overwhelming need, as Mr. Helm put it, "to get more bang for the buck."
If viewers perceive that instead of commercials between programs they must watch snippets of programs between commercials, "eventually they will go to their VCR machines, or switch channels," Mr. Drake said, adding, "There are lots to places to go with no commercials."
But as the networks confront rising costs and a decline in advertising demand caused by the recession, they try to squeeze in additional revenue-producing moments. The trade weekly Advertising Age has reported that a CBS plan to redistribute the number of spots it runs during its most desirable prime-time hours has put agencies "on the warpath against the rise in commercial clutter."
The latest report introduces changes in research methodology that limit comparisons with the years before 1990. In the past, the report involved the monitoring of a single week of telecasts, usually in November. This time, in order to broaden the report's scope, two months were monitored within a half year. In the past, the report looked at data from only one week a year.
Needless to say, the networks take issue with the report. "The bottom line is that the networks provide the least cluttered advertising environment available to advertisers and, in other words, the most favorable advertising environment," said Peter Chrisanthopoulos, president of the Network Television Association in New York. The association's members are the so-called Big Three networks, excluding Fox. A Fox representative did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
According to studies commissioned by his association, Mr. Chrisanthopoulos said that ABC, CBS and NBC ran fewer commercials an hour than Fox, independent stations, cable or syndicated programming. He went so far as to say that his medium compared favorably with the advertising-to-editorial ratios of magazines.

HEADLINE: U.N. Stops Short of Haiti Resolution

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The deposed President of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, asked the United Nations Security Council tonight for help in restoring democracy to Haiti, but the Council stopped short of enacting a resolution condemning the military coup there.
Warning that similar takeovers could "murder democracy" elsewhere, President Aristide said "the threat to democracy in Haiti constitutes a threat to democracy throughout the world." 
 President Aristide, a leftist and the country's first democratically elected head of state, said "notorious criminals who have murdered many people" returned with the military coup of Sept. 29. He told the Council he had seen criminals, including drug smugglers he said had been released from prison by the military junta, at army headquarters the day after the takeover.
The President, a Roman Catholic priest, spent much of his short address tonight urging the Council to support the Organization of American States in its efforts to restore democracy to his country, saying he stood united with "the international community, which has turned its gaze on Haiti" and is trying to find a solution.
Father Aristide, who addressed the Council in French, thanked its members in advance for the help he believed they would give his attempt to return to power. And he specifically asked them to help Haiti built up an honest police force so that it would not need to rely on an army that "supports dictatorship.
 
Resolution Blocked
 But the United States, other western Council members and the Soviet Union were unable to muster enough support from the 15-nation body to push through a formal binding resolution condemning the military takeover and supporting O.A.S. efforts to restore democracy.
China, supported by the several nonaligned countries represented on the Council, successfully limited the Council's involvement to a simple statement of concern by the Council's President, arguing that the group should not get more deeply involved in the internal difficulties of a particular state.
The members say they are worried that the Security Council, at the urging of Western nations, is bemcoing increasingly involved in domestic issues that are the private affairs of member states.
Earlier France, in particular, had made clear that it wanted firmer Council action. Its United Nations representative, Jean-Bernard Merimee, told reporters that his Government wanted a resolution backing up O.A.S. efforts similar to the one the Council adopted last month supporting the European Community's mediation attempt in Yugoslavia.
 
Words of Condemnation
 Instead, the Council's current President, Chinmaya Gharekhan,India's United Nations representative, said, in a short statement on the Council's behalf, "the grave events that have taken place in your country deserve to be condemned strongly."
He spoke of a "violent usurpation of legitimate democratic authority" and said members "condemn this action and hope it will be reversed as soon as possible." He said the Council supported the efforts the that O.A.S. is making to restore democracy, adding that all members hope President Aristide will be able to resume office as soon as possible.
A representative from Honduras, speaking for the O.A.S., the United States, France and other members of the Council, made brief statements universally condemning the coup and demanding a restoration of democratic government.
President Aristide, came to New York to address the Council after spending the day in Washington gathering political support.
He also met informally today with members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. He held a closed-door session with the Inter-American Human Rights Commission in which he lodged complaints about human rights abuses by the Haitian military.
Father Aristede appealed to the members of Congress to throw full support behind the O.A.S., but emphasized that he favored a peaceful reversal of the coup and that he opposed any American military intervention.
 
Return to Washington Planned

At United Nations headquarters this evening, before his address, Father Aristide was greeted by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. He then met with Alain Vivien, a junior minister from the French Government, which with the United States, helped secure his release from Haiti.
President Aristide also met with Mayor David N. Dinkins, who had asked to see him. The Haitian leader plans to return to Washington on Friday to meet with President Bush, who wants "to personally stress his support" for the island's elected Government, a White House spokesman said.
Haitian supporters of Father Aristide rallied outside the United Nations today, shouting, ringing bells and holding banners and Haitian flags. THe protesters chanted: "What do we want? Aristide! What do we need? Aristide!"
The O.A.S. voted late Wednesday night at a meeting in Washington to condemn the military takeover by a junta led by Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras. The regional organization called for the restoration of democracy and asked all countries to suspend all economic, commercial, diplomatic and military assistance to the new regime.
A high-level delegation of the 34-member organization is to fly to Haiti on Friday to press the military junta to reinstate Father Aristide. The delegation is expected to comprise Foreign Ministers or senior officials from the United States, Canada, Bolivia, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Jamaica. The United States will be represented by the Assistant Secretary of State for inter-American affairs, Bernard W. Aronson.

HEADLINE: Haiti's Coup: Test Case for Bush's New World Order

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The coup in Haiti has put the Bush Administration and its talk of a new world order on the spot: can it do any less to restore a democratically elected Government next door in the Caribbean than it did to put a feudal monarch back on the throne in Kuwait?
Administration officials insist that ultimately the answer is no, and they have begun using the same sorts of warnings vis-a-vis Haiti that they used before the intervention to liberate Kuwait. But Haiti is not Kuwait, and the Caribbean is not the Persian Gulf. 
 That is why it is by no means clear that the Administration has the stomach, the will, the national political support or the regional political support for pushing a multilateral intervention to oust coup leader Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras and restore the democratically elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- if no other option works.
For now, Washington is clearly hoping that it will not ever have to face that question. It has joined with other members of the Organization of American States in a policy of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation to bring the junta down. But in echoes of their Kuwait policy, both President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d have staked out a firm position: this coup will not stand.
 
No Aid, No Friends, No Future
 "Let the coup plotters in Haiti and any who dream of copying them know this: this hemisphere is united to defend democracy," Mr. Baker told his colleagues at the O.A.S. emergency meeting on Wednesday. "This junta is illegitimate. Until President Aristide's government is restored, this junta will be treated as a pariah throughout this hemisphere, without assistance, without friends and without any future. This coup must not and will not succeed."
But what exactly will that mean? It was often said during the gulf war that if Kuwait harvested carrots instead of crude oil the United States never would have sent troops to reverse the Iraqi aggression there. The issue in Kuwait, President Bush explicitly stated, was not democracy, but to prevent a dictator with weapons of mass destruction from seizing control of more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves.
Haiti, of course, does harvest carrots and little else. It is the poorest country in the hemisphere. The only reason for the United States to push aggressively to restore President Aristide is because his is the youngest democracy in the hemisphere and the last link in a chain of democratic governments Washington has been trying to nurture next door for the last 20 years. Will the United States fight as hard when its principles are at stake in the Caribbean as it did when its strategic interests were at stake in the Persian Gulf?
The Administration's intervention in the gulf was made easy by the fact that Iraq's violation of Kuwait's borders and sovereignty were the classic justification for international intervention. Even previous American interventions in the Dominican Republic, Chile and Grenada were driven by supposedly strategic arguments that Cuba and ultimately Moscow stood behind the governments there. Or, in the most recent example of Panama, the notion that drug trafficking and control of the canal were at stake.
 
Wary Neighbors
 However, intervention purely to uphold human rights or to restore the legitimacy of a democratically elected government, such as Haiti's, is highly unusual, particularly in this hemisphere where the legacy of American interventions have left Latin and Caribbean governments extremely wary about joining with Yankee forces. That is what happened when the armed forces of Jamaica and Barbados sent token contingents to fight with the larger American forces that invaded Grenada and toppled its leftist rulers.
That is what really makes Haiti such an interesting test case. The Administration's behavior there will determine just how far it is prepared to go beyond the classical arguments for internationally accepted intervention, and it will also determine how much the democratic revolution that swept Latin America and the Caribbean during the last 15 years has reshaped the attitudes of leaders there toward the politically sensitive issue of intervention.
If the results of the O.A.S. meeting Wednesday are any indication, both Washington and its allies in the hemisphere are clearly in a state of flux, but it is not clear how much new ground they are yet prepared to break. The 34-nation O.A.S. moved swiftly and with virtually no dissent to adopt a resolution calling on each member state not to recognize the Haitian junta and to suspend all military, economic, commercial and financial relations with it.
If these steps, which will be personally conveyed to the coup plotters by an O.A.S. mission to Port-au-Prince, fail to move them to step down, the organization vowed to consider as yet undefined "alternative" measures.
 
Shared Fears
 The fact that the normally reticent O.A.S. ministers went even this far was itself a sign of the times. For almost every country in the hemisphere, democracy is a relatively new and fragile experience. As President Aristide's O.A.S. colleagues considered his plight on Wednesday, they all seemed to say: There but for the grace of God go I. The problems that President Aristide ran into with his own military, resentful at losing some of its traditional powers and prerogatives, are problems that do or will apply to every single one of his newly democratic neighbors.
"If the military in Haiti can use a range of excuses, some of which might even be quite justified, to overturn the constitutional democracy there, it will embolden militaries everywhere else in the hemisphere," said Robert A. Pastor, an Emory University expert on Latin America and a member of the international commission that monitored Haiti's first Democratic elections in December.
O.A.S. officials who took part in drafting the resolution on Wednesday said the ministers started out slowly and then kept inserting tougher and tougher language as the night wore on. But at that point, even President Aristide was unwilling to ask for a military option. He seemed to believe that to be reinstated as President on the back of some multinational force -- even an O.A.S. one -- would undermine his own legitimacy and should be treated only as the option of last resort.
"It's better to think of the force of the international community than to think of other forces," he said.
 
Force, the Unspoken Word
 That seemed to dovetail conveniently with the Administration's instincts as well. President Bush has already said he was disinclined to use any unilateral American military force in Haiti, but he has not ruled out United States participation in some form of multinational operation to restore democracy there.
For now, though, Administration officials make clear that they do not want to go to the American people and ask for support for any American involvement in a military intervention in Haiti, and they certainly do not want to test the political nerves of the young democracies in the O.A.S. by talking about use of force.
American officials, in other words, are hoping that they can pass the Haiti test the easy way, by having democracy restored there exclusively by means of nonlethal economic and diplomatic pressures. If that does not happen, though, Mr. Bush and his new democratic neighbors in this hemisphere will yet have to answer the question: what price democracy?

HEADLINE: U.S. Studying Philippines' Base Plan

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials said today that they were still seeking details of a Philippine Government plan to require American forces to withdraw from the Philippines by 1994.
The plan, a compromise agreement reached by the administration of President Corazon C. Aquino and opponents of the American military presence in the Philippines, puts the United States in an awkward position. Privately, the Administration would prefer to maintain the Subic Bay Naval Station, the shipyard and supply depot on Luzon Island that serves the Navy's Seventh Fleet. But a State Department official said today that Washington must avoid looking "like we're trying to muscle these guys." 
 A feeling that the base was a vestige of American colonial control was the catalyst for the Philippine Senate vote last month rejecting a 10-year extension of the American lease.
 
Possibility of Change
 President Aquino favored the lease renewal, arguing on the basis of the base's economic benefits, and made plans to organize a national referendum on the issue in an effort to circumvent the Senate vote. The Senate majority was prepared to try to enforce a one-year withdrawal deadline. Under the compromise, the Americans will be given three years to pull out and Mrs. Aquino is to abandon the referendum campaign.
A three-year withdrawal period raises the possibility that a new President and Senate, to be elected next spring, could agree on a policy reversal and decide to let the 5,900 American troops stay longer. But Administration officials have said they "aren't counting" on such a reversal.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said on Wednesday that the United States was disappointed in the decision, but would "conduct ourselves accordingly" if the Philippine proposal sticks.
American diplomats in Manila and senior Navy officials in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, have been preparing contingency plans in case the United States has to end its nearly century-old presence in the Philippines.
 
Plans for Withdrawal
 Adm. David Jeremiah, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week in Singapore that a withdrawal of American forces from the Philippines would not reduce the United States military presence in the region. The Navy has said it would build no new bases to replace Subic, but shift Subic's functions to existing bases in Guam, Japan, Singapore and Hawaii. Moving operations to new sites would add as much as $600 million a year in labor costs.
Pentagon officials said today that how and when American forces might begin withdrawing was unclear. "It's not simply a timing question," Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters. "There's a lot of questions that go with that."
Some reports have indicated the United States would not be obliged to pay rent for the base during the withdrawal period. Other reports suggested that Manila would insist that the Navy leave behind much of its equipment.
The chief of the Philippine armed forces, Gen. Lisandro Abadia, said today that the Philippines wants the United States to begin withdrawing its forces from Subic early next year, the Associated Press reported. He also said that the United States would turn over Clark Air Base, which was damaged by a volcanic eruption earlier this year, to the Philippines on Dec. 4.
A senior Pentagon official said that given the circumstances, a three-year timetable would be considered "a good deal" if the Philippines allowed Navy ships to continue operations at Subic during the withdrawal and existing agreements exempting Navy personnel from Philippine taxes remained in effect.
"A three-year deal would mean we don't have to go running out with our sleeves hanging out our suitcases," the official said.

HEADLINE: Fallout Expected in Hanoi Refugee Issue

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The Bush Administration may be heading toward a confrontation with the British Government over a reported agreement between Britain and Vietnam to for cibly repatriate Vietnamese living in refugee camps in Hong Kong, Administration officials said today.
State Department officials said they were still uncertain of the details, but Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, reiterated the Administration's long opposition to such forcible repatriation. "Our position on involuntary repatriation is well known," she told reporters today. 
 In December 1989 the United States led a worldwide outcry after 51 refugees were forced by British authorities to return to Vietnam from Hong Kong. Journalists reported that many of those being deported were weeping and screaming as they were taken by bus and forcibly put on an airplane.
That deportation was supposed to be the beginning of a repatriation of thousands of Vietnamese who had declined to go home voluntarily. In British eyes, the Vietnamese clogged an already overcrowded Hong Kong. But the complaints from the United States and elsewhere -- notably an unusual rebuke of the British Government by the Pope -- halted the program.
 
Question of Economic Refuge
 "The key question now is whether the Administration will continue to stick with its strong opposition," a senior Congressional official said. In 1989, President Bush opposed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the issue, and now Mr. Bush will be facing her successor, John Major.
Some Administration officials said today that they were confident that Mr. Bush would not change his views. "Bush has been pretty consistent in maintaining opposition to any involuntary repatriation," said one.
Some Administration officials faulted the British for what they described as a failure to adhere closely to a 1989 international agreement that focuses on the need to make voluntary repatriation more attractive. "Instead they have seemed very impatient to get on with the business of deporting people against their will," said one official.
But officials acknowledged that the 1989 agreement is somewhat ambiguous about what to do with people who are not deemed political refugees but rather economic refugees and refuse to return home.
Officials also complained that London and Hanoi worked out the agreement largely in secret. Though the agreement is said to directly concern only those refugees in Hong Kong, it is widely expected that other Southeast Asian countries that have been unwilling hosts to thousands of refugees will quickly follow suit.
 
Hanoi Keeps Its Distance
 HANOI, Vietnam, Oct. 3 (Special to The New York Times) -- Vietnam said today that the forced return of Vietnamese refugees to their homeland was "not a good measure," even as diplomats reported that Vietnam had tentatively agreed to reverse policy and accept involuntary repatriation of thousands of the refugees.
In a statement to reporters, the Vietnamese Government said it preferred to look for "better, appropriate ways" that would preserve "the dignity of refugees." More than 100,000 Vietnamese are living in refugee camps across Southeast Asia, most with little hope of resettlement outside Vietnam.
Diplomats said the statement appeared to be an effort to demonstrate that, if forced repatriation is begun, it is not at Vietnam's suggestion.
"Quite rightly, the Vietnamese may be trying to distance themselves from any suggestion that they came up with this strategy," said a diplomat here. "It was the idea of Hong Kong and the nations that now have to care for the boat people."
Vietnam has in the past opposed forced repatriation, if only because it lacked the resources needed to resettle the refugees.
Diplomats in Hanoi said today that Vietnam would probably back away from its offer to accept the refugees if the Bush Administration is strongly opposed to the plan. Vietnam is reluctant to offend the Administration, and is trying to re-establish diplomatic relations and trade with the United States.

HEADLINE: Uncertain Winds on Midwest Farms

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAUNEMIN, Ill.

 BODY:
In a sun-dappled Illinois cornfield that seemed to stretch to the horizon, a big, green combine rolled across eight rows at a time. But the cornstalks, often as not, were barren, left lifeless by drought.
"A couple more droughts and I'll be gone," Tom Harms said recently as he steered the giant harvesting machine through parched cornfields that are yielding barely half the usual crop. "Even so, I know it could be worse." 
 Like most who survived the awful farming days of the mid-1980's, Mr. Harms, an affable reddish-haired 30-year-old in green cap and blue jeans, now stands on more solid financial footing. He is secure enough to withstand a setback like the drought that has reduced crop yields in parts of Illinois, Indiana and Iowa.
"For the farmer who has survived," said Terry Francel, an economist with the American Farm Bureau, "the balance sheet is in much better shape than it was a decade ago."
In the mid-80's, farmers overall owed the equivalent of about 30 percent of their assets. That average debt today is about 20 percent.
 
$2.5 Billion in Credits
 Farmers now look hopefully to the Soviet Union, where a poor crop has left that nation with a voracious need for imports, which could raise prices of American exports. But the Soviet economy is no better off than its harvest, and banks in the United States have so far been reluctant to back loans for grain imports, despite some guarantees by the Federal Government.
The Government has offered $2.5 billion in credits to guarantee all the principal and virtually all the interest on loans to Soviets for grain.
The loan guarantees should mean that Soviet imports, which usually total about 13.7 million metric tons, this year could reach nearly 20 million tons. "That's good news for American farmers," said Mr. Francel.
American corn production, the nation's most important crop, is expected to be about 7.3 billion bushels, perhaps 10 percent lower than last year's crop, largely because of the drought in the Midwest. An early freeze in Minnesota and northern Iowa could also lower those stocks slightly.
"It's the tightest year we've had in a while," said James Ryan, an analyst with the Agriculture Department. Despite the drought, he said, the United States has enough grain to increase its exports to the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union, which has been buying American grain since 1972, usually takes about 18 percent of the nation's grain export. Soviet officials have estimated they need to import about $14.7 billion in food products to meet that nation's needs over the next year. But the reluctance of banks to back loans to the Soviet Union could have serious consequences for American farmers, agriculture experts say. For farmers, most of whom participate in a Government program to cut production in exchange for price subsidies, the dire need for food in the Soviet Union underscores what they see as a paradox. "People shouldn't go hungry if we've got the food to feed them," said Robert Galle, an Iowa farmer.
The North American Export Grain Association, a trade group in Washington that represents grain dealers and shippers, has called for a $2 billion increase in Government loan guarantees to the Soviet Union through next year.
About 80 percent of farmers agreed to leave 7.5 percent of their acreage unplanted this year in exchange for Government subsidies that guarantee the farmer a minimum price if the crop's price on the open market falls below that target. The Government is considering reducing, and perhaps eliminating, the program next year. Under the 1990 farm bill, 15 percent of farm acreage is not eligible for subsidies.
While Government subsidies account for about 30 percent of American farm income, the subsidies for farmers are much higher in Europe and Japan. Government subsidies in Norway, for example, represent about 77 percent of farm income. Talks aimed at reducing such subsidies around the world have been conducted through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to little avail.
"American farmers, who are very efficient and productive, would be willing to compete on a level playing field," said Mr. Francel, of the Farm Bureau. "But that's not what we've got."
For corn, this year's average yield is expected to be about 106 bushels an acre, as against the usual 118 bushels. For farmers like Mr. Harms, who farms with his father, Gerald, the drought has been much more severe.
The Harms's farm is harvesting only about 60 bushels an acre. The poor crop has made this year's harvest, which can be the most rewarding time of the season, a deep disappointment.
"It's just disgusting," said Mr. Harms, whose family farms about 1,900 acres, but owns only a few hundred, working the rest by sharing profits from the crops with the land owner. The poor crop means the farmer will delay purchases of new equipment. Mr. Harms and his father had hoped to buy a new combine soon. But a new combine would cost $140,000, an unaffordable luxury in a lean year.
As a result of the poor crop, Mr. Harms's wife, Joy, has taken a job at a child care center. "We need her here," said Mr. Harms, "but we just don't have the cash flow."
 
A Long Harvest Day
 The harvest of corn and soybeans on the Harms farm lasts about four weeks. The workday starts soon after 4 A.M., and usually lasts until after dark. Mr. Harms's mother, Marian, who does the bookkeeping, brings lunch to the fields, when time allows.
Mr. Harms splits costs and income 50-50 with the landlord on the land he does not own. The landowner pays the taxes, while the farmer is responsible for the machinery.
Dry weather has hurt production for most of the past six years in this part of the country. The conditions have diminished not just the crops, but also a sense of camaraderie among some farmers. In a trend that angers many farmers, some tenant farmers now quietly make pitches to a neighbor's landlord to work the land for a fraction less than the current tenant.
"It's getting cutthroat," said Mr. Harms.

HEADLINE: Weicker Plans Partial Closings of State Agencies

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said today that he planned a limited shutdown of many state agencies beginning next month -- in some cases, as often as one day in every two weeks -- thus cutting paychecks and hours worked for more than 11,000 state workers. He said that another 1,277 employees would be laid off completely, in addition to the more than 2,400 already given their notices last month.
Mr. Weicker, who made the announcement at a grim meeting of state commissioners and agency heads at the Capitol, said the cuts were forced by the intransigence of the leaders of the state employee unions in resisting pay and benefit concessions. He said the layoffs and cuts could all be rescinded if an agreement is reached, but he expressed little hope. The unions and the state broke off talks last week, and the unions reasserted on Wednesday at a meeting in the Governor's office that their final offer was still their final offer. 
"When the gauntlet gets thrown down, take it or leave it," Mr. Weicker said. "I chose to leave it."
Aides to Mr. Weicker said that the new layoff notices would begin going out immediately. The first 200 of those who received their notices last month lost their jobs today, and a much larger group faces unemployment at the end of the next pay period in two weeks.
"It's obviously going to impact in terms of the services the state can deliver," Mr. Weicker said. "But I've got news for you: no money, no services."
Mr. Weicker, a third-party governor, has demanded that 19,000 state workers who got raises on July 1 give those raises back to the state, as he said they had agreed to do last spring as part of a $346 million concession package. The unions, acting as a bargaining unit representing all 45,000 state employees, have offered to defer future pay raises, which they say was the spirit of the original agreement, but not to turn back the clock.
The president of the Connecticut Employees Union Independent, Steven Perruccio, said that his union would file a lawsuit against the state over the partial closings, which he said violated the union's contract.
 
Unanswered Phones
 The exact shape the closings will take is not clear yet; each state agency has until Nov. 1 to file its plans for implementing the office closings. But Mr. Weicker conceded that his decision would be felt by just about everyone -- from the workers who will see smaller paychecks from the state just in time for Christmas to the residents who will endure longer lines at state agencies, telephones that are not answered and buildings that are not cleaned.
The closings and layoffs announced today -- in addition to layoffs ordered last month -- will save about $86 million of the $346 million that the unions had agreed to in the original concession package. The remaining $260 million, including deferred payment to the state employee pension plan, would still have be exacted from the unions.

HEADLINE: Leonard A. Rapping Dies at 57; Adviser and Economic Theorist

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Leonard A. Rapping, an economist who advised several Federal agencies and helped develop theories on the interplay of human behavior and business cycles, died Tuesday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
Dr. Rapping, a resident of Newton, Mass., was 57 years old. He died of heart failure, his family said. 
 With Robert E. Lucas Jr., his co-author, Dr. Rapping helped lay the foundation for what was called equilibrium business cycle theory. It holds that the financial expectations of business executives and consumers help mold their decisions and therefore influence economic outcomes.
That theory was applied to help analyze the 1970's phenomenon of "stagflation," in which prices rose despite economic stagnation and recession.
 
Was Working on Book
 At the time of his death, Dr. Rapping was completing a book for the Twentieth Century Fund on the social and economic effects of the slowdown in American wages in recent years. He was an author of numerous books and journal articles.
Early in his career, Dr. Rapping held a laissez-faire view of government's role in the economy but grew to believe capitalism needed regulation. He wrote that a free-rein market is subject to "the confusion and chaos of the gladiatorial arena." He criticized President Ronald Reagan's supply-side economics, calling it a policy that "transfers money from the poor to the rich."
As a consultant and researcher, Dr. Rapping worked for the Federal Bureau of the Budget, the Defense Department, the Justice Department, the Labor Department and the Transportation Department. Other clients included the Center for Naval Analysis and Northwestern University's Transportation Center.
Dr. Rapping also served as director of the National Academy of Science's Panel on Technology and Employment and worked for the Rand Corporation.
For the last seven years, he was a professor at the University of Massachusetts and for 12 years before that was on the faculty at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He also taught at Brandeis University, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Nevada, San Fernando State College and University of California at Los Angeles.
Born in Indianapolis, Dr. Rapping was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of U.C.L.A. and earned his doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago.
He is survived by his wife, the former Judith Alt Wilson; a daughter, Alison of Washington; a son, Jonathan of Princeton; two stepchildren, Eric Wilson of Philadelphia and Arianna Wilson of Springfield, Mass.; a brother, Richard of Los Angeles, and a sister, Hanna Lee Jutovsky of Navato, Calif.

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Excerpts From Gates's Testimony on His Record at the C.I.A.

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks made today by Robert M. Gates, the President's nominee to head the Central Intelligence Agency, as transcribed by the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription sevice. Mr. Gates was responding to accusations that as a senior C.I.A. official in the mid-1980s he sought to tailor intelligence analyses of global events to support the Reagan Administration's foreign-policy agenda.
I think one of the lessons that the committee has already learned is that one thing all analysts have in common is some difficulty with brevity. And I will say that today I appear before you in substantial measure as an analyst, and I'm afraid I will be guilty of the same crime.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The committee's experience this last week with this subject of politicization in many ways reflects my own. This issue, as I indicated two weeks ago, has dogged American intelligence for decades. Indeed, I included in my answers to your interrogatories a long message to all analysts that I wrote on politicization back in 1985. . . . 
 Again and again, Inspector General Reports and studies by the directorate's product evaluation staff found pockets of perceptions of politicization, more often in the Soviet Office than elsewhere. But they searched in vain for evidence of slanting in our products. Evidence of politicization was always elusive, but the perception was always a worry.
I'd ask analysts, when I would go down into their work spaces to talk with them, if their work had been distorted. Ironically, many felt this happened more often at the branch and division chief level where their drafts were first reviewed, than higher up. But the answer was virtually always 'No.' But they had heard that that had happened for sure in the next branch over. And so I'd go over there, and I'd get the same answer.
I must say that I regret that this seems to lie, somewhat at least, behind the views of my old friend and admired colleague Mr. Ford [Harold P. Ford, former chairman of the National Intelligence Council, who testified in opposition to Mr. Gates's nomination], whose testimony suggests that he seems to have no complaint with me on areas where we worked together directly, but that he had been persuaded by negative comments from others. And that saddens me. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	No analyst who considers himself or herself to be the best-informed person on a subject likes to be challenged. Analysts like to write on subjects they like in the ways they like. And to be told that our specific subject, or the way you present it, is irrelevant to policy makers, or is not persuasive, is hard to swallow. . . .
The much-maligned review process takes the analysis of a single individual, challenges assumptions, asks questions and hopefully scrubs out the biases of the analyst, as well as others at all levels, thus turning the draft of an individual into the official view of the Central Intelligence Agency or the intelligence community. The process can be rough and tumble. Most analysts do well in the give and take. But some do not. And some see in this process political pressure, and that's why we're here today. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Thus it is deeply disturbing to me to hear attacks not just on my integrity, but by implication on that of many analysts, managers and leaders in C.I.A. and the intelligence community.
Indeed, charges as have been made by at least one person before this committee of a systematic, years-long effort to politicize and to corrupt the analytical process implies that former Deputy Directors Admiral Inman [Bobby Ray Inman, former Deputy Director for Central Intelligence] and John McMahon, the current acting director, Dick Kerr, the heads of all the other intelligence agencies and hundreds of analysts and managers in C.I.A. either acquiesced in it, ignored it, somehow missed it, or joined it. And that's ridiculous.
Moreover, it ignores the many instances where we published assessments unwelcome to the Reagan Administration in areas such as arms control, strategic forces, Lebanon and countless others even more controversial and contentious than the Soviets in the third world.
Before responding to specific allegations that have been made, let me set the scene for the period 1981 to 1987, because mood and atmosphere are important to our discussion here.
AN AGENCY IN CHANGE The early 1980's were a time of great turbulence for the directorate. In the fall of 1981, then Deputy Director for Intelligence John McMahon ordered the most sweeping reorganization of the directorate in its 30-year history. . . .
For the first time in their careers, the analysts found themselves working for people that they often felt did not understand their own analysis or particular skill. In short, there was predictable great disruption and a lot of unhappiness on the part of a lot of analysts who found their familiar worlds and surroundings turned upside-down. There were disruptive relocations of most people and offices. The Soviet Office was even moved out of headquarters to a distant building, with real and negative consequences for management and morale.
Now, four months after all this happened, I came along, charged by Director Casey [William J. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence in the Reagan Administration] and Admiral Inman to improve the quality of analysis and prepare to implement far-reaching changes in the way we went about our business, from more intensive review of drafts to bringing accountability to analysis.
Thus, not only did most people find themselves in different offices with different colleagues and new supervisors in early 1982, they now found changes in the analytic process itself. All of this meant that there were a number of unhappy analysts early in my tenure, unhappy about too much change from a comfortable, familiar past -- a phenomenon not unknown in other institutions. . . .
ADDRESS TO EMPLOYEES I addressed all of the analysts and managers three days after I became Deputy Director for Intelligence. That blunt speech set forth the problems we saw in C.I.A.'s analysis and the measures we intended to improve it. The speech set the stage, the agenda and the tone for my entire time as D.D.I. . . .
I addressed the problems as follows, and I quote from January 1982: "My assignments to the N.S.C. and the White House under three Presidents of both parties and close association with two D.C.I.'s have shown me our senior readers' side of the fence, the perspective of the policy maker. And there I have seen analysis that was irrelevant or untimely or unfocused or both, all three; failure by analysts to foresee important developments or events; closed-minded, smug, arrogant responses to legitimate questions and constructive criticism; analysts pretending to be experts who did not read the language of the country they covered, who have spent little if any time there, who were unfamiliar with its history or its culture, who were oblivious to academic or private-sector research on the country and who argued that none of that mattered; flabby, complacent thinking and questionable assumptions combined with an intolerance of others' views, both in and out of C.I.A.; a predilection to write history, as opposed to looking ahead; poor, verbose writing; a pronounced tendency to confuse objectivity and independence with avoidance of issues germane to the United States and policy makers; research programs too often glued together on the basis of what interested the analyst or was already under way, as opposed to senior-level consideration of the key questions to be addressed; and analysis that too often proved inaccurate or too fuzzy to judge whether it was even right or wrong."
I continued: "While there have been some improvements, as an insider and as one of you, I am obliged to tell you that from the standpoint of many of those for whom you write, our work has long been inadequate and still is not often held in high esteem. For those of you who did not read my article in Studies in Intelligence last year on the use of intelligence at the White House, let me commend to you the Presidential quotes at the beginning that are so critical of us over so long a time.
"To those quotes, you may add current criticisms" -- again, back in 1982 -- "from both of our oversight committees and a number of other former senior officials in both Republican and Democratic administrations.
The present Director and Deputy Director and both of their predecessors have been deeply concerned about the quality of the directorate's work. Moreover, individual senators and representatives from both parties have complained about the substantive quality of briefings and presentations before them. Unfortunately, in all too many cases, their concerns and their criticisms are justified.
"Obviously, C.I.A.'s analysts are capable of and do turn out high-quality work. But we also turn out work that is irrelevant, uninteresting, too late to be of value, too narrow, too unimaginative, and too often just flat wrong. In a business where being wrong just once can have enormous consequences for our national security interests, we have been too self-confident, too set in our ways, and too defensive in response to criticism, constructive and otherwise."
NEED FOR DIVERGENT VIEWS Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time, I will pass over the specific measures I announced in that speech . . . except for one that in light of the current discussion I think is worth repeating.
It was Point 11 in that speech, and I quote again: "In an intelligence organization, it is essential that voices crying in the wilderness, those who hold unorthodox or minority views, be heard. Beginning immediately, any analyst who believes his office publications, agency publications or other formal channels are not addressing key substantive issues, problems or divergent views in his or her area of responsibility, is invited to send me a memorandum setting forth these concerns and alternative views.
"This is a serious undertaking for people with serious misgivings or concerns. I do not expect this opportunity to be abused with frivolous subjects or trivial disputes within organizations. This measure should help insure that bureaucratic hierarchies do not limit expression of serious views by experienced analysts. And I personally assure you that no analyst will be penalized or suffer for taking advantage of this opportunity. Indeed, such conscientiousness should be welcomed."
I concluded the speech with this paragraph: "As these 11 actions and others which likely will follow over time suggest, I intend to insure that the primary focus of you and your managers is kept on the single purpose for our existence: produce the best-quality intelligence available anywhere. That is my only goal."

 	 	 		. . .	 	SOVIET POLICY IN THE THIRD WORLD Before addressing specific allegations of slanted intelligence, I want to speak about the subject area on which most of the allegations are focused: the relatively narrow area of Soviet policy in the third world, and, I might add, that part of the Soviet office from which nearly all of the allegations before this committee emanate.
C.I.A.'s work on this subject in the 1970's, in my view, and in the view of many policy makers in the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations, had been flabby. C.I.A.'s analysts missed the likelihood and significance in 1975 of the massive Soviet supply of military hardware to Angola, where it was married up with tens of thousands of Cuban soldiers. The agency missed similar developments in Ethiopia in 1977 and failed to foresee the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. They downplayed the Soviet role in the flow of arms through Cuba to Central America.
They obscured in the 1970's and early 1980's the reality that the Soviets were prepared to put at risk their relationship with the United States rather than forego opportunities in the third world. As one agency evaluation made clear, instruments of Soviet foreign policy such as covert action and disinformation were dealt with only in passing, and the seamy side of Soviet activities, such as assassination or support for terrorism, were avoided.
The need for more rigorous work was evident. Surveys of users of intelligence suggested it was our weakest area. . . .
Now to the allegations:
ATTEMPT TO KILL POPE One: I am alleged to have believed the Kremlin was behind the attempted assassination of the Pope in 1981; to have ordered study with no look at evidence of Soviet non-involvement; to have rewritten personally the key judgments and summary, removing all references to inconsistencies and anomalies; to have dropped a scope note advising that the paper made no counter-arguments against Soviet complicity; and to have written a covering transmittal note unknown to the authors saying that the Soviets were directly involved in portraying my views as C.I.A. consensus.
Now the facts: According to Mr. Lance Haus, the project manager, Kay Oliver, who was one of the drafters, and others, I told Haus that Casey was convinced of Soviet involvement in the assassination attempt, but that I was agnostic and I expected him to be agnostic also. And that was the view I took before this committee when I testified here in February of 1983.
Mr. Haus acknowledged that he killed the scope note as no longer relevant, and also that he wrote the transmittal letter, a letter which incidentally did not state unambiguously, or any other way, that the Soviets were directly involved. Indeed, the letter specifically says that questions remain and probably always will. Several participants recall that I was the one who urged adding the section of the paper pointing out the inconsistencies, weaknesses, anomalies and gaps in the case for Soviet involvement. . . .
The same participants recall no orders from me, or anyone on the seventh floor [the C.I.A.'s executive offices] to build a case against the Soviets. Rather, the suggestion, in light of new reporting, was simply to look at the new evidence with a focus on the Bulgarian connection. I did not rewrite the key judgments. Based on the evidence, the allegations that I drove this paper to its conclusions and then knowingly misrepresented it to policy makers are false.
WEAPONS IN AFGHANISTAN Two: It has been alleged that I introduced into agency publications, without supporting evidence, that the Soviets used lethal chemicals in Afghanistan. In fact, the best we can reconstruct, there was one item in the National Intelligence Daily in the late summer of 1985 suggesting this possibility. I was out of town at the time; the item was initiated by analysts in the Soviet Office, and I had nothing to do with it. The allegation is false.
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS Three: It has been alleged that I introduced into agency publications, without supporting evidence, information portraying increased contra successes between 1984 and 1986. In fact, I refer the committee to the national estimate of February 1985, "Nicaragua Prospects for Sandinista Consolidation," and another estimate, in March 1986, "Nicaragua Prospects for the Insurgency." In the key judgments of both, you will find descriptions of serious contra problems and forecasts of further declines in effectiveness and unlikelihood of real improvement in contra performance. . . . The allegation is false.
DRUG DEALERS AND TERRORISM Four: It has been alleged that I wanted an intelligence product that linked drug dealers and terrorists.
In reality, we have heard outside experts contend this linkage existed, and I asked our people to look into it. Two major intelligence assessments, one in November 1983 and another in March 1986, and a national estimate in November 1985, all generally concluded that while there was some reporting of a narcotics dealer-terrorist connection, terrorist groups were not systematically involved in drug trafficking, and were less likely to do so than insurgents. The allegation . . . is demonstrably false.
IRAN AND TERRORISM [Five:] It has been alleged that in response to my pressure in 1985 and '86, directorate publications in November '85, January '86 and May 1986, said that Iran's support for terrorism was down substantially and that Iran was becoming more pragmatic, all with a view of creating a climate for selling arms to Iran.
The facts are as follows: In November 1985, the publication of our Near East Office, a publication by the office that I did not review as Deputy Director, said that if the Iranian radicals won in an internal power struggle, there would be an upsurge in Iranian-sponsored terrorism, which had dropped off substantially in 1985. A formal assessment by our Near East Office, in January of 1986, noted that direct Iranian involvement in terrorism reached a peak in 1983 and '84, but since then had seemed less directly involved.
The terrorism review, another publication I did not review, of Jan. 13, 1986, clarified the picture by noting that while the level of Iranian-supported terrorism was high in 1985 -- high -- the number of incidents directly linked to Iranian-supported groups dropped compared to 1983 and '84. . . .
In sum, these and other publications during this period repeatedly stressed that Iranian-sponsored terrorism remained at a high level in 1985, and that Iran remained a major terrorist threat, particularly to the United States. The allegation that I directed an abrupt departure from previous D.I. analysis on this issue is false.
MOSCOW AND TERRORISM Six: It is alleged that in 1985 I wanted an agency document to assert that Syrian, Libyan and Iranian support for state terrorism was coordinated by Moscow, and that over the objections of senior Soviet analysts, I endorsed a national estimate and a monograph by an independent contractor to accuse the Soviets of coordinating terrorist activities.
The facts are quite different. I approved a proposal to have an outside analyst examine the idea that Syria, Iran and Libya were collaborating to harm U.S. interests and that the U.S.S.R. was encouraging this. The drafter of the national estimate on this subject was an experienced C.I.A. analyst, not the outside contractor. That estimate, a special national estimate issued in April 1985, entitled, "Iran, Libya, Syria: Prospects for Radical Cooperation," focused on the radical states. . . . The estimate reviewed what the Soviets would and would not do to support them, and the only intelligence agency to dissent was the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. The estimate was carefully drafted to avoid overstatement, and it was useful. The allegations about this estimate are false.
KILLING OF A DRAFT PAPER Seven: It is alleged that I killed an estimate draft in 1982 on the Soviets and the third world, and another such paper in 1985.
The facts are as follows: As Deputy Director for Intelligence, and in February 1982 only Deputy Director for Intelligence, I was in no position bureaucratically to kill an N.I.E. The Director, Deputy Director Inman or the chairman of the National Intelligence Council, Harry Rowen, were the only ones who could do that. On request, I read the draft and I offered my reaction.
That memorandum has been declassified. But let me just read you one excerpt to give you the flavor. This memo, dated 14 February:
"In sum, the estimate is basically a snapshot with a great deal of detail on problems and opportunities confronting the Soviets in the third world. But what I find lacking is any sense in the change in the Soviet approach to the third world over the last several years,and that pulls together for the policy maker something more than the specifics we've been feeding them for the last three or four years, something that provides a synthesis of what it all means in terms of larger Soviet imperatives and motives in that part of the world."
Now, there was an N.I.E. on the Soviets in the third world; it was done in September 1984. . . . It stated that Soviet prospects would depend on factors beyond their control, some factors; and concluded that they would seek as vigorously as in past years to press their strategy of third world penetration. There were no dissents. The allegation that I killed the 1982 draft to block analysis of constraints on the Soviets in the third world is false.
BLOCKING OF A MEMORANDUM Eight: It is alleged that I blocked a memo showing indicators of Soviet activity in the third world either stagnant or declining -- measures, such as reduced ship days out of area waters, stagnant economic or military aid, and fewer advisers abroad.
In fact, while I may have found a specific paper inadequate, during the period 1983 to 1987 the directorate published a number of assessments dealing with these issues. I submit a partial listing for the record, including four papers by the Soviet Office. . . . The allegation is false.
MIG'S FOR SANDINISTAS Nine: It is alleged that I stopped a paper concluding that the Soviets would not send MIG fighters to the Sandinistas.
In fact, the pros and cons of this and the constraints on the Soviets had been reported, and my note simply said that the paper did not go beyond what we have already said.
Let me read part of it into the record: "My view is that there are no considerations in this memo that policy makers have not already thought of or that we have not already presented to them in one form or another. . . . Don't get me wrong: The bottom line of the memo, that the Soviets will not be sending the MIG's in the foreseeable future may well be true. In fact, I may lean in that direction in my own mind. I simply do not find the paper to be a significant contribution beyond what has already been provided. I also find it very loose, both analytically and editorially." The allegation is false. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	BLOCKING RESEARCH Ten: It is alleged that I blocked a major research effort in 1984 documenting Afghan insurgent failures against Soviet forces. Supposedly my view that mujaheddin successes would lead to more dramatic Soviet action served to block analysis of insurgent shortcomings and Soviet limitations.
What really happened? I said more research needed to be done to determine whether in fact the insurgency was gaining or losing ground in Afghanistan. That seemed to me to be relevant to next steps by the Soviets.
 My memo to the director of the Soviet Offdice on this paper has been declassified, but, again, let me just read an excerpt or two. . . "It sems to me that the first step in looking at what the Soviets might do is to assess the level of insurgent activities, say over the last two years. . .
 "I would argue that if the data shows there has not been a significant increase in insurgent activities over the last couple of years, then the motives for a significant increase in Soviet resources devoted to the war are less compelling. On the other hand, if those data show steady or steep increases in insurgent activity and Soviet losses. then the motivation for doing something different ina significant way is heightened.
"In short, I find the paper superficial and unpersuasive. . . . Let's get our fingers down into the dirt and get some information on which we can base our speculation."
SOVIET UNION AND IRAN Eleven: It is alleged that I rejected in 1985 directorate analysis documenting Soviet problems in Iran, and personally was responsible for the inaccurate assessment in the Iran special national estimate in May 1985.
In fact, a major paper was published by the directorate in May 1985, entitled "Iran: The Struggle to Define and Control Foreign Policy," that explicitly addressed opposition in Iran to improved relations with the Soviet Union, especially among clerics and conservatives. But the directorate paper also acknowledged indications of efforts by pragmatists in Iran to improve ties with the Soviet Union because of their belief that Iran was threatened by U.S. actions, the U.S.-Iraqi rapproachment of 1984, the course of the war with Iraq and a deteriorating internal political situation.
With respect to the May 1985 estimate, every single member of the National Foreign Intelligence Board approved that estimate. . . .
INFLATING LOSSES Twelve: The Directorate of Intelligence is accused of inflating Soviet aircraft losses in Afghanistan over a three-year period in order to support my views on Soviet losses.
In fact, how to measure Soviet aircraft losses was a source of great conflict between our Near East Office, which thought that all sources of information should be taken into account, and the Soviet Office, which argued that only one source should be relied upon. From 1980 to '85, the Near East Office methodology was used. After that, the Soviet Office refused to coordinate on the numbers and, I regret to say, the directorate essentially no longer offered estimates on Soviet aircraft losses.
This was a dispute among technical experts. The inference that I was involved is false.
DISPUTE ON ANALYSES Thirteen: It is alleged that I allowed a Directorate of Operations officer involved in the Iran initiative to provide his own reports to the N.S.C. and then to submit his own analysis of these reports to the President's Daily Brief, thereby making U.S. policy makers, including the President, recipients of C.I.A. disinformation.
In fact, the D.O. officer in question states that he briefed the N.S.C. on only one occasion, and he briefed the N.S.C. principals on Nov. 25, 1986 at Mr. Casey's behest. He adds that he never got from me nor was given by me permission to disseminate anything. . . .--
A search of all Presidential Daily Briefs in 1985 and 1986 has turned up no such article by this officer. . . . This allegation that I allowed a President to get C.I.A. disinformation is a particularly reckless and pernicious charge and is refuted by the man supposedly involved.
Relatedly, the allegation is made that there was an effort to exaggerate the influence of so-called Iranian moderates and thus justify U.S. arms sales. In fact, as I testified two weeks ago, all N.I.E.'s and C.I.A. publications throughout this period emphasized that there was no faction in Iran interested in improving relations with the United States. . . .
REWRITING JUDGMENTS Fourteen: It is alleged that in 1981 Director Casey directed me to rewrite the key judgments and change the text of an estimate to show extensive Soviet involvement in international terrorism. Then a rewrite of the estimate was ordered expanding the scope of the paper and implied despite evidence to the contrary Soviet support for European terrorist groups.
The facts are as follows: In 1981, I had no position supervising any analytical component. As Mr. Casey and Admiral Inman's chief of staff, I saw a draft of the estimate and I told them that it successfully and effectively disproved Secretary of State Haig's charge that the Soviets direct international terrorist organizations. . . . I also said it missed an opportunity to review indirect Soviet assistance, such as money, weapons, training, safe haven and safe passage. They then ordered a re-draft.
And here is what the House Intelligence Committee had to say about the final product, in a report that they issued in September 1982: "The committee and its staff examined both the product and the process carefully -- very closely. As the subcommittee chairman later stated in a letter to the Deputy Director for Central Intelligence, the staff concluded that, quote: 'After an indisputably difficult production process the result was a very high quality product.' . . .
That N.I.E. stands as a fine example of intelligence performance under difficult circumstances."
The allegations against me on this Estimate are false. . . .
TAKING FOOTNOTES Fifteen: It is alleged that I did not permit D.I. analysts to take footnotes in National Estimates.
In fact, between 1983 and 1986 the directorate had at least 16 footnotes in National Estimates and was included on a number of occasions in alternative language where the identities of agencies were not cited. . . .
ALTERING CONCLUSIONS Sixteen: It is alleged that well-documented conclusions concerning the failure of Soviet efforts to gain influence in Teheran were radically altered in 1985 without any change in the evidentiary base.
In fact, the May 1985 Special Estimate on Iran, the National Intelligence Daily of 16 May 1985 and the C.I.A. assessment of Iranian foreign policy in May '85 focused instead on new specific evidence of Iranian interest at that time in improving relations with the U.S.S.R. and described the motives as well as the opposition.
REMOVING AN OFFICIAL Seventeen: It is alleged that I ordered the senior intelligence officer for Soviet foreign policy to be removed from the Office of Soviet Analysis.
In fact, the director of that office has written that I did not order the removal of anyone, although I did express dissatisfaction with the product of the Third World Activities Division and its, "thumb in your eye," unquote, product style.
Mr. MacEachin [Douglas J. MacEachin, Chief of the Arms Control Intelligence Staff of the C.I.A] then added, and I quote: "I," Mr. MacEachin, "had found the division as a whole seemed to see each effort to address competing views as being driven by political motives. And therefore, when they did address competing alternatives, it was done with what tended to be a back-of-the-hand approach. The division tended to see themselves in a holy war with the Administration. I," MacEachin, "made the decision to move the division chief." Unquote.
And I would add that the officer was not removed from the office but from a managerial position. He retained his senior grade, supergrade -- to which I [had] promoted him -- and became the office's senior analyst on foreign policy. . . .
ESTIMATE ON IRAN Eighteen. The next allegations also concern the May 1985 Special Estimate on Iran. The charges are that the view that the U.S.S.R. was well positioned to increase its influence in Iran were introduced without consulting Soviet analysts in the directorate; that the conclusions of Soviet analysts were ignored; that the N.I.O. [for the Middle East] did not vet key judgments with the intelligence community until the first coordination meeting; that the N.I.O. informed participants at that meeting that I had approved the draft and it could not be changed.
This was discussed here yesterday. But let me offer additional facts to what Mr. Fuller [Graham E. Fuller, then the N.I.O. for the Middle East] said. On May 13th, the day before -- the day before -- the community coordination meeting, representatives of all the relevant C.I.A. offices met to review the draft. According to a memo by C.I.A.'s representative for the estimate, Mr. Charles Herseth, the discussion focused mainly on the paragraphs covering the role of the U.S.S.R. and of the Iranian army during instability, sections which, as Mr. Herseth wrote, the -- N.I.O. had heavily redrafted on his own.
Herseth continues that "The differences between the draft and the changes I will propose -- at the coordination meeting -- are primarily factual and do not significantly alter the thrust of those sections."

 	 	 		. . .	 	The N.I.O., as he testified yesterday, recalls showing me the original Soviet Office contribution and his rewrite, and my preferring the latter. He substituted his language in the draft and, without my knowledge or approval, cited my agreement with that text.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I attended the National Foreign Intelligence Board meeting on this estimate and all participants praised the paper. The principal drafter of the paper noted in a memo that I tried to avoid an I.N.R. footnote on the internal situation, but I.N.R. insisted, and Casey ruled all views should be reflected.
I, along with Casey, McMahon and General Odom, then the Director of N.S.A., felt the difference of view represented by the footnote was so scant that it was unwarranted. After the meeting, I called the Director of I.N.R. who had not been at the meeting and persuaded him that this was the case and he agreed to drop the footnote.
There was no suppression of dissent and no outside pressure for unanimity. There was no slanting of analysis. . . .
MALAISE AND ANGER Nineteen -- and there are only 20: It is alleged that numerous Inspector General Reports over the past 10 years have described malaise and anger over corruption of the intelligence process.
In fact, Inspector General Reports have noted perceptions, especially in the Soviet Office, that politicization exists, and these reports have continued to this very day. But the Inspector General also stated that he was unable to identify concrete examples of abuse and indeed found many SOVA products that challenged Administration policies. They also noted that the perceptions problem seems greatest among junior analysts and that nearly all senior analysts and managers believe the integrity of the process had been maintained.
VIEW OF SOVIET UNION Twenty: Finally, it is alleged that Casey and I created an agency view of the U.S.S.R. that ignored Soviet vulnerabilities and weaknesses and failed to recognized the pluralistic political culture that Gorbachev [President Mikhail S. Gorbachev] developed in a relatively short period of time.
In fact, the documentary record speaks for itself. For myself, I call your attention to the memo I sent to the Deputy Director for Intelligence. . . .
I said on the 16th of October 1986: "I continue to worry that we are not being creative enough in the way we are analyzing internal Soviet developments. It seems to me we are looking at Soviet domestic and economic issues in terms of relatively straight line projections based on the methodologies and data sources that have dominated our analysis in the past without opening new lines of inquiry, asking new questions and exploiting previously underutilized sources.
"From talking with Soviet defectors and emigres and people who are in touch with middle-level Soviet officials in one way or another, I sense that there is a great deal more turbulence and unhappiness in the Soviet Union than we are conveying in anything we have written."
I went on: "To what degree, if at all, have we failed to give adequate attention to what Gorbachev actually has done? While we have talked about tinkering with the system, has he actually done a great deal more than that and set in motion even more to create the possibility of qualitative change in the Soviet system over a several year period? We seem to be focusing on changes in the Party [the Communist Party of the Soviet Union] and the Government. What about the economy? Are we missing some significant changes underway? I am concerned that we are so caught up in the day-to-day tactical and discrete changes he is making and measuring them against some larger objective called 'reform,' that we may not be pulling together all of the strands in such a way as to identify the cumulative scope of what he is up to.
"In sum, I am worried that there are a lot of questions that one hears from Soviet analysts and in discussions with various people that we are not doing any publishing on. I am concerned that we are in a rut and may not be recognizing significant change in the Soviet Union even as it is taking place. I am not arguing that all these things are true, I just don't see the issues being addressed in our publications, everything seems too pat."

 	 	 		. . .	 	Some of these analyses were controversial, and I raised a lot of questions whether Gorbachev was being cast in too rosy terms, but the Soviet Office's prevailing analysis that Gorbachev was a different, more reformist leader was accepted and reached policy makers. 

 	 	 		.. .	 	In sum, Mr. Chairman, a careful review of the actual record of what was published and sent to policy makers demonstrates that the integrity of the process was preserved. We were wrong at times, but our judgments were honest and unaffected by a desire to please or to slant. Our review process wasn't easy, but it was far from closed. It was rigorous, but it was fair. People who wanted to be heard, were heard. I was demanding and blunt, probably sometimes too much so. I had, and have, strong views, but as both Mr. MacEachin and Mr. Fuller said yesterday, I am open to argumentation, and there was a lot of that, and I never distorted intelligence to support policy or to please a policy maker.
Nevertheless, what has emerged in these hearings is clear evidence that the perception of politicization in some areas remains real and must be addressed by the next Director. . . . To change an atmosphere, a tone, is a tall order, and in the real world probably never perfectly attainable. Even so, there are measures that can be taken.
PLEDGES FOR THE FUTURE First, if confirmed, I would candidly and quickly address these issues for all analysts. I would stress the importance of integrity and objectivity of the product, the importance of insuring that divergent views are heard and conveyed to the policy maker, and emphasize to all managers that analysts are to be encouraged to speak their minds openly and that there should be incentives for doing this. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Second, all managers -- I believe all managers of analysis should have as a part of their own performance evaluation an appraisal of how well they encourage the above principles and values in their organizations, their openness to alternative views, and their willingness to support their analysts up the line once they've approved the analysis themselves.
Third, if confirmed, I would direct the Office of the Statutory Inspector General to pay special attention to problems of analytical process. . . .
Fourth, I believe issues relating to integrity of analysis, relationships with policy makers, and managing different points of view should be made a part of every training course for analysts and their managers.
Fifth . . . I encourage the committees to consider re-establishing something like their old analysis and production subcommittees that can focus oversight on the analytic process. . . .
Sixth, if confirmed, I would ask the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board for its help and ideas in this area.
Seventh, if confirmed, I would consider creation of an analysis council of retired former senior officers that could advise the D.C.I. and D.D.C.I. and the Deputy Director for Intelligence about the problems we are discussing. . . .
Eighth, and finally, if confirmed, I would solicit from the analysts and the managers of analysis themselves their own ideas on how to rebuild morale, insure integrity and independence, how to avoid self-censorship, and deal with the perceptions of politicization. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	The proof that the integrity of analysis was preserved is in the quality of the people that produced the assessments and in the documents themselves, the nearly 2,500 major assessments and estimates produced while I was D.D.I. and deputy D.C.I. I am fully prepared to stake my reputation and integrity on the body of that work. I was, and am, proud of it, and proud to have been associated with the people who produced it.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Most important, President Bush, with whom I have worked so closely during these revolutionary times, has spoken publicly and repeatedly of his confidence in my integrity and my ability to lead the C.I.A. and the intelligence community. This uncommon relationship between us and his expectations, having himself been Director, offer a unique opportunity to remake American intelligence, and to do so while preserving and promoting the integrity of the intelligence process in a strong and positive relationship with the Congress.
Thank you.

HEADLINE: Arkansas' Clinton Enters The '92 Race for President

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Oct. 3

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas entered the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination today with an unstinting indictment of a decade of Republican domestic policies and a promise to restore the American dream for "the forgotten middle class."
The 45-year-old Governor offered himself as someone who could "reinvent government," infuse it with the values that Americans hold dear, and use it to address the problems that plague this nation, from crime to economic decline. 
 He promised an administration that would broaden opportunity for Americans through better schools, more college scholarship programs, tax breaks for the middle class and a healthier economy. But Mr. Clinton also said his style of government would expect more from Americans -- from welfare recipients who would be expected to seek work, to corporate executives who would face an irate President if they engaged in the excesses of the 1980's.
 
Reclaim the Middle Class
 Mr. Clinton, who has argued in recent years that the Democratic Party must refashion its message if it hopes to reclaim the middle class, tried to make the case for a more active, problem-solving Federal Government -- but not the stereotypical Democratic administration that the Republicans delight in running against. "A Clinton Administration won't spend your money on programs that don't solve problems and a government that doesn't work," he said.
Mr. Clinton is the fifth major candidate to enter the race for the Democratic nomination. His declaration today follows a month when the Democratic field suddenly came to life, after a summer when one leading Democrat after another backed away from a challenge to Mr. Bush. The new class of candidates, in contrast, scents opportunity even amid the towering Bush approval ratings.
Mr. Clinton presented his case against the Republicans today with smooth confidence and a trace of disdain. He asserted that the Republicans "have washed their hands of responsibility for the economy, for education, for health care and for social policy." Rather than leadership and vision, Mr. Clinton asserted, they had offered only "neglect and selfishness and division."
Mr. Clinton was particularly impassioned about the Republicans' record on race. The setting was appropriate, one of those historical ironies that so often crop up in modern Southern politics: He stood on the steps of the Old State House, the site of two conventions in 1861 that led to the state's secession from the union.
 
'Race Against Race'
 "For 12 years, the Republicans have tried to to divide us, race against race" Mr Clinton said. "Here in the shadow of this great building, all of us, we know all about race-baiting. They've used that old tool on us for decades now. And I want to tell you one thing: I understand that tactic, and I will not let them get away with it in 1992." His audience roared its approval.
Mr. Clinton, a fifth-generation Arkansan, seemed euphoric today as he finally said the words that he was expected to say for so long, "I am proudly announcing my candidacy for President of the United States of America." He was 32 years old when he was first elected governor here, a New South Governor with humble roots and an educational background that included Georgetown University, Yale Law and Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar.
He lost his first re-election campaign, but came back to win the governorship in 1982, and has held it ever since. He has, by necessity, built his Presidential campaign on his domestic expertise, presenting Arkansas as a laboratory for policy innovations, from teacher testing to welfare reform.
Mr. Clinton said little on foreign policy today, praising Mr. Bush's recent arms control initiatives and generally promising "to keep America strong and safe from foreign dangers and to promote democracy around the world." But Mr. Clinton argued that America's strength must begin at home, with the core American dream of education, home ownership and decent jobs. There, he asserted, is where the nation is now imperiled.
"Middle class people are spending more time on the job, less time with their children and bringing home less money to pay more for health care and housing and education," he said. "The poverty rates are up, the streets are meaner, and even more children are growing up in broken families. Our country is headed in the wrong direction, fast. It's falling behind, it's losing its way."
Mr. Clinton's lack of foreign policy expertise is just one of the hurdles he faces; he is also from a small state, and like most of his colleagues begins the race with little name recognition. He has also, in recent months, been forced to deal with a rumor campaign pressed by political opponents here an Arkansas.
Mr. Clinton was, until recently, the chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group formed in 1985 to push the party toward what it considers the political center. Much of his speech today and his campaigning of recent weeks have come from themes he articulated while chairman of that group, including the emphasis on values. At the same time, Mr. Clinton has tried to broaden his appeal in recent months.
Today, he defined his cause as "preserving the American Dream, restoring the hopes of the forgotten middle class and reclaiming the future for our children."
Mr. Clinton has also acquired a strong populist tone. "I'm not out to soak the rich," he said today. "I wouldn't mind being rich myself. But I do believe that rich people should pay their fair share of taxes. For 12 years, while middle class incomes went down, the Republicans raised taxes on middle class people. And while the incomes of our wealthiest people went up, their taxes were lowered. That's wrong, and the middle class needs a break."
Like many of his colleagues, Mr. Clinton tries to resist ideological labels. "The change I seek, and the change that we must all seek, isn't liberal or conservative. It's different and it's both." Mr. Clinton asserted that most Americans care little about such distinctions and simply want policies that work.
 
Generational Appeal
 In his resistance to labels, Mr. Clinton is like another Democrat who entered the race this week, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Like Mr. Kerrey earlier this week, Mr. Clinton made a generational appeal, asserting, "I refuse to stand by and let our children become part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than their parents."
So far, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey seem to be positioning themselves as future-oriented, fresh-thinking Democrats who are willing to challenge the orthodoxy, the kind of position Gary Hart sought in 1984.
The voice of unabashed Democratic liberalism in the race is Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, while Governor L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia offers himself as a blend of fiscal responsibility and compassion. Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts runs as a pro-business liberal. The other candidates considering a race include former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California and Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma. The Rev. Jesse Jackson is still considering his options.
Mr. Clinton's speech today was relentlessly focused on the strains of the middle class, but he closed with a poignant plea to remember the poor. He talked of his own childhood, which he described as poor but hopeful, shadowed by the death of his father before he was born but rich with grandparents and great-grandparents.
"It's a long way from that," he said gently, "to the children in the streets of our cities who have to worry about being shot going to and from school, who do bullet drills at school, and go home and worry about their parents' drug abuse." Mr. Clinton, speaking almost softly, beneath the old white pillars of the antebellum South, added, "I tell you, by making common cause with those children, we give new life to the American dream."

HEADLINE: New York Shifts on Welfare: Education Stressed Over Jobs

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
In a little-noticed but pivotal shift in New York City's welfare-to-work program, the Dinkins administration has changed a strategy of quickly placing welfare mothers in mostly low-paying jobs in favor of a more expensive -- and as yet unproven -- investment in education and training.
The city's Human Resources Administrator, Barbara J. Sabol, is betting that teaching thousands of women on welfare reading and a variety of skills will eventually lead them out of poverty into higher-paying jobs, improving their chances of staying off the welfare rolls and thus saving taxpayers money in the long run. 
 In sharp contrast, her predecessor, William J. Grinker, had begun requiring able-bodied women on welfare to look for a job or lose part of their welfare checks. He cited national research showing that low-cost job-search workshops placed enough women in jobs to reduce welfare expenses and modestly improve women's incomes.
 
Philosophical Opposites
 Mrs. Sabol and Mr. Grinker are on opposite sides in the welfare-reform debate. Like most other welfare administrators across the nation, Mrs. Sabol believes that society must nurture welfare recipients with education and training so that they can compete in a tough job market.
Her policy, experts say, is based more on hope than on hard evidence. Rigorous studies of intensive programs like those she favors are under way but have not been completed.
But if her approach works, it may help the more unskilled who are unable to find work through a job search, said Judith Gueron, president of the Manpower Demostration Research Corporation, a New York nonprofit organization that has become the nation's leading evaluator of welfare-reform programs.
Mr. Grinker maintains that welfare mothers are often able to help themselves, just as the working poor do, if required to look for a job, even if it pays badly.
Under Mr. Grinker, Mary Thornton, a mother of three who has lived on welfare for a decade, would have been required to attend a monthlong "job club." Staff members coach women in writing resumes and interviewing for jobs. The women are then required to hunt for jobs through classified advertisements in newspapers and the Yellow Pages.
Instead, under Mrs. Sabol's program, Ms. Thornton was invited to an H.R.A. office in the Bronx recently. In a brief interview with a caseworker, Nellie Vega, Ms. Thornton said her dream was to be a nurse.
"We have two programs suitable for you," Ms. Vega replied. One would combine study for a high school equivalency diploma with unpaid work in a hospital. The second would place Ms. Thornton in two years of nursing school after she got her diploma. Her tuition would be paid for with government funds.
Ms. Thornton seized the second choice. "That's my goal," she said with certainty. "I'm all for it."
 
The Long View
 City welfare records show that a monthlong job search is more likely than education to lead directly to employment, but the jobs themselves are often low-paying.
Mrs. Sabol acknowledges that 15 percent of the women assigned to job clubs generally find immediate employment, compared with about 5 percent of the women assigned to work/study or other education and training programs.
"Even granted that difference," she said, "we have to look over the long term and see what happens with clients who learn to speak English and get their G.E.D.'s" -- the General Educational Development certificates that are the equivalent of diplomas.
Mr. Grinker said he believes that more women will remain unemployed under Mrs. Sabol's new policy and simply move from training program to training program.
"A low-wage job is a hell of a lot better than welfare," Mr. Grinker said. "It's the first rung on the ladder that gives people opportunity. It teaches people how to come to work on time and what it is to be productive."
At a time when almost 1 million New Yorkers, about one-eighth of the city's population, are on public assistance -- the highest level since 1976 -- the city's latest experiment in welfare reform faces the challenge of breaking a deeply rooted pattern of welfare dependency in the midst of a prolonged recession.
"It's mind-boggling," said Catherine Zall, Deputy Commissioner of the city's Office of Employment Services, which runs the welfare-reform program. "Think of large geographical areas of the city where the predominant way of life is welfare."
New York City's welfare-reform efforts have gone through many incarnations over the last decade. In 1985, the city began what was then described as the nation's most extensive mandatory program to get women off welfare.
Under the program, women who did not volunteer for education or training were required to work part time in government agencies for no pay while they continued to get their welfare checks. At any given time, about 5,000 women were dispatched to work as janitors or clerks or in other low-skilled positions.
To get their work assignments, women on welfare from all five boroughs were summoned to one huge office in Manhattan. They were offered virtually no counseling and little choice about what work they preferred, Ms. Zall said.
"Work experience was a very blunt instrument," she said. "It was like an assembly line." The program cost $54 per welfare recipient and placed only 4 percent of them in permanent paying jobs, she said.
 
Choice vs. No Choice
 Mr. Grinker, who founded the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, took over the city's Human Resources Administration in December 1986 at the request of Mayor Edward I. Koch, bringing with him great ambitions to revamp the city's welfare efforts.
But it was not until April 1989 that Mr. Grinker began to carry out a new policy of requiring women on welfare to look for jobs. Mr. Grinker said he was distracted from welfare reform by crises in child welfare and homelessness. "It was a priority that had to take a back burner, much to my chagrin," he said in an interview recently.
A year later, in April 1990, Mayor David N. Dinkins appointed Mrs. Sabol to run the city's vast social-services apparatus. Six months later, she jettisoned Mr. Grinker's mandatory job search for her own program emphasizing individual choice.
Her more expensive, intensive program actually serves fewer than half as many welfare mothers as the workfare program of the mid-1980's -- 2,100 at a time, compared to 5,000 then.
 
New Federal Rules, Too
 Despite the smaller numbers, the city is able to meet the requirements of a new Federal welfare reform, which took effect last November and requires that a growing proportion of able-bodied welfare recipients with children 3 years old and above be placed in education, training or job programs.
In this, the first year covered by the Federal rules, at least 7 percent of the 106,000 eligible welfare recipients in New York City will have to enter a program or lose a portion of their welfare benefits. By 1995, 20 percent will have to participate.
Under Mrs. Sabol, the number of local offices for the city's welfare-reform program, called "Begin," has grown from 1 in Manhattan to 2 in Manhattan and 2 in the Bronx. The city plans to open 4 more offices in Brooklyn and Queens by January.
In the last year, the city has mailed out thousands of call-in letters for Begin. The letter starts with encouragement: "You have an opportunity to change your life. You've probably dreamed about leaving welfare; now you can make it happen." But it leads to a warning a few paragraphs further, in underlined capital letters: "YOUR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE GRANT MAY BE REDUCED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP THE APPOINTMENT."
 
Results Are Not In
 Mrs. Sabol softened the mandatory-participation requirement by giving women choices. What is not known is whether welfare mothers will succeed in school or job training or, if they finish the programs, whether they will get decent jobs.
To begin to answer those questions, Mr. Grinker's Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation is conducting the first large-scale study women who receive intensive education and job training do better in the work force.
The research organization has studied programs in Arkansas, San Diego, Virginia and Maryland and has found that job clubs, Mr. Grinker's favored route, have done well in finding employment for women and, as a consequence, have cut welfare costs and lightened the load on taxpayers. But they also found the strategy did not help the most disadvantaged welfare recipients.
Under Mrs. Sabol's program, about a third of the women participating in Begin are choosing immediate job searches while 40 percent are picking work/study or career-planning classes and about 25 percent are enrolling in classes to learn English as a second language.
Under Mr. Grinker, all but the non-English speakers would have been sent first to job clubs. Only those who did not find jobs would have been referred to education and training programs.
After receiving a recent call-in letter, Alicia Hall, who has been on welfare for 10 years, picked a job club, which requires her to make 25 telephone calls to potential employers every day. One afternoon, she scoured the Yellow Pages for potential employers and neatly noted on a pad each of her calls. She said she hoped to find an office job, perhaps as a receptionist.
"If it wasn't for job club, I wouldn't have pushed myself," she said. "I don't want to kid you. But I am ready to work. My youngest is 6, and this girl ain't having no more children."

New York Fails to Advance in Cup Bid

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
The organizers for the 1994 World Cup named 19 communities yesterday as the leading contenders to stage games in the monthlong soccer tournament. New York, the country's most populous city, was not among them.
In reducing a list of 26 bidders, the organizing committee placed New York on a "nonpriority" list of sites now virtually assured of no chance of holding games. The metropolitan area was not shut out, however. A New Jersey bid for Giants Stadium in East Rutherford and Rutgers Stadium in Piscataway, and the Yale Bowl in New Haven were among the "priority" sites that representatives of soccer's international federation will inspect over 10 days, starting Oct. 29. 
 Early next year, the contenders will be reduced to 12, after which consultations between the world body, the Federation Internationale de Football Association, and the organizing committee will determine the 8 to 12 sites and stadiums in which 5 rounds of 52 games will be played.
"These were extremely difficult decisions," Alan Rothenberg, the president of the organizing committee and the United States Soccer Federation, said during a telephone conference call, reflecting on the selection process so far. "We will try our level best to bring the World Cup to as many regions as possible."
 
Stadiums Hurt Bid
 In general, organizers took several criteria into consideration in developing the priority list. Included were the size and nature of the stadium, public and private support, population and the area's past and projected future commitment to soccer.
New York fared well in all but the stadium category, as organizers thought the arrangements necessary to play games in Yankee Stadium or Aqueduct race track -- the only sites under consideration in the formal bid -- would have been too onerous. The size of the field and sight lines were the problems with Yankee Stadium; constructing a field over a parking lot was the concern at the race track.
Don Smith, the president of the New York City Sports Commission, said that organizers were informed that Shea Stadium was also available but the formal bid documents included no reference to it as a potential site, only to sites "to be determined."
The New Jersey bid also posed problems but, apparently, not insurmountable ones. Giants Stadium would require construction of a platform, on which a grass field would be placed to meet the FIFA requirement that all surfaces must be natural. At Rutgers, discussions are under way to increase the stadium seating capacity.
Rothenberg did not necessarily view New York's fate as a loss for the city, never mind the economic impact staging games might have meant. "Our view is the New York metropolitan market as one massive, vitally important market," he said.
 
An Off-the-Field Role
 New York has already been assured at least some participation in the World Cup, having won the right to stage the Dec. 8 qualifying draw, a process in which 132 countries will be grouped for two years of continental and regional playoffs, producing the 22 countries to make the final rounds in 1994. As the host nation, the United States automatically qualifies, as does Germany, the defending champion.
Rothenberg also said that New York is in contention as host for the final draw, the FIFA Congress, which is a series of meetings, and to be the international media center.
These are the other areas still under consideration: Atlanta; Boston-Foxboro, Mass.; Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas; Denver (for a proposed stadium and Mile High Stadium), Detroit-Pontiac, Mich.; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles-Pasadena, Calif.; Miami (for Joe Robbie Stadium and the Orange Bowl); New Orleans; Orlando-Kissimmee-St. Cloud, Fla.; Philadelphia; San Francisco Bay (for Candlestick Park and Stanford Stadium); Seattle, Tampa, Fla., and Washington.
Along with New York, the other demoted bids were from Charlotte, N.C., Honolulu, Houston, Knoxville, Phoenix and Portland-Corvallis, Ore.

The Deal Is Already Done For Gorbachev's Coup Book

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
First came the coup of the Kremlin; now comes the coup between hard covers: President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has sold his account of the August uprising to HarperCollins for what some in the industry say is $500,000.
Giving new heft and meaning to the ever-growing field of quickie books, HarperCollins says it plans to translate the 74-page typed manuscript, print it, bind it and ship it to stores before the end of this month. 
 In a nation where Nikita S. Khrushchev, after his own overthrow, was forced to write his memoirs in secret and smuggle them out of the country, many Kremlin denizens are now tell-all graphomaniacs. Mr. Gorbachev; Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, and a raft of other Government figures are competing to publish their versions of the coup that failed.
And even though the Soviet Union is at one of the most critical junctures in its history, struggling to redesign its economy and Government, several of these leaders have already found time to write their accounts of the August events.
"We, without a doubt, have the publishing coup," said William M. Shinker, senior vice president and publisher of the adult trade division at HarperCollins. "After the coup, every publisher in New York was trying to resuscitate Soviet books on their back lists. But this clearly is the book to have."
He would not comment on widespread industry reports regarding the size of Mr. Gorbachev's advance. But people in the publishing industry, who insisted on anonymity, said colleagues in the Murdoch organization had told them that the $500,000 figure coincided with figures mentioned to them when they expressed interest in the book.
Publishers are also furiously trying to secure the rights to a coup memoir by Mr. Yeltsin, whose resistance to the plotters is credited with defeating the attempt to oust the Gorbachev Government. An aide in Moscow said Mr. Yeltsin was currently writing a book at a Government country house in Sochi, on the Black Sea.
Newsweek magazine has acquired first serial rights to the book, but the rights to its publication are to be auctioned at the Frankfurt Book Fair next week.
 
Murdoch Is Summoned
 HarperCollins received a telephone call from the Soviet Embassy in Washington last week, asking that Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, the publisher's parent company, fly to Moscow to meet with Mr. Gorbachev about publishing his book, Mr. Shinker said.
Mr. Murdoch had personally acquired the memoirs of Mr. Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, titled "I Hope," during a trip to Moscow last July, but he was not able to make this latest trip. Instead, Eddie Bell, HarperCollins's chief executive in Britain, went to Moscow on Friday and returned with the manuscript of "The August Coup."
The book, which will be published in the Soviet Union by Novosti, is said to be an analysis of the events that brought on the coup, and the consequences of its failure. HarperCollins executives said the book would describe in detail the Gorbachevs' three days of incarceration in their Crimean dacha.
Mr. Gorbachev said after the coup, however, that he would never disclose everything about the events. Many people, including Soviet officials and leading cultural figures, say they expect few revelations in the book and describe it as Mr. Gorbachev's attempt to stamp his interpretation on the events. Mr. Gorbachev has been circumspect about his personal life and thoughts in all his interviews and published writings, including "Perestroika," the best seller published by HarperCollins in 1987.
"It will be an attempt to say everything but what we want to know," said Tatyana Tolstaya, a popular Russian writer, who is teaching this year at Goucher College in Baltimore.
Mr. Yeltsin's book can be expected to be more personal and explicit. His earlier book "Against the Grain," which was published by Summit Books and became an underground best seller in Moscow, broke many taboos about Kremlin politics and etiquette.
 
A Journalist in Demand
 Random House has commissioned a quickie book on the coup from Vladimir Pozner, a Soviet television journalist whose flawless English has already earned him a best seller ("Parting With Illusions," published last year by Atlantic Monthly Press) and regular appearances on Phil Donahue's television talk show.
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Foreign Minister who quit his post last December after issuing warnings of an encroaching dictatorship, tacked a coup epilogue to his book, "The Future Belongs to Freedom," published this month by the Free Press.
Even before the coup, leading and even middling lights of Soviet politics, culture and history seemed to have been caught up in a wave of literary confession. Yegor K. Ligachev, Mr. Gorbachev's longtime conservative nemesis on the Politburo, has pressed Western correspondents in Moscow for the names of literary agents in New York who could help sell a book he wrote.
And the obsession with writing has swept up some of the people arrested for plotting and carrying out the coup. Anatoly Lukyanov, the former chairman of the Soviet Parliament and a law school friend of Mr. Gorbachev who is in jail on charges he masterminded the overthrow, told a Soviet journalist that he has been writing love poems in his cell.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
On 20th Anniversary, Fans of the Islanders May Want a Divorce

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
The Islanders have little to celebrate as they begin their 20th season tomorrow night in Boston. Their milestone is burdened with millstones. They have more problems than some expansion teams -- and less optimism.
For sale since last winter, they have no buyer yet. Their best player, Pat LaFontaine, has demanded a trade and the team has tried, so far without success, to move him; meanwhile, he did not come to camp. The captain, Brent Sutter, has said he wouldn't mind a change of scene, although he did finally come to camp. The top goalie, Mark Fitzpatrick, still has a blood disorder that threatens his career; he is working out with minor league teams but his status is uncertain. 
 The team's spiffy new practice complex, which was supposed to open last season in Suffolk County, is unfinished because of financial problems. The team's new radio network is anchored by a New Jersey station that can't be heard at night inside many Long Island homes. Some gaps will be partly filled by smaller stations with limited range.
Perhaps, if fans are stuck in traffic on the Long Island Expressway and they can't tune in the play-by-play, they can get on their car phones and CB radios and pass the word:
The 20th-anniversary edition of the Islanders might be every bit as good as the team back in Year One, which won 12 games in a 78-game schedule.
This is not to say that every player is worthless. LaFontaine is a scoring whiz who thrives even without a supporting cast. His trade could bring one or more good players. Sutter combines discipline, intelligence, talent and effort. Patrick Flatley scraps on the boards and in the corners. David Volek has advanced play-making skills. David Czyzowski has a major league shot. Randy Wood cuts and drives to the net as well as anyone. On defense, Rich Pilon is a rugged checker whose comeback from a career-threatening eye injury helps him see the bright side of hockey life.
"There are a lot of people in this world worse off than me," Pilon said after a recent workout. "People in wheelchairs. People out of work. I'm in the National Hockey League. It's a business and I'm here to do a job.
"Let's face facts: We're not an overly talented team. And Paddy's not here. But we can win with hard work in the corners and good checking. We can win those games, 2-1 and 3-2."
 
Defense Might Be Good
 If they do, a major factor might be Pilon and his associates on the blue line, the strength of the team. Joe Reekie keeps the puck away from his net and toward the other end. Gary Nylund, recovering from a knee injury, can be physically dominating. Dean Chynoweth is young and big and strong and tough. Jeff Norton can rush the puck from one end to the other.
Ken Baumgartner is a team leader in the locker room and a brazen intimidator on ice. Two newcomers, Tom Kurvers and Randy Hillier, should add stability, experience and depth.
The main man in goal is Glen Healy, who played in 53 games last season. He said that the lack of turnover on the roster could have a positive aspect because "we know the system, we know what's expected."
"Of course, we would like to have a player like Steve Yzerman, but we don't, so it's no surprise we don't score," Healy said. "So we have to play as a tight-knit group of 20. Heart and hard work can go a long way."
The locker room has a new coat of paint and a new trophy case, but the stagnation on the roster brings apathy from the fans. A radio commercial for season tickets avoids mentioning any players.
 
Impact of Uncertainty
 Bill Torrey, the general manager, said during training camp that the possible sale made him reluctant to shuffle the "assets."
"In the past," Torrey said, "when I wanted to make a deal, I made a deal. Anytime anybody is in limbo, it just makes it another element involved, a factor in the team's life. You can't ignore it."
Don Maloney, the former Ranger star, is the new assistant general manager, replacing Gerry Ehman, who remains in a reduced role. Ken Morrow, a star defenseman from the Stanley Cup years, is a new assistant coach to Al Arbour.
Arbour has coached the team since 1973, except for the Terry Simpson era, which lasted less than two seasons in the late 1980's. He and Torrey still enjoy exalted reputations for their earlier success. But the impending change of ownership casts them now, at best, as Long Island lame ducks.
Perhaps symbolic of the franchise's uncertainty is the practice headquarters in Happauge. It is three-quarters finished, according to Timothy Mattimore, a lawyer and investor.
"The Islanders indicated they would be very happy if we would get it built yesterday," Mattimore said. "They are saying, 'Are you ever going to finish this project?' "
For the time being, the team continues to practice at Cantiague Park in Hicksville. The players dress in the women's locker room. On the way to the ice, they walk by a sign that reads "Caution: Plaster Falling."
 
Why Buy the Cable?
 This season, the new flagship of the four-station radio network is WPAT (930 AM), in Paterson, N.J. Also on the network is WGBB (1240 AM) in Babylon, L.I., WRHD (1570 AM) in Riverhead, L.I., and WFAS (1230 AM) in White Plains.
Fans out of radio range can always pay for SportsChannel, the pay-cable TV service that will carry most of the games.
But why buy cable with so many good tickets available? During a recent exhibition at the Coliseum, as the team skated through a listless 2-1 loss to the Devils, the organist tried to rouse the small gathering with "Glory Days," one of the Springsteen anthems from the early 1980's, back when the Isles were good.
The song is about youthful optimism and sports triumphs of the past and how fast that all slips away. A few fans clapped to the beat but most sat still as the music bounced hollowly about the building. Soon, the puck was dropped, the music stopped and play, such as it was, resumed.

HEADLINE: Trump Officials Return Fee

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Two of Donald J. Trump's top executives have returned $1.4 million they received as a consulting fee from one of his financially troubled casinos, after bondholders objected to the payment.
The Press of Atlantic City reported in today's issue that Stephen Bollenbach, the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, and Nick Ribis, head of Trump's Atlantic City holdings, set up a corporation to advise on restructuring the bonds of Trump's Castle Casino Resort. 
 Trump made a $1.4 million payment on July 31 to the corporation, the Financial Advisors Capital Corporation, as the first installment on a $2.7 million fee. Mr. Bollenbach told the newspaper that he and Mr. Ribis ended the contract and returned the money on Aug. 17 after bondholders objected to the fee arrangement and threatened to kill the restructuring deal. The proposed deal would give the bondholders half the equity in the casino, in return for their acceptance of lower interest rates on their bonds.
The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement said it would probably have filed a complaint if the money had not been returned.

Short-Term Treasuries Post Gains

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Treasury bill prices rose yesterday on hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates soon to stimulate the faltering economic recovery.
But while the short-term market benefited from the prospect of an expected rate cut, the long-term market languished; the 30-year Treasury bond closed slightly lower. 
 The 8 1/8 percent 30-year Treasury bond closed down 3/32, or 94 cents for $1,000 face amount, at 103 11/32. It yielded 7.83 percent, up from 7.82 percent on Wednesday.
The three-month bill rose, sending its yield down 8 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to close at 5.01 percent. The six-month bill gained to cut its yield 7 basis points, to 5.08 percent.
 
Employment Data
 Traders are betting that the Fed will cut interest rates as early as today, if the September employment report scheduled for this morning proves especially weak. The figures will provide the first official look at the economy's performance last month, and economists are projecting a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 6.9 percent for September from 6.8 percent in August.
The focus of any Fed interest rate cut would likely be the Federal funds rate, the amount banks charge one another for short-term loans. The target rate is now believed to be 5 1/4 percent, and it could be cut to a target of 5 percent -- the lowest since 1977.
The prospects of a Fed easing were bolstered by the weak money supply figures released yesterday, which showed that M-2 money supply in the week ended Sept. 23 fell by $3 billion.
M-2 is a broad measure of money in circulation, including cash, traveler's checks, checking accounts, bank deposits and Eurodollars. A decline in the money supply tends to show a slowing economy.
"The money supply is one of the main factors that has influenced Fed policy making in the last couple of months," said Jim Winder, an economist at Merrill Lynch. "The latest numbers are weaker than most people were looking for."
Adding to the sense of a sluggish recovery, the Labor Department reported yesterday on initial jobless claims in late September, and economists said they were at recessionary levels.
Factory orders fell 1.9 percent in August after a big July surge, the Government reported yesterday.
The White House has also voiced increasing concern about the health of the economy, adding another element of pressure on the Fed for easier rates, economists said.
Corporate bonds were aided by the RJR Nabisco Holdings decision to retire $1.8 billion of high-interest preferred stock with a new issue of common stock.
The move will leave the company with less than $15 billion in debt, lowering its overall borrowing costs. In response to the plan, all the big rating agencies said they might upgrade RJR's debt to an investment grade from its present junk bond status.
In intermediate maturities, the 6 1/8 percent two-year Treasury note ended 3/32 higher at 100 10/32, yielding 5.96 percent. The 10-ear 7 7/8 percent note was 1/32 higher at 102 25/32, yielding 7.47 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Lower in U.S.; Yen Posts a Broad Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar sank to a seven-month low against the Japanese yen yesterday and finished lower against most currencies in domestic trading after turning in a mixed performance in Europe.
Gold prices rose. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours bid for an ounce of gold at $357.25, up $2.25 from Wednesday's late bid. 
 The yen was the center of attention in the currency markets, appreciating against most other currencies after some recent weakness.
Dealers in Japan said the yen surged after news reports there that an unidentified Foreign Ministry official had said Japanese companies would remain competitive if the dollar fell below 130 yen. That suggested to some traders that Japanese and United States authorities had agreed to stand aside as the yen rose.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 131.15 yen, from 133.11 on Wednesday. That was its lowest close there since it finished at 130.95 yen on Feb. 22.
The dollar sank further in Europe and the United States. In London, the dollar was quoted at 130.83 yen late in the day and it dropped to 130.60 yen in New York from 132.60 yen late Wednesday.
Michael Guarino, senior manager for foreign exchange at ABN-Amro Bank in New York, said the yen might have been helped by the announcement that the Japanese Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, would resign in the wake of the Japanese financial scandals. He said the resignation could signal that an embarrassing series of scandals are being "put to rest."
"This also could be the correction that a lot of market participants have been looking for in the yen," he said.
The pace of dollar trading was tempered by anticipation of today's release of United States employment figures for September.
If the figures show more economic wekaness, many traders expect the Federal Reserve will take steps to encourage lower interest rates, a development that could depress foreign demand for the dollar. German markets were closed for a national holiday and that also depressed the level of trading in Europe.
Mr. Guarino said the dollar did not fall as sharply against other currencies because the German mark, Swiss franc and the British pound were being sold primarily against the yen.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Good Year For Money Managers

BYLINE: By Alison Leigh Cowan

 BODY:
AS a group, the nation's money managers are outperforming the market so far this year, buoyed in large part by a favorable climate for small and medium-sized stocks, estimates released yesterday by CDA Investment Technologies show.
CDA, which based its calculations on quarterly filings made by 525 money managers with the Securities and Exchange Commission, found that the portfolios of those in the reporting group had increased an average of 25.4 percent in the first nine months of the year. That is 5.1 percentage points better than the rise in the Standard & Poor's 500. 
 The top performer was Target Investors Inc. of Wilton, Conn., whose gain CDA put at 79.3 percent. Robert Zuccaro, Target's president, said CDA's estimate was in line with actual performance.
Though he invests in a range of health-care, financial and technology stocks, he attributed his standout performance to the one thing that all his picks have in common: they tend to be small to medium-sized stocks.
"That's our style," Mr. Zuccaro said. "We never deviate from it. Like any style, it comes into favor and goes out of favor and right now it's very much in favor."
One of his best performers was Score Board, a seller of baseball cards and memorabilia that is traded over the counter. He bought it in the low teens. It closed yesterday at $27.25.
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., last place in the rankings and the only money manager that showed any loss for the period, was down 3.9 percent for the year. A Dean Witter spokeswoman said she would look into CDA's figures but had not called back by late yesterday.
While CDA's numbers have proved a decent indicator over time, the methodology has shortcomings. For instance, CDA assumes that money managers finish the quarter with the same stocks they began it with, and that they were fully invested. Those assumptions distort the stated performance of any manager who traded actively in the quarter or had assets sitting in cash.
CDA also does not track foreign equities, small holdings, stocks of bankrupt companies whose value is negligible and short positions. Short-sellers sell borrowed stock, hoping to profit by replacing it with shares bought later for less.
Another shortcoming is that managers who hold only a few stocks or who keep to one or two industries dominate the top and the bottom of the rankings, since their holdings tend to be more volatile than a well-diversified portfolio.
Two of the three worst performers did not quibble with their estimated returns, but rather they explained that CDA's methodology punished them for being specialists.
W. H. Reaves & Company of Jersey City, which placed third from the bottom, with a 7.4 percent gain for the nine-month period, noted that it concentrated almost exclusively in utilities and other defensive stocks that have had trouble vying for investors' attention since the end of the Persian Gulf war.
Kenneth J. Gerbino & Company of Beverly Hills, Calif., which landed second from the bottom with a gain of 2.1 percent, had the misfortune of having invested heavily in another out-of-favor sector: gold-mining stocks.
Mr. Gerbino, the president, said CDA was underestimating his performance since it gave him no credit for the money he was making on the short side or for two winners in Canada. One was a large position he had amassed in Continental Gold, which was bought out by Placer Dome last year, pushing the stock up nearly sevenfold. More recently, he scored big with his stake in Taseko Mines, the owner of a huge copper find whose stock has roughly doubled this year amid speculation that it might be bought out.
"CDA leaves out a lot," Mr. Gerbino said. That said, he was still less than thrilled at being featured so prominently near the bottom of the heap. "Don't worry about spelling my name wrong," he said.
On the other end of the spectrum, managers who had concentrated their bets in biotechnology and recession-resistant sectors were handsomely rewarded, especially after strong results by two biotech companies, Amgen and Chiron.
"One of the better eggs I've laid was selling Chiron after it acquired Genentech and the earnings were going to be negative for six quarters," said Louis Navellier, president of Navellier & Associates Inc. in Incline Village, Nev., which nonetheless placed second from the top. "It went up 20 points after I sold it."
He and Mr. Zuccaro both cited ECI Telecommunications, a supplier of digitized equipment that enables telephone companies to transmit data much faster than before, as one of their smarter picks. The stock has more than doubled since Feburary.
Mr. Zuccaro, whose computers keep tabs on 21,000 stocks, which are then subjected to rigorous screening before he will buy them, is also fond of Smithfield Foods, which sells premium-priced smoked hams and deli meats. In his view, the company's widening profit margins make the stock attractive even though it has about doubled this year. "It's a well-run business," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 9, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
The Market Place column in Business Day on Friday quoted an executive who misidentified the company that is merging with the Chiron Corporation. It is the Cetus Corporation, not Genentech.

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Excerpts From Questions and Answers at the Gates Hearing

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from questions and answers at a hearing by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence into the nomination of Robert M. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, as transcribed by the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service. Questions From Senator John Glenn Democrat of Ohio
 Q. What was Casey's view of the papal assassination? 
A. I think that Mr. Casey was persuaded by Claire Sterling's book, in particular, that the Soviets had in fact been behind, or at least knowledgeable about the attempted assassination of the Pope.
 Q. Were his views generally known throughout the agency?
 A. Yes, sir.
 Q. And do you think that colored any of the writing that went into the reports?
 A. Well, I don't know. My recollection is that everybody also knew that John McMahon, the Deputy Director, was just as equally convinced they weren't involved because of the poor trade craft that was involved. He found it hard to believe that the Soviets would associate themselves with such an amateurish undertaking.
 Q. You commissioned a panel in 1985 to review the issue, right?
 A. Yes, sir.
 Q. That was the Cowey, the so-called Cowey Panel?
 A. Yes, sir.
 Q. . . . The Cowey Report says: "But many of the people thought the paper had an unusual thrust for an intelligence assessment. They thought that calling the paper 'The Case for Soviet Involvement,' and marshaling evidence only for that side stacked the deck in favor of that argument. And ran the risk of appearing biased."
 Now, that was the Cowey Report. What was done after that? After that report came out? Anything?
 A. . . . The Cowey Report, I think, is explicit in saying that there were no directions from the seventh floor [the C.I.A.'s executive offices]. But people at lower levels were influenced in terms of what they thought the seventh floor wanted to hear. . . .
 I would say, also, that the Cowey Report was very explicit in saying that I, as D.D.I., tried to distance myself from it because I knew it would be -- that whatever the outcome of the report that it would be susceptible to charges of politicization, whichever conclusion it arrived at. And that may also have accounted for my basic agnosticism.
 
Whom to Believe
 Q. So, my problem here in knowing who to believe is a very, very tough one.
 Let me quote from Mr. Goodman [Melvin A. Goodman, a former CIA analyst, who testified against Mr. Gates's confirmation]. . . . It refers to the 1985 intelligence assessment on the papal-assassination issue as an example of the imposition of intelligence without evidence.
 Now, here's what he said with regard to that same assessment: "So what did Bob Gates do? Bob Gates rewrote the key judgments. Bob Gates rewrote the summary. Bob Gates dropped a very interesting scope note that said -- in trying to explain the methodology -- that we only looked at the case for Soviet involvement. We didn't look at any of the evidence -- and I might add, very good evidence from very sensitive sources -- that would have explained, the Soviets were not involved. He dropped that scope note."
 Can you go through and give your version of each one of those?
 A. Yes, sir. The committee has two sworn statements from those who were directly involved in the preparation of this paper -- Mr. Lance Haus and Ms. Kay Oliver. Their sworn statements make the following statements: That the paper did examine both sides of the argument for Soviet involvement, that the paper was appropriately coordinated and that the removal of the so-called scope note, the drafting of the key judgments and drafting of the cover memos were all handled by, and at the initiative of lower levels of the C.I.A. With no direction from me. . . .
 What I think you have here is the contrast between those with first-hand experience -- those who were directly involved in the events, and those who are hearing second hand about what happened. And I think the difference here is that Mr. Goodman was not directly involved and the two analysts who have submitted sworn statements to this committee were, in fact, those who were in charge of the project and actually did these things. I think that's the difference.
 Q. Well, O.K. Let me go through this. And I don't have a whole lot of time remaining now. But, did you rewrite the key judgments?
 A. No, sir. And these analysts say that I did not.
 Q. Did you rewrite the summary?
 A. No, sir.
 Q. Did you "drop a very interesting scope note that indicated that there were other sensitive sources that would explain the Soviets were not involved."
 A. Not according to these analysts, Senator.
 Q. Well, I'm asking you, though. I don't want the analysts' opinion. I want yours if you have it.
 A. Senator, let me say something that applies to a lot of other things before this committee.
 What I've given you this morning I certainly didn't remember. I put that together over the weekend, over the last few days from documents, from testimony from others, from what others have said before this committee, from the documentary evidence available at the agency and from asking questions out at the agency.
 As I indicated in my statement, I reviewed something like 2,500 papers and estimates. And I have to admit to you that when I left C.I.A. in 1989, I had no reason to try and stay on top of all these things -- and I probably never was on top of them in terms of remembering them.
 And so, to ask me what I specifically recall saying or doing about a specific paper without my being able to go back and look at it or my being able to talk to others who were more directly involved gives me a real problem. And it's not because I have selective amnesia. It's that I did a major data dump when I left C.I.A. There was no reason to keep all that information, in my mind. I never expected to go back to C.I.A. And that was all the past. So that's why I have to rely on the testimony of others.
 But you have two sworn statements, as I suggest here, of those who actually drafted the paper, making the comments that I've just described.
 
White House Ties
 Q. There is one other area that I'm concerned about a little bit. You . . . had a 1987 speech on the Soviet S.D.I. [Strategic Defense Initiative, a space-based missile defense program] and you endorsed the Administration's S.D.I. program. I remember when that came out I was concerned about that because -- and I'd like to find out what your rationale is for that. I don't think the head of the C.I.A. or a high C.I.A. official should become a flak for whatever Administration position that is on the Hill here or being considered.
 A. . . . I think that, as I have looked back on it, it seems to me that while the Director of Central Intelligence should not be barred from giving substantive speeches -- because I think some of the speeches that have been given in the past on technology transfer and proliferation and so on have been useful -- I think on balance that the D.C.I. should be very, very careful about undertaking such an effort. And it should be in a way that would be divorced from specific U.S. policies and certainly should not be susceptible to being read as advocacy.
 So I would expect to give very, very few speeches on substantive issues, but rather focus, if I were confirmed, when I gave public talks, on the nature of intelligence and the nature of our business and why it's a useful thing to do.
 
Questions

 From Senator David L. Boren Democrat of Oklahoma
 Q. Let me turn to another area which I find some discrepancy, or at least raises some questions in terms of the testimony we've heard since you testified, and that's the question of your knowledge about the role played by Colonel North [Oliver L. North, an aide to the National Security Council in the Reagan Administration]. . . .
 My question is this. On Oct. 9, you had this meeting with Colonel North. . . . I believe Mr. Casey was there, and the hostages plane had been shot down [in Nicaragua and an American, Eugene Hasenfus, had been captured and accused of flying weapons to Nicaraguan rebels]. And Colonel North, you said by your own recollection, you said that you turned to Colonel North and you asked Colonel North, "Is the C.I.A. clean in this operation?" You asked him in essence to certify that the agency was clean in this matter.
 Now, unless you really thought that Mr. North was in some way involved in operating, running this operation, that he had a lot more knowledge of it other than just encouraging the fund raising and encouraging their efforts in a general way. Why would you ask the question? Why would you think he could tell you or not why the C.I.A. was clean unless you thought that he had some role in the operations or unless you had some suspicion that he was involved in the operation?
 A. Mr. Chairman, I had earlier asked the Deputy Director for Operations if C.I.A. had had any involvement in the Hasenfus matter and had been told that we had not. And I saw this lunch as an opportunity to inquire of Colonel North whether he was aware, from his contracts with private benefactors, whether there was any chance that proprietaries or anybody else had been involved. I didn't, as I recall in the memo that I did afterward, I didn't just say is C.I.A. clean?
 I rather said did he have any reason to believe or any indication that C.I.A. in any way, indirectly or anything else, had any connection with this thing. And it was purely in connection with knowing that he was in touch with the private benefactors. The idea that he was quarterbacking this thing or running it, frankly, based on my own experience with the N.S.C. staff, just never even occurred to me quite honestly, that he was at the hub of this entire operation, as I indicated when I testified a couple of weeks ago. I'd served on the N.S.C. staff under some of the most powerful N.S.C. advisers in our post-war history, and the idea of somebody running a military operation out of the N.S.C. staff would have unthinkable under those circumstances.
 And, frankly, while I knew he was in touch with those guys, and so on, the idea that he actually had an operational role frankly I think was beyond the pale as far as I was concerned.
 
Budget Considerations
 Q. Two questions for you. One, in light of all the shifts that have occurred in the world and the decline of the likelihood of some of these threats and the reduction of the need for expenditure in some of these major areas -- some have estimated as much as 50 percent of the agency budget going into this area -- do you feel we can find real bottom-line economies, net savings, in the overall intelligence budget to pass on to the American people? Cut the total, to put it bluntly?
 And, in addition to trying -- if that's the case, do you think, in addition to making some net cuts that there should also be some areas that we increase? . . .
 A. I think there are two dangers in this. One is plucking an arbitrary budget number out of the air and saying, "That looks right" -- either higher or lower or whatever. The other danger is the one that you mentioned, and that is an agency adrift and in search of a mission and trying to find new work to do in order to justify its budget.
 And that's why I suggested at the outset of these hearings that I think what is needed on an urgent basis is a top-down review of what the priorities, missions of intelligence -- of American intelligence ought to be.
 Rather than the D.C.I. as a manager of bureaucratic programs going top up -- going up to the top and saying, "Here is the amount of money I need and here are all the justifications for it," I think it's appropriate for the President, his senior advisers, and, with some appropriate involvement in the process, the Congress, say: "No, here's what we want U.S. intelligence to do in the aftermath of the cold war and the breakup of the Soviet Union. These are the priorities that we want you guys to address, and you tell us what you need to do that and what the budget will look like."
 So I think that's why I've suggested this -- sort of what I'd like to call this Capability of 2005 study that I think ought to be done within a very few months on an urgent basis to identify for the new Drector and -- and -- and the intelligence community just what it is they ought to be working on.
 . . .
 I think one major area where -- where there could be some savings, I think we clearly in the intelligence community are going to have to look at the amount of work that gets done on Soviet conventional forces. And I think that there can be a lot of streamlining and I think it's time, because the threat of war in Europe has receded so greatly one thing that I would be willing to consider, for example, is moving C.I.A. out of that business entirely and letting D.I.A. handle Soviet conventional forces.
 I think the risks have been reduced to the point where competitive analysis in that particular arena is not so important. And that's a fairly major undertaking by C.I.A. And some of those assets could be used to look at political and economic and social issues inside the new republics of the Soviet Union, and so on. . . .
I think that there are some, perhaps, structural changes that can be made that would reduce duplication in the community and where -- where other agencies, as well as C.I.A., can do services of common concern and -- and where we can have a fair amount of streamlining.
 . ..
 In terms of areas where I think increases are likely going to be needed, I think that the biggest immediate threat to American security is the proliferation problem that Senator Glenn described, but I would broaden that to include chemical and biological weapons, as well as proliferation of ballistic missile technologies.
 Our capabilities on C.W. and B.W. now are pretty much confined to human intelligence, and I think that there is a need for some real investment in technical means by which we may be able to detect some of the precursor chemicals or some of these weapons where we are not able to get a human source. . . .
 One of the other concerns that I think we're going to have, at least in the near term, I think we are going to have to track very closely Soviet strategic programs, because both in connection with the arms-control agreements that have been signed, but also in terms of assuring ourselves that what they are telling us about control of these weapons to the extent we can determine is in fact true in terms of how -- how good the command and control over those 30,000 or so nuclear weapons is going to be. . . .
 
Questions

 From Senator Frank H. Murkowski Republican of Alaska
 Q. How do you respond to the allegation that you, as head of this agency and in your responsible positions, more or less had to go along with the policy of the Administration, which was, "We want to have a strong military capability because we believe this is the appropriate alternative for the United States, and we need all the supporting documentation and intelligence to go with it"?
 A. Well, Senator, I think that the record is very good that the agency called them as it saw them during that time. I don't think anybody at a senior level in the Reagan Administration needed any persuasion from us about Soviet activities in the third world.
 On the other hand, we did, I think, tend to hold them back at some times -- on some occasions when they thought that they could get the Soviets to do something that we didn't.
 
Soviet Pipeline
 A perfect example of that is our estimate on the Soviet export gas pipeline.
 The Administration was absolutely dead certain that they could stop the Soviets from building that gas pipeline, and it was deadly important. They put an enormous amount of diplomacy and pressure on the Europeans to get them to cut it all off. And we issued an estimate that said it wouldn't work, that they were going to build the pipeline . . . and there was nothing they could do about it.
 Similarly, Soviet defense spending . . . we issued an estimate in 1983 saying that the rate of growth in Soviet military procurement had leveled off and was at zero. Now, if you think Cap Weinberger [Caspar W. Weinberger, a Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration] welcomed that estimate at a time when he was trying to get a major U.S. military buildup, it was not a fun time.
 But let me cite a couple of other examples where I think we were wrong and I think others were right.
 The overall strength of the Soviet economy. I think we overestimated statistically how big the Soviet G.N.P. was, giving a false impression of the economic strength they had and their ability to sustain this military competition as far into the future as anybody could see. It was not through trying to underplay Soviet strength but by overstating it that I think we erred.
 . . .
 So what I'm trying to convey is that I think if you look at the overall picture of production on the Soviet Union by the agency during this entire period, it is a period where we got a lot right, we got some important things wrong, but people were basically calling them as they saw them.
 
Questions

 From Senator Warren B. Rudman Republican of New Hampshire
Q. . . . You read from a document that you had. It's not quite the same one I have here but it was to the director of SOVA [the C.I.A.'s Office of Soviet Analysis] on the Afghanistan exploring options, and it says in short, "find the paper superficial, unpersuasive, largely because the detailed digging which hasto be done to provide a factual base on which to make some judgments about Soviet perceptions of how the war is going has not been done." . . .
 Were you in the habit of writing notes that were this blunt to people?
 A. Yes, sir.
 Q.What was the general reaction you had to these? I am told that this is not atypical of your communications back and forth. What kind of reactions did you get from people at the agency? I mean, that's a pretty good assault on one's intellect.
 A. Well, Senator, the truth of the matter is, after I'd been reviewing papers for a couple of months, a couple of people, I don't remember who, came to see me and told me they ought to tone down my remarks on the papers. And so I did and that's what you have.
 Q. That's toned down.
 A. That's the toned-down variant. I think it is both an asset and a liability that I am a very blunt-spoken person. I will tell you exactly what I think and I won't mealy mouth around about it. I'll be honest, it is something that, as a management problem, I think I'm more sensitive to now than I was then.
 
Questions From

 Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio
 Q. . . . I think the real question is, what will be the aura, what will be the attitude of the American people towards a C.I.A. headed up by Robert Gates, against whom so many have been willing to come forward to indicate their concerns, to put their reputations, and in some instances, their jobs on the line.
 . . .
 Is that really the thing that we should be doing? You can vote yes, you might get 51 votes, you might get 65 or 82. But I say that no matter how you slice it, this entire matter, the fact so many have come forward with so many reservations and so many concerns, I believe has put that -- the image of the C.I.A. in question, and I'm not sure that we help that image by confirming you for this position. . . . A. The first point I would make is that it is not normal for the President to nominate a career professional. And the reason that he did that, that this President did that, I believe, is that he did not want the appointment to be in effect a political appointment, that he wanted the integrity of the process protected. . . .
 It has caused me some real pain that old friends like Hal Ford [Harold P. Ford, a former member of the National Intelligence Council who is now a C.I.A. contract employee and who testified before the committee on Wednesday in opposition to Mr. Gates's nomination] and Mel Goodman have come forward. And I agree with you, I think that takes some courage. But it has caused me great pleasure that the most senior, professional intelligence officers this government has known in a generation, the likes of a Bob Inman [Bobby Ray Inman, a former Deputy Director of Intelligence] and a John McMahon are willing also to come forward and be heard.
 The fact is that there is a confirmation process but the selection of the head of American intelligence is not a popularity contest. I sure as hell wouldn't win one at C.I.A. But the President thinks that I'm the right man for that job. I think the rest of his national security team believe that. And I honestly believe that there are a number of people at C.I.A. who believe that it would be a good thing to have a professional heading the agency again, and that with the President's confidence and his mandate we can make this change into the future.
 
Questions

 From Senator Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey
 Q. Let me, if I can, turn to another subject that we touched on very briefly in your first time here, and that was our exchange in the Committee on Soviet future, Soviet Union. . . .
 Basically, I'm asking that if you could go against conventional wisdom and say there might come a time when the Soviet Union might be open for some kind of change. And what kind of intelligence data, what kind of work should you be doing now to equip policymakers with the information they need if that point ever came?
 And your response to me gets down to, "Well, I think the first thing that we would be required to do would be to be able to identify for them that such a change was in the works, that such a change was approaching or possible, and then measuring whatever change there may be toward a qualitatively different system." Then jumping, you say, "Quite frankly, and without any hint that such fundamental change is going on, my resources do not permit me the luxury of sort of just idly speculating on what a different kind of Soviet Union might look like." Now, that ----
 A. What was the date of that exchange, Senator?
 Q. March 16, 1986, which is an important point. The date of that exchange is March 16, 1986. The memo that you have submitted today to the record is Oct. 16, 1986. So my question to you is, what happened in the interim?
 A. Well, what happened in the interim, first of all, was that believe it or not I actually gave some serious consideration to the questions you had raised. Events in the Soviet Union continued to lead me to believe, as I indicated in the memorandum, that more was going on than we might be seeing.
 I think that some of the work that the Soviet office had done on growing problems inside the Soviet Union and the process of the reform -- the way the reform process was going all led me to conclude that we weren't digging hard enough and that we weren't going into some of the sources such as defectors and emigres and others that would give us a better feel for what was going on inside the country.
 So I think it was a combination that we had -- events in the Soviet Union, analysis that our own office was doing, and so on.
 Q. So basically this memo in which you say that you're not being creative enough analyzing internal Soviet developments, and so forth, indicated to you that you had a problem within the agency in trying to keep track of what was going on, that the way you were going about it needed to be changed.
 A. In terms of the Soviet Union, yes, sir.
 Q. Now after you issued this memo, at another point in here, you say, "I continue to believe that we have not paid enough attention to emigre Soviet economists." And the question is, what did you do then?
 This is a memo laying out, you know, your concerns. What specific things did you do to act upon those concerns so that you'd be better able to track what was going on in the Soviet Union, in particular, the dramatic changes?
 A. I tended to be pretty careful once I became Deputy Director of Central Intelligence about looking over the shoulder of my successor. I obviously had been a very strong-minded Deputy Director for Intelligence. Mr. Kerr [Richard Kerr, the Acting Director of Central Intelligence] had been my deputy for four years, very capable man and I did not want to give him the sense that I was second-guessing him or double-tracking him or that I was trying to D.D.I. and D.C.I.
 So this kind of a memorandum on my concerns was fairly uncommon and I thought that by sending him the memo and by sending a copy of it to the National Intelligence Officer for the Soviet Union that in expressing some specific suggestions for how they might go about working this problem better, that I had probably stepped as far into his province as I should at that time.
 Q. Well, let me get to the point here. This memo shows that you had some concern that there had to be things done differently in the agency, that indeed there were rumbles in the Soviet Union that would have dramatic implications for this country. We might be spending less on defense, we might have a whole series of new opportunities.
 And then, what did you do based upon what was in this memo? Your answer is, well, you didn't want to tread on the deputy's territory.
 The end of communism occurred in the Soviet Union in August. Now the purpose of my question in 1986 to you was that so a policy maker would have on his desk the day that happened, if it should ever happen, some well-thought-out paths on how to deal with that situation. It ended in August. What did the President have on his desk the next day in terms of giving him the counsel that four to five years of thoughtful analysis could well have provided him?
 A. Senator, I think that while I would have to refresh my memory on the specifics, one of the things that occurred in the wake of this memorandum and my concerns was a conference that was held, I think under the joint sponsorship of the National Intelligence Council and the Directorate of Intelligence, I don't remember specifically, but on alternative futures for the Soviet Union. And papers were commissioned, a variety of essays were written on different courses that events might take and so on.
 I'd have to go back and get the specifics of that, but I do recall that there was such a conference and that papers were prepared and in other words there was some followup.
 Q. But my question to you is what was available to the President the day the end of communism took place in the Soviet Union? The purpose of the question five years earlier was so that if the event ever took place the intelligence community would have had a chance to think through possible alternatives and have them for the President to make a decision about.
 A. I don't think that there -- well, in addition to the papers that were done about alternative futures, under the auspices of the agency, in September of 1989 I asked that an interagency -- when I was down at the N.S.C., I asked that an interagency -- small interagency group, including intelligence officials, be put together to begin looking at contingencies for a variety of dramatically different outcomes in the Soviet Union. That work proceeded over a year and a half period, and a considerable amount of work was done by the agency, but also by State and Defense in connection with that effort.
 So I think that while I can't point to you a specific paper that the President said that here are the different ways that this thing could go in the Soviet Union and here is the different kind of Soviet Union you could see, I think there were some endeavors -- obviously, you can always do better -- but several different endeavors to try and have people thinking about -- exactly what you were talking about in March of 1986: What are the different courses that this thing could take, what are some dramatically different outcomes? And I think people had given a fair amount of thought to that.
 
Questions

 From Senator Alan Cranston Democrat of California
 Q. How much reporting from either human or technical sources was actually in hand in the areas being disputed regarding alleged politicization? If there was a large volume of reporting available which was ignored or subverted, I'd be greatly concerned. If, on the other hand, there was very little reporting from the field, then the arguments are over staked-out positions and assumptions, rather than over what the facts mean or meant.
 A. I think, with regard to the views of Iranian politicians and with regard to the initiatives that the Iranians took during the first part of the year to -- the overtures to the Soviet Union that took place in secret, I would -- I think that both our technical and human intelligence was reasonably good. There was a fair amount of evidence, I believe, on both of those issues, and including the issue of Iranian attitudes toward the United States.
 Q. Second, what was available in these terms in regard to the Soviet involvement in the alleged papal assassination attempt?
 A. There was virtually no evidence that I can recall, and I'd have to refer back to the analysts, but my impression is that there was very little information available in the first two or three years after the assassination attempt.
 As the Italian investigation proceeded and various threads were developed back to Agca's relationship to the Turks [Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk who was convicted of trying to assassinate the Pope] and his stay in Bulgaria and so on, I think that we began to develop some information. We then had a -- as I recall, a defector that -- and this is one of the problems that we had with a lot of the production on this issue -- the paper that was published in 1983 that said the Bulgarians weren't involved -- and by implication, neither were the Soviets -- was driven very much by the reporting of this one guy.
 Then we received some additional reporting over the winter of '84, '85 that in turn, I think, played a major role in the conclusions of the paper in April 1985. That was not the only body of information, but it was an important one.
 So I would say that we thought we had reasonably good human intelligence, but I think in retrospect we were too driven by too few sources

HEADLINE: National Forests: Going, Going . . .

 BODY:
The forests are sanctuaries not only of human life but also of the human spirit. And every tree is a compact between generations.
So declared President Bush in 1989. Yet Mr. Bush has done little more than his indifferent predecessor to stop the devastation of these sanctuaries. Logging in the national forests continues at a furious pace. And neither the President nor Congress has tried to strike a fair compromise between the needs of nature and industry. 
 Last week, two senior Forest Service officials with responsibility for millions of public acres told Congress they had been kicked out of their jobs for resisting orders to increase the timber harvest that they felt were environmentally unsound. Their defiance, they said, provoked the wrath of the timber industry and the White House.
Such charges of industry favoritism are a further embarrassment to an Administration still smarting from the spanking it got in May from U.S. District Judge William L. Dwyer of Seattle. Accusing the Administration of a "deliberate and systematic refusal" to comply with laws protecting wildlife, he banned further logging in parts of the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest until Federal agencies produced an effective protection plan for the endangered spotted owl.
Congress is now seeking a compromise to the old-growth dispute. But it obviously has a much bigger task: the need to rethink the purpose of the national forests and the role of their designated stewards, mainly the Forest Service.
Historically, Federal policy has favored exploitation of the national forests, which provide roughly 15 percent of the nation's wood. The Forest Service has long been in the business of selling timber. In 1976 a worried Congress adopted the National Forest Management Act, which urged the service to treat the forests as valuable ecosystems by balancing wilderness and industry values.
Yet the trees kept falling. One reason was that a big chunk of the service's budget comes from selling timber. Perversely, some of its conservation programs -- erosion control and plant and animal inventory -- are funded by timber sales. As a result, the service assigns targets to each of its nine national forest regions, rewarding forest managers who meet their "cut."
It's a cozy deal for industry because the timber harvested from public land is cheap. The Forest Service picks up road construction and other costs. That, of course, creates artificially low prices, reduces incentives to harvest private land and further increases the pressure on public lands. But loggers love it.
The Government has been equally solicitous of industry in the Pacific Northwest, whose majestic old-growth forests are coveted by loggers. These forests are also home to the spotted owl, and for years, conservation groups -- as anxious to save the forests as they were the owl -- urged that the bird be listed as a threatened species.
The Reagan Administration dawdled, knowing full well that if it protected the owl it would also have to protect its habitat. And when Mr. Bush reluctantly agreed to list the owl in 1990, his aides torpedoed an interagency plan to set aside millions of acres to protect the habitat.
That's what set Judge Dwyer off. He acknowledged the complexity of the issue and the hardship his decision might cause for logging families, whose anxiety borders on desperation. Yet he found it inconceivable that "the mightiest economy on earth" could not find a way both to manage its irreplaceable old-growth forests and ease the pain for workers, families and communities.
Judge Dwyer is right. But the courts are not the place to set policy in the Northwest or anywhere else in the national forest system. That is a job for the "environment President" and the Congress. And so far, both have failed.

A Fuel Cell That Utilities Might Use

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Physical Sciences Inc. of Andover, Mass., which researches energy technologies, has patented what it says is a highly efficient way to produce electricity by combining hydrogen and chlorine.
Although still a long way from commercial readiness, the new fuel cell could allow electric utilities to smooth out their power production between times of high and low electricity demand. And, because the "exhaust" from the fuel cells consists of high-purity hydrogen chloride, the new generator could serve a dual purpose for industrial companies that use hydrogen chloride. 
 Fuel cells convert chemical energy directly into electrical current by capturing electrons that are freed when atoms combine to form molecules. Scientists have long been fascinated by fuel cells, because they can tap more of the energy in a material than systems that burn oil, gas or coal to run motors and turbines.
 
Not in Widespread Use
 But fuel cells are a comparatively expensive way to generate electricity and have been reserved for fairly exotic uses, like providing power on the space shuttle.
But the new fuel cell, invented by Alan H. Gelb, has features that could make it economical for storing electricity during times of excess capacity for re-use during hours of peak demand.
The new cell has an electrolyte solution, which conducts electrical current between a positive and negative electrode. Hydrogen and chlorine are pumped through the cell, forming hydrogen chloride, which yields one electron for every two molecules of hydrogen chloride. These electrons constitute the usable electrical current.
Mr. Gelb said that besides being more efficent than most previous fuel-cell systems, his system had an advantage because hydrogen and chlorine were easily linked and separated. That means that an electric utility could use excess electricity to break up hydrogen chloride through existing electrolysis technology, and, in time of need, recapture the electricity by putting the atoms back together.
This form of storage would preserve as much as 70 percent of the excess electricity, Mr. Gelb said, and could free utilities from the need to burn natural gas or other fuels during times of high demand.
Mr. Gelb said the device could capture up to 60 percent of the energy of a chemical reaction, compared with the 30 to 35 percent of energy captured by large internal-combustion engines.
Mr. Gelb received patent 5,041,197.

HEADLINE: Invoking Kristallnacht Betrays Jewish History;
People on the Fringe

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A. M. Rosenthal (column, Sept. 3) writes of the silence of African-American leaders regarding the shouts of "Heil Hitler" in the midst of the Crown Heights turmoil. No one who remembers the 1936 Olympics when Adolf Hitler looked on with disdain as the track star Jesse Owens shattered his conjectures of racial superiority can say in good conscience that Hitler is a hero or friend to the African. What happened to the Jewish people in World War II was one of the sickest illustrations of the worst of humanity. 
 As senior minister of what is reputed to be the largest Protestant congregation in the New York metropolitan area, black or white, I made the above statement in a recent Sunday-morning worship. No representatives of the news media were there to report it. I am confident that similar statements were made from other pulpits, but we do not control who or where the news media report.
I am of the mind that hotbeds of tension and unrest will exist as long as we ignore the frustration and resentment derived from the economic disenfranchisement, unemployment and inadequate housing that plagues African-American youths in our country's urban centers. The right to protest for rights is at the center of protections for all the citizens of this republic. Mr. Rosenthal believes that the remedy for this frustration is a more forceful police presence.
African-Americans and Jewish people have shared a history of suffering, and neither holds a monopoly on what it means to be ridiculed or persecuted. The Crown Heights disruption is perhaps symptomatic of people on the fringe having to fight among themselves for the smallest piece of the political pie.
Not only do the powers that be wish to choose the African-American community's heroes for us (as in the case of Clarence Thomas), but you also wish to tell me whom I ought to hate. Many of us choose not to spend our time disavowing people within our communities for others, but rather in offering new solutions in our community.

Carpenter Lowers Income Forecast

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: READING, Pa., Oct. 4

 BODY:
The Carpenter Technology Corporation, a manufacturer of specialty metals like high-alloy steel for pipes, said it expects to report net income for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 "significantly" below the 76 cents a share of a year earlier. It cited planned lower production levels to reduce inventories, higher process and product development costs, and higher medical and wage costs.
The company said that while orders appeared to be strengthening and production was being adjusted accordingly, there was much uncertainty about economic activity for the fiscal second half. Carpenter Technology stock fell 62.5 cents today, closing at $47.75.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on Jobs Report Except for Loss Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar got a lift yesterday from a report that unemployment in the United States was slightly better than expected, but trading was still dominated by the Japanese yen.
The yen continued to climb after indications that the Japanese wanted the currency to strengthen to help bring down surpluses with trading partners. 
 The dollar fell against the yen, piercing the 130-yen benchmark in domestic dealings and settling at its lowest level since Feb. 16.
"The yen is still the main focus of the market," said Bob Morrissey, senior dealer at the Bank of Boston, adding that there was talk that the dollar could sink as low as 127 yen.
"That would help address the trade surplus between Japan and everybody else," he said.
The dollar advanced against other currencies, however. Traders who had been betting on a negative report on employment in September were forced to buy dollars after the Government announced that the jobless rate improved slightly last month.
The Labor Department said the unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent in September, down one-tenth of a percentage point from August.
Some traders had expected a rate as high as 7 percent, which they had assumed would prompt the Federal Reserve to nudge interest rates lower. A drop in United States interest rates is typically bearish for the dollar.
Curtis Perkins, a vice president with the Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, said a late round of selling limited the dollar's gains on the day. But he said the pace of trading picked up, capping a lackluster week.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 130.20 Japanese yen, down 0.96 yen from Thursday. Later in London, the dollar fell to 130.00 yen. In New York, the dollar fell further, to settle at 129.90 yen, from 130.60 yen on Thursday.
In London, the pound fell to $1.7370, from $1.7525 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.7375 to buy a pound, down from $1.7515 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6775 German marks, up from 1.6640; 1.4695 Swiss francs, up from 1.4545; 5.7155 French francs, up from 5.6700; 1,255.00 Italian lire, up from 1,245.00, and 1.1314 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1313.

HEADLINE: BANK REGULATORS REBUT PRESIDENT

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Anxious to revive the economy, the Bush Administration is publicly prodding the Government's bank supervisors to ease up on credit standards so that commercial banks will make more loans. But the White House tactic, first sounded a week ago and reiterated yesterday by the President, stirred up a fuss this week among the supervisors, who insist that they are not at fault.
Banks are not making more loans, regulators and bankers say, mainly because demand for loans has fallen and not because regulators have clamped down too much. In addition, many bankers acknowledge that they have voluntarily raised their credit standards in the last year or so to eliminate potential borrowers who might not be able to repay their debts. 
 The Administration's position, spotlighted at a much-publicized White House meeting last week, is that excessively cautious regulators are inhibiting bankers, who then turn away too many customers.
 
Longtime Customers Hold Back
 "I think the regulators are not being treated completely fairly at this time," said Robert Hawkins, president of Southern Commercial Bank in St. Louis and president-elect of the Independent Bankers Association, which represents many midsized banks. "They are entitled to a portion of the blame. But bankers can't be busy making new loans when they are busy trying to collect bad ones already made. And we are not seeing many good loan applications. The good borrowers are holding back."
Mr. Hawkins says, for example, that he would love to lend to some of the small machine shops and retailers in south St. Louis whose owners are his longtime customers. But they don't ask, he said.
"They've basically cut back," he said. "I'm thinking of a guy I helped put into business 25 years ago: he has very little debt; he knows what he is doing. He makes pulleys for trucks and farm machinery. But he's not seeing strong demand, and he says the machinery he now has in his shop he can live with for a few more years."
Indeed, a monthly survey of 2,000 small companies by the National Federation of Independent Business shows that only 36 percent are borrowing regularly from banks, one of the lowest percentages in a decade. The group says the biggest reason for the decline is that people are not asking for money because the economy is too weak.
The White House, hwever, is putting the blame on bank regulators, much to the regulators' irritation. "I respect the Bush opinion, but I happen to disagree with it," said Paul Fritts, executive director for bank supervision at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which not only insures deposits but also regulates small and midsized banks. "The examiners can't speak out, and they are easy targets."
His boss, L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C.'s chairman, agreed. "If we could cure the credit crunch by sending all the field supervisors on a world tour, we would," he said. "It would be a very low-cost solution. There aren't that many supervisors, only about 8,000 of them."
 
Applying Pressure to Take Risks
 The White House campaign reflects the Administration's concern that the incipient economic recovery might fail to materialize in time for the 1992 election. The Federal Reserve has been pushing down interest rates, and might continue to do so, but the lower rates have not increased bank lending as they did in the early months of past recoveries. So the White House appears to be putting pressure on the banks -- largely through the regulators -- to take more lending risks.
"If we are going to get a pickup in economic activity, then that vast portion of the economy that depends on banks to finance inventories and receivables -- unpaid bills -- has to get credit, or the recovery could possibly stall out," said John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor and the chairman of the Fed's committee on bank supervision.
Although Administration officials acknowledged in interviews that weak loan demand and timidity among bankers were factors in the credit crunch, the White House nevertheless made the regulators the focus of concern at last week's meeting of the President's Economic Council. Overregulation is also likely to be the theme at a White House meeting set for early next week -- in a fresh debate about who is most responsible for the cutbacks in bank lending: the bankers, the borrowers or the regulators.
 
Banks Buy Treasury Issues
 Rather than make loans, commercial banks have increasingly invested deposit money in safe Treasury securities, and more than $510 billion of these are now held by banks, an increase of $60 billion since the end of last year. The banks' outstanding commercial and industrial loans, on the other hand, have fallen gradually, to about $620 billion.
The Administration, in effect, is jawboning the regulators first and the bankers second to reverse this trend. The chief beneficiary would be the thousands of small companies -- operations with annual revenue of less than $30 million and fewer than 100 employees -- that rely on bank credit to stockpile goods and to cover wages and other expenses until overdue bills are paid.
"A major cause of the credit crunch is overregulation, and there is no doubt about it," Robert A. Mosbacher, the Secretary of Commerce, said in an interview. "The regulators are intimidating bankers, so that in many cases the bankers have not been able to use their experience to work with lenders."
 
Going Straight to Washington
 Somewhat less bluntly, other officials are suggesting that an appeals system might be created so that bankers could go over the heads of field supervisors, to top regulators in Washington. Or capital requirements might be eased; that is, ways might be found to make it easier for banks to meet a new standard, effective on Jan. 1, that will require them to keep on hand enough capital -- essentially cash in reserve -- to equal 7.25 percent of outstanding loans.
To meet the requirement, many banks have called in loans or slowed lending in some areas. One is auto leasing, in which a bank, working through an auto dealer, purchased a car and then leased it to a consumer. Since many banks have withdrawn from this field, the business is going to huge private lenders like GE Capital, which has $75 billion in outstanding loans of various kinds.
GE Capital is as concerned about creditworthiness as the banks are, said James A. Park, the senior vice president for finance. "But we are finding that we can acquire safe lending segments, like auto leasing, that banks want to get out of," he said.
Whatever the final decision on capital requirements, the Administration's effort is directed at getting the regulators to be "more balanced," as John E. Robson, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, put it in an interview. "We have a lot of incidents in which we believe the regulators have been too harsh," he said. "And we also know that the bankers are willing to use regulators as an excuse when they don't want to give a loan."
Susan Krause, senior deputy for bank supervisory policy in the Office of the Comptroller, which regulates large banks, shifted most of the responsibility for credit cutbacks to the bankers. "They are getting out ahead of the regulators in their caution in making loans," she said, although she agreed that her field supervisors were sometimes overly cautious in one important area: valuing real estate that serves as loan collateral.
 
Downgrading of Real Estate
 A developer might owe, for instance, a $900,000 construction loan for an office tower appraised in the late 1980's at $1 million. He might be making regular payments on the loan, but if the office building's value is marked down to $800,000 because of the current glut of unoccupied office space, the loan might be downgraded, particularly if future rental income seems problematic to the regulators. The downgrading can make a bank seem weaker than it may actually be.
Bankers say that pressures from regulators make them gun-shy, even when dealing with someone like Harry E. Featherstone, chief executive of the Will-Burt Company in Orrville, Ohio, a manufacturer of metal parts for various industries.
Mr. Featherstone last month obtained a $500,000 loan from Society Bank in Cleveland to buy a German-made laser that cuts steel. It was a big loan for a company with less than $20 million in annual revenue and $1.5 million in debt already outstanding.
"We went into immense detail with the bank, which we have not had to do before," said Mr. Featherstone, who remembered that in 1985 he once borrowed $3.5 million on his signature. "We practically had to dissect the machine for the bankers and to explain how much it would save us. Now they call me every two or three weeks to ask me how things are going. They are nervous, and I don't blame them."

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Up for 5th Straight Day As Soviets Deny Sale Plans

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices rose for the fifth straight day yesterday, turning higher late in the session on New York's Commodity Exchange after a Soviet official said his country had no plans to sell gold from its reserves.
Gold for delivery in October finished $1.30 higher at $359 a troy ounce, bringing the gain for the week to $9.90. December silver ended at $4.17 an ounce, down 4.8 cents. The contract traded as low as $4.13 during the session. 
 Gold traded as low as $356.10 before turning around on news that Arkadi Volsky, a member of a Soviet economic policy-setting committee, told a group of business executives in Washington that the Soviet Union has no plans to sell additional gold from its reserves, which he pegged at 240 metric tons.
The report was the latest of numerous signals since Monday that the Soviet Union's gold reserves are much lower than previously thought. Fears that the Soviets will sell huge quantities of gold to raise hard currency have eased this week, allowing gold prices to rise.
Grain and soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of Trade as the Government prepared to earmark $400 million worth of Soviet loan guarantees for purchases of various farm products.
After the close, the Agriculture Department allocated the export credits as follows: $132 million for wheat and flour, $99 million for protein meals, $73 million for soybeans, $51 million for feed grains, $15 million for poultry and $30 million to cover freight charges.
Wheat for delivery in December settled at $3.44 a bushel, up 5 1/4 cents; December corn rose 2 1/2 cents, to $2.53 3/4 a bushel; December oats rose 3/4 cent, to $1.30 a bushel; November soybeans climbed 4 1/4 cents, to $5.81 3/4 a bushel.
Livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as traders evened up their positions ahead of the weekend.
Live cattle for October delivery rose 0.47 cent, to 73.27 cents a pound; October feeder cattle rose 0.37 cent, to 85.92 cents a pound; October hogs rose 0.52 cent, to 45.77 cents a pound; February frozen pork bellies rose 0.05 cent, to 45 cents a pound.
Crude oil prices dipped on the New York Mercantile Exchange in a session short on market-moving news but managed to retain most of the gains of the last two days. Refined petroleum products were mixed, with near-term contracts lower and most deferred deliveries higher.

HEADLINE: Sharp Rise For Bonds On Jobs Data

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Bond prices rose smartly yesterday after the Government released a so-so employment report that showed that the economic recovery continued to limp in September.
"The economy is still moving up, but employment growth is falling short of the norm by a wide margin," said Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs. The economy generated just 24,000 non-farm jobs in September, or 224,000 since payrolls hit bottom last April. 
 Rates on Treasury bills, on the other hand, barely budged. They had headed down earlier in the week on widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve would ease credit.
But the Fed apparently did not ease yesterday, sticking to a recent pattern of letting the markets nudge rates down before the central bank steps in. "By hanging fire like this, the Fed isn't threatening the improvement in inflation expectations," said Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
While bond prices rallied over the course of the day, traders said a flurry of selling occurred early in the morning immediately after the employment report. Some traders initially interpreted the downtick in the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent, upward revisions in the numbers of jobs created in July and August, and a rise in the average workweek as signs that the recovery was stronger than had been thought. There was another flurry after President Bush said, in a news conference about a Democratic measure to extend unemployment benefits, that the economy was, indeed, recovering.
But these selling spurts soon gave way to buying as traders focused on the small rise in the number of payroll jobs in September and an outright decline in jobs in the factory sector -- one of the economy's few bright spots this summer. Further, hourly earnings data for September suggested that inflation pressures remained under control. Hourly earnings were 3.2 percent higher in September than a year earlier, compared with 3.6 percent in June.
 
30-Year Bond Jumps

By the close of the New York cash market, the Treasury's 30-year bellwether issue jumped 23/32, to 104, to yield 7.77 percent, a four-and-a-half-year low, and down from 7.83 percent on Thursday.
Ten-year notes with a 7 7/8 percent coupon rose by 16/32 to yield 7.37. Two-year notes with a 6 1/8 coupon due in 1993 rose 4/32, to 100.15, to yield 5.87.
Six-month Treasury bills edged down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.07 percent, while three-month T-bills were flat, with a rate of 5.02 percent.
Coming on top of slow money growth, traders and economists said, slow job growth points to further easing by the Federal Reserve. That prospect is good for bonds because lower short-term rates would be likely to prompt more investors to shift their funds out of C.D.'s into bonds.
Many traders expect the Fed to move to push the Federal funds rate down by no more than a notch, from around 5.25 percent to 5 percent this month. The Federal funds rate, the interest rate on overnight loans between banks, fluctuated between a low of 4.75 and a high of 5.18 yesterday.
The easing could come within a week, said Steven I. Saslow, executive managing director at Carroll McEntee & McGinley, a primary dealer in government securities. "The Fed gets the next week's money supply numbers on Tuesday, and if they are very weak, they may ease that day."
Not everyone thinks that the Fed will necessarily ease, however, mostly because there have been scattered of signs that business and consumer buying firmed a bit last month. "There's no compelling reason for the Fed to ease," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns.
According to recently released data, sales of new houses jumped in August. Car and truck buying revived a bit in September after stalling in August. And consumer confidence edged higher in September, according to the University of Michigan survey. In the meantime, factory order backlogs continued to climb in August and commodity prices have stopped falling.
"What will matter a great deal this month," said Michael Moran, an economist at Daiwa Securities, "are indicators of final demand like retail sales. If these show a pickup, the Fed should hold policy steady for a while."

HEADLINE: Dow Plummets 23.03 in a Late Selloff

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices slid yesterday in moderate volume, with a sharp selloff in blue chips in the last minutes of trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,961.76, down 23.03 points for the day and 44.28 for the week. The New York Stock Exchange composite was down 1.51, to 210.22. 
 Volume on the Big Board was 164.1 million, down from 174.4 million shares traded on Thursday, with declining issues outpacing gainers by 895 to 668.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 3.23, to 381.24, while the American Stock Exchange composite was off 1.55, to 371.47. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite showed only a slight decline of 0.11, to 520.40.
Harry W. Laubsher, senior vice president and market analyst at Tucker Anthony Inc., said "the lack of any possible market impact by the September employment figures suggest investors are counting on the Fed cutting rates further, while growing more fearful that third- quarter earnings will prove depressing."
 
Shift to Cash

Mr. Laubsher said yesterday's late selloff may well have been traders shifting to cash ahead of the weekend, and program selling. "We may be seeing a Dow at 3,006 and 3,007 as the new ceiling, and if the market should break below the 2,960 level on a closing basis it would likely bring a pickup in selling pressure," he added.
Bonds added some measure of support to stocks after a slight increase in the United States non-farm payroll, to 108.96 million in September, and the unemployment rate declined one-tenth of a point, to 6.7 percent. Twelve economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had expected an increase of 38,000 in the non-farm payroll and an unemployment rate of 6.9 percent.
The largest-volume issue on the New York Stock Exchange was American Express, which fell 1 3/8, to 21 5/8, as analysts cut their 1991 and 1992 earnings estimates on the company on Thursday after the announcement by the company that it expected big credit card losses.
Traders said Synergen, a biotechnology company, was down 2 5/8, to 63 3/4, as Larry Bloom, an analyst with Soundview Financial, removed it from short-term buy, to hold, citing a coming patent dispute that could cast a cloud over the stock.
 
Strong Earnings Rewarded

Just as the market has punished companies with poor earnings forecasts, it has also rewarded those with good earnings prospects. Legent, a company that develops and markets software products, rose 2 7/8, to 32 1/2, after the company said it expected fourth-quarter earnings of 50 cents a share before any charges. Analysts were expecting 37 cents a share with a range of between 22 cents and 43 cents.
Chrsyler rose 3/8, to 10 1/2; Ford Motor was up 5/8, to 30 5/8, and General Motors was up 7/8, to 38 3/8, as Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said yesterday that he and other legislators planned to submit legislation to force Japan to end its practices of limiting the sale of American cars and car parts or face losing part its share of American market.
RJR Nabisco Holdings, which plans to sell $4.9 billion in common and preferred stock to help it reduce debt and expand overseas operations, fell 1/4, to 10 3/4, and was the second-largest volume trader on the big board.

HEADLINE: The Fed Voted in Favor Of Lower Interest Rates

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers voted secretly in late summer to tilt monetary policy in favor of lower interest rates if the economy were to decline further, according to minutes released today.
Indeed, following the release of weak economic data in the ensuing weeks, the central bank cut both the discount and the Federal funds rates on Sept. 13 to help get the economic recovery back on track. 
 The Federal Open Market Committee had adopted a neutral policy last spring, biased neither toward easing nor tightening credit, reflecting the feeling that economic growth and the inflation rate were in balance.
But the minutes showed unanimity among the F.O.M.C. members that while policy should remain unchanged, a majority felt it should be tilted toward possible easing if needed.
The majority "felt that the risks to the expansion were largely on the side of a weaker-than-projected economy, and they believed that the Federal Reserve should react promptly to signs that the expansion was less robust than desired or that monetary conditions might be inconsistent with sustained growth."
But they also felt "an immediate easing move would be premature because the most recent economic information, although mixed, still suggested a moderate rate of economic expansion," the minutes showed.
At the same time, the F.O.M.C. directive noted that "increases in consumer prices have been small in recent months."
The directive was adopted by a 10-to-0 vote.
The F.O.M.C. met again Tuesday to map strategy amid renewed calls by the Bush Administration for lower interest rates. Minutes of that meeting will be released next month.
Still, some analysts thought the Fed might nudge down the Federal funds rate today if the September employment report showed deterioration. The rate is the interest that banks charge each other for overnight loans.
But although the number of new jobs rose an anemic 24,000, the overall unemployment rate edged down to 6.7 percent and the Fed did not move. The jobless rate had held at 6.8 percent in July and August after falling from 7 percent in June.
President Bush, at a news conference today, called the onr-tenth of a percentage point decline in September "one more sign that the economy is strengthening."
Other analysts believed the central bank would not act before seeing the Commerce Department report on September retail sales due out next week.
Within hours after August retail sales were reported to have taken their steepest drop in seven months, the Fed lowered both the funds rate and the discount rate, which it charges commercial banks for loans.
The funds rate fell to 5 1/4 percent from 5 1/2 percent and the discount rate dropped to 5 percent from 5 1/2 percent.
The F.O.M.C., composed of the Fed board members and five of the Fed's 12 regional bank presidents, meets eight times a year to formulate monetary policy.

HEADLINE: Joblessness Fell a Bit Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate edged down a tenth of a point, to 6.7 percent, in September, but a disappointingly slim increase in company payrolls indicated that the economic recovery was losing momentum, Government figures showed today.
The labor market report, the first sweeping view of the economy's performance last month, was not regarded by private analysts as weak enough to insure an immediate round of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, they said the numbers would not sway the Fed from its general stance of favoring easier credit. 
 "While the economy is still growing, it's growing at a very slow rate," said Laurence H. Meyer, president of a St. Louis-based economic consulting firm that bears his name. "We're seeing very anemic employment growth."
The increase in payroll jobs nationwide last month was 24,000.
 
Presidential View

President Bush, looking at the scattered bright spots in today's numbers, said at a news conference that "today's unemployment figures show the economy is moving in the right direction."
Although the Labor Department considers a change of less than two-tenths of 1 percent statistically insignificant, the unexpected drop in the jobless rate could help the Administration in opposing a bill passed by Congress this week that extends jobless benefits by up to 20 weeks. The Administration has threatened to veto the measure, which Mr. Bush has repeatedly denounced as a budget buster.
Among the 11 largest states, the best results last month were turned in by New York, with a decline of seven-tenths of a point in its jobless rate, and New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which each posted declines of five-tenths of a point. The rates for these states are now 6.8, 6.2 and 6.8 percent, respectively. Michigan's jobless rate rose the most last month, to 9.7 percent from 9.1.
 
Some Negative Factors

Among the negatives in today's national data were a decline of 22,000 in factory jobs and an increase of almost 500,000, to 6.4 million, in the ranks of part-time workers who would prefer to have full-time jobs.
"The jobs that are being created are the part-time, lousy jobs," said Markley Roberts, an economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
In addition, the department's quarterly survey of discouraged workers -- those who say they want a job but have given up looking because they think the search would be futile -- climbed by nearly 100,000, to 1,075,000. This was the highest level since the first quarter of 1987 and more than 250,000 above that of the third quarter of 1990, when the recession began.
The decline in factory jobs, which followed two straight advances, was spread through both the durables and nondurables categories, with electronic equipment and aircraft manufacturing continuing to lose significant numbers of jobs and employment in food processing returning to its June level
Factory hours and factory overtime were each trimmed by six minutes a week, but the length of the overall private-sector workweek expanded by that amount.
 
Government Jobs Decrease

State and local governments, many of them confronting budget crises, shed 35,000 jobs, bringing the total since June to 85,000.
And the retail sector, which accounts for nearly one in five non-farm jobs, is approaching the holiday season with its employment essentially unchanged since May.
Over all, however, service jobs in the private sector revived somewhat last month after languishing for much of the year; health services accounted for 38,000 of the sector's gain of 88,000.
"The labor market clearly appears to have been in a holding pattern over the last several months," Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. "We have yet to see any sustained signs of a rebound."
As measured by the department's survey of households, there were very large increases, of more than 700,000, last month in both the labor force and in employment. Dr. Norwood dismissed these as aberrations, however, noting that the labor force had declined by about the same amount during July and August and that the lack of expansion in the teen-age labor force during the summer meant that fewer workers withdrew from the market last month. Seasonal adjustment factors are especially powerful in September data.
 
Nudging Downward

The ranks of the jobless fell 46,000 last month, to 8,442,000, enough of a decline to nudge the unemployment rate down to 6.7 percent after readings of 6.8 percent in July and August.
There was a decline in the unemployment rate for teen-agers, to 18 percent from 19 percent, but the rate for all Hispanic workers rose 1.2 points, to 11.1 percent.
The number of those out of work 15 weeks or more fell 34,000 in September, but the median duration of jobless spells climbed to 7.5 weeks from 7.2 and the average duration was unchanged at 14 weeks.
The payroll survey also showed that the index of aggregate weekly hours rose to 122.1, from 121.5, but that the proportion of industries adding workers last month fell to 49.7 percent, from 54.6 percent. Only 46.8 percent of manufacturing industries added to payrolls, down from 56.1 percent in August.
Despite sizable upward revisions in payroll jobs for July and August, analysts expressed concern about the small size of September's rise. And the decline in factory payrolls was called an "especially downbeat note" by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in its publication, Global Data.

Taj Mahal Is Out Of Bankruptcy

 BODY:
The Taj Mahal Casino that Donald J. Trump built in Atlantic City has emerged from bankruptcy. Last year, the casino, hurt by the recession and the decline of gaming revenue in Atlantic City, was unable to meet all the interest payments on bonds it had sold to finance construction. As part of a settlement with bondholders. Mr. Trump agreed to cede 50 percent of the equity in the casino to bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates on the debt and more time to pay it off.
A "prepackaged" bankruptcy petition, in which the majority of creditors and the debtor had already agreed on a plan that needed the court's approval, was approved in Federal bankruptcy court yesterday. As part of the petition, Mr. Trump must insure that the casino meets projections for earnings and performance in order to keep control of the company's board.

The Economy
The Bush Administration's attempt to revive the economy by prodding Government bank supervisors to ease credit standards so that banks will make more loans has stirred a fuss. The supervisors insist that they are not at fault. Banks are not lending more mainly because demand has fallen, regulators and bankers say. Also, banks have tightened their credit standards. [Page 1.] 
 The unemployment rate slipped a tenth of a point, to 6.7 percent, in September, but a disappointingly slim increase in payrolls in dicated that the economic recovery is losing momentum. The Government's labor mar ket report, the first sweeping view of the economy's performance last month, was not regarded by private analysts as weak enough to insure a new round of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, although cuts still seemed possible. [33.]
Fed policy makers voted in late summer to tilt monetary policy toward lower interest rates if the economy declined further, minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee showed. [37.]
The Administration restricted imports from Canada and China. Temporary duties were imposed on Canadian softwood lumber, and Washington plans legal proceedings that could lead to long-term duties. Also, the Customs Service ordered its agents to impound imports of certain Chinese wrenches and steel pipes, pending an investigation of whether they were produced by prison labor. [33.]

HEADLINE: Lower Rates Give Bond Funds a Lift

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Falling interest rates proved to be a rising tide that lifted the performance of all mutual funds investing in bonds in the last quarter.
Although all categories of bond mutual funds turned in positive performances in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30, data compiled by Lipper Analytical Services showed that many did much better than others, depending on the type of bonds the funds had bought. In figuring the performance of each fund, Lipper measures the change in asset value of a share in each fund, plus reinvested dividends. 
 The best-performing funds by a wide margin were those investing in zero-coupon Treasury bonds with long-term maturities, known as target maturity funds. Returns for that group averaged 9.27 percent, but were much higher for the several funds of the Benham Group of Mountain View, Calif. Benham funds accounted for four of the top five performers in the quarter.
David Schroeder, portfolio manager for the Benham target maturity funds, noted that the long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds his funds buy always perform strongly when bond yields are declining. He added, though, that the strong gains in the past quarter did not attract many new buyers, because investors seemed more willing to take their profits than to make new investments in anticipation of further declines.
At about 7.80 percent, Treasury bond yields are the lowest they have been since 1987, falling from 8.5 percent as recently as mid-July.
Zero-coupon bonds do not pay interest like other bonds, but when interest rates fall, their prices rise about three times as much as those of regular Treasury bonds. Conversely, prices of zero-coupon bonds, and the Benham targeted funds, fall about three times as much as regular Treasury bonds when interest rates rise.
That volatility has been clear in past quarters. In the first three months of 1990, for example, interest rates rose and the long-term Benham funds declined by more than 13 percent. Still, over the last five years, as interest rates have declined, the target maturity funds have returned nearly 54 percent, one of the highest rates of any type of bond fund.
 
Money-Market Funds Suffer

One cause of the rally in long-term Treasury bonds -- a series of moves by the Federal Reserve to reduce short-term interest rates -- has wreaked havoc with the returns of money-market mutual funds. As short-term rates have fallen to where three-month Treasury bill rates are hovering around 5 percent, the return on money-market mutual funds was held to only 1.34 percent. While that return was the lowest of any fund group except short-term tax-exempt funds, the money-market funds remain a haven for investors who want to avoid the risk of loss should interest rates begin to rise.
The second-best performing category of mutual fund in the third quarter, with a quarterly return of 7.61 percent, was those investing in overseas markets. Those funds, which attracted $6.4 billion of fresh cash from investors in the first eight months of the year, benefited both from lower interest rates in most of the world's economic powers and from the weakening of the United States dollar, which meant their assets denominated in foreign currencies were worth more dollars.
The Megy Fund, whose 13.59 percent return in the quarter was the highest of any global fund, is a newcomer to the business, with only $200,000 of assets and an investment policy limited to securities in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela. Declining interest rates in those countries, plus sharp gains in their stock markets (where the Megy Fund may invest up to 5 percent of its assets) resulted in the fund's strong performance.
Among tax-exempt bond funds, the most consistently popular type of bond fund among investors during the past decade, the best performance was the 4.07 percent return by the general funds that invest in securities issued by a wide range of local governments.
That return was exceeded by many state funds, which invest in bonds of a specific state so that the fund's interest payments are exempt from that state's income tax as well as from Federal income tax. The return for bond funds investing in New York issues was the highest of any state, at 4.65 percent, reflecting the higher yields available on bonds of local governments, like New York City, whose credit quality has been weakened by the troubled regional economy.
In California, the leading state for bond funds, the average yield was 3.90 percent, about the average for most state bond funds.

HEADLINE: A-Plant's Closing Brings Shrugs as Well as Doubt

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROWE, Mass., Oct. 2

 BODY:
After Federal regulators recommended that the Yankee Rowe nuclear plant be closed indefinitely for safety reasons, workers here this week portrayed the shutdown as a bureaucratic mix-up and said they were proceeding as if it were a routine maintenance interruption.
"There are always problems and always solutions," Gregory Maret, the plant's technical director, said on Wednesday, the day after the shutdown. "We'll continue to operate as normal except the plant will be in a cool condition and we won't be generating electricity. Other than that, it's just another day in the wonderful hills of New England." 
 Workers reduced temperatures in the nuclear reactor from 520 to 180 degrees and were keeping busy with routine maintenance chores like cleaning the plant's main electricity generator, inspecting pumps and recalibrating monitors, Mr. Maret said.
He said the halt was similar to one in June, when lightning hit a transformer and forced the plant to close for a week. Yankee Rowe, the nation's oldest nuclear plant, has been shut down 38 times in its 31 years of operation, he said.
 
Defending Plant's Safety
 The managers coming and going from the plant's gate insisted Yankee Rowe was as safe as it was in June when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission rejected arguments that the plant's aging reactor vessel had become so brittle that it might crack and release radiation during an accident.
But the commission's staff reversed itself on Tuesday based on new safety calculations, and the plant operator, Yankee Atomic Energy Company, a consortium of New England utilities, voluntarily shut the reactors. It was the first time in nearly five years that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had recommended closing a plant for safety reasons.
Norm St. Laurent, the plant supervisor, said company officials now hoped to persuade the N.R.C. to allow them to restart the plant within the next few weeks.
"I would have shut the plant down if I thought it wasn't safe," said Mr. St. Laurent. Asked whether any of the plant's 260 workers might be laid off, he said: "I can't tell you anything about that."
 
'Bombshell' to Workers
 The N.R.C.'s recommendation to shut the plant came as a "bombshell" to plant workers, said Jim Lynch, a security supervisor who has been at Yankee Rowe for 16 years. "If there was a real problem here the way some people think there is, I can't imagine why anyone would work here on a daily basis," he added.
The 350 residents of this tiny northwestern Massachusetts town near the Vermont border have benefited greatly from tax revenue from Yankee Rowe and many of them have defended it against out-of-town protesters. Now, some are saying they are eager to know the results of extensive safety tests that are scheduled in the future.
"It gives you doubts," said Heidi Lehr, owner of Rowe's only grocery store. "I think they should shut it down now to test it." But she said she still distrusts the motives of plant opponents who had appealed to the N.R.C. to shut the plant before next spring.
"They're going to keep pushing," she said. "They're trying to shut it forever."
 
Doubts on License Renewal
 A Yankee Rowe opponent who runs a Unitarian retreat here said he believed the N.R.C.'s action meant it was unlikely the plant would be able to renew its operating license when it expires in the year 2000. "I would sleep easier if it was closed down for good," said the opponent, Doug Wilson, a director of the Rowe Conference Center.
Other residents say they are concerned about layoffs at the plant in a recession that has already given Massachusetts one of the country's highest unemployment rates, 9.2 percent.
But in the meantime, the troubles at the plant have been a boon for the Rowe Country Store. Ms. Lehr reported a run on disposable cameras Tuesday when tourists flocked here to watch protesters celebrate the shutdown.

HEADLINE: Japanese Premier Forced to Give Up Bid for New Term

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was forced today to abandon his effort to win a second term in office after his most powerful party benefactors abruptly withdrew their support.
The sudden withdrawal by Mr. Kaifu cleared the way for a chaotic scramble to succeed him among several leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan uninterrupted for 36 years. He is to remain in office until his term expires on Oct. 30. 
 Politicians and analysts agreed that the contest would be one of the most bitter in many years, but that no major policy matters would be at stake. All the leading candidates hold the same basically conservative view of economic issues coupled with strong support of the United States, and policies in Japan are forged by consensus among political leaders and bureaucrats who will continue to wield power.
 
Slow Process of Consensus
 It appeared that the Kaifu ouster was also a product of consensus, a slow process, often maddening to the United States when it wants quick action, but revered by the Japanese. People in Tokyo almost seemed to take pleasure today in being reminded that politics at its highest level in this country consists of behind-the-scenes maneuvering, like a grand form of bunraku, or Japanese puppet theater.
This Prime Minister was brought into office and then removed because he was needed at a time of scandal to provide a "clean" facade for the powerful party barons, who run the party's multibillion dollar patronage machines, and then finally no longer served their purposes.
In the last two years, these barons settled policies among themselves and dictated them to Mr. Kaifu, sometimes forcing him to shift abruptly. The Prime Minister never objected. Indeed, he performed cheerfully and was popular because the public felt he was doing his best in tricky circumstances.
 
Takeshita Among Candidates
 Among the leading candidates to succeed the 62-year-old Mr. Kaifu are former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita; Kiichi Miyazawa, a former Deputy Prime Minister; Tsutomu Hata, a former Agriculture Minister; Ichiro Ozawa, a former secretary general of the governing party, and Michio Watanabe, a former Minister of Trade and Industry.
The collapse of Mr. Kaifu's power base came early today when it became clear that his main supporter, Mr. Takeshita, withdrew his backing out of irritation with what was deemed to be the Prime Minister's impetuousness and equivocation on the issue of political reform.
This action came after a long period of rising dissatisfaction among party elders over Mr. Kaifu's general performance on the Persian Gulf war, the Soviet Union and the handling of the recent stock market scandals.
 
No Public Comment by Kaifu
 Looking ashen-faced and shaken, Mr. Kaifu made no public comments about his decision to withdraw, which was announced by an aide.
Mr. Kaifu took office in August 1989 at a time of public furor over bribery and sex scandals in the Government and the earlier imposition of an unpopular sales tax, all of which resulted in a sharp setback for the Liberal Democrats in parliamentary elections that summer.
When he took office, Mr. Kaifu was a former Education Minister with little experience in foreign policy or economic affairs and little independent political strength. But in his first statement after being selected for the post, he pledged to pursue "step-by-step efforts for political reforms." Six months later, he led his party to an election victory, largely because of his image as a clean politician.
But Mr. Kaifu never banished the perception that he was plucked from relative obscurity and beholden to the powerful party barons who put him in office. Party professionals saw him as reactive, weak and indecisive.
He was widely regarded as having been too slow to condemn the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last year and the hard-line coup attempt in the Soviet Union in August. He refused concessions on Japan's ban of rice imports, dashing American hopes for a breakthrough on trade negotiations.
 
Most of His Bills Fail
 Most of the Prime Minister's legislative package failed, although a proposal to permit Japanese troops to join United Nations peacekeeping forces may be approved this year or next.
Paradoxically, the issue that led to his downfall was the one that put him in power in the first place -- his dogged espousal of legislation to cleanse Japanese politics of the overwhelming influence of big money contributions from businesses and individuals.
Mr. Kaifu's ethics package would have imposed new limits on fund-raising, provided for Government subsidies for campaigns and carried out a sweeping redistricting plan that would have cut the power of rural areas and left most districts represented by only one lawmaker, instead of three or four under the current system.
The legislation was opposed for various reasons, not least because it would have transferred electoral power to urban areas and thoroughly disrupted everyone's re-election plans. It was long expected to fail, in fact, but not quite so spectacularly as it did on Monday.
Even Mr. Kaifu was startled when most his own party members moved to kill the legislation, hoping that this would humiliate the Prime Minister. But what apparently doomed Mr. Kaifu was his response to the defeat, a reaction that was interpreted as an unseemly mixture of stubbornness and equivocation.
 
Party Leaders Infuriated
 He infuriated party leaders by threatening, if only indirectly, to dissolve Parliament, and then backing down when it was clear that party leaders opposed such a move. Then on Thursday he again hinted that he would dissolve Parliament.
"The party leaders have been supporting Mr. Kaifu with a certain amount of exasperation and frustration and maybe resentment," a Government official said. "But when he indicated he might dissolve the Parliament and then withdrew it, there was an outcry: 'What kind of leader is he?' "
Even before the events of this week, three of the governing party's four main factions were fielding candidates to oppose Mr. Kaifu's re-election. The election is to take place Oct. 27 among the 394 Liberal Democratic Party members in Parliament.
The three factions already opposed to Mr. Kaifu control a majority of the Liberal Democratic votes. But Mr. Kaifu has always counted on the backing of the fourth and largest faction, which has 108 members and is headed by Mr. Takeshita, who is widely considered the most powerful politician in Japan because of his grip on patronage and fund-raising.
Until this week, politicians assumed that Mr. Takeshita would find it useful to stick by Mr. Kaifu and entice one or two of the other factions to join him by offering jobs and patronage in a new Kaifu government. The first signal that something was amiss came Thursday when a Takeshita ally criticized Mr. Kaifu for his threat to dissolve Parliament.
Some may see Mr. Kaifu as a martyr for his cause of political reform, but Japanese leaders seem to regard him as merely an instrument for advancing an idea for reform that failed to achieve consensus. It thus seemed that his idle threats and stumbling remarks were being punished almost on esthetic grounds.
Mr. Kaifu, in other words, was out of sync with his patrons, and the consensus behind him vanished as quickly and mysteriously as it had appeared.

HEADLINE: Pact Bans Oil Exploration in Antarctic

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Climaxing a long campaign by environmental groups to turn the Antarctic into a "world park," 24 countries, including the United States, signed an agreement today to ban mineral and oil exploration in the continent for at least 50 years.
The agreement, which was hailed as historic by governments and environmental groups alike, also includes new regulations for wildlife protection, waste disposal, marine pollution and continued monitoring of the Antarctic, which covers nearly one-tenth of the world's land surface. 
 'It's the first time that the international community has formally recognized the finite nature of this planet," said Steve Sawyer, executive director of Greenpeace International. "This is as close to a permanent ban as can be obtained," added James N. Barnes of the Washington-based Friends of the Earth.
 
'Last Great Wilderness'
 Governments seemed equally satisfied. "This is the protection of the last great wilderness," said Michael Heseltine, Britain's Environment Minister. "It's a case for celebration. I'm delighted to be making history."
Tucker Scully, the chief American delegate, said, "I think it is a very good agreement and it's important we move quickly to implement it."
The agreement takes the form of a protocol to the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, which banned nuclear and military activity in the area, suspended competing territorial claims by seven Southern Hemisphere nations and established rules for scientific research.
Although there is no firm evidence that Antarctica contains oil or minerals in commercial quantities, many governments, led by France and Australia, rejected a 1988 convention regulating mining activities on the continent as inadequate and began campaigning for an outright ban.
 
U.S. Held Up Accord
 But today's accord, which will go into effect after ratification by the signing governments, almost came unstuck in Madrid last June when the United States refused to endorse a draft agreement accepted by all other governments on the grounds that a 50-year moratorium was effectively a permanent ban.
Last June's draft said the ban could be lifted after 50 years only with the unanimous approval of all 26 full members of the Antarctic Treaty, while the United States insisted that future economic and environmental circumstances could justify greater flexibility. Since the Antarctic Treaty nations always work through consensus, Washington could hold up the accord.
But a new formula requiring only a two-thirds majority to end the moratorium proved acceptable to the United States and in July President Bush announced that Washington would sign the protocol.
The agreement, which emerged from four negotiating sessions over the past year, was signed at a ceremony at the Spanish Foreign Ministry today by 24 members of the Antarctic Treaty, including the Soviet Union, China, Germany, Canada, Britain and France as well as the United States. Japan and South Korea said they would sign after completing domestic legal procedures.
 
14 Other Nations Involved
 The negotiations also included 14 other signatories of the Antarctic Treaty -- countries with environmental interest but no scientific bases in the continent. Of these, seven signed today and all others are expected to do so during the year in which the protocol will be open for signature.
"Not only has the Antarctic become an international park for peace, but it has been considerably promoted for developing scientific research for the benefit of all humanity," Spain's Foreign Minister, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, said at today's signing.
But, while heartened by the protocol, environmental groups said they would continue to be vigilant in the Antarctic because, in Mr. Sawyer's words, "it is still not safe from continuing human activities."
He said some 25 national scientific bases in the Antarctic have proven to be "environmentally disastrous" -- some bases have been abandoned without being dismantled -- while an increasing demand for Antarctic fish and growing numbers of tourists represent new threats.

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Excerpts From Senate Hearings on Nominee to Be Director of Intelligence

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from today's hearings by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the nomination of Robert M. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, as transcribed by Reuters and the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service.
 
Statement
By Senator David L. Boren
Democrat of Oklahoma
 After hearing Senator Hollings last night, I felt that in a way I had not been fully fair to the nominee because I have not shared in open session and before these hearings close, I think I should share in open session some of my own insights into actions by this nominee that I think should be considered by this committee. 
 They're not determinative, I would say to you Mr. Gates, and I would say to you as I sit here this morning I have not fully determined in my own mind how we'll vote on this nomination. There are many factors to be considered. . . .
I want to weigh the benefits of your experience that you would bring to this job against the disadvantages that in some way that experience also presents itself. There are two sides to the argument. There are those that say experience is critical for the next director to make the changes that need to be made.
There's another point of view presented by some of our witnesses and even though some of it was not based upon direct experience with you, it is an important perspective that says we need someone who can make a fresh start to make all the changes in the agency. So there are many, many factors that have to be weighed before I make a final decision myself.
But there is one other factor, and perhaps I am in some ways the best witness on this element, that should also be before the members of the committee. It is not determinative of how someone should vote or how I will vote, but it is evidence, in a sense, our experience that should be weighed in the balance with the other factors as we make a decision about how to proceed.
 
. . .
 . . . [F]or the past five years I have made it the focus of my own personal legislative agenda and my own work as chairman of this committee, to strengthen the Congressional oversight process over intelligence. Because I became convinced that if we had true, credible, effective, efficient oversight, that could probably do as much as anything to prevent that kind of thing from happening in the future. . . .
So we tried to change the oversight process and make it efficient, and make it effective, and make it tough, and let people in the agency know that someone was watching, and watching more effectively than had been the case before.
RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST The other thing I was determined we should try to do is build some relationship of trust between the executive and legislative branches, and between the two parties and the operation of this system, so that we wouldn't have to sit here as members of this committee and try to figure out the right question to ask in exactly the right way to get the information that the elected representatives of people deserve to have.
And that had been the atmosphere before, and, quite frankly, that was the atmosphere during the Casey tenure, and that I think was his personal attitude because he came from a culture in the intelligence community that existed before oversight was ever heard of or thought of. And so he had a different attitude.
And we wanted to change it. And we wanted to build that trust.
 
. . .
 And I would tell members of this committee, there was no single person in the intelligence community, without exception, that supported the efforts of this committee to get access to information and to have truthful reporting to this committee than the nominee that's before us this morning, Mr. Gates. Every time we had a problem of not having people give us information or talk straight to us as we were trying to have our quarterly reviews of covert action, he responded.
We then struggled to set up an independent audit unit for the first time, since the General Accounting audit units cannot go out and audit secret programs. This committee and the committee in the House for years have been dependent upon the C.I.A. itself to tell us how they were spending their money and how they were operating their secret bank accounts. . . .
So we set up an independent audit unit. . . .
I can tell you from my personal experience that the person who was most forceful in all of the intelligence community and the executive branch in advocating full cooperation and full access to the new audit unit of this committee of any information we ever wanted was the nominee, Mr. Gates. . . .
 
. . .
 And then when we got into negotiations with the executive branch about whether or not there should be a statutory independent inspector-general confirmed by this committee and answerable to it, with an obligation to report any differences of opinion in terms of the conduct of investigations that they might have with the Director of Central Intelligence -- so it couldn't be swept under the rug -- they had to report any difference of opinion to us within a certain number of days. . . .
And I want the members of this committee to know who it was, because I had those conversations and I was in the room when some of those debates occurred with some of the other advisers to the President. It was this nominee, Mr. Gates, who most forcefully argued and used his influence to urge the President of the United States to approve and not to veto the independent statutory inspector-general.
'FORCEFUL ADVOCATE' And over almost six years now, we have negotiated with the executive branch for major reforms in the oversight process and in the finding process for covert actions; first, with the Reagan Administration and then with the Bush Administration. And, as you know, through two attempted enactments, one of them vetoed by the President, to get the lessens learned from the Iran-Contra matter written into the law so we could never again have retroactive findings and verbal findings and some of the things that we found wrong with the process during the Iran-Contra years. . . .
And I know, again, who was the most forceful advocate for this committee and for the oversight process in trying to explain, even to the President of the United States who was D.C.I. when the oversight process was not in place, why it's important and why it is appropriate, is this nominee, Mr. Gates.
 
. . .
 So I just put that into the record and I want my colleagues to know that.
And in listening to Senator Hollings last night I realized that he was thinking about this nomination without the benefit of what I know.
 
. . .
 . . . [T]hat is not in any way for me to say that's the sole factor on which we should judge this nominee. There are many, many factors. We have to consider lots of things before we judge this nominee. There are many factors that I'm going to weigh.
I would say, Mr. Gates, as I said in the beginning, I haven't made a decision about how I'm going to vote on your nomination. And I'm going to carefully look at the record.
 
. . .

 
 
Questions
From Senator Sam Nunn
Democrat of Georgia
 You state to the analysts and the managers who were gathered, quoting you, "While our list of successes is impressive, the list of our shortcomings, the events where we fell short, is in some ways even more impressive. We failed adequately to predict the scope of Soviet strategic deployments during the late 1960's and early 1970's. We failed to anticipate technological breakthroughs such as those that led to the deployment of the Alpha class submarine.
We missed the revolution in Iran. We failed to predict the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan until they actually began their military preparations. We failed over a number of years to identify for our policy makers the magnitude of Soviet efforts to acquire Western technology, and the nature of those efforts.
We failed to anticipate the Egyptian decision to launch a war against Israel in 1973. We significantly misjudged the percentage of Soviet G.N.P. allocated to defense.
We have repeatedly misread Cuba. We ignored Soviet interest in terrorism. We have been far behind events in devoting resources to examining instability and insurgency, and that is not an exhaustive list."
Mr. Gates, that sweeps from the late 1960's all the way up to the early 1980's with an astounding number of what you perceived to be and told your community intelligence failures.
Could you tell us what your view is on the intelligence failures, shortcomings, of the 1980's up to the present time, and also, any notable successes? . . .
A. I think that among the failures would be most recently the failure to anticipate Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. It would be the Soviet recognition that they could no longer sustain the level of defense spending that they had with the economic troubles that they had.
I think that we did not anticipate -- I'm stretching here -- I think we did not anticipate the Israeli incursion into Lebanon in 1982.
SOME SUCCESSES I think some of our successes, I think that the record on Eastern Europe is good. There was an estimate done in 1984 that anticipated, that predicted major crises in Eastern Europe by 1990. A 1987 estimate that predicted that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would be in crisis within two or three years.
I think we did a pretty good of tracking Gorbachev's reform measures, and the problems in those reform measures. We did a better job than I remembered yesterday, I was going to deal with this with Senator Bradley, in looking at some of the alternative futures for the Soviet Union, the event of major problems.
I think they did a good job of predicting a crisis this year in the Soviet Union. There is a very good memo from April.
I think another success -- there are some shortcomings clearly in performance on the Iraq war, but I think that there was a very good success in the respect that they had -- the intelligence community had a good fix on the technological capabilities of Iraqi weapons. I think intelligence did a remarkable job in tracking the effectiveness of the sanctions and in providing a basis for some 800 diplomatic demarches.
So just off the top of my head, those are some successes and failures that I can think of.
Q. Well, let me just read you a couple of quotes from Secretary Shultz in his Iran-contra testimony.
 
. . .
 . . . [T]here were two things that I objected to, and I'm quoting him. One was the intelligence analysis that was stated in it, because I thought that they were not reading the Iran situation right. And the other was the suggestion that basically flowed from the intelligence estimate that it was desirable to change our policy on arms sales, so the two things were connected, end quote.
Now let me read you another Shultz quote.
. . . "I developed a very clear opinion that the President was not being given accurate information. I was very alarmed about it. It became the preoccupying thing that I was working on during this period, and I felt it was tremendously important for the President to get accurate information so he could see and make a judgment."
 
. ..
 Here you had a Secretary of State, one of the principal customers of intelligence, that basically was having to fight against what he believed to be the Central Intelligence Agency or the intelligence product going to the President.
Now, you in that period of time, either head of D.D.I. or deputy, and yet you say that you don't believe the President was being misled. And yet the Iran-contra committee found that the President was being misled. And people that worked for you believed that the President was being misled. . . .
A. Senator, two points.
First of all, there is no -- no secret that Mr. Casey and Secretary Shultz disliked each other intensely. In fact, I think during that fall period of 1986, that Mr. Casey even tried to get the Secretary of State fired.
Second, it's also, I think, no secret that Mr. Casey did not draw as bright a line as he should have in terms of his own role between providing intelligence and trying to influence the policies.
Q. On that one, Mr. Gates, did you ever go and tell the President that: Watch out for Mr. Casey because -- you said yesterday, we have to pull him back all the time.
A. No, sir, and I don't think either one of my predecessors did either.
Q. Well should you, looking back on it, have gone to President Reagan in this time frame and told him that he had better be cautious?
A. What I felt was important was insuring that the President's daily brief that went to the President every day, and that the intelligence that was published by the community and by C.I.A. that went to the National Security Council staff, to Admiral Poindexter, to Secretary Shultz, presented as honest and forthright an account of what was actually going on as we possibly could.
And I think that record stands up well. . .
 
. . .
 Q. Did you ever express concern to Mr. Casey himself that he should be careful about what he was saying on this subject?
A. I talked to Mr. Casey on several occasions about insuring that the views of the analysts get represented when he would go do his briefings at National Security Council meetings.
 
Remarks
By Senator Warren B. Rudman
Republican of New Hampshire
 Well, I would just like to point out to Senator Nunn, a very interesting line of questions, that all of Secretary Shultz's comments, if you go back and look at the record, were not relating at all to national intelligence estimates out of the C.I.A.
They were all related -- and I'll give the Senator the cite -- to National Security Council Directives, N.S.D.D.'s. And the committee found that there was atrocious misrepresentation to the President of the United States of what the real facts were by the National Security Council headed by then Admiral Poindexter.
 
Questions
From Senator Dennis DeConcini
Democrat of Arizona
 I just want to discuss the now famous speech of '86, "War by Another Name." Senator Bradley raised this with you yesterday and I believe you told Senator Bradley that you tried to make it very clear when you delivered this speech that this was your own opinion. Is that a fair statement to Senator Bradley?
A. The passage that he read, yes, sir.
Q. When you made that speech, you were introduced as the Deputy Director of the C.I.A. Was there any qualification or caveat that this was your own statement and not to be considered the statement of Bob Gates the Deputy Director of the C.I.A. or just Bob Gates, Mr. Citizen who wants to express a view here personally?
A. I don't recall that there was any caveat. Sometimes I would introduce speeches by saying that what I was about to offer was my own view. I don't recall whether I did in this case.
Q. In this speech you made some very interesting statements that have been rehashed here that within the Soviet Union's global strategy, its targets include, among other things, the Panama Canal, the mineral resources of South Africa, the oil fields of the Middle East, and I believe you admitted to Senator Bradley that this amazing analysis was based on no evidence.
A. That's correct. I was my analysis.
Q. So my question is, if you are to make these kinds of speeches and you are confirmed, number one, I gather that maybe you're not going to make them but if you do, don't you think it's very important that you clarify that this is your own personal view, particularly when you are the director of the C.I.A.? . . .
A. . . . I not only agree that it's important to differentiate whether I am offering what is in essence a summary of what intelligence has concluded at a given time on a subject like proliferation or whatever and where it's a personal view. But frankly, going back to the discussion of yesterday and two weeks ago, as I had indicated on the first day of the hearings, and quite honestly, before I was nominated for this job, having where you stand sometimes depending on where you sit, from my job as deputy national security adviser, it seemed to me inappropriate for the director to give speeches that could be interpreted as policy advocacy.
Q. And certainly you agree that that one could be?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And I take it that's not going to be your practice if you're confirmed.
A. You can bank on it.
 
Questions From
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum
Democrat of Ohio
 Mr. Gates, I've thought a little bit the last 24 hours about your 20 points, and I kept coming back to the 33 non-recollects that you gave this committee, and the 40 don't-knows, and I'm having some difficulty with it, and I'm wondering whether you would like to address yourself as to the reason that you told this committee . . . that you couldn't recollect the answer to 33 questions, and you didn't know the answer to 40 others, when it's quite obvious that you had the resources -- the whole C.I.A. was ready to help you, the whole White House ready to help you -- to get any information that you needed, to go back and dig out the facts. Why didn't you give this committee more full answers than you did?
A. Senator Metzenbaum, I gave this committee in those interrogatories the most honest answers that I could. Some of those questions concerned conversations between other people. Some of them involved Mr. North's diaries, which I had nothing to do with, and hadn't looked at.
Q. Why didn't you go to look at them at that point?
A. . . . First of all, when I prepared those 20 points, I went back to C.I.A., I went through the allegations that had been made before this committee last week, and I listed all of those allegations. . . . And I asked them to pull together the documents for me that were related to those questions.
. . . [A]ll I'm trying to tell you is that -- and I guess that I am responding with some passion because I'm a little annoyed at this notion of selective memory or selective amnesia, to take the other side of it.
And the fact of the matter is that I don't, I don't think it is unreasonable that somebody is not going to remember the details of a conversation that took place five or six years ago, or even five or six weeks ago, if there is no written record made of it, and if it falls in the middle of a variety of other things that are going on.
 
. . .
 Q. What bothered me from the inception, bothers me now, is whether you were leveling with us, whether you were trying to sort of "gild the lily" a little bit, by saying, "I didn't read the North notes." But you could have gone and read them when you got the interrogatories, and you could have then answered our question. But you didn't do that. I had difficulty with it.
A. Well, Senator, at times those questions were asking me what I thought Mr. North had been referring to when he would write something or other, and that's where I would answer that I didn't know. Because I, I -- far from me to know what was in his mind when he --
Q. Somebody said you didn't know what was in the notes.
A. I was trying to be very careful, Mr. Chairman, in responding to those questions. I obviously had read the entries that were being asked about, but I did not -- I had not taken the time to read all of Colonel North's diaries, or to know the context, or to even know that the entries reflected things that had actually happened.
 
Closing Statement
By Mr. Gates
 . . . [J]ust as I would worry that inadequate coordination and sharing of information might cause C.I.A. to miss an important development abroad, I believe we need further safeguards when it comes to recognizing and acting upon intelligence information raising the suspicion or possibility of illegal activities outside of C.I.A. This is related to the concerns expressed by both Senator Nunn and Senator DeConcini.
While by statute C.I.A. is not a law-enforcement agency, I think we have to act conscientiously when information of concern comes to us.
 
. . .
 The D.C.I. is the President's senior intelligence officer and as such, he is expected to have a personal view. But it is his first responsibility to insure that the views of the institution -- the analysts -- are accurately and faithfully reported together with dissents and alternatives.
The problems of perceived politicization and self-censorship must be addressed urgently. . . .
Finally, on a personal note, this confirmation process, while long -- after all, the whole Soviet empire has fallen apart in the course of these things -- has been fair, thorough and professional. And for that, I thank the committee and its staff. I will close by again thanking the President for nominating me, and I will say that I hope that this committee and the full Senate will see fit to return me once again to the agency I love and to which I dedicated my life a long time ago.
Thank you.

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
From His Position of Power, Bush Swings Into a Defense

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Maintaining an oddly defensive posture as he prepares to enter the 1992 campaign, President Bush called a news conference today to tell the country that he really does care about domestic problems.
Stung by Democratic assaults on high unemployment, civil rights and parental leaves, facing the gloomy prospect of an election year with the economy in recession, and battling polls that show American voters think he spends too much time on foreign affairs, Mr. Bush insisted that he was as concerned about problems at home as about the global crises that have consumed much of his 31 months in office. 
 "So I will keep plodding along here, and making clear what our domestic priorities are, and I will not neglect my responsibilities to keep the American people informed on national security matters," Mr. Bush said.
That the President of the United States felt compelled to make this argument was a measure of the challenge facing Mr. Bush, even though he is a heavy favorite for re-election: His undeniable electoral strength is based on his handling of foreign policy, but the concerns of American voters are increasingly turning to pocketbook issues.
Today, he tried to use the forum of a hastily called news conference in the White House press room to turn the pressure on Congress.
Mr. Bush accused the Democratic leaders of passing legislation that they know he will veto simply to score political points against what even Republican advisers concede is his weakest flank: economic and social issues. Mr. Bush insisted that he, in turn, is not playing politics when he uses his Presidential pulpit and the trappings of his enormous traveling entourage to promote his programs.
As he did on Wednesday in a three-state political swing, the President insisted once again that he is not yet a candidate for re-election and suggested it was not fair to treat him as one.
So intent was Mr. Bush on countering the impression that he is almost exclusively focused on foreign affairs that he turned one question on European affairs into a discussion of the domestic political struggle.
Asked if he was willing to attend a four-power summit conference on arms control, as suggested by France, Mr. Bush said: "Well, I've got to watch foreign travel. I don't want to have it leveled agianst me that I'm interested in only one area here."
And the President kept what he called "a score sheet" on his lecturn of the number of domestic and foreign-policy questions he was asked by reporters, with the apparent aim of backing his argument that he is forced to address foreign policy more often than domestic issues by nature of his job.
 
Facing Embarrassing Vetoes
 Frustrating his effort to seem engaged in domestic policy are ineluctable political realities: Mr. Bush has no extra money to address social ills. He is fighting a Democratic Congress that is presenting him with several politically embarrassing vetoes on bills regarding parental leave, abortion and other hot issues. And he has been forced to deal with an astonishing series of complex international crises.
These have naturally taken up much of his attention. But Mr. Bush is, by his own admission, more at home at the United Nations than on Main Street and in the end, he is likely in the 1992 campaign to try to change the subject from domestic to foreign affairs.
For now, Mr. Bush is trying to do just the opposite. But he has been doing it a reactive way. Mr. Bush has been so vexed by recent Democratic charges that he lacks a program on domestic policy that he has often resorted to voicing the criticisms himself simply so he can then rebut them.
He has done this as he hiked through the Grand Canyon, visited dozens of schools, clinics and crime-prevention centers, addressed schoolchildren twice on satellite television links and flown from coast to coast raising money for Republican candidates.
Today, Mr. Bush began his news conference by saying a drop in the unemployment rate for the month was a sign that "the economy is strenghtening." And he renewed his attack on Congress over a $6.4 billion bill extending payments for the unemployed beyond the normal cutoff period, which he has said he would veto.
 
Backing Smaller Benefits
 "I am deeply concerned about those who are out of work," Mr. Bush said. "Unemployment benefits are important. Congress should provide a responsible extension of such benefits. The bill that we've been for for some time, the Dole bill, does just exactly that. And I'll sign a bill that helps people and also protects the overall economy."
Mr. Bush was referring to a $1.9 billion measure sponsored by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, that would also extend unemployment benefits but would pay for itself, while the Democratic bill would cost the Government money, which Mr. Bush said would break the 1990 agreement on reducing the Federal budget deficit.
Asked his advice for those who are unemployed and facing a loss of benefits, Mr. Bush said, "What they ought to do is demand of their Congressmen: 'Let's not just try to get it your way up there. Do something that the President can sign that will help us with unemployment benefits but will also protect the other taxpayers.' "
But he conceded that his promise at the 1988 Republican National Convention to create 30 million jobs in eight years was too ambitious. "Whether I live up to 30 in eight years, I don't know, but if I can get through these first four years is what I'm focusing on right now," he said. "I've learned just to avoid all the predictions now, including 30 million in eight years."
Renewing his proposal to cut the tax rate on profits from investments, or capital gains, Mr. Bush asserted that such a reduction would "stimulate the economy immediately."
"It doesn't have to take effect, it just has to get the confidence that a reduction in capital gains would give it, because it would create jobs and people would see it and people would invest more," Mr. Bush said.
 
Keeping Score
 Pressed to explain what he meant, Mr. Bush said: "I mean confidence in the economy," he said. "You see, what I think is that what the economy needs is a shot of confidence."
Mr. Bush argued that the criticism of his focus on foreign affairs was unfair, asserting: "The point is, a President has to deal with these things. You can have every Congressman and every group can deal much more openly and be much more engaged on the domestic side, but on foreign policy, there's a disproportionate responsibility for national security, whatever it is"
Mr. Bush suggested that news coverage of his Presidency also left the impression that he was not engaged on economics and social issues. "You all ask a lot of international questions and I answer them," he said.
Picking up a sheet of paper, Mr. Bush said: "I'm thinking of this press conference. I kept a little score sheet here."
He never reported the results of his tally. If he had, it would have shown that Mr. Bush was asked 26 questions, 16 of them on domestic issues.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Boat People: Lo Rnt, Riv Vu

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Riverside Park was not meant to be a housing project, but over the years two groups of people have made it home. One formed a small shantytown of homeless men and women. The other established yachting's version of a trailer park on Manhattan's Upper West Side, living year-round on 120 boats and floating homes in the city's 79th Street Boat Basin.
The homeless people were called squatters, and the boat owners were called a community, but to some critics there was not much difference: Both groups had turned public waterfront into private housing at unbeatable prices. For $300 a month -- less than it costs to park in nearby commercial garages -- boat basin residents can not only park their cars in a city garage, they get a berth big enough to moor a three-story home. 
 This year, though, when city officials moved to reclaim the park for public recreation, a clear difference between the two groups emerged. The city evicted the homeless people in the summer. It is letting the boat dwellers remain, even though most of them have been on rent strike for more than a year, and it is spending more than $2 million over the next year to fix up their home.
In some cities it might seem odd for a government confronting a budget crisis to be subsidizing the owners of yachts and houseboats, but in New York the boat owners and some local politicians consider it customary and just. And that may be the most remarkable thing about the story of New York's brand of boat people: It is a typical example of how the housing system often works in the city.
It is a traditional New York saga of tenants who complain about intolerable conditions but refuse to leave and make a profit with clandestine sublets; of landlords who spend more energy on legal battles than than on maintenance; and of public policies that provide cheap rents to long-ensconced residents -- who tend to be middle class or affluent -- while leaving indigent newcomers to fend for themselves on the open market.
 
'Squatters on Public Land'
 The result of all this is a dilapidated public facility that is sealed from the public by chain-link fence and razor-ribbon wire. Its docks are rotting and its waters have so much silt that they are unnavigable most of the day -- not that navigability is a major concern. Ninety percent of the boats in the marina never leave the dock, and consequently there is rarely any room for outside boaters to come in.
"The people in the boat basin are squatters on public land," said Peter Wright, chairman of the Riverside Park Fund, a private group that raises money for the park. "We should have a spiffy public recreational facility that generates revenue for the Parks Department. Instead we have an eyesore that's like a private co-op, and the city is subsidizing it. Why? These are not poor people. Why do they get to live in a park?"
New York's four other municipal marinas, which forbid boaters to take up residence there, generate revenue for the city. The city is guaranteed at least $150,000 annually, for instance, from the concessionaire at the 330-slip World's Fair Marina in Flushing, Queens. The concessionaire operates it and pays for maintenance as well as capital improvements, an arrangement common at municipal marinas in other cities.
The Parks Department, however, is currently unable to find any concessionarie to run the 79th Street Marina because of its decrepit condition and its residents' reputation for rent strikes.
The residents began living there year-round in the mid-1960's, according to Gene Greenspun, who has the most seniority among the roughly 150 "live-aboards" there today. He got a berth at the marina in 1955 and began living year-round in 1969.
"It's a romantic way of life," Mr. Greenspun, a chemist and engineer, said while sitting on his upstairs balcony recently watching the orange evening sky over the Palisades. "When I moved here it was strictly for love of the water. Today you have people here because it's cheap."
Mr. Greenspun's 2,000-square-foot home, named the Fountainhead, is a three-level, brown-shingled house with carpeting, a dishwasher, a den, a bar, a two-story living room, an organ and synthesizer, a washer and dryer, and cable television. His rent is $262.50 a month; two of his neighbors with taller, roomier houses pay a little less.
The average rent at the boat basin is $233 a month -- roughly what other residents of the Upper West Side pay in property taxes alone. The average monthly tax bills in the neighborhood are $170 a month for a rental apartment; $203 for a co-op; $420 for a condominium; $541 for a house.
Live-aboards get running water included in their rent, but they pay for their own electricity and provide their own oil or coal heating. They pay $60 monthly to park in a city garage next to the marina. At nearby commercial garages it costs between $300 and $415 monthly to park, and the city parking tax alone comes to more than $30 a month.
The city hopes to raise the dockage fees by 40 percent, which would still be a little less than the rate at some local private marinas. The increase will not provide any revenue for the city, because the new fees would just cover the budgeted operating and maintenance expenses, assuming the fees are paid. For now, with two-thirds of the live-aboards on a rent strike for the past year, the city is losing more than $200,000 a year running the marina.
 
Charges of Negligence
 In addition, the city is currently spending $2.2 million in capital funds to renovate the marina, and there are future plans to spend another $3.4 million on dredging and other capital improvements. The city is also contemplating spending $800,000 for a sewage-pumping station for the waste from the boats' toilets, which is currently released directly into the river.
Why, when other marinas in the area are turning a profit for private owners and concessionaires, should the city be subsidizing the boat basin? The live-aboards, who have formed a group called the Hudson Harbor Preservation Association, argue that the city should repair the marina because the city let it deteriorate when it was being run by concessionaires.
"These people have suffered through tremendous personal and economic costs," said Lonn Berney, the association's lawyer. "Yes, the city's putting in funds now, but it was the city's negligence that let the marina fall into disrepair."
The live-aboards have long argued that the marina's decrepit conditions have justified their low rents. But these conditions rarely caused tenants to leave. The waiting list for berths grew to 400 names over the past decade as nearly all the live-aboard renewed their leases, often quietly profiting by subletting their homes.
Over the years they have used rent strikes to press for repairs, successfully resisted an attempt by the city in 1980 to shut down the marina as a fire hazard, enlisted support from politicians like Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, and inspired sympathetic media coverage of their fight to keep their homes.
"How are you ever going to get a guy out of here who's been here 15 years?" asked Mr. Greenspun. "The city can't do that. When you've got 120 boats, you can spend $100 each to hire a lawyer to keep fighting the city forever. And why shouldn't we get to live here? You can say that it's cheap living down here, but what about people up the hill living in rent-controlled apartments for $99 a month? Where's the rationale for that?"
That is a good question, according to critics who refer to the marina as floating rent control. They see its decay as a classic example of what happens when public policy keeps rents so low that tenants never want to move, landlords never want to make repairs, and lawyers never stop arguing.
Robert S. Bernstein, the president of Nichols Yacht Yards, which operated the boat basin from 1977 to 1982, said that his firm spent $250,000 in legal fees battling the city and tenants on the rent strike. "It's the crummiest marina I have ever seen in my entire life," he said, blaming its deterioration on the city's refusal to raise rents to pay for improvements.
"There was an entrenched, combative tenant group," he said, "that got politicians and the press on their side with their story of people living on the brave new frontier on the water fighting the evil landlords. But they're nothing but rent-control squatters."
 
Plans by the City
 No private operators have responded to the city's requests for bids to renovate or operate the marina, which is why the Parks Deparment has taken it over. Charles McKinney, the city Parks Department's director of Riverside Park, has been negotiating with the live-aboards' association on a plan for the city to rebuild the marina in return for higher dockage fees, an end to the rent strike, and a gradual change in the marina's character.
Mr. McKinney said he would like to open a pier for strollers and perhaps for commercial sightseeing boats or ferries. He has met resistance from the live-aboards' association, particularly in his proposal for allocating any slips that are voluntarily vacated by live-aboards. He wants to set them aside for short-term stays by visiting boaters.
"I'm willing to accommodate the people living there now," Mr. McKinney said, "but I don't want to perpetuate the situation indefinitely after they leave. They want to be able to pass their slips along to other live-aboards, and they want the community to stay as large it is. My position is that the park should be used for recreation for everyone, not housing for a few people."
Mr. McKinney said the marina's residential character has forced the city to allocate most of the current capital spending on an extra electric line to protect the live-aboards against a power failure and the city against resulting lawsuits for endangering the safety of residents. Mr. McKinney said the extra line, which is costing $1.8 milllion, would not be essential if the marina were not being used for housing.
Mr. McKinney said that most other capital improvements at the marina should ultimately benefit the public, and that he hopes the rebuilt marina will eventually generate revenue for the city. But it is still unclear whether the public will get access to the marina, or whether the city will ever recoup its investment.
The fate of the marina did not hold much interest for a group of homeless men and women sleeping a few yards away one recent night in the park's rotunda, just above the marina's parking garage. They expressed some resentment at the new policy forbidding them from leaving shanties or other permanent structures in the park, and said they wished they could find a single-room-occupancy hotel with rents as low as the marina's.
But they showed little reaction when told that the city's contribution to the the boat basin this year amounted to $15,000 for each of the homes there.
"It ain't fair," Ernest Davis, a 42-year-old native of Harlem, said with a shrug. "Nothing we can do about it. They got money and authority, and we don't. Money talks in politics. If you got a dollar and I don't, they're going to take care of you."

HEADLINE: New York Drops Painters to Hire Inmates, Union Says

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration is laying off unionized painters and replacing them with welfare recipients, jail inmates in work-release programs and ex-offenders, union leaders say -- a practice, they contend, that violates the law and further strains the administration's contentious relations with organized labor.
But supporters of the use of welfare recipients and others in city painting jobs say the goal is simply to educate these people and help them find jobs, not to displace union workers. 
 The city's Human Resources Administration, which oversees social-service programs, has discharged eight union painters since June and nine more are scheduled to be let go.
The agency says it is eliminating the civil-service jobs to help resolve the city's budget problems, but it has also extended and expanded a longstanding job-training contract with a nonprofit agency that hires welfare recipients, jail inmates on work release and former inmates to do the same work as the union painters.
The union, Local 1969 of the civil service painters, sued the city early last month, accusing the Human Resources Administration of violating state law by replacing civil servants with welfare trainees. The local demands that the union painters be returned to their jobs.
Officials of the Human Resources Administration would not comment on the dispute because it is now in court, said Sheila Jack, an agency spokeswoman. The city is to respond to the union's lawsuit in court next Wednesday.
Because of paperwork delays, the layoff of nine painters, originally planned for yesterday, was postponed, union officials said. The employees will be discharged any day, bringing to 17 the number of painters laid off, or 40 percent of the 42 civil-service painters employed by the city agency last spring.
Labor leaders have occasionally chafed at the use of trainees in jobs that could be filled by civil-service workers. But those concerns were muted during the 1980's, as the city's economy boomed and thousands of additional municipal workers were hired each year.
But as the city's fiscal condition deteriorated in the last year causing the layoff of about 5,000 city workers, union leaders have become alarmed at the possibility that welfare trainees could be used to replace civil servants.
The Wildcat Service Corporation, the private, nonprofit agency that runs the job-training program for the city, said initially, in response to questions, that its trainees do not do painting that is ordinarily assigned to union painters. The point of the program, they said, is educational, to teach basic painting and broader "life skills" like punctuality and how to search for a job.
"It's just a training program," Amalia V. Betanzos, the corporation's president, said early this week. "It's not union work. It's not work that the people who are being laid off ordinarily do."
Mrs. Betanzos said the painting done by the trainees is work that the city would ordinarily contract out to private companies. The program is in its fifth year, she said.
But labor leaders insisted that people in the job-training program are assigned to do exactly the same work in city shelters as civil-service painters. Sometimes, union and nonunion crews have worked simultaneously at the same site, but most of the time they are kept apart, union officials said.
When Mrs. Betanzos was asked again, on Thursday, how the trainees' work was different from the union painters', she referred the question to her agency's vice president of operations, Richard Harris.
Mr. Harris said the trainees used to do only basic painting, while the union painters also performed more sophisticated tasks like reconstructive plastering. But he said that, in response to complaints from the union, an agreement was reached last year expanding the scope of the trainees' work and making it the same as that of the union painters.
Union officials said they had made no such settlement, and that it had been imposed, over their objections, by the city.
"It appears to us that the city is using Wildcat workers to get similar service at lower cost," said Albert M. Carrozza, the president of Local 1969.
 
Another Program
 State law allows municipal social-service agencies to create on-the-job training programs with private employers for people receiving home relief, the form of welfare for able-bodied adults with no children.
In a separate welfare program for women with children -- the largest one of its kind in New York -- the city has recently shifted its strategy away from putting these mothers in low-paying menial jobs and toward educating and training them in programs like Wildcat's.
But the social-service law also says that welfare recipients cannot be used to replace regular government employees, or to do the work they ordinarily do, said Adam Ira Klein, the lawyer representing the union.
The union argues that that is precisely what has happened at the Human Resources Administration.
"It's really just cheap labor, taking family people and replacing them with low-paid workers," said John Alfarone, the special trustee in charge of District Council 9 of the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades, the local's parent body. "The city values cheap labor."
 
Minimum Wage
 The union painters earn an average of $21 an hour, based on prevailing labor rates set by the city, Mr. Carrozza said. Each must have three years' experience as an apprentice and five years as a full-time journeyman painter to be hired by the city, he said.
The welfare recipients and ex-offenders are paid the minimum wage, $4.25 an hour, Mrs. Betanzos said.
The city paid $664,500 to Wildcat for the painting program during the fiscal year that ended June 30, Ms. Jack said. It has budgeted $398,000 -- an increase of 20 percent -- for the first six months of the fiscal year that began on July 1.
Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said the welfare recipients in the Human Resources Adminstration's painting program "are effectively being used as union busters."
"We shouldn't allow it," he said, "because the union movement is being destroyed by people who are supposed to be supportive of it."
The civil-service workers paint the interiors of 34 homeless shelters operated by the city, as well as administrative offices of the Human Resources Administration. Members of their local also paint in about a dozen other municipal agencies. Job trainees employed by Wildcat paint in the Police and General Services Departments, said Mr. Carrozza, the local's president. He said he did not know whether union workers had lost their jobs and been replaced by trainees in those departments.
The labor leaders said they had tolerated the city's use of welfare trainees for a long time, because they support such programs. "We are not against the programs that Wildcat has," Mr. Carrozza said. "Wildcat's aims are worthy ones."
But the union officials said they drew the line when civil-service workers began to be laid off and in effect were being replaced by people in the training programs.
Union officials said the trainees are exposed to all kinds of hazards -- from lead and asbestos at work sites to the use of ladders and scaffolding -- for which they are ill prepared. The labor leaders also contended that they were not motivated by racial concerns: Most of the unionized painters are members of minorities, Mr. Carrozza said, as are many of the people in the training program.
Mr. Carrozza and other union leaders noted that Mayor David N. Dinkins was elected two years ago with broad support from organized labor. But the city's labor relations have deteriorated badly over the last year, as the administration has laid off workers and demanded union concessions.

Convention Center Project

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
THE State of Rhode Island is the prime mover and investor in a $290 million convention center project now under construction in downtown Providence. The state is not only financing the project but it will be the owner of a new hotel and of the landmark Biltmore Hotel, which it is buying from The Providence Journal Company.
Managed by the quasi-public Convention Center Authority, the project is being financed with tax-free revenue bonds. The authority, arguing that the recession had made it impossible to find a private hotel developer able to finance construction of a needed new hotel, got permission from the General Assembly this year to include the two hotels in the project. 
 The cost of construction of the new hotel and the purchase and partial renovation of the Biltmore is estimated at $90 million.
At the June groundbreaking, Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun compared the convention center to the "pump-priming" projects of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Depression. Construction is expected to generate about 1,500 jobs and, once the project is completed late in 1993, about 3,500 permanent jobs. Rhode Island has a 9.1 percent unemployment rate.
The project is expected to run a $9.3 million annual deficit, at least in the first few years, but the authority argues that the state will realize a net economic gain. Figures prepared by the Dallas office of Coopers & Lybrand, accountants, predict $50 million in tax revenue over the next 10 years and $600 million in tax revenue to both the state and Providence over the next 30 years.
The Providence Convention and Visitors Bureau, charged with marketing the convention center, has found interest in it to be "very favorable," said Terry Dale, the bureau's president. The primary reason, he said, is that hotel rates in Providence are as much as 40 percent below rates on other nearby metropolitan areas.
"Many groups have wanted to come to New England for some time," Mr. Dale said, "but have found rates in Boston prohibitive."
The convention center, developed by the local Metro Partners Inc., will include a 100,000-square-foot exhibit hall, 20,000-square-foot ballroom, 15,000 square feet of meeting space and parking for about 2,400 cars.
The new hotel will have 260 rooms and be connected to the convention center. The authority will own both it and the 290-room Biltmore, but they will be managed by TCC, a Miami company. The authority has voted to negotiate a franchise agreement with Westin Hotels & Resorts of Seattle.

HEADLINE: Casing In The Bomb;
Disarmament Plan Quickens Calls for A Peace Dividend

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN most respects, the budget deal President Bush and Congress struck last October was as pleasant for the politicians involved as a skinned knee. The President was forced to renege on his no-new-taxes pledge. Democrats had to concede that there would be no growth in social programs for years. But the agreement did have one fundamental political attraction: it was supposed to put off further argument about spending and taxes until after the 1992 elections.
Now, that has gone by the boards. When the President startled the nation a week ago Friday by announcing that he planned to scrap a significant portion of the nuclear arsenal, it was guaranteed that the size of the military budget will once more come under intense political scrutiny. And that will throw open the door to fresh debate on the basic budget issues that have divided politicians for years: how high taxes should be, how large the deficit should be and how much the country can afford to spend on health, highways and the myriad other Government programs voters demand. 
 Lawmakers from both parties agree that changed circumstances mean that the military budget should be re-examined. If, as the President said -- even before yesterday's announcement of plans for sweeping cuts in the Soviet nuclear arsenal -- war with the Soviet Union is "no longer a realistic threat," then why, they ask, is it necessary to keep active a dozen aircraft carriers at an annual cost of about $600 million apiece? Why should the nation spend billions for the Star Wars missile defense system, the B-2 Stealth bomber, a new attack submarine or other astronomically expensive state-of-the-art weapons? Why should tens of thousands of troops be maintained in Germany, South Korea and elsewhere around the world?
Those questions were raised not only by liberal Pentagon critics but by such staunch conservative supporters of the military as Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, and Senator John McCain, a conservative Republican and former career naval officer who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
On Friday, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Les Aspin, suggested that he foresaw deep new cuts in the Pentagon budget, which, at close to $300 billion a year, now accounts for about one-quarter of total Federal spending. Mr. Aspin, a Wisconsin Democrat, announced that he was beginning an investigation to "determine what real defenses we need at the spending levels we can justify by the real threats we face."
 
Things Fall Apart>
 After days of similar speech-making and news conferences, it was clear by the end of last week throughout the Capitol, downtown at the White House and across the Potomac at the Pentagon that the budget arrangement was coming apart and would have to be renegotiated next year, before the election.
"It's getting very frayed around the edges," said Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee and was one of the main authors of the budget agreement. "An unraveling is imminent."
The cornerstone of the deal between the President and Congress was that tax rates, the military budget and domestic spending were locked in concrete for years. Any proposal to reduce taxes was required to have an offsetting spending cut. And money could not be shifted between the military and domestic sides of the ledger.
The issue now is not whether the annual spending levels for the Defense Department enacted last year will be reduced in the years ahead. That is almost a certainty. What must be decided is how much will be cut and what the money will then be used for.
 
'Reasonable' Cuts
 Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were concentrating last week on getting their budget through Congress for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 and insisting, at least publicly, that cutbacks in the years to come would be unwise.
While some saving might result eventually from the President's new moves to reduce nuclear weapons, they said, initially the Government will face the added expense of destroying some nuclear weapons and shipping others home.
But a senior adviser to the President said he was sure that if Mr. Bush had not already instructed Mr. Cheney to begin preparing a new, less expensive long-term plan for the military, he would soon tell the Defense Secretary to do so. "What the President insists on," said the aide, who talks with the President often, "is that the defense reductions be reasonable and prudent and not done in haste."
How much is reasonable and prudent is, of course, open to question. Two authorities on the subject, William W. Kaufmann, professor emeritus of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and John D. Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, argued in a paper prepared before the failed coup in the Soviet Union and published late last month that the budget now planned for the Pentagon could safely be cut over the next 10 years by nearly 50 percent at a saving of $316 billion.
"The future ability of the United States to maintain the conditions of its security will depend as much on its moral authority, diplomatic skills and economic assets as on its military capabilities," the study asserted.
The Pentagon and the White House surely will not agree to cuts that deep, and Congress might not either. But a reduction of 25 percent or so in the military budget has already been scheduled over the next five years, and further reductions of tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars are not out of the question.
That money could be used in three basic ways: to reduce the budget deficit, to cut taxes or to expand domestic programs.
Many Democrats in Congress would like to spend the money on new social programs, particularly in the area of medical care. But the Bush Administration is dead set against that.
"One of the big problems in opening up the defense budget for debate again is that the money can be used as an offset for anybody's favorite spending program," said one of the President's senior assistants. In the same vein, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in an interview last week that the Administration vigorously opposed "an income-transfer policy, which we know in the Great Society was tried for a long period of time and which economists have thrown over as a way of life."
Republicans in Congress generally favor a proposal by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas that would divide Pentagon savings between a tax cut and deficit reduction. "The American people should be rewarded in some fashion for the fruits of their labors," said Senator McCain.
Meantime, discussion has begun within the Administration about taking some money out of the Pentagon budget to provide short-term economic assistance to the Soviet Union. Secretary Brady said he thought such talk was premature, and whether the President himself has been involved in such discussions is not clear.
The best bet -- no surprise in these times of divided Government -- is for a negotiated settlement: a little money for the Soviet Union and much more for popular social programs, middle-income tax relief and reduction of the deficit.
Expect the debate to last all next year. It will be a framework for the 1992 campaign.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Bush Makes Aid to Israel Subject to Conditions

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR an issue charged with so much deep passion, the debate over housing loan guarantees for Israel ended last week in a remarkable hush -- but not because there was no clear winner. Indeed, it was precisely because the Bush Administration had trounced Israel and its Congressional supporters that neither side had an interest in ballyhooing the outcome. Israel and its supporters did not want to advertise their defeat. And the Administration did not want to publicly relish its victory, because it expects that it will have to fight this issue again four months down the road and there would be no point in antagonizing its opponents any more than it already has.
Last week Senators Bob Kasten, Republican of Wisconsin, and Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, announced that they were acceding to President Bush's request to delay until February their legislation offering $10 billion in loan guarantees to help Israel resettle Jews emigrating from the Soviet Union. While the Senators said they had 70 co-sponsors for this legislation -- enough to override a Presidential veto -- what they didn't say was that many had signed on only on the understanding that the bill would be delayed as the President asked. 
 That the loan-guarantee issue was put to rest this way was both revealing and pregnant with longer-term implications. The first thing to understand is that virtually nobody in Washington is challenging Israel's need for the loan guarantees, which would enable it to raise money from private banks on preferential terms. For the first time ever, though, the United States is trying to link the granting of such economic assistance to a change in behavior by Israel. President Bush let Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, know that he would grant Israel the housing loan guarantees only if Israel accepted unprecedented conditions -- severe restrictions on settlement activity in the occupied territories -- to insure that the loans would not be indirectly helping Israel consolidate territorial claims on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Mr. Bush said he sought the four-month delay because he knew how inflammatory a debate with Israel on such conditions would be. He wanted the issue to arise after the beginning of a peace conference planned for this month, in hopes that the United States could get a settlements freeze not by using its own economic stick against Israel, but rather as part of a deal: Israel halts settlements in return for the Arabs suspending their economic boycott and the Palestinians suspending their uprising.
In spurning Mr. Bush's appeal for a delay, the Israelis seriously miscalculated the mood in America. The overwhelming sentiment in Congress is that Israel should not continue its de facto annexation of the West Bank, and when Mr. Bush was prepared to take the flak for finally making an issue of that point, he got the lawmakers' quiet support. Even more interestingly, he got the quiet support of many average Israelis and American Jews, who largely kept to the sidelines at the peak of the debate. Many American Jews remain deeply troubled by the threatening language Mr. Bush used in opposing Israeli wishes. Nevertheless, on the substance of the case an advertisement placed in major newspapers last week by Americans for Peace Now, a liberal Jewish group, seemed to speak for many. It said: "If Israel continues to build and expand settlements in the occupied territories, it will undermine the possibility for a Middle East peace. A recent poll showed 67 percent of Israelis favor a freeze on settlements for the sake of peace talks."
Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, an influential Democrat who supported a delay, put the argument this way: "I think we have an obligation to help resettle Soviet Jews. But Shamir has a concurrent obligation to settle those Jews in a way that does not block a peace settlement." Mr. Obey recalled the Israel exemplified by its first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, as "an inspiring example of wise conduct and long-sighted sensitivities" and added, "I have a full commitment to that Israel, but I do not feel that that translates into a commitment for bull-headed expansionism at the cost of Israel's long-term welfare and America's long-term welfare."
If there is one principle that Administration officials say they think they established by defeating Israel on the question of a delay, it is the right to attach political conditions to Israeli aid. That notion, heretofore virtually unthinkable, has now become legitimate and will almost certainly be reflected in the future. The relative quiet among American Jews in the wake of the housing loan imbroglio masks an intense, private debate on this very point.
"I believe that this is one of the most important results of the whole controversy," said Stephen P. Cohen, head of the Montreal-based Center for Middle East Peace, "because it is making American Jews and Israelis ask the question: 'What is the relationship between American Jewish political activism for Israel and the wisdom of Israeli policies?' That is a linkage that people have not wanted to investigate in the past."
But all of this comes at a price. The intense struggle between Washington and Israel during the last month could leave the impressions that the only big problems with a peace conference are Israeli settlements, and that all Arabs are ready to attend and offer Israel real reconciliation and security in return for Israeli concessions. This is not at all clear. There is still much work for the Administration to do on the Arab side of the table.
In some ways, the tough line Washington has taken with Israel should make the Arabs more willing to talk. But it may also be that the Administration's tough approach to Israel has raised unrealistic Arab expectations, especially with Syria, that Washington will deliver Israel, and that all that the Arabs will have to do is negotiate with the White House, rather than with Mr. Shamir.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
For the Democrats, The Trick Is to Change Concerns Into Votes

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EVERYONE knows what America's problems are. For Maryland state troopers, it's government layoffs. For Colorado real estate developers, it's savings and loan losses. For New Yorkers trying to bring civil suits in Manhattan it's logjammed courts.
Of course, it would be difficult to build a Presidential campaign on such narrow issues. But the five Democrats now running for the Presidential nomination might face the same problem with other issues as well, including education, racial tension, poverty and homelessness. 
 The problem is that many of the things that worry people -- even those that worry a great many people -- cannot easily be turned into the kind of political cause that gets politicians elected. The existence of a dissatisfied electorate, which should be good news for Democratic challengers and a catalyst for political change, becomes an increasing frustration to Democrats unable to translate that dissatisfaction into votes that can be marshalled against Republicans.
Although voters seem to think Democrats fare better coping with domestic concerns than Republicans, polls show that few seem to hold the Republican White House responsible. And Democrats have yet to figure out how to turn the nation's concerns into campaign issues.
The 1988 Presidential election provided a textbook case. Although Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts presented a universal health care plan and talked often of other core issues, his campaign will always be remembered for becoming mired in Republican-made images of flags and convicts.
The fault does not all lie with the Democrats. In survey after survey, poll takers have discovered a vital disconnect between concerns and campaign issues among voters. The Gallup poll, which since 1951 has been asking Americans to name the political party identified most closely with national prosperity, recently reported that the majority of those who had an opinion named the Republicans. The outcome was unusual, the Gallup polltakers said, because the party holding the White House tends to suffer the public's wrath in economic downturns like the current one.
Some political experts say that one reason the Democrats have trouble capitalizing on core issues is that Republicans have used their last 11 years in the White House pitting traditionally Democratic interest groups against one another. Hence, civil rights legislation is cast as an entitlement program, and the move to extend unemployment benefits is portrayed as a budget-busting maneuver on behalf of labor unions rather than the general public.
In the end, every Democratic issue winds up looking like a game where no one benefits, least of all the reliable middle class voters both parties are competing for. This leaves the campaign landscape clear, as in 1988, for shallow games about who is more patriotic.
Campaign strategists for both parties have hammered home to candidates that they should speak only of the salient issues that determine how Americans vote, not of the vague concerns that crop up in polls but do not affect the way ballots are cast.
"Frequently the pollsters are telling candidates that they are better off talking about what one would call consensus issues rather than contentious issues," said John Deardourff, a Republican consultant. "You've got to find issues about which some kind of working majority of people feel the same way or it isn't vote-productive." As a result, issues that disproportionately affect the poor and the disenfranchised generally hold little exploitable political benefit for Presidential candidates.
Homelessness, for instance, was cited as the nation's second most important problem in a January 1990 New York Times/CBS News poll. But by the following August, the issue had practically dropped off the screen. The problem, it seemed, was considered intractable even by those who had led the call for a solution.
Curtis Gans, the director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, said Democrats have abdicated their role of defining a focused party message that could help them mount an effective Presidential challenge, although the Democrats might have an outside chance of making a dent on the electorate if the recession continues. "But it is also true that if the economy recovers at all, it is likely that the Democrats will still be at a severe disadvantage," he said. "Because they have not figured out who they are."
There is also some debate about whether the Republicans have figured out who they are. But for the White House, there is less to lose on that front, because it is relatively easy for a President to maintain a positive image. White House finesse in this area was on display last week as Mr. Bush and Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander turned a visit to a Washington, D.C., elementary school into a campaign preview.
The visit, in which the President talked to schoolchildren who had been advised to wear soft-soled shoes that would not make distracting noise, was taped by a private production firm that was paid with $26,750 in Federal funds. The visit was broadcast live by Cable News Network and Public Broadcasting Service stations and the tape was made available to other networks.
The Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the event was not electioneering. But he also said the White House would not hesitate to use the footage for political purposes if it was deemed effective.
The President has lately grown annoyed at the Democrats' consistent refrain about what they describe as his lack of concern on domestic matters. But for his opponents, White House irritation is the best they can hope for as an immediate strategy to get their message heard above the din. President Bush, well aware that the public generally thinks far less of Congress that it does of the White House, has already demonstrated how quickly he can take the offensive.
"The President, I think, can rightly say, 'George Mitchell and the Congress have prevented me from helping to get this economy moving again,' " said Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Administration's domestic issues czar. "It's no secret I would like to see him do more of that."
But Mr. Kemp, who encountered problems of his own distinguishing himself in the primary crowd when he sought the Republican Presidential nomination in 1988, warned of the problems inherent in failing to address the issues that most trouble the electorate. And his words serve as warning to candidates of both parties.
"The economic pie is in contraction; it's shrinking," he said. "It pits people against people and class against class and race against race. We become uncivilized when we have a shrinking pie."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Haiti Democracy, Such as It Was, Is Ended by A Chaotic Coup

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
AN indignant world endowed with newly activist reflexes almost immediately began to organize a strong reaction last week after a mutiny by Haitian soldiers turned into a bloody rout of supporters of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The mutiny quickly forced the elected priest-turned-president into exile on Monday.
While statements of condemnation rained down from all over the hemisphere and as far away as Moscow, the Organization of American States and other international bodies began to seek a strategy for quickly returning the deposed President to power. 
 By Friday, a delegation of foreign ministers from the Americas flew to Port-au-Prince to deliver a demand that Haiti be returned to constitutional rule. Argentina's Foreign Minister, Guido di Tella, portrayed the mission as "a test of the new international order" and what he called the "newly democratic O.A.S."
But for many Haitians, whose country has long been torn by violence and wrenched by serious class- and race-based tensions, the coup is rife with murky complexities.
President Aristide, though still wildly popular among the desperately poor masses of this country who elected him in the expectation that he would improve their lot, has generated almost equally passionate fears and suspicions among many in the tiny and prosperous educated elite; these people say that after his election to the presidency last December, Father Aristide showed scant regard for the country's newborn democratic institutions and on several occasions openly legitimized the use of violence to settle scores.
To be sure, almost nobody in Haiti is showing any sympathy for the armed, undisciplined thugs who now roam the streets shooting randomly at pedestrians, and virtually everyone is crying out for a return to constitutional rule; those who are familiar with the Constitution, however, make the point that once he is returned to office, Father Aristide himself will have to work much harder at enforcing the rule of law. Even among those who detest the military and denounce the coup, many now fear that the supporters of a returning President Aristide might soon unleash a cycle of deep purges and violent retribution.
 
Quiet Appeals
 For months before the coup, foreign diplomats here say, they were quietly urging President Aristide to condemn the scattered roadside executions of supposed partisans of past dictatorships with burning tires by his supporters, as well as the intimidation of magistrates who were to judge the President's enemies.
While publicly proclaiming strong support for Father Aristide, the diplomats have also privately counselled him to work with the legislature, which they say he has rarely shown more than contempt for. His Government has repeatedly declined or ignored legislative appeals for it to submit nominations for important positions from judgeships to commander in chief of the armed forces, as called for by the Constitution.
In August, Father Aristide's angry supporters surrounded the Parliament, roughing up legislators and threatening to burn them alive. To date, the President has issued no explicit apologies for the incident or repudiations of it.
Now, after weeks of mounting tensions, the army, a force that itself has no history of respecting the law or human rights, has seized upon the executive's many perceived constitutional breaches to justify a takeover of the country.
While few here take the army's statements at face value, the pressing international demands that Mr. Aristide be returned to power are rapidly being supplemented by much stickier requests by legislators, businessmen and political leaders that the international community help arbitrate Haitian institutional tensions and somehow constrain a free-wheeling President to stay within the law.
"Aristide has been told in Washington that he cannot simply return to the status quo ante," said one diplomat privy to last week's discussions between the deposed President and the O.A.S., referring to the President's provocative and legally questionable behavior. "He just looks blankly at you when those kinds of things are said, though. It is like the message does not register."
 
A Lack of Tools
 Other diplomats here spoke with exasperation about the lack of tools for making such a message stick once the President is returned to power, which remains the goal of all the foreign organizations addressing the crisis. Diplomats and knowledgeable Haitians say the means available to outside countries for enforcing conformity with the internal laws of a sovereign nation, always a matter of interpretation, are new and untested. Moreover, each has obvious drawbacks.
First there is the sensitive question of how another country can set guidelines for the behavior of a democratically elected leader. Then there is the separate matter of enforcement. Last week, before the international community decided to cut off Haiti from economic aid, President Bush himself expressed distaste for imposing economic sanctions on a country that is among the world's poorest.
Stronger support for the Haitian legislature, which has the constitutional authority to impeach the President if he breaks the law, could also backfire. With no tradition of parliamentary democracy, Haitians have so far shown little sympathy for the methodical legalisms of the legislature and would likely rally to a popular president's cause in the case of a showdown, throwing the country once again into crisis.
"The O.A.S. cannot sustain itself here indefinitely, but neither can the country go forward and survive if Aristide comes back without making some serious changes," said one Western diplomat. "What this is all about is a constitutional equilibrium between the institutions and restoring some balance to the society."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Leaders Come and Go, But the Japanese Boom Seems to Last Forever

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
TOSHIKI KAIFU became Japan's Prime Minister two years ago, riding a wave of public disgust over the ruling party's scandal-tainted ways. Yet there seemed little sense of outrage last week when the same sort of political kabuki he promised to reform was played out in public once again, forcing him to abandon his campaign to cleanse Japanese politics and announce that he would not run for re-election. The reason for the subdued reaction, at least in part, was contained in an equally important but little noticed event during the week: Japan set a record for its longest post-war economic boom.
The Japanese seem to have taken prosperity for granted, assuming that the politicians can maneuver as viciously as they like with little impact on their steadily humming economic machine. It is not hard to understand this feeling: At a time when the American economy is struggling with recession, the Japanese economy has just completed its 58th month of uninterrupted growth. It topped the 57-month Izanagi boom -- named for one of the mythical beings who created Japan -- that lasted from October 1965 to July 1970. 
 Setting the new record may not have been an occasion for parades or speeches, but economists are calling this one of the greatest booms in recent history, a period that has not only fundamentally altered the Japanese economy but sown the seeds of even greater friction with the United States. Some have taken to calling this period Japan's second economic miracle, as important as the one that turned a war-devastated nation into an industrial powerhouse.
"Japan is a different country today than it was five years ago," said Kenneth Courtis, senior economist with Deutsche Bank in Tokyo. "It will become even more evident in the 1990's. The Japanese economy has so much momentum that, competitively speaking, the 1990's will be over in 1995. The West won't be able to catch them after that." As Mr. Courtis put it, Japan has grown economically by the equivalent of one France since 1985, or by one South Korea each year. Its manufacturers invest more every year in new plants, equipment and research than American companies, though the American economy is some 40 percent larger than Japan's.
But the real import of the boom, economists emphasize, is not just the high growth rates. "The Japanese economy has improved not just quantitatively, but qualitively," said Yoshio Suzuki, chief counselor at the Nomura Research Institute and a former central banker. "Our companies have changed the composition of their products; they have shifted some of their production abroad, and are building higher technology products."
This is the change that is likely to make Japan an even more threatening competitor for American companies, many of which used the immense wealth created in the 1980's to benefit their investment bankers rather than investing aggressively in the future. Japanese companies are expected to increase their capital investment budgets this year -- a time when the economy is starting to cool -- by slightly less than 10 percent. But in previous years capital investment grew at a double-digit clip, roughly twice the rate of their American counterparts. Mr. Courtis estimated that Japanese companies spent about $625 billion on such investments over the last five years, a sum it will take American companies nearly 10 years to spend.
Toyota Motor, for instance, entered the 1980's as a tough competitor in the low end of the American auto market, and ended the decade having held on to its solid position selling less expensive autos while carving out a place at the luxury end, using a technologically advanced, $40,000 car to duel with Mercedes Benz. Toyota produced 3.7 percent of its vehicles abroad in 1985. Last year the figure stood at 16.1 percent.
The problems this improvement could generate were also evident last week: Japan announced Friday that its trade surplus more than doubled in August from the year before, to $8.25 billion. After tumbling for the last four years, the surplus could rise to more than $70 billion this year as companies wrest ever larger shares of foreign markets.
As has often been the case with Japan, this boom grew out of an immense challenge. In September 1985, Japan agreed to reduce its yawning trade surpluses and America's growing deficits by doubling the value of the yen against the dollar. Suddenly, the exports on which Japanese industry relied soared in price for Americans holding weaker dollars. "We thought that no economy could withstand a doubling in the value of its currency," said Mr. Suzuki. "We began reducing interest rates rapidly just to avoid a depression."
In 1986 the growth rate of Japan's economy was halved from the previous year and it slipped into a deep lull. The central bank slashed its official discount rate, a benchmark that affects what banks charge for loans, to 2.5 percent from 5 percent. The move sent a strong signal to Japanese industry: they were being given access to almost free capital to increase their productivity.
Companies poured immense sums into new technologies, more modern plants and, to avoid currency problems, new plants in the markets where they sold their goods. This flood of investment began to make up for the shortfall in exports. Corporate profits began to pick up, workers' incomes rose, and consumer buying was lifted. . The stronger yen also slashed Japan's fuel import bills, since oil is paid for in dollars.
In 1987 the Japanese economy had built up so much speed that it barely reacted to the crash on Wall Street. The value of the shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange stood at 91.9 trillion yen in 1981, but rose to a peak of 611 trillion yen in 1989. At current exchange rates, that means almost $4 trillion of new wealth was created. Some of this has trickled down to the average Japanese, who is enjoying a huge improvement in lifestyle. Japanese, for instance, began venturing abroad in huge numbers. The country's travel deficit -- the difference between what foreigners spend traveling in Japan and what Japanese spend when traveling overseas -- rocketed to $21.4 billion last year from $3.7 billion in 1985.
There was, however, a dark side. Worried that the soaring prices of stocks and real estate would trigger broader inflation, the central bank began to hit the brakes in late 1989 and lift interest rates. The result was a stock market crash last year, sharply reduced lending to property speculators, and a wave of bankruptcies.
The financial industry has been hit with several scandals as stories of excesses become public. Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Finance Minister, announced last week that he was planning to resign to take responsibility for a damaging series of disclosures of unethical practices.
How much this turbulence in the financial markets has affected the industrial economy remains to be seen. Mr. Suzuki said he fears the economy is at a crossroads and he predicted there is a 60 percent chance of its slipping into a recession -- in Japanese terms that means less than 3 percent growth, an enviable rate in the United States. What is being called the Heisei boom, which means peaceful boom, would be over at last.
"They've steered to a new course, and so you have to look at things in a different way today," said Mr. Courtis. "The lesson was that they didn't roll over when they took a punch. They faced reality."

HEADLINE: A BUMPIER RIDE FOR NEW YORK TAXIS: Rarities;
One Job Women Don't Want

BYLINE: By By Ian Fisher

 BODY:
Why are there so few women among New York City's 40,000 yellow cab drivers? And why is the number dropping so quickly?
The Taxi and Limousine Commission says the number driving medallion cabs fell from 708 in 1989 to 520 in 1991 -- or 1.3 percent of all drivers. And fewer are on the way. In 1984, nearly 3 percent of all applicants to the Taxi Drivers Institute were women. This year, the number may not even hit 1 percent. 
 Experts disagree as to why women, who were probably never more than 5 percent of the drivers, are becoming as rare as Checker cabs.
"Why don't women come in?" asked Willy Bly, director of the League of Mutual Taxi Owners, which represents 4,500 taxi owners. "There is only one reason: the crime chases them away."
Several experts mentioned worry about robbery, and said fewer women drive at night. But others noted that the job market had changed too. In the 1980's, there was an increase in office temporary and data-entry jobs, which offer flexible schedules, little danger and no need to get a license.
"A lot of jobs -- whether you work hard or you don't work hard -- you get paid X number of dollars a day," said Karen Hartson, 37, a driver for seven years. "Especially in the last year, we've had bad economic times and it's been very difficult. There just aren't the passengers out there anymore."
Others said women from the countries whose men are rapidly entering the business -- Haiti, Pakistan, India and Egypt -- were probably less likely to drive.
And some blame a general decline in the perception of cab driving as a job. Sophie Bakelman, 70, who has driven for 25 years, said driving has become more stressful and competitive during the recession.
"The business isn't like it was," Mrs. Bakelman said. "They're crazy drivers now. If there is a fare on the right and they are on the left, they cut you off."
Anne Syntaski, a lively, gravelly voiced 72-year-old who works for the Taxi Drivers and Allied Workers Union and chats with many drivers, but said that fear of crime hasn't driven everyone she knows off.
"We had a woman come in here last week," she said. "She said, 'Hell, I'm 75 and I'm still driving.' Well, God bless her. That took a lot of moxie."
Mrs. Syntaski, who started driving in 1963 after her husband and son both died, only quit herself four years ago.
"It wasn't always so dangerous," she said. "I only got shot once."
About 15 years ago, she said, she was on the FDR Drive near Houston Street when she heard a shot. It came from somewhere off the highway.
"I guess I jumped a little in the front seat," she said. "The passenger said, 'Are you hurt?' And I said, 'I'm not looking down,' because I knew that I'd been shot in the arm. It was a surface wound, thank God."

HEADLINE: A Bumpier Ride for New York Taxis

BYLINE: By By Ian Fisher

 BODY:
In the overheated 1980's, New York City's taxi business reflected the decade. As the economy soared, so did hands on every streetcorner, making it nearly impossible to flag a ride. Medallion prices jumped, other kinds of cabs burgeoned and calls for reform rose. Now cabbies say there are fewer passengers, more inspectors and more unregulated competition. And the subways are cleaner. But are the cabs better? Who's the man -- it's probably not a woman -- behind the wheel? What's the story with those yellow-bumpered cabs? And why are they yellow anyway?
It might not be noticeable, but when you hail a taxi or call a car service these days, the cabs should be safer, cleaner and operated by more qualified drivers than ever before -- in theory at least.
The reason is that over the last five years, the Taxi and Limousine Commission has grown vastly, enacting scores of new rules intended to improve service and bring order to a chaotic industry. 
 There is, for instance, a dress code, and a new yellow cab safety inspection center in Queens. Most significantly, the commission in 1987 quadrupled the number of cars it regulates by licensing the 30,000 livery cars and "black cars," the dark sedans usually servicing corporate accounts -- both of which can legally take passengers only by phone.
The commission has also doubled the number of school hours for new cab drivers and mandated English tests, and has more enforcement agents prowling the streets, making sure drivers are licensed and do not refuse to pick up minorities or balk at trips outside Manhattan.
Inspectors wrote 42,240 summonses to yellow cab owners in fiscal 1991, 17,000 more than in 1989. Most were for safety defects like bald tires or severe dents, or for dirty cabs.
But those numbers -- and many new rules -- infuriate people like Ronald Stoppelman, president of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents 18 fleet owners. "We in the industry can't move, sneeze or stub our toes without breaking some regulation," he said. "It's just simply an over-regulated business."
Many drivers agree. "The T.L.C. inspector is crazy because he fines you for everything," said one 32-year-old driver.
Industry leaders and cabbies say the rules hurt drivers, most of whom earn $21,000 to $30,000 a year, the commission estimates. And they say the commission does little to stop their biggest problem: illegal street pickups by licensed livery or black cars or by gypsy cabs, unlicensed and often uninsured cars cruising for passengers. (Licensed livery cabs have a diamond-shaped T.L.C. sticker on the windshield.) Just last year, inspectors began seizing gypsy cabs -- sometimes by hailing them and impounding them if they offer a ride. They have seized 979 since May 1990, plus 35 yellow cars with meters that weren't New York taxis at all.
But with the new rules, the question remains: Is riding a cab better now? The commission says complaints have dropped from 12,578 to 8,927 in the last five years. But most riders can still tell stories about cabbies who speak little English, drive with a leaden foot and don't know Broadway from Broad Street from East Broadway.
All attempts to increase the number of medallions, frozen at 11,787 in 1937, have been beaten back by the industry. And New York is still often compared unfavorably to London, where cabbies get two years of tests and training, and spend weeks on bicycles, learning even the most obscure byways of the city.
Elizabeth Roistacher, a Queens College economics professor and consultant to a taxi panel under the Koch administration, said many changes look promising, especially a new rule that requires new owners of individual medallions to drive their own cabs the equivalent of 36 hours a week. "They are doing a lot of the right things in terms of trying to improve the standards," she said.
And some riders say cars seem cleaner and that, at least since the recession began, it has been easier to find a cab.
But for William Lugo, theater worker, hailing a taxi remains the same frustration it always has been.
One night this summer, Mr. Lugo, a dark-skinned Hispanic 28-year-old, tried to catch a ride from Times Square to Chelsea. He watched for 25 minutes as empty cabs streamed by him. And nowadays he doesn't even bother to try to hail a cab home to the South Bronx.
"Never -- they will not go," he said. "They just look at me and laugh."

HEADLINE: In 7 TV Appearances, Wealth of Exposure for Bush

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
President Bush provides a special introduction tonight in an ABC television movie called "Heroes of Desert Storm," which mixes news coverage of the Persian Gulf war with dramatic re-creations of events.
Mr. Bush's videotaped appearance will mark the seventh time in 10 days that he has been on national television in an extraordinary streak, even for a President. Those appearances have come on the major networks as well as on the Public Broadcasting Service and cable television, although the forums have been extremely varied: 
 On the night of Sept. 27, he addressed the nation on all networks about his plans to reduce nuclear arms. The next two afternoons he opened NBC's coverage of the Ryder Cup golf tournament with a brief taped message rooting for the American team.
 
Children and Country Music
 On Tuesday afternoon he delivered a message of encouragement to the nation's schoolchildren on PBS and the Cable News Network. On Wednesday night he appeared on stage to salute the winners of the Country Music Association Awards show, televised by CBS.
On Friday he held a news conference that was televised by all networks except ABC, which decided that the session would not generate any real news and did not need to be broadcast live.
These television appearances came over a period when events were dealing a number of blows to Mr. Bush: Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas made well-publicized announcements of their candidacies for the Democratic Presidential nomination and included attacks on him; Mr. Bush's nominee for Director of Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates, was the subject of damaging testimony before a Senate panel; attacks continued by lawmakers opposing confirmation of Mr. Bush's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Clarence Thomas, and Democrats, spurred by the President's plans to veto bills that would extend unemployment benefits and guarantee unpaid leave for workers with family emergencies, stepped up their complaints that his Administration lacked a domestic agenda.
Dorrance Smith, the director of media affairs for the White House, said Mr. Bush's television appearances were not part of "any organized political effort" at a public-relations counteroffensive.
"It's fair to say we are going to find different ways for the President to do television," but the participation in the golf tournament coverage, the country music awards show and the movie tonight were not conceived of as parts of an overall plan, Mr. Smith said. Mr. Bush's participation in "Heroes of Desert Storm" was requested long ago, he said, and was in no way related to his other appearances.
 
Celebrating 'Our Neighbors'
 The movie is a dramatized account of the experiences of American troops in the war. The President will open it with a 30-second statement, saying that Americans have always believed there are causes to fight for and that the real heroes of war are not just the leaders but also "our neighbors" who commit themselves to the cause.
Mr. Smith said he had been asked by Don Ohlmeyer, executive producer and director of the movie, about the possibility of such an introduction. Mr. Ohlmeyer and Mr. Smith, a former news producer at ABC, once worked together at the network, very briefly.
The White House asked for and received a copy of the movie's script, Mr. Smith said, and "it seemed editorially consistent with what we wanted to say: that the troops were the heroes." He also pointed out that the movie had been made with the full cooperation of the Defense Department. "So it was a completely friendly project in that regard," Mr. Smith said.
Mr. Ohlmeyer emphasized that the movie incorporated extensive videotape from the war, including some shot by the Defense Department. He said that among the reasons he had used videotape is that it helped make the overall look of the movie consistent, with no discernible seams between the news coverage of the war and the movie's re-creations of it. The movie will be preceded by a disclaimer that says this technique was used "to achieve realism."
Television movies have sometimes been criticized for blurring the line between reality and re-creations. But Mr. Ohlmeyer said he regarded such arguments as "specious."
The writer of any news account brings a personal perspective to the story, he said, just as he and his scriptwriter did in this TV movie.

HEADLINE: Diplomats Press Haitian's Return

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 5

 BODY:
International efforts to restore the presidency of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide continued today amid indications that the army, which deposed him and forced him into exile on Monday, continued to rule out his return to Haiti.
According to reports filtering out of the closed-door meetings Friday evening between a high-level delegation of the Organization of American States and Haitian officers led by Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military said instead that it would be willing to relinquish power to an interim administration headed by the chief justice of the Haitian Supreme Court, Andre G. Cherilus. 
 New elections were reportedly promised within 90 days under the proposal.
General Cedras's position seemed to shift, however, before his third session with the O.A.S. delegation tonight. He suggested that Father Aristide could return to the country only "after a consensus is realized through all the sectors in the country."
As this conciliatory-sounding statement was being made, the Government television began broadcasting an unsigned 20-point petition against the deposed Government, urging among other things that Father Aristide and his Prime Minister, Rene Preval, be tried for treason.
General Cedras's qualified statement about the President's return seemed based upon the calculation that few sectors of the elite, from leaders of political parties to legislators and business executives, look forward to Father Aristide's return after a traumatizing eight months in office.
 
Talks With Parliament
 The eight-member O.A.S. delegation was to return tonight to Kingston, Jamaica, where it had spent Friday night for reasons of security. Officials of the delegation gave no indication of whether they would halt or continue their efforts here on Sunday. One member of the O.A.S. delegation, Foreign Minister Guido di Tella of Argentina, told reporters traveling with the mission that the organization had strongly expressed its commitment to the return to power of Father Aristide during its two hours of discussions on Friday with General Cedras.
"He is an intelligent man," Mr. di Tella said. "He has tremendous problems. Now he is aware of the seriousness of our actions."
 
Issue of Rights Abuses
 Asked about concerns over the deposed President's perceived abuse of authority and encouragement of violence, themes General Cedras is said to have discussed with the delegation, Mr. di Tella said, "These allegations of human rights abuses are part of the picture."
Early this afternoon, leaders of eight Haitian political parties, none of them linked to the President, arrived to meet with the O.A.S. delegation, and reportedly expressed strong reservations about Father Aristide.
"Most of the people in the delegation don't want him to return," said Marc L. Bazin, the only serious rival to Father Aristide in the December elections, which he won with 67 percent of the vote.
At a brief afternoon news conference that followed discussions with members of the Aristide Government, the Bolivian Foreign Minister, Carlos Hurralde, called the Haitian crisis a "complex, sensitive problem," indicating that diplomatic efforts would continue for some time.
 
Promoting Aristide's Return
 "We need the return to the constitutional process," Mr. Hurralde said. "We are promoting the return of President Aristide." Asked what might be done should the military refuse to relent, Mr. Hurralde said, "Other measures can be taken" after further consultations at O.A.S. headquarters in Washington next week.
As the talks went on, limited economic activity resumed in the capital today after six days of a near-total freeze on commerce that resulted from fears of violence and popular consternation over the military coup. Although public transportation was nowhere to be seen, large crowds of people milled through streets heavily littered with the debris of a powerful nighttime storm.
Women selling eggs, fruits, rice and other goods and shoppers uncertain when their next opportunity to purchase food lent renewed animation to the central city.
 
Roads Are Barricaded
 Reports from the countryside, however, indicated that roads in some areas remained barricaded by Aristide supporters, who rained rocks down on anyone who tried to pass.
Diplomats said low stocks of many goods, including oil and gasoline, and the bureaucracy's continuing refusal to collaborate with the military administration could soon place additional pressure on the military to reach a negotiated settlement of the crisis.
Some observers who believe that General Cedras did not order the coup and is not in full command of his soldiers, however, question whether he can reach an agreement that achieves the return of the President over the objection of his soldiers.
"Aristide's status is not something that Cedras or the General Staff can simply decide by themselves," said an official who is close to the O.A.S. talks.

HEADLINE: Rebel Front Says It Can Fix War-Battered Angola

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola, Sept. 30

 BODY:
As Angola emerges exhausted from 16 years of civil war, most people think that their lives can only improve. They may be disillusioned.
"During the war I suffered a lot," said Emiliano Chitunda, a baker, "but now my life is becoming more normal." Mr. Chitunda called President Jose Eduardo dos Santos "a good man" because he signed the peace agreement concluded with the Government last May. But Mr. Chitunda put his faith in Jonas Savimbi, the guerrilla leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. 
 Mr. Savimbi, who returned here Sunday after 16 years spent fighting from the bush, is already campaigning to win the national elections schedule in a year. He contends that his rebel movement, popularly known by its Portuguese acronym Unita, can direct its battlefield resolve toward a peaceful struggle for prosperity.
"Enough of Mediocrity -- We Deserve a Better Life," read a banner hung by Unita backers on a street in Luanda.
 
Will Seek U.S. Intercession
 "We will cooperate with the Government in peace, but we are an opposition movement," said Mr. Savimbi, who is scheduled to meet with President Bush on Monday in Washington.
"I'm going to ask the Americans to put pressure on the process," Mr. Savimbi told reporters. The visit is also calculated to increase Mr. Savimbi's electoral chances by implying that the United States, which supported his movement, will do more for Angolans than the Soviet Union and Cuba, which backed Mr. dos Santos's Government.
Unita, which blames the Marxist ideology now scrapped by the Government for Angola's ills, lacks an economic track record of its own. The areas under its control operate by barter at subsistence level. Mr. Savimbi's group says that it has plans for reconstruction but has yet to disclose them.
But some people in this capital, who blame Unita for wartime atrocities, nonetheless think that the insurgents can do no worse than the Government run by the rival Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola.
Angel Feijo, a student, said Mr. Savimbi "has the power to put right the conditions in this country," adding: "The Government hasn't the power to put it right. They don't know how to lead the way."
 
Regaining 1975 Levels
 Some economic analysts predict that it will take as long as a decade to bring Angola back to the level of 1975, when Portugal gave up its African colony. The Angolan economy, said Alfred S. Fawundo, the deputy representative of the United Nations Development Program here, "really defies conventional description."
The civil war was devastating, causing the deaths of more than 500,000 Angolans, two-thirds of them children. Up to a million people were displaced. Basic installations and services have suffered more than $30 billion in material damage since 1980, according to a United Nations estimate.
Angola has one of the world's worst child mortality rates; 1988 figures showed that 29 of every 100 children died before reaching the age of 5.
Before the war, Angola had rich potential. It still ranks second in Africa, after Nigeria, in oil production. Petroleum and its products generate 95 percent of foreign earnings, much of which has been spent on Soviet weapons.
Once, Angola was the world's fourth-largest producer of coffee and the fifth-largest of diamonds. It also prospered on cotton and fishing, and supported itself in agriculture. Now, many basic food items must be imported.
The country's deterioration is conspicuous in Luanda, which has tottered for years on the brink of urban apocalypse. Stately houses have decayed and many office buildings, reduced to derelict slums. Squatters from a refugee influx that quadrupled the population of Luanda camp in the decrepit buildings, hanging laundry from the balconies, cooking or sleeping in the foyers. The stench of uncollected garbage fills the humid air.
Disabled people, some wearing remnants of army uniforms, hobble or crawl along the streets begging for food. More than 40,000 Angolans, including civilians, have been maimed, and live land mines are still found throughout the country.
Yet Luanda throbs with an informal, though hardly productive economy. Women balance on their heads cases of imported beer and soda acquired from restricted state stores. They are bound for Roque Santeiro, a sprawling black market nicknamed from a Brazilian television soap opera.
Francisco, a clerk in Luanda, said he uses the monthly hard-currency allowance from his European employers to invest in imported beer. At Roque Santeiro, he resells the beer at seven and a half times what he paid for it -- $176 a case at the official exchange rate. Francisco said the Government made speculation a necessity.
"We have a very corrupt society," complained a young teacher named Manuel, who also asked that his full name not be used, "and the civil servants earn a lot, not through their salaries but through their privileges at the Government stores."
 
2 Adjacent Tiers of Commerce
 Near the waterfront, a "people's store" displays rice, cooking oil, vinegar and other staples subsidized by the Government. They must be purchased with ration cards issued to state employees, which excludes many Angolans. Outside, women sitting on the cracked sidewalk beg emerging shoppers to sell them anything. On the black market, a can of cooking oil can fetch 25 times the state price of 12 kwanzas.
After the black market rate for a dollar soared to 2,000 kwanzas last year, the Government devalued the currency -- from 30 kwanzas to the dollar to 60. Last October, it recalled the old money to exchange for new kwanzas. Angolans received one-twentieth of what they handed in, and promises that the Government would hold the rest. Outside the main bank, men stand scanning posted lists of those whose applications to get money back are under consideration.
Though the Government has repudiated Marxist policies and moved to start deregulating the constricted economy as early as 1987, it seems unwilling to undertake sweeping free-market reforms with an election a year away. A law forbids even unprofitable companies from laying off employees.
And the central bank refused to give foreign currency to some companies to import machinery and spare parts, grinding some factories to a halt.
"To privatize is one thing, but the most important thing is shifting responsibility from the Government," an African economic analyst said. "There will still be a tendency to resist through regulations, or hold out strategic enterprises" from deregulation.
"I think Unita might not have that kind of restrictive mind," the analyst said.
 
The New Colonialists
 Some Angolans express nostalgia for Portugese colonial rule, when they say they were oppressed and exploited but had stable homes and enough to eat. But many also take for granted the welfare policies of socialism.
"There is a will on the part of the people of Angola to change, but I don't think there is a will to make more sacrifices," Mr. Fawundo said.
The immediate threat to peace is posed by war-weary soldiers on both sides who have no prospect of jobs or even food for tomorrow.
Peace plans call for 70,000 Government soldiers and 50,000 guerrillas to gather at 50 assembly points and be disarmed. From each side, 20,000 will be selected for a new professional army and the rest demobilized. A target of Aug. 1 was missed because mined roads and blown bridges made travel hazardous. With food shortages at the assembly points, concern has grown that some soldiers may resort to banditry.
 
Unicef Role
 "We are afraid that they are not all going to the assembly points," said Valentin Neto, a Luanda resident. "We want them to stop being soldiers so that we are safe from them."
The United Nations Children's Emergency Fund, or Unicef, has been active in Angola. It has found that to feed malnourished children and their mothers, it may have to help the soldiers too.
"The issue is what do you do to make sure that the peace process doesn't grind to a halt, to make sure that the peace process isn't threatened?" said Ibrahim Fall, the fund's representative in Angola. His relief program, designed for 1.9 million Angolans in nine provinces, now contemplates feeding up to three million in all 18 provinces.
"The war cost a lot of money, but peace has its price," Mr. Fall said.

HEADLINE: Shooting Puts Focus on Korean-Black Frictions in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 5

 BODY:
The grainy videotape, in pantomime, shows an angry tussle over a $1.79 bottle of orange juice at the counter of a Korean grocery. It shows the customer, a 15-year-old black girl, turning as if to walk away, then it shows a woman raising a pistol and firing a single, fatal shot into the back of the girl's head.
The videotaped shooting, which has been shown repeatedly on television, has become the focus of rising tensions between Koreans and blacks in this city, where increasing ethnic diversity is bringing with it increasing frictions. 
 On Monday a jury is scheduled to begin deliberations in the trial of Soon Ja Du, 49, the Korean woman who faces a charge of second-degree murder in the death of Latasha Harlins, whom she had accused of trying to steal the bottle of juice.
"This incident embodies all of the problem areas," said Larry Aubry, a member of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission. "It has come to symbolize what is wrong in the situation."
He added: "You look at all the economic indices like income and housing, and blacks remain at the bottom. Then the Koreans come in and try to make their mark. It's kind of a worst-case scenario."
In crumbling South Central Los Angeles, with its vacant lots and closed storefronts, the only economically successful enterprises in some places seem to be Korean groceries, service stations and liquor stores.
It is a situation that has led to frequent violence. In the last six months, two Korean shop owners have been shot and killed in holdups, and another has been gravely wounded. In the same period, Koreans have killed three black people, but charges were filed only in the Harlins case.
With a boycott similar to the yearlong action in Brooklyn that ended last February, a black group, the Brotherhood Crusade, succeeded this week in closing a Korean market where a black man was killed in June in what the police called justifiable self-defense.
At her trial this week Mrs. Du tearfully denied intending to shoot the girl after they argued over the bottle of orange juice that was protruding from the girl's backpack.
 
Poverty and Discrimination
 Two witnesses, a 9-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl who were in the store to buy hair gel for their mother, testified that Mrs. Du and Miss Harlins engaged in a slapping, shouting, stool-throwing argument before the fatal shot was fired on March 16.
Outside the courtroom some blacks said the killing points up the poverty and racial discimination with which black people live as a wave of energetic immigrants jostles them aside.
They said the Koreans, who now own about 3,000 small businesses in Southern California, are preying economically on their people.
"There is consistent and persistent rude treatment," said John W. Mack, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Urban League.
Chull Huh, secretary general of the Korean Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles, said of the boycotters: "They're not willing to listen to the Korean community's opinions. They try to provoke, to exaggerate the issue."
Leaders of the Korean immigrant community talk urgently of the need to understand the ways of black Americans, and suggest that racial stereotyping may be involved on both sides.
 
The First Third-World City
 Cultural sensitivity has become an urgent issue in recent years as Los Angeles has developed into what some people have begun to call the nation's first third-world city.
In the last 20 years the Korean population of Los Angeles has increased to 250,000 from 9,000 as part of an influx of Asians, who now make up 9 percent of the city's population of 3.5 million.
At the same time, the black population has declined, to 13 percent from 17 percent in the last decade. Black neighborhoods like Watts have been flooded with members of other minorities, while blacks have remained at the bottom of the economic ladder.
In South Central Los Angeles some Korean markets have become the targets of vandalism and firebombings, as well as a series of boycotts organized by Danny Bakewell, the leader of the Brotherhood Crusade.
He has targeted the Empire Liquor Market, where Miss Harlins was killed, the 7 Days Food Store, where a Korean grocer waved a pistol in a dispute with two men who were delivering eggs, and the Jr. Liquor Market, which was closed in the agreement Friday.
In the final days of the 110-day picket of that market, a half-dozen picketers were protesting the death of Arthur Lee Mitchell, a former amateur boxer, who was shot in an attempted holdup on June 14 by the shop's owner.
The scene was emblematic of the deep fissures of mistrust and misunderstanding that often divide the city's many ethnic groups.
Inside the quiet, empty store, its owner, Tae Sam Park, 47, patted his heart and said, "I'm scared -- all the time." Every day, he said, he and his wife, Kum Ock Park, walk past picketers shouting, "Go back to Korea!" and "Murderer!"
Mr. Bakewell has said he hoped to form a flying force of picketers who would make Korean businesses change their ways or close down altogether. The agreement ending the boycott would offer Mr. Park's grocery for sale to a black buyer, if one comes forward.
This approach seemed only to underline the economic realities behind the black-Korean tensions.
Outside Mr. Park's store, the picketers said that when shoppers approached them they sent them down the street to King's Market, the only other nearby grocery.
King's Market is owned by a Korean.

HEADLINE: REPORT IS CRITICAL OF MENTAL CLINICS

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Nearly half of the community mental health centers that are required to provide basic services under Federal contracts have failed to do so, a Government report asserts.
Officials of the National Institute of Mental Health, the agency in charge of the community mental health program, disputed the figure issued Thursday in the report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. But they acknowledged that 10 to 15 percent of the community mental health centers under contract with the Government were failing to provide basic services. 
 The failure of this and other programs to provide service is one of the reasons for the growing number of homeless, mentally ill people now wandering the streets of American cities untreated, experts say.
About 600 community mental health centers have received a total of several hundred million dollars in Federal construction money in the past 25 years. In return, they agreed to provide, for at least 20 years, five basic mental health services, including emergency treatment and outpatient clinics.
 
249 Failures Are Cited
 The Inspector General's report estimated that 249 of the 600 have failed to give the basic services to the community and many have failed to provide service at all to the poor, as required. The report was released at a hearing of the Human Resources Subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee.
But officials of the mental health institute estimate that about 60 of the centers have failed to provide basic care. The agency said it was working to get them to do so in most cases. In a few cases, the agency is seeking to have the mental health centers return the original Federal investment.
But both the Inspector General and the mental health institute agreed that the community mental health center program had been substantially altered over the years.
The program was begun in 1963 in the belief that the hundreds of thousands of patients being released from mental institutions under new laws and court rulings could go home and receive mental health care at the centers in their communities.
 
Construction on Promises
 The Federal Government provided construction money to build the centers, often as part of existing hospitals, and in return the centers agreed to provide five basic services: emergency mental treatment, in-patient care for the severely ill, day treatment for those who could live at home but needed intense care, outpatient services for those who needed periodic treatment, and education services to schools, hospitals and other institutions.
Further, these centers were required to provide a small amount of free or very low-cost care to those who could not afford regular rates for 20 years. The amount required in the 1963 law was 10 percent of the original construction grant in services each year, an amount that now amounts to very little after almost three decades of inflation.
Today Dr. Alan Leshner, acting director of the National Institute of Mental Health, said that in the intervening years it had become apparent that community mental health centers had been unable to provide adequate service to those who were released from institutions or were most seriously ill.
In addition, it has become clear that few centers provide free care. Some provide reduced-price care, but for people without insurance, the amount can still be high. In one example cited, a 45-minute counseling period cost $18.
Among the institutions cited in the report as failing to provide basic services were are such well-known clinics as McLean Hospital near Boston and the Thalians Community Mental Health Center at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
Other institutes cited as failing to provide basic care were the University of Arkansas Medical Center; Carondelet Health Services in Tucson, Ariz.; Buffalo General Hospital in New York State; Touro Infirmary in New Orleans; Battle Creek Adventist Hospital in Michigan, and Youth Consultation Services of the Episcopal Church in Newark.
 
'A Toughter Attitude'
 A report 18 months ago by Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, working with a former consultant for the institute, Howard Fishman, found serious deficiencies in the way mental health services were provided by many of the centers.
Representative Ted Weiss, Democrat of Manhattan, the chairmen of the subcommittee holding the hearing, said that since the report was issued, "N.I.M.H. was supposed to require the centers to refund the Federal grants they had received, or to make up for their past mistakes by providing the required services for additional years."
"Today, we hear that in most cases, N.I.M.H. failed to do either," he said.
Dr. Leshner said he believed that many of the centers cited as deficient were not seriously deficient and that their violations could be corrected. In several cases, the institute asked the centers to keep offering services several years beyond their 20-year requirement to make up for their years of failure. But the institute asked for only about one-third of the number of additional years that the Inspector General's report said could be extracted from the centers.

HEADLINE: Lured by Zlotys, Ivan Plays The Model Migrant Worker

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRZEMYSL, Poland, Sept. 29

 BODY:
In the factories and on the construction sites of eastern Poland, there is a new model employee these days. Trustworthy, tireless, and willing to accept half the prevailing wages, these highly prized workers speak broken Polish and are likely to answer to names like Nikolai, Mikhail or Ivan.
They are Russians, Lithuanians and Ukrainians. Like the Poles who have for years streamed west to work without permits in America and Western Europe, they are flocking to Poland, eager to earn sums equivalent to eight months Soviet pay in a month. Some enter legally, while many more come on tourist visas and then melt into the cities and countryside, wherever there is work. 
 The result is a paradox of Eastern Europe's uneven transition to capitalism. While state enterprises in the Soviet Union have earned a reputation for inefficiency and indolence, Polish employers in this border region speak of Soviet workers in awe-struck tones -- even as Poles continue to supply the West with cheap, illegal labor.
"They work for much less money; they don't need vodka, and they work without supervision," said Michal Rabski, who owns two cosmetic stores and is putting the final touches on his three-story home. His construction crew consists of two Nikolais and a Pyotr, all from Sambor, a Ukrainian city about 35 miles from the border.
"Look at the way they work -- everything is neatly put away," Mr. Rabski said with evident delight. "If they were Poles, half of the village would be up here having drinks."
 
A Yen for Zlotys
 To the visiting Soviet workers, the most important feature of Poland's economic program is the internal convertibility of the Polish currency, the zloty. While foreigners are officially barred from trading zlotys for American dollars or other foreign currency, the exchange counters in various Polish cities in fact serve all comers. Soviet visitors can also use their zlotys to buy goods that are scarce in the Soviet Union -- from cars to children's clothing -- and resell them back home at a large profit.
The two Nikolais and Pyotr are typical. They entered the country legally, sponsored by a Polish construction company, and work in their spare time for Mr. Rabski, earning 10,000 zlotys an hour, a bit less than $1 and about half of what Poles make for comparable labor. Their total monthly pay, 1.4 million zloty, turns into $128, which in turn can be traded for at least 4,000 rubles at the current black-market exchange rate -- eight months pay for the average Soviet factory worker, whose monthly salary is about 500 rubles, although workers in private, cooperative and other enterprises can earn much more.
A year ago, officials throughout Eastern Europe feared the imminent arrival of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of refugees from a collapsing Soviet Union. That threat has not materialized, but Polish officials worry that the loosening of travel restrictions in the Soviet Union presages a flood of migrant workers who will take jobs from Poles or force local wages lower.
The phenomenon reflects the differing pace of economic change in the two countries. Poland is in the second year of a far-reaching program that filled once empty shops with goods; the Soviet Union is still debating the first steps towards dismantling its command economy. Further, Soviet workers have little or no incentive to work.
 
Four Million Soviet Visitors
 Local officials say they have no solid estimate on how many Soviet citizens are working in Poland, but they acknowledge that the number is growing, with most of them taking jobs primarily in construction and in private factories. More than four million Soviet citizens have already visited Poland this year, and tens of thousands are known to be legally in the country now.
"Things in Poland are in good order," said the younger Nikolai at the door of the workers' hotel where he temporarily lives. "This is the kind of work and conditions we'd like to have in the future in free Ukraine." He and his colleagues said they intend to stay in Poland through the rest of this year, but said they have no plans to settle in the country.
Local employers -- cities or other entities -- may hire the Soviet citizens if they establish that no Poles are available for the work in question and that the wages are appropriate in the labor market. In Rzeszow, when the local orchestra expanded, it chose to hire 14 violinists from the Ukrainian city of Lvov at a salary of 1.4 million zloty, or $128, a month; an orchestra official said no Polish musicians were available at this salary.
From the Soviet side, a prospective worker needs only a written invitation from a Polish citizen -- which must be approved by local police -- and a valid Soviet passport.
Lodging is a problem for some of the migrant laborers. Local officials say that visiting Soviets have been seen sleeping in sheds Poles keep on their state-provided garden plots, leaving behind a bottle of Russian vodka as payment.
 
'Longing for Work'
 Zdzislaw Besz, a journalist from Przymysl who operates a store and brick factory, said he hired two Ukrainians earlier this year with the help of a cousin from Kiev. Mr. Besz said he paid them the same salary as his Polish employees.
"These are excellent specialists," Mr. Besz said. "They never gave me any problems. I'd like to hire even more Russians. These people were motivated. I didn't have to keep my eye on them."
Jacek Pasternak, head of the labor office in Rzeszow, about 60 miles from the Soviet border, said he has heard reports of labor markets, where Polish employers can place orders for craftsmen from the Soviet Union. But he said most appeared to be finding work through informal channels.
The story told by Kazimierz, a 68-year-old retired carpenter in Rzeszow, was echoed by many employers. Kazimierz, who spoke on condition that he not to be identified further, said he hired a Soviet citizen who simply walked up to his construction site and asked for work.
"He was a guy with a university education, and the goal he set himself was to add some money to the family budget and buy a car," Kazimierz said. "You could set your watch by him. He came at 7 A.M. ready for work, in his work clothes. As far as alcohol, well, he didn't drink."
 
Taking Jobs Poles Don't Want
 Poland's eastern regions have unemployment rates at or above the national average of 10 percent but local officials insist that the immigrants are taking jobs Poles have already turned down.
"Generally, Poles do not want to undertake these jobs," said Mieczyslaw Janowski, the mayor of Rzeszow. "Russians and Ukrainians do this kind of work for relatively low wages."
The Polish Government's response thus far has been characterized more by slight nervousness than by panic, and there is no systematic attempt to prevent these people from working here. If Rzeszow faces a larger influx of Russian or Ukrainian workers, Mr. Janowski said, the authorities would have no choice but to vigorously enforce immigration laws.
Still, Mr. Janowski acknowledged, his city has little ability to make the rules stick because of enforcement difficulties. "The United States hasn't resolved this problem either," he said."
The Polish tradition of working illegally in the West is particularly strong in this region. Many of the Poles working illegally in Chicago or New York come from here, and Mr. Janowski was well aware of the comparisons.
"If we felt upset because the borders of Western Europe were closed to us, so similarly the Ukrainians and Russians will feel resentment if we try to put up some very strict, inpenetrable barriers at the border," he said. "Besides, this would not resolve any of problems."
So, the two Nikolais and Pyotr toil away, saying they plan to take their earnings back home. One said he would buy a car on the open market, instead of waiting up to 20 years to order one from the state factory. Another said he planned to build a house.
And all three acknowledged that they were considerably less industrious back home. "We work as we are paid," said the younger Nikolai.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev Signs an Accord For Limited Role in I.M.F.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Opening the way for the Soviet Union to receive large-scale Western technical aid to help its transition to a market economy, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed an agreement today that grants this country special association status with the International Monetary Fund.
Under the agreement, the I.M.F. will advise the Soviet Union on combating its high inflation, setting up a Western-style banking system, gathering accurate economic statistics, and establishing a social safety net for those hurt most by economic reform. 
 The accord, which goes into effect immediately, contains no explicit Soviet commitment beyond supplying economic statistics to the I.M.F. But implicit in the negotiations has been an understanding that the Soviet Government will continue to push for market principles as it negotiates to transform itself into a loose economic confederation of sovereign republics.
"This agreement paves the way for the U.S.S.R. and the republics to take their rightful places in the world economic system," the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, said after meeting with Mr. Gorbachev.
"None of us here believes that this agreement will create miracles overnight," Mr. Camdessus said. "On the contrary, this agreement represents the beginning of a difficult and challenging course of economic reform that is unique in our history."
Under Communist rule, the Soviet Union repeatedly denounced the Washington-based I.M.F. as an instrument of capitalist exploitation.
Today's agreement states that the fund will also provide technical assistance to the republics if they request it. I.M.F. officials said they were waiting for the central Government and the republics to clarify their political and economic relationship before the agency determines what aid to give to Moscow and what to the republics.
Mr. Camdessus said individual republics might be able to become full I.M.F. members if they wish to and if they achieve diplomatic recognition as independent countries.
In London in July, the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial democracies agreed to offer the Soviet Union special association status with the I.M.F., but a week later the Kremlin applied for full membership. Such membership would enable Moscow -- with a crumbling economy and almost $70 billion in foreign debt -- to borrow money from the I.M.F., which was set up in 1945 to promote exchange-rate stability and economic growth among nations.
 
Surer Organization Wanted
 At a news conference today, Mr. Camdessus said full Soviet membership was inappropriate, at least for now, while Moscow and the republics had not yet hammered out their relationship. He added that it was now impossible to accurately assess the Soviet Union's economic output and determine how much money it would be required to contribute to join the I.M.F.
Mr. Camdessus said special association was preferable for now because it enabled the fund to begin providing immediate technical assistance.
The Bush Administration has opposed granting the Soviet Union full membership because it worries that any loans Moscow took out might be squandered until substantial economic changes were in place. But Germany, whose banks are major creditors of the Soviet Union, has supported membership. German commercial banks are eager for the I.M.F. to lend money to the Soviet Union to help keep it solvent.
The I.M.F. director said teams from his group would begin working in Moscow on Monday to discuss the range of aid to be provided, analyze and discuss tax policy, and assess the nation's process of collecting statistics.
 
Vast Soviet Resources
 "This country has incomparable human resources, well-trained people," Mr. Camdessus said. "What is necessary is to give them the savoir-faire, the know-how accumulated in our institution over 45 years."
President Gorbachev and republic officials seemed eager to move forward with economic change, he said, adding that I.M.F. experience shows that when people and their government back reforms, "progress can be made rapidly."
Under today's agrement, the fund will open a permanent office in Moscow and conduct periodic assessments of the nation's economic policies and performance, as it does with full members. It will also invite Soviet banking officials to Washington to take I.M.F. Institute courses on subjects like regulating the money supply and foreign exchange operations.

HEADLINE: Dying Town Considers Salvation in a Landfill

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WELCH, W.Va., Oct. 2

 BODY:
The corrugated Appalachian terrain of McDowell County is as pretty as America gets this time of year, with the leaves starting to turn along the banks of the shimmering Tug Fork River. But it is as sad as America gets, too, with the hills that are dressed in foliage ravaged by coal mining, and the river fouled by raw sewage because the county seat, Welch, has never had the money to build a sewer system.
Now some hope has dawned, but it is hope tinged with despair and a sense of ignominy. A developer is proposing to set up a vast landfill in a remote 6,000-acre hollow three miles from town to treat and store sewage sludge, household garbage and incinerator ash from other states, brought in by 150 to 200 railroad cars a day. It would be the nation's largest repository for non-toxic out-of-state refuse. 
 In return, the developer, Capel Resources Inc., would build Welch a sewer system that would clean up the river, which has the state's highest levels of fecal bacteria and which flows through Welch. The county would get tax revenue from the landfill and long-term jobs for to 300 workers, many of them former miners who have been displaced by automation.
However demeaning the notion of building an economy upon the refuse of other economies, most community leaders here say the only alternative is McDowell County's extinction as an economic entity.
"We're for it for the economic benefits," said Tony Johnson, a former state trooper who publishes the little Welch Daily News. "It's a damn shame a county has to look at doing something like that. In my heart I'm mad about it. But I don't see anything else. It's a cornerstone to build off of."
 
Legislature Considers Action
 But to others, including Gov. Gaston Caperton, the landfill would be an environmental disaster. "The people of West Virginia are crying out for protection from out-of-state garbage," the Governor, a Democrat, told a special session of the Legislature this week. He is proposing an overall limit on landfills that, by setting a maximum monthly tonnage for each landfill, would severely restrict the acceptance of other states' waste.
Environmentalists warn of poisons leaching into creeks and water tables and of mob-controlled waste haulers lacing their exports to West Virginia with prohibited toxic materials.
But Jack Fugett, president of Capel Resources, said the company was taking all precautions to prevent the contamination that others fear and that the hollow was situated beyond any roads or sight of the community.
Governor Caperton expects the issue to be resolved in the special session, within two weeks.
Under Federal deadlines to close overloaded and leaky landfills, many states have turned to incineration and recycling. But incineration is often expensive and can foul the air, and a lot of waste is not recyclable. Capel Resources, an affiliate of the Berwind Corporation of Philadelphia, a big owner of coal mines in McDowell County, calculates that rather than engage in the political brawls of opening new landfills, states would readily dispatch their wastes to West Virginia.
 
A Town Divided
 The question is how readily West Virginia would receive it. In McDowell County, there are strong feelings on both sides.
"I don't like sitting on somebody else's garbage," said an aged widow on the porch of her home in a fashionable neighborhood of Welch, population about 3,200. She refused to give her name because she said she was afraid of recrimination.
Paitsel Lockhart, a retired teacher and school administrator, lives in a poorer part of town on Route 16, closer to the site of the proposed landfill. "Kick the dump in the rump," reads the sign propped in front of her house.
Ms. Lockhart is an officer of Tears-WV, which stands for Team Effort Against Ruining Southern West Virginia. "I think the mountains are too beautiful for out-of-state garbage," she said. "Good for the economy? Maybe it's good for their economy," the economy of Berwind in Philadelphia.
But Welch's Mayor, Martha Moore has endorsed the landfill.
 
Mine Union's Views
 The United Mine Workers, still a powerful institution in the state, has seen its membership plunge in southern West Virginia. While the landfill would bring jobs, the union doubts that those hired would be anywhere near 300 and that they would earn little more than the minimum wage because the jobs would require little expertise.
The union wants the landfill limited to waste produced by West Virginians. But Mr. Fugett says that would be too little to justify the project.
Most people in McDowell County seem to think the local economy is in such a state that any new business, however humiliating, is worth trying, and supporters of the landfill are urging the Governor to exempt the county from his proposed dumping cap of 50,000 tons a month and let McDowell residents decide for themselves.
 
Living Off the Government
 McDowell County's population is 35,000, a third the level of the 1950's. Most months, it has the highest unemployment of the state's 55 counties, currently exceeding 20 percent, or more than twice the state average. Government checks -- for Social Security, unemployment compensation, coal miners' disability, welfare -- are the principal source of income.
A study this year by the state Task Force on Children, Youth and Families found that 37 percent of McDowell County's residents fall below the Federal poverty line, which was $13,360 for a family of four last year; that percentage is about twice the average for the state.
In the view of many people here, the sole options are moving away and thereby accelerating the county's decline or installing the landfill. Most sources of jobs do not come to McDowell County. Companies that would build factories are repelled by a terrain too hilly to accommodate them and by roads, all tortuous and only two lanes, that put the nearest sizeable city, Beckley, up to an hour and a half away.
"I'm concerned about environmental control," said Don Goodson, a grocer here. "If that can be achieved, then, yes, we should have the dump."

HEADLINE: House Battles to Make Parental Leave Veto Proof

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
House supporters of a bill that would grant many workers unpaid leaves for family emergencies say the Senate's overwhelming approval of the measure this week will strengthen their cause. But they still foresee an uphill struggle to pass a veto-proof version of their own.
The House proponents say they are sure they can improve on the 237-to-187 vote that passed a similar bill last year, a margin that fell far short of the two-thirds approval necessary to override a veto. To attract more votes, they say, they will adopt compromises reached in the Senate that decreased the number of part-time workers and senior-level employees covered by the leave benefit. 
 The bill would require employers of more than 50 workers to grant their employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year for the adoption or birth of a child or for a serious illness suffered by the employee or an immediate family member. Workers would be guaranteed their jobs back upon returning to work.
The legislation, which would cover 46 million people and is vigorously opposed by business groups, is to come before the full House in two or three weeks. The Senate passed the compromise measure on Wednesday, 65 to 32, with three Democratic supporters absent, but President Bush has said he planned to veto the measure, just as he vetoed last year's bill.
House Democrats have been savoring the uncomfortable position that their Republican colleagues were left in by the President's promise of a veto. They said that while Mr. Bush might be able to withstand political damage caused by opposing abortion rights, increased unemployment benefits and family leaves, Republican members would be forced to take the brunt of their constituents' ire if they continued to back the President.
"The President is losing some of his soldiers on this one," said Representative Pat Williams, a Montana Democrat who is chairman of the House Education and Labor Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations. Still, he expressed doubt that the House could pass the Senate version by a veto-proof margin.
 
Seeking White House Approval
 Mr. Williams said he and other supporters of the legislation would try to work with the White House and Republican lawmakers "to determine whether or not we can pass a bill and get a Presidential signature."
Representative Marge Roukema of New Jersey, the most active House Republican supporter of the legislation, said the margin of the Senate victory would "send a powerful message to the rank and file here." But she added that while her rough estimate of the current House vote spread was more favorable than last year's tally, "it's not good enough."
"We still have to do an education job on why the business community has no legitimate complaint and why you can't keep saying no to American working families," she added.
Ms. Roukema suggested that Mr. Bush still might eventually drop his opposition to the family-leave bill without major modifications, but Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, put a damper on such hopes by insisting that businesses should not be forced by law to provide the benefits.
Mr. Fitzwater dismissed the bill as a partisan Democratic effort to make Mr. Bush look insensitive to the needs of families, although 15 Republican Senators voted to pass it. "This bill points up very dramatically the kind of political season that is upon us here," he said.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is the principal sponsor of the legislation in the Senate, is seeking a compromise with the White House despite Mr. Fitzwater's comments, according to a Senate aide.

HEADLINE: Japan Focuses on Takeshita for Premier

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 5

 BODY:
A bruising contest for the political leadership of Japan got off the ground today with all eyes focused on former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, a wily and secretive leader of the governing party's biggest faction with the power to make or destroy any candidate's chances.
Mr. Takeshita and his ally, Shin Kanemaru, were the ones who at the last minute withdrew their support from Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Friday, forcing him to drop his efforts to win another term in office. Until this week, they were Mr. Kaifu's biggest benefactors. 
 The Kaifu withdrawal paved the way for a race that will culminate on Oct. 27, when 394 members of Parliament in the governing Liberal Democratic Party choose their next leader. The struggle was expected to provide an important glimpse into the way power relationships work behind the scenes in Japan.
Today, for instance, Mr. Takeshita and Mr. Kanemaru were beseeched by three would-be successors to Mr. Kaifu. The meetings were the subject of endless speculation, including whether Mr. Takeshita would eventually decide, or be asked by his colleagues, to try to return to the job.
 
Power Behind the Scenes
 Mr. Takeshita resigned as Prime Minister in April 1989 to take responsibility for a spreading bribery and corruption scandal that had caused his approval ratings to skid to single digits in the polls. But he has continued to wield power behind the scenes.
Announcing their candidacies were Kiichi Miyazawa, a former Deputy Prime Minister; Michio Watanabe, a former Finance Minister, and Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a former Foreign Minister. All are considered shrewd and experienced professionals but linked to various scandals in the past.
Mr. Miyazawa, an urbane former government bureacrat, and Mr. Watanabe, a gruff-voiced political operative, were initial front-runners. Both pledged today to continue the cause of political reform, economic expansion and close ties to the United States.
In another development today, Mr. Kaifu held a news conference but declined to explain his decision this week to threaten a dissolution of Parliament, then to withdraw the threat, and then to make the threat again -- a sequence that was said to have led to his downfall.
 
Failure of Reform Plans
 "Many things have happened," he said with a grim face, his hands folded tightly before him. "Now I have put everything in my heart and I have nothing more to say."
The Prime Minister, who will remain in office until Oct. 30, said he had only one regret, the failure of his package of bills overhauling Japanese politics, including curbs on fundraising, government subsidies of campaigns, and a sweeping redistricting of parliamentary districts.
Those changes were all aimed at reducing the flow of money into the political system, but they were torpedoed by an alliance of party barons. Mr. Kaifu said he nonetheless hoped that the next Prime Minister would pursue the agenda of political reform.
 
Biggest and Richest Faction
 The contest for Prime Minister is certain to be less the result of issues than the product of alliances of the governing party's five factions, cemented as always by promises of jobs and patronage.
The Takeshita faction is not only the biggest in number, with 108 members, it is also the richest, tapping hundreds of millions of dollars in funds from the securities, automobile, construction, electronics and appliance industries, all of which have been helped by the Government.
Under normal circumstances, the Takeshita faction might have been expected to turn to two of its younger and more promising leaders. But one, Ichiro Ozawa, a former party secretary general, has taken himself out of the running, partly because he suffered a heart attack last summer.
The other, Ryutaro Hashimoto, is tainted because this week he resigned as Finance Minister in Mr. Kaifu's Government to take responsibility for the huge securities scandal, in which the ministry's surveillance of the industry was widely criticized as lax.

HEADLINE: Gambling's Spread: Gold Rush or Fool's Gold?

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DEADWOOD, S.D.

 BODY:
Hoping to breathe some life into this colorful but withering Old West town in its storied gulch, South Dakota voters approved casino gambling in Deadwood two years ago. The promoters said they expected betting of $4 million a year.
They were way off. In the first two years, gamblers have bet $400 million on Deadwood's slot machines and blackjack and poker tables. 
 "Nobody," said Bill Walsh, a former Roman Catholic priest who runs a hotel and casino here, "could have expected anything like this."
Deadwood may be the most successful recent venture in legal gambling, but it is not alone. Around the nation, and especially in the West, gambling fever has reached a gold-rush pitch. Gambling experts predict that one day in the not-too-distant future, casinos will be operating within an easy day's drive of everyone in the nation.
The experts warn that gambling is no economic savior; some call it nothing more than a tax disguised as a slot machine. But such warnings have been ignored in the face of the magical appeal of chance.
Already, gamblers in Iowa and Illinois can wager on riverboats in the Mississippi River, and Louisiana and Mississippi have approved similar plans. The slot machines started whirring in three Colorado mountain towns last Tuesday. Card games are legal in California, Montana and Oregon. Slots are permitted in the oceanside counties of Maryland. Vermont is considering legalizing video poker.
 
Indians Look to Gambling
 And Indian reservations are investing heavily in gambling. In Minnesota, reservations operate 11 casinos with profits last year of $500 million, though they hardly threaten Los Vegas, which gathered a take of $4.3 billion last year. There are casinos on reservations in Michigan and South Dakota, and tribes in at least 10 other states plan to open gaming halls.
Under Federal law, tribes can offer any games already legal in their state. And Indians are not subject to the same betting limits. One casino in Minnesota, for example, has gambling of up to $1,000 a hand.
Between 1982 and 1990, gross gambling revenues roseto $25.9 billion from $10 billion, not accounting for inflation. And the nation's aging populace augurs more growth. Older people tend to have more disposable income, and more time to dispose of it.
 
A National Pastime

"Like any industry, there is a saturation point for gambling," said Paul Dworin, publisher of Gaming & Wagering Business Magazine. "But we're not anywhere near reaching it yet."
Once viewed as a bit tawdry, even sinful, by a large segment of society, gambling has become a national pastime, now regarded as American as, say, the lottery, which is sanctioned in 36 states.
"The nation's inhibitions toward gambling have been completely broken down, and why not?" said Bill Thompson, a professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas who has written books about the gambling industry. He said people tend to take this attitude: "If your own state approves of gambling, in the form of the lottery, then it must be all right."
 
Benefits Called Overstated
 In rural regions, gambling has been embraced as an economic tool to generate jobs. And as a means of raising money for government treasuries, politicians have found that gambling is often considerably more palatable among voters than, say, increases in the sales tax.
But Mr. Thompson, who predicted that someday no one will live very far from a casino, contends that the economic benefits of gambling have been vastly overstated. To be sure, some towns and regions reap economic returns. But it does not help the economy as a whole, he said. Gambled money simply plays a sort of musical chairs, jumping from the pocket of an unlucky player to a luckier one.
Atlantic City's struggling neighborhoods, for example, are testimony that gambling's high tide does not lift all boats. "There is this notion that gambling creates all this new, free money," he said. "That's nonsense, of course. Money doesn't grow on trees. A job that's created by gambling in one place usually just means the loss of a job somewhere else. For the most part, gambling only amounts to a tax. And it's a very inefficient, unfair tax."
 
Powerful Supporters
 In referendums on gambling, those campaigning in favor usually outspend opponents by 20 times or more. There was scant popular opposition when gambling in the Colorado towns of Central City, Blackhawk and Cripple Creek was approved in a statewide vote.
Indeed, three council members in Cripple Creek who voiced opposition to gambling were recalled by the voters. One of them, June Sylvain, said some people snubbed her after she predicted that gambling would ruin Cripple Creek. She has since moved away.
Bets in Colorado and South Dakota are limited to $5, with gambling halls offering slots, blackjack and poker. Riverboat gamblers in Iowa cannot lose more than $200 on a trip, at least in theory, because players are limited to buying that amount in chips.
 Stakes are kept smaller, in part, to avoid attracting organized crime. And promoters say the limits on bets insure that no player can get hurt too badly. But at $5 a throw, or even less, a paycheck can disappear in an afternoon, as many unlucky gamblers know.
 
A Compulsive Quest
 And for every gambler who strikes it rich, many more fall victim to a compulsive quest for the big jackpot. For these gamblers, who account for an estimated 5 percent of all bettors, the expansion of gambling could put temptation nearly everywhere.
"I'm sure Colorado already has some Gamblers Anonymous meetings," said Arnie Wexler, the executive director of the Council of Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey. "But just wait and see how many more there are going to be now."
Since casinos opened in Deadwood, the biggest winner has clearly been the town treasury, which has collected more than $11 million. Much of the windfall is being used to refurbish Victorian buildings and preserve a town made famous by Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok, who was shot to death as he played cards here. Deadwood is perhaps the nation's only town of 3,000 with a full-time archeologist.
Some longtime residents here, however, wonder if gambling has not succeded too well. Traffic is heavy, the sidewalks are crowded and the quaint, small-town feeling has disappeared, along with most of the retail stores.
 
No Drug Store, But Lots of Slots
 The Deadwood Trading Post has become the Golddiggers casino. The New York clothing store has become the Midnight Sun casino, which is owned by Dan Costner and his brother, Kevin, the actor. The town's car lots are gone, and so is the drug store. The famous Goldberg's grocery store remains, but it is jammed with slot machines.
"It's exciting now, like a constant carnival," said Bob Harlan, a Deadwood resident who works for the Homestake Mine Co. in nearby Lead. "But it's completely changed the face of the town. A lot of the older people feel badly about it. We have a lot of good restaurants now. But you have to go out of town to buy clothes, or just about anything else. And we don't recognize the faces in town anymore."
But proponents of gambling note that Deadwood had been sliding toward oblivion for years, and they say gambling offered the only realistic hope for survival.
"You had a town that was experiencing decades of slow decline," said Jody Severson, a tourism consultant here. "Maintenance on the infrastructure had been deferred. The tourism was drying up. And this is a state that's near the bottom of per capita income. It's desperate for jobs."
 
Gambling Jobs at Home
 Indeed, the gaming growth has allowed many young people to find jobs at home, curtailing the traditional exodus to bigger cities.
 For owners of businesses in new gambling centers, the increase in prices for commercial real estate has made many rich. Most of these retailers have happily sold buildings for 10 times or more what they had been worth.
But Rosie Hennings, who runs an antique shop amid the gaming halls in Central City, has been one of the few holdouts. She had declined offers of up to $1.3 million for her establishment.
In fact, she has posted a hand-lettered sign in her window:
"We approve of gambling," it reads. "However, this shop will stay as is -- we are not going out of business. Merchandise is not 50 percent off."

HEADLINE: Multiculturalism Divides More Than It Unites

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Mosaic and the Melting Pot" (Op-Ed, Sept. 23), Hugh B. Price trots out the favorite evidence of the multiculturalists for alleged Eurocentric bias in today's classrooms: textbook enormities from the 1950's. (New York State's Education Commissioner, Thomas Sobol, is particularly fond of the long-defunct "Columbus discovered America" idea when arguing for textbook reform.) Never have outdated textbooks had so long and useful a life -- their pedagogical value long since exhausted, they are recycled as ideological weaponry for a war that has already been won. 
 One would never know from the alarmist rhetoric that textbooks have been revised in accordance with the multiculturalist agenda for well over a decade. A study by Nathan Glazer and Reed Ueda in 1983 of six major high school American history books found that European immigrant groups received a quarter or less of the coverage accorded blacks and Hispanics, and that the achievements of minority culture and individuals were disproportionately stressed (with the exception of Asians, whose successes do not sit well with the multiculturalists).
The textbooks presented American history as a morality play whose primary theme is the oppression of virtuous ethnic minorities by a monolithic evil white majority.
It is most unlikely that in the eight years since the Glazer-Ueda study, textbooks have become less sensitive to minority demands. But since the multiculturalists' power is directly proportional to the stridency of their demands, they cannot acknowledge their own success.
Mr. Price seeks to turn the tables on the proponents of a common American civic tradition by arguing that the multiculturalists are its only true defenders. He appropriates the rhetoric of his opponents, invoking the political and economic freedom that "defines our society and bonds us together." This is a clever rhetorical ploy, but wholly specious.
The proponents of multiculturalism have little interest in the elements in American ideology that bond us together. They typically express nothing but disdain for the American experiment, seeing it as a thinly veiled project of imperialism and racism. But their emphasis on race and ethnicity as the most important elements of a person's identity augurs a new apartheid, in which one's racial and ethnic qualifications are scrutinized carefully to determine fitness for a job or inclusion in the curriculum. Contrary to Mr. Price's claims, multiculturalism leads not in the direction of "inclusiveness," but toward fragmentation and exclusivity.
The concept of an inclusive, tolerant society is the legacy of the European Enlightenment, and of it alone. We can realize that ideal not by trashing the Western tradition, but by understanding it through the study of its history.

DOWN TO EARTH

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:
EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE FEELING THE RESTRAINED MOOD of the 1990's -- including the folks at the International Home Furnishings Market in High Point, N.C. At this mecca of mainstream furniture design, the kind of opulent features that flourished in the 80's -- gilt and velvet, shiny lacquers and trompe l'oeil surfaces -- are no longer politically correct. When the nation's largest wholesale furniture fair opens on Oct. 17, for nine days, the look will be low-key, the feeling earthy.
"There's no question that manufacturers are taking into account a very different set of values than they were a decade ago," says Robert Sonneman, a lighting designer who will introduce his first collection of furniture and fabrics this fall. "People want solid pieces with intrinsic value, furniture you can put your feet up on." 
 Which also means modern isn't really modern anymore. "There's a softer, more romantic approach to contemporary styling," reports John Mascheroni, a designer for Swaim and for Jeffco. "The hard edge is disappearing." So are slick pieces fashioned from plastics, steel and polished chrome. The new look, to borrow a computer cliche, is user-friendly. Brushed metals, weathered patinas and natural finishes prevail, along with organic motifs. The most environmentally conscious manufacturers are even using recycled wood and nontoxic paint.
As always at High Point, the offerings are geared to the thousands of store buyers and merchandise managers who will shop the showrooms. Naturally, then, the economy will influence style. With sales down in both the furniture and housing markets, manufacturers fear taking chances on bold new looks and flights of creative fancy. Designs are more cautious, and so are purchases.
"Homeowners are no longer buying seating by the mile," Mascheroni says. "They are more interested in acquiring one piece at a time -- a love seat one year, a reading chair the next." In an effort to spur sales, showrooms will be carrying fewer complete sets of furniture and more individual pieces -- ones with a softer, friendlier, more casual look. For the time being, it seems, furniture makers and merchants are keeping their feet firmly on the ground.

GRAPHIC: Photos: A chair designed by John Mascheroni for Swaim has the new softer, romantic look. Its rounded shape is reminiscent of 1930's designs. This fall's modern pieces, like the oak and brushed-metal table by Robert Sonneman for Stanley Furniture, make use of more natural materials. Earthy elements, like the twig base of this glass table by John Mascheroni for Jeffco, characterize the new look. An ebony and burl bed, from the Pace Collection's new Boca series created by Leon Rosen, has simple, conservative lines.

HEADLINE: Manhattan for Under $100 a Night

BYLINE: By TERRY TRUCCO; TERRY TRUCCO, who lives in New York, writes a column of design for The Home Section of The Times.

 BODY:
MANHATTAN has hundreds of hotels, but they tend to be expensive. Even hotels that say they are economically priced can easily cost $150 a night for a double room. And that's before little extras like room service, tips and taxes, which are currently 16 1/4 percent for rooms under $100 and 21 1/4 percent for rooms over $100, plus $2 a room.
But Manhattan is a big place, and it's still possible to get a room for two for less than $100 without checking into a youth hostel. You shouldn't set your sights too high, of course. Expect an elevator, a private bathroom and sturdy locks. Expect fresh sheets, clean towels and daily maid service. Room service is usually too much to ask for, though there should be vending machines and perhaps coin-operated washing machines. And if your room has recently been renovated, there may even be a bit of style. 
 I recently spent a night at four hotels aimed squarely at budget-minded visitors. Three were chosen because they are either new or recently renovated. And the fourth was selected because it's a legend. In each instance, I reserved a room several days in advance and never mentioned that I was writing an article.
 
Broadway American Hotel
 The new Broadway American Hotel, which opened in January, is a welcome arrival on the Upper West Side. The place is a study in budget chic. Headboards have oval cutouts displaying postcards of King Kong on the Empire State Building. (Visitors can keep the cards.) The lobby's sleek new ceiling also has big oval cutouts, with the original crenelated ceiling, nicely restored, peeking through.
These touches are particularly striking as the hotel, originally designed as a 1919 apartment building, was a dingy single room occupancy hotel for years. One caveat: 173 of its residents still live here, in rooms sprinkled among the hotel's 200 guest rooms. All doors are identical, though I assumed a room on my floor with two extra locks belonged to a permanent guest. Ear-splitting music emanated from that door as I carried up my bag; luckily, though, things got quieter when I was ready to go to sleep.
My sixth-floor $89 room was large, with simple gray speckle-paint walls, two big closets, new blue-gray carpeting and two narrow twin beds with pale blue spreads. The television stood on a cupboard that hid a mini-refrigerator. It was the perfect atmosphere for "I Love Lucy" reruns. There was an oval-topped bedside table but no desk, and two armless wooden chairs, not very comfortable. The simple, white-and-gray bathroom was spacious. Only 50 rooms have private baths. The rest share what range from baths with tiny stall showers to larger bathrooms with tubs, with one bathroom to three guest rooms, or 13 bathrooms to a floor.
The tired-looking kitchens on each floor -- no pots and pans are supplied -- seem the domain of the permanent residents (one refrigerator door was padlocked). Drinks and snacks cost $1 in vending machines throughout the building.
Broadway American Hotel, 2178 Broadway (at 77th Street), New York, N.Y. 10024; (800) 446-4556 or (212) 362-1100. Rates: double rooms with private bath, $89; $65 with shared bath. All guests must present a credit card on checking in.
 
Herald Square Hotel
 Not far from the Empire State Building (and Macy's) is the Herald Square Hotel, a neat, clean few-frills hotel, with a glamorous past. Built in 1893, this pink brick and limestone building was the original home of Life Magazine -- there's a century-old carving of Winged Life, a fetching little cupid, gazing down at the entryway. It's worth taking a minute to admire the handsome exterior, because once you're inside, historic details are few. The well-lighted lobby is functional and nothing more, with no place to sit (vending machines and lockers fill a room off to the side). But early Life photographs and covers, including illustrations by Charles Dana Gibson, a onetime resident, adorn the walls. And the atmosphere, with lots of talkative Europeans and South Americans, can be lively and fun.
Like its sister hotel, the modestly priced Washington Square Hotel, the 114-room Herald Square, renovated two years ago, is cleverly designed, with no wasted space. My compact sixth-floor room, $65 for one person, was long and extremely narrow, with pale pink walls and gray moldings. A cheery strip of classically patterned wallpaper lined the ceiling. The double bed, with a pastel patterned spread, stood beside a built-in bedside table. A cabinet holding the television was at the bed's foot. By it was a drawerless desk with a cane-back chair. The long, narrow bathroom had a fairly new tub with a sliding glass shower door. There were no free-standing lamps; instead, rather annoying fluorescent lights were built into the walls.
My tiny window looked onto another building, though much of the view was obliterated by the air-conditioner. But larger rooms, all identically furnished, are almost spacious. All have vintage Life covers on the walls.
Herald Square Hotel, 19 West 31st Street (between Broadway and Fifth Avenue), New York, N.Y. 10001; (800) 767-1888 or (212) 279-4017. Rates: double rooms with private baths, $55 (showers only), $70, $75 and $85.
 
Journey's End
 Journey's End Hotels is the slightly ominous name for a chain of Canadian-owned economy hotels found mainly in small towns throughout Canada and the United States. But in July 1990 the company opened a 189-room hotel, just off Fifth Avenue, in a new high-rise near the main branch of the New York Public Library. There are no notably New Yorkish details about the Journey's End hotel, which typifies the high end of the budget league. The big white lobby looks like an airline check-in area. The narrow mezzanine lounge, where complimentary coffee and muffins are served on weekends, is clean and comfortable and has lots of tropical-print sofas and chairs. But the place is clean and well-run, if a little preachy. A printed notice on my bathroom mirror requested that guests refrain from stealing the towels.
My 14th-floor room in the back, at a summer weekend rate of $115, looked straight onto several brick buildings. It was spacious but dark; I had to keep the lights on during the day. The queen-size bed had a green floral spread, a blond wood headboard and one bedside table. A lamp hung over a table with two upholstered chairs. The large, cream-colored bathroom had a molded plastic tub.
When I checked in I was handed a stack of take-out menus from nearby delis and Chinese restaurants. So I ordered a corned beef sandwich from Reubens.
Journey's End, 3 East 40th Street, New York, N.Y. 10016; (800) 668-4200 or (212) 447-1500. Rates: double rooms, $135.88, $88.88 on weekends.
 
Hotel Chelsea
 In its own way, the Hotel Chelsea is as famous as the Plaza. The roster of illustrious past residents at this downtown red-brick temple of bohemia includes the writers Thomas Wolfe, Dylan Thomas, Arthur Miller and Brendan Behan. Punk rocker Sid Vicious died here. And Edie Sedgwick, girl of the year in 1965, almost burned the place down. The Chelsea, which seems little changed since Edie's day, still has an intriguing atmosphere, if you like things a little scruffy and don't mind seriously outdated plumbing. It's about as far as you can get from spit and polish, but that's probably the point.
The highlight of my brief stay was a morning spent in the lobby, sipping coffee from a nearby deli. The much-painted walls are lined with an impressive collection of contemporary art, all painted or sculptured by onetime residents, including the painter Larry Rivers. And the parade of passing residents was enjoyable and varied, from old ladies in shorts and straw hats to slim young artists and actors. Everyone stopped to pet a big white dog gnawing a bone by a battered coffee table.
The elevator wasn't working very well, so I walked the four flights to my $85 room. It was roomy but very old, with painted white stucco walls and stained mouse-gray carpeting. An orange wool chair stood in a corner, next to a beat-up desk. The double bed, which didn't have a blanket, had pilly sheets and a pink floral spread that matched the curtains. An old black-and-white television stood on a pedestal. And a weary kitchenette, with gas stove, fridge and sink, was by the door. But the room got plenty of light and was oddly cheerful.
The old yellow tile bathroom, however, was ghastly. The vintage shower dripped continuously. And the toilet was a slow flush. The porter will pick up take-out orders from nearby restaurants.

HEADLINE: DANCE;
The Graham Company Faces Life Without Martha

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
For the first time in its 65-year history, the Martha Graham Dance Company will open a New York season without Graham, though the founder's imprint remains strong. She helped plan the two-week run that begins on Tuesday at the City Center, and even left an unfinished dance, "The Eye of the Goddess," from which an excerpt will be presented.
Graham also laid plans further into the future. She chose two longtime associates, Ron Protas and Linda Hodes, to run the company, and suggested directions they might take over the next few years. Work by other choreographers was to be introduced into the all-Graham repertory, and new choreographers were to be developed in the choreographers' workshop offered at the school she founded in 1927. 
 "Martha laid down an artistic and financial structure which is pretty clean for at least three to four years," said Mr. Protas, who is 46 years old. "We'll be feeling our way through the framework she left us."
To date, Ms. Hodes added, there have been few surprises. "This is not so different from what we were doing before. It's only that there's no Martha to go to and say, 'What will I do?' "
With no more new works to come from Graham, the company is reaching out to choreographers like Jerome Robbins and Paul Taylor. Graham also drew up a list of about 10 pieces long absent from the repertory for possible revival, and there was even talk of reviving Ted Shawn's tigerish "Xochitl," one of Graham's first major vehicles in 1920, for Suzanne Farrell.
Spurred by economic difficulties of the sort facing most arts groups today, the company is also considering requests from troupes around the world to stage Graham's work. So far, only Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak Project has acquired a piece, "El Penitente," which Mr. Baryshnikov will dance at the opening-night gala on Tuesday and in four other performances at City Center. Mr. Protas described this signature Graham work as "Martha's gift to Misha."
Graham had considerable personal magnetism off the stage as well as on. Mr. Protas came under her spell in 1969, when he approached her as a young amateur photographer of theater stars. A Brooklynite who had abandoned his law studies at Columbia University, Mr. Protas had no experience in running a dance company. But a few years later, Graham -- sick and feeling abandoned by some of her dancers, Mr. Protas said -- asked his help in reshaping the company. By the end of her life she had come to depend on him and he on her.
"She was a fantastic, wild, wonderful being," he said, "real, honest, strange, private, and a wise and caring woman. I don't think anyone really knew her." The two often talked about Mr. Protas's growing reputation in dance circles as a monster upstart. "That's the role of anyone close to me," he quoted Graham as having said. "They don't like me either, but it's easier to attack you."
Difficult as it is to run a company, Mr. Protas said that life has become easier in some ways now. "I don't have the responsibility I had. Every day, I had one goal -- to make life as comfortable and interesting and challenging as I could for Martha. Yes, I'm upset we have a layoff coming up. But if Martha were alive, I'd be hysterical. There'd be so much less time for her to work."
For Ms. Hodes, a former Graham dancer and an administrator at the Martha Graham Center, Graham was first a teacher and later a friend. "I came to Martha young," said Ms. Hodes, who declined to give her present age. "I was 7 and had my heart set on being an ice skater." Dancing, she had heard, was good for skaters. And since her family lived around the corner from the Graham studio in Manhattan, Ms. Hodes attended Saturday children's classes taught by Graham.
"They were extraordinary," she recalled. "There were maybe five of us. She didn't treat us as if we were little kids. She taught us technique with dramatic images. She'd tell us these great stories from dances she was working on, like Medea putting the poison crown on the princess's head. The bloodier the better."
Ms. Hodes danced with the company from 1953 to 1964, when Graham asked her to stage some of her dances for the new Batsheva Dance Company of Israel, which Ms. Hodes went on to direct. Fifteen years later, Graham called her back to New York to run her school and serve as a coach and rehearsal director.
The third key figure in the new management, appointed associate artistic director by Mr. Protas and Ms. Hodes in one of their first official actions, is Yuriko Kikuchi, a noted interpreter of Graham's dance roles, who is known professionally as Yuriko. The American-born dancer made her way to the Graham studio in 1943, armed with a permit to leave the Japanese relocation camp where she had been interned, a one-way ticket to New York and $100. She began as a seamstress, and joined the company in 1944, eventually taking on many of Graham's dance roles. She later became director of the Martha Graham School Ensemble.
"Martha was a loner, really," said Yuriko, who is 71. "She never confided anything to her dancers. We were like her different colors, for her to use as a painter." But watching Graham choreograph and perform over the years, Yuriko said, she was able to steal a lot of things.
"I talk about all those dramatic and dynamic moments to the dancers," she explained. "My job is to work with them on the artistic development of the characters, how to bring the true character of the piece out of them. I would like every one of them to get close to the performance pitch of Martha Graham. Not everyone can get there, but they can understand the dynamics and how they approach the role."
Change, all three of the managers agree, is natural and inevitable. And the world of dance has changed enormously since Yuriko's and Ms. Hodes's days as Graham dancers. "The company needs to change because the business is changing," Ms. Hodes said, "not only because of Martha's death."
Tours have been booked well into 1993, with negotiations in progress for an Australian tour in 1994. The company has reduced its deficit to $1.1 million and has acquired some eager and influential new board members. Russ Alley, the director of development, said that four planned European tours and a national tour next year are being supported by a new financial partner, Chase Manhattan Bank, which is also sponsoring the City Center season.
But the company's greatest treasure is the Graham dances. "The body of Martha's work is still so wonderful, so brilliant, so contemporary, there's no way we'll ever run out of interest in it," Ms. Hodes said. "If we do in time, then there's no reason to have a Graham company. Of course, there's an insatiable need for the new. As a businesswoman, I understand that. But I'm hoping the changes will be gradual.
"It may not be everybody's view that we are doing the right thing. But Martha chose people she trusted. She gave us her blessing to continue in a way she saw fit. This hasn't happened 10 times before. We don't have examples. We'll have to see how it goes. It's a very tenuous time, but it's also exciting. There has always been this question about what happens to a ballet or modern dance company when its creator dies. And this question has not been answered yet."

HEADLINE: Bulgaria: The Old World at Ancient Prices

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; KEITH BRADSHER is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
IMAGINE walking into a government tourism office in Manhattan, paying a little less than $5 and receiving not only the directions but also the key to a stranger's private apartment in one of the better parts of town.
Or imagine walking into one of the finest restaurants in Manhattan, consuming a five-course meal with wine, with live piano music in the background -- all for less than $10. 
 Such were my experiences last April in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, a country that offers the rich history of Europe for a fraction of the cost of a visit to Britain or France.
Indeed, traveling alone with a small knapsack in Bulgaria for 10 days cost me just $830 -- including round-trip air fare from New York. From the 80-cent fare for a two-hour intercity bus or train trip to the 50-cent hearty meals in village cafes, travel in Bulgaria is almost ridiculously cheap, a throwback to the postwar days when the United States dollar was still mighty.
Bulgaria is so little known in the United States that about as many Americans visited it in all of 1991 as went to Britain on a single average day last year. Most of the 8,000 or so American visitors to Bulgaria last year were diplomats, businessmen and consultants who stayed in Sofia, so that Bulgarians in smaller towns have met few if any Americans and are eager to chat.
And while Bulgaria's historic sites are not as famous as Notre Dame or the Tower of London, they give up nothing in beauty: the immense Rila monastery, with its painted colonnades of wood set in a wooded Balkan valley beneath snowy peaks; the walled city of Veliko Tirnovo, an elaborately restored 14th-century fortress to match Carcassonne in southern France in a more spectacular setting, and Koprivshtitsa (pronounced Ko-PREEV-cheet-sa), a small community of 19th-century homes, narrow cobblestone streets and rushing brooks spanned by stone foot bridges.
Seeing these splendors without spending a lot of money requires a certain willingness to endure some discomfort. The four Bulgarian budget hotels that I stayed in cost nearly as much as a Motel 6 in the United States but offered smaller rooms, intermittent hot water, very short beds, burned-out light bulbs and poor service. The Bulgarians have been so insulated from Western tourism that even the taxi drivers in Sofia do not understand the phrase "how much" and cannot give a price in English. Memorizing a few Bulgarian phrases is easy, however, and learning to count in Bulgarian does not take long. French companies built the Bulgarian rail system in the 1930's and French terms and signs are still used there extensively. Traveling to Sofia and back for less than $1,000 also requires a willingness to book a ticket long in advance or do business with a discount travel agent. However, Americans no longer need a visa.
Authorized with four days' notice to take a vacation, I paid just $580 to a ticket consolidator, a friend of my brother, for a ticket aboard Yugoslav Airlines.
The carrier canceled the return leg of my ticket while I was in Bulgaria -- a kindly reservations agent in Sofia fixed the problem -- and then stranded me for an extra day in Belgrade on the return because of a strike. But Yugoslav Airlines, which never knew that I was a reporter, very generously transfered me to a Pan American World Airways flight the following day. Given the civil disorder in Yugoslavia now and the difficulty with my ticket, I would not try to fly the same way again. A new, privately owned Bulgarian carrier, Jes Air, has just begun offering weekly flights from New York to Sofia with round-trip tickets as low as $678 this autumn and $568 this winter.
The true budget traveler begins saving money in Bulgaria as soon as he steps off the plane at Sofia airport. A coven of raffish-looking taxi drivers and black market money-changers haunts the exit. It is not a good idea to use them. The lucky traveler who does so will pay the official rate of about $2.20 in Bulgarian leva for the ride into town and will be able to change money at close to the official rate.
The unlucky traveler may pay considerably more for the taxi ride and lose his shirt to the money changer. One black marketeer eager to practice his English explained the tricks used to defraud tourists. These include lying about the exchange rate or handing over either a fistful of out-of-date Yugoslav currency or a few Bulgarian notes wrapped around a wad of newspaper.
The most aggressive ploy is to point suddenly at an imaginary secret police agent, grab the startled tourist's dollars or marks and bolt into the crowd.
A good strategy at the airport is simply to change money at the state bank there, pick up a map at the tourist bureau and walk outside to catch the municipal bus into town. It only costs a nickel.
After a little sightseeing, head for the downtown tourist bureau, where you will be offered a selection of hotels or, if you prefer, assigned to inexpensive lodgings with a family. Except in the summer there is no need to reserve ahead.
Repeated devaluations of the Bulgarian leva and a profusion of exchange rates for different transactions have confused even the bureau officials. A room for the night in a local apartment cost $10 in dollars during my visit. But it cost only $4.90 if I changed dollars and then paid the same official at the tourist bureau in Bulgarian leva.
My first encounter with Bulgarian hospitality came a few minutes after I had left the tourist bureau. When I mistakenly knocked on the wrong door in the apartment building, the tenant did not just walk me to the right apartment. When it became clear that no one was home, she insisted on using the key from the tourism office to open the carved wooden door and let me in.
I insisted that I could not enter someone else's apartment if no one was home, and would have to go for dinner first. So she not only walked me to a nearby restaurant but also asked whether I had enough money to pay the bill.
When I returned late that evening, the apartment proved to be very comfortable and well furnished, but occupied, like many such apartments, by an elderly woman who talked unceasingly in rapid-fire Bulgarian. I later encountered the same problem in the Black Sea port of Nesebar and, for this reason, I ended up dividing my nights equally during the trip between private homes and budget hotels.
Sofia is the best place in Bulgaria for fine dining and shopping. The Pyongyang Restaurant, forbiddingly named for the capital of North Korea, turned out to be a series of well-appointed dining rooms. I had a savory spiced mushroom dish, wild rice with beef stew, fresh bread and fruit salad over sherbet along with wine and delicious apricot brandy -- for just $8 including tip.
Good meals are hard to find in smaller towns, where the only meat served is usually poor-quality pork and fresh vegetables are almost never available. I never found it necessary to wait for a table in a Bulgarian restaurant, however, because the collapsing economy has left few people with the money to eat out.
Widespread desperation combined with the lifting of more than 40 years of Communist controls has brought a flood of privately owned religious paintings and icons onto the black market at very low prices. But shoppers should be aware that fakes are also sold and that the Bulgarian Government bars the export of any artwork deemed a national treasure.
After visiting the Alexander Nevski Memorial Cathedral, I headed for the Sofia tourist bureau. An employee there told me incorrectly that most of the intercity buses had been canceled because of a fuel shortage, and prevailed on me to pay $40 for a 50-mile taxi ride to the Rila Monastery. The taxi driver waited there for an hour, and then drove me 10 miles back to a $9 budget hotel in the village of Rila. The following day I took a municipal bus up to the monastery, took more pictures, then hitched a free ride aboard a school bus to Rila and caught an intercity bus back to Sofia for 80 cents.
Bulgarian buses and trains cost almost nothing by American standards and are clean and pleasant but very slow, having scarcely been modernized in the last half century. So to cross the breadth of the country to the Black Sea, I then paid $45 for a ticket aboard one of Bulgarian Airlines' two-propeller Antonov-4's, of ancient Soviet manufacture. We sailed low during the 90-minute flight over snow-capped mountains and hills lacerated with trails and dotted with small villages, the tile roofs of cottages forming collages of red squares below.
Burgas, the second largest Bulgarian city on the Black Sea after Varna and the region's transportation hub, has rows of huge apartment buildings facing the sea. In an Orwellian touch, each building bears a one- or two-digit number six feet high instead of a street address. The local taxi driver told me that they were mainly occupied by elderly people.
The village of Nesebar, a $7, 20-mile taxi ride from Burgas, stands on a small islet at the end of a causeway. The village contains the ruins of more than a dozen churches dating back as early as the ninth century. Because the island is fairly flat, it lacks some of the visual impact of Mont-St.-Michel in France. But the hospitality of the residents more than compensates. While the merchants in Mont-St.-Michel charge extortionate prices even for basics like food, a Nesebar resident closed her shop early and invited me to her home to feed me a light lunch and give me advice on what to see.
From Nesebar I rode a bus for nearly three hours north to Varna, visited the city's extensive Roman ruins and took a two-hour train ride inland to Shumen, the site of a well-preserved mosque built during the five centuries of Turkish occupation of Bulgaria, which ended in 1878. The following day I took another two-hour train ride farther inland to Veliko Tirnovo, Bulgaria's magnificent medieval capital. The last several days of my trip, in which I traveled by train back to Sofia with overnight stops in the market town of Kazanluk and the museum village of Koprivshtitsa, were very relaxing, but never matched the history and hospitality that I found in Veliko Tirnovo.
The site is spectacular, the Yantra River having cut itself a gorge several hundred feet deep in the soft limestone rock and wriggled through no fewer than six hairpin turns in the course of several miles. From the surrounding hills the river resembles the confluence of three, twisting through steep canyon walls. The old walled city on a hill is ringed on three sides by water, while on the fourth side, across a causeway spanning a deep gully, lies the present-day, more sprawling town.
The old town was razed to the ground by the Turkish army after its capture at the end of a five-year siege in the 14th century. Today the foundations of many houses and churches are visible, the king's palace is being rebuilt and a fairly modern church has been raised. The walls have been fully rebuilt on the two sides facing the new town.
The friendliness of the residents was remarkable. A taxi driver of Turkish ancestry took me without charge to the local mosque to show me how the government had allowed it to fall into disrepair, then invited me home to meet his father, wife and children over coffee.
A woman who had grown up in Veliko Tirnovo and just returned insisted on my joining her family for a guided tour down a historic cobblestone street. And a group of students in torn T-shirts and leather jackets gathered round at a cafe to talk about music and soccer in the West.
After touring both the old and modern cities by day, the best way to spend the evening is on the balcony of the Hotel Yantra in the new town, which looks across a gorge to the old town. There you can watch an extravagant sound-and-light show, its lasers and colored floodlights illuminating the fortress walls. Even travelers completely jaded with such shows will be impressed.
And the budget traveler can still save money. The hotel charges Western tourists as much as $100 for a lavish meal in the restaurant, after which the waiters herd everybody onto the balcony for the show. But for hardier travelers who eat at tables on the balcony, the price is a few dollars for the same meal and a seat for the show is ensured.
 
 
 
LIVING LIKE THE LEADERSHIP
 Every fan of spy novels and movies can picture the scene. High above an impoverished and bitter town stands the villa, surrounded by a high fence and at the end of a winding road through immaculate gardens. The conference room is hung with expensive tapestries, the bedrooms offer perfect views across a manicured lawn to the medieval fortress in the valley below.
And through the post-modern mansion's long hallways once stalked the absolute ruler of nine million people, the master of one of the world's most feared secret police forces.
Todor Zhivkov, the Communist ruler of Bulgaria for 35 years and the original builder and master of the Arbanasi villa overlooking Veliko Tirnovo, is now under house arrest in Sofia. His more democratic heirs to the financially crippled country have turned his estate and other country retreats of the Communist party into luxury hotels in a desperate bid to attract foreign currency.
For $70 to $90 a night, you can stay in the bedrooms where foreign dignitaries and Bulgarian party bosses once slept. Or, for just $120, you can stay in the presidential suite and imagine yourself a despotic Balkan leader. The suite includes a large anteroom with its own washroom; a spacious corner office with a massive desk and several overstuffed and uncomfortable chairs; an austerely elegant bedroom, and a bathroom the size of a Manhattan living room.
A small cafe downstairs serves delicious pastries and coffee to a clientele of foreign hotel guests and Bulgarian visitors curious to see a once-forbidden sanctuary of their leadership.
Yet the villa's exclusive ambiance is beginning to erode. Armed guards are nowhere to be seen, and the hotel staff is very friendly and willing to give tours to casual visitors. A peasant woman from the nearby village tended a small flock of rather dirty sheep on one side of the lawn. And, to my surprise, the taxi driver contemptuously urinated on a neatly trimmed hedge in the front lawn before we left.
For the budget traveler, the Etar hotel in Veliko Tirnovo charges just $10 for a single room with a less impressive view of the fortress. The beds are very short, the sheets are threadbare and the faucets drip, but there is hot water and a rollicking bar and restaurant downstairs. -- K. B.

HEADLINE: Life Without Intourist

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON; ALLEN R. MYERSON is an editor of the business section of The Times.

 BODY:
I knew that a trip to Moscow and Leningrad promised no luxury. I was ready for mass-produced meals drowned in gelatinous gravy, and gloomy hotels patrolled by personnel as friendly as wardens at the state pen. What I could not take was the price in the Intourist brochure: an off-season minimum of $1,375, or $2,179 with the flight from New York, for an advertised 10-day tour of Moscow and Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, that amounted to only eight nights in the Soviet Union.
And so, last fall, I decided to test the Soviet Union's new openness by trying to circumvent Intourist. 
 True, many guidebooks and articles warned that Intourist was the only way to go. I feared that any effort to beat the Soviet system might tempt the system to strike back.
Some foreign guidebooks mentioned that tours could be less expensive through Britain than the United States. With a few letters, telexes and phone calls, I discovered British agencies that offer inexpensive tours through Intourbureau, the Soviet Central Council of Tourism and Excursions. Set up to handle trade union exchange programs, it has tiptoed onto Intourist's turf in the past few years by taking paying customers -- an estimated 200,000 a year -- at hotels it operates in at least 25 Soviet cities.
The greatest difference between bourgeois and proletarian travel appeared to be price. I sacrificed little else by going with the Central Council instead of Intourist. For an eight-night Central Council trip from Sept. 29 to Oct. 7, Goodwill Holidays, which sells the organization's programs, asked 425 from London, or 260 for land costs alone. The exchange rate had turned sharply unfavorable, almost $2 to the pound, but the land cost was still just $1,038 for both my wife and me -- less than half the Intourist rate.
The other attraction was a chance to do more than see the sights. The Goodwill brochure was titled "Meet the Russians." It said the agency was founded by Quakers wanting to pursue "people's detente." Like many Goodwill tours, ours was organized around a special interest or group: we were offered the opportunity to join about 30 students from Notre Dame University who had been studying in London. Rather than meeting the group in London, we checked the travel advertisements and found $650 round-trip tickets on Yugoslav Airlines to Moscow, plus $30 on Aeroflot from Moscow to Leningrad, where the tour began. There was a change of planes in Belgrade, then a second red-eye flight dumping us in Moscow at 4 A.M. For us, the switch was an advantage, since we planned to visit Eastern Europe and return from Belgrade on the connecting flight.
Then the problems began. Two weeks before departure, Goodwill called to say the flight from London to Leningrad had been canceled, so the group would leave the day after. I had to change my return flight anyway since I planned to go from Eastern Europe back to Moscow; the change penalty was only $100.
Our Belgrade layover included a hotel nap and dinner at no extra cost. We returned to the airport an hour before the daily 11 P.M. flight. Bad news: The flight was bumped to 10:30 P.M., it was already filled, and we were bumped off. We came back the next night almost three hours early.
In Moscow, we were left with Leningrad tickets dated the day before, and the knowledge that Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, was invariably overbooked. We felt like stranded orphans. This was no time, we decided, to remain aloof from Intourist. In need of a foster parent, we asked an English-speaking Intourist guide for aid in getting on the Leningrad plane with her group.
The guide agreed to help. Later, we cautiously asked her about Intourbureau. "The Intourist hotels are much better," she sniffed, saying our hotel would be jammed with Russian tourists all crowding into our shared bathroom.
Our flight to Leningrad, scheduled for 7:35 A.M., left four hours late. We hitched a ride on the Intourist bus, then took a cab to our hotel, the Gavan, an Intourbureau property about five miles from downtown.
We were not impressed. The dreary lobby was roiling in cigarette smoke and sharp Slavic accents. The reception desk wanted us to wait. And wait. Fortunately, we spotted a group whose Reeboks and camping parkas were patently American. It turned out to be our group, which had arrived the day before, and our Intourbureau guide, Valera Bason, known as Val, persuaded the desk to let us into our room.
The room looked like it had been fixed up as well as possible after a brawl or two. It was clean, but narrow, with two tight single beds, end to end, along one wall, blistered wallpaper, a black-and-white television -- and our own bathroom, no matter what the Intourist guide said.
Val planned a trip to a history museum. Having missed the city tour that morning, we decided to do it ourselves. Val gave us a disapproving glare. "Thomas, I'm not responsible for these people," he loudly warned the professor who led the group.
We returned in time for a supper little different from any others we had in Leningrad or Moscow: meat, probably beef, slathered in gravy, with boiled potatoes and a vegetable puree. We usually had soups and salads for appetizers, with cabbage prominent in both. The filling offerings at breakfast included yogurt, cheese, creamy Russian farina and sausages similar to hot dogs. The meals were never unpalatable, and there was always some hearty, brown Russian bread, but everything was so bland that it seemed to fade into the plates.
That first night, we chose an evening of people's detente arranged by Goodwill at a trade union recreational center over another meeting set up by Intourbureau. Our hosts, English-speaking, more or less, were curious about the United States, and many were ready to pack up and go. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had no admirers.
Val was usually unwilling to reveal his plans more than a few minutes in advance. Leading us the next morning on a 45-minute bus trip to Pavlovsk, a sumptuous summer palace, he rushed us around with perfunctory remarks. Rolling through the nearby town of Pushkin on the way back, my wife and I asked to jump off the bus and explore, enduring more of his warnings and passing up the group's lunch.
The adventure was worth it. We looked over Catherine the Great's immense Italianate palace. At a farmer's market, we scooped up fruit far more luscious than anything in Soviet stores. We rode wooden benches on a train back to Leningrad, where we met the group at the Hermitage.
Val soon told us that, because of our late arrival in Leningrad, my wife and I had been crossed off the reservation list for the late train. The only alternative was an earlier train that would get us to Moscow before dawn.
Our train cabin had four bunks with plenty of mattresses and blankets. The car had a samovar for tea. We shared a bottle of wine with the two women in our cabin, who offered their bread, candy and cheese. The older one examined the mineral water we had bought in a hard currency shop. She coveted the plastic bottle, we realized, and we handed it over when we arrived.
Nobody met us at the Moscow station, contrary to Val's promise, so we spent five packs of Marlboros on a cab to our hotel. It was called the Central Tourist House, despite its location a 25-minute drive or 35-minute subway and bus ride from Red Square.
As Intourbureau's 35-story flagship, it was a great improvement over the Gavan. The lobby boasted travertine floors, and the sunny dining room had alcoves separated by curving wooden partitions. Our room was larger, the beds wider than in Leningrad, and the dark wainscotting handsomely matched the furniture.
The hotel's distant neighborhood did give us a glimpse of ordinary Moscow life. The subway stop was set among modern, blank-faced high-rises. The barren grocery stores, the weed-grown courtyards, the swarms of commuters packed into wheezing buses -- for most Muscovites, these were more familiar sights than the Pushkin Museum.
Many Russians were sharing the hotel, as the Goodwill brochure had promised. We had little contact. Our group was seated together at meals, and usually lounged around together, sometimes at a comfortable bar on the 34th floor. By the time we reached Moscow, my fears of being surrounded by raucous, vodka-swilling students had turned to appreciation of their observations. They were, after all, braving the Soviet Union on their break instead of lolling on some Mediterranean beach.
The several M.B.A. students were especially attentive at the Paris Commune shoe factory -- with 5,000 employees, the nation's largest. Some students were surprised by the factory's tidiness, while others wondered whether it was a showplace section of a showplace plant. We doubted that most Soviet plants had American and Japanese computers for advanced design.
The plant managers were confident of profiting in the emerging free market by keeping up to the minute with fashions. Then one said they planned new shoe designs three years in advance. The shoes in a display room looked stylish enough, if not trend-setting, but these were solely for export. They bore little resemblance to the dowdy footwear in Soviet stores.
To save the trip back to our hotel for lunch, our group ate three days of four at downtown hotels owned by the City of Moscow and often used by Intourist. The Ukrainia, a Stalinist monstrosity, featured a high-ceilinged dining room with murals, and waitresses in some ministry's conception of peasant garb. The meat was more fatty, the service more brusque than at our hotel. "Can we have one meal without cabbage or potatoes?" one woman on the tour asked.
As for our second dose of detente, what was billed as a round-table discussion at a downtown technical school featured two English-speaking economists seated at a couple of rectangular tables, with our group in rows of seats facing them. "After so many years of silence, we are glad to be able to express ourselves," one said. He was also a pollster, who had found that Mr. Gorbachev's approval rating had fallen in three years from 85 percent to 28 percent.
Otherwise, our chats with the Russians were impromptu, and sometimes easier to start than break off. Many knew some English. We were startled by their openness, irreverence and despair. We listened to the owners of a private art gallery complain of official harassment, and heard several versions of the Cab Driver Plan for economic reform.
Our guide, Vladimir, or Vlad, Khachaturian, was as much of an improvement as our hotel. He posted schedules and always had backups if plans fell through. Arriving at the Pushkin Museum one afternoon to find locked gates and a sign citing "technical reasons," he pointed the bus toward the Tretyakov Gallery, with Gorky Park across the street.
He also had an understated, contemporary wit. When we passed Gosplan in our bus, he announced, "Here is where all the five-year plans are worked out. But not very efficiently, as you can judge by our economy."
Would I travel with Intourbureau again? Assuming that price continues be an object, yes -- especially after sampling Intourist's own accommodations. A couple of weeks later, I returned to Moscow for business, staying at Intourist's prerevolutionary National Hotel shortly before its scheduled closing for renovation. A few of the most expensive rooms had Russian antiques and Kremlin views. Mine had towels and curtains with the texture of dishrags and a view of the neighboring Intourist Hotel. The dining rooms dazzled with immense chandeliers and moldings that seemed applied by French pastry chefs. But waiters, like the rest of staff, floated in a haze of indifference. The food was only somewhat better than on my tour; at one dinner, red caviar was a welcome luxury but the chicken Kiev seemed to have been cooked in Vaseline. Being down the hall from a room where Lenin himself once stayed was poor compensation for paying $160 a night. Except for the location and the whiff of Czarist grandeur, the National was no better than the Central Tourist House.
But when I return to Russia, I might join a tour in London instead of flying over myself. When things start going wrong -- and in Soviet travel, they always do -- it's more comforting to be in a group.
 
 
 
ALTERNATIVES TO INTOURIST
 In touring the Soviet Union, it pays to check the exchange rates and shop around: prices and schedules, in many cases, are as changeable as Soviet politics. Some agencies say the nation's turmoil has caused them to trim their schedules and avoid certain republics.
With the pound running at about $1.73, Britain usually offers the cheapest alternatives to Intourist. There, several agencies deal with the Central Council of Tourism and Excursions, or Intourbureau, and with some of the new entrepreneurs, partnerships and local travel services that have sprung up. Progressive Tours (12 Porchester Place, Marble Arch, London W2 2BS; telephone 262-1676) plans dozens of trips next year. An eight-day, seven-night tour of Moscow and St. Petersburg will be about $700 from London through March, about $50 more during warmer seasons. Without flights, the prices will be about $350 less. Total costs from the United States are likely to be less than half of what Intourist charges. Goodwill Holidays (Manor Chambers, School Lane, Welwyn, Hertfordshire AL6 9EB; 871-6421) also will have at least 20 tours next year.
Progressive and Goodwill are among the agencies also offering to arrange reasonably priced travel for individuals, until recently the exclusive and expensive province of Intourist. Cheapest of all are their accommodations in Russian homes -- few comforts, but they say that Russian hosts with hard currency can assemble meals much better than most hotels, and there is no better way to learn about Soviet life.
You can join British tours in the Soviet Union, but a London rendezvous is simpler, the cost difference minimal. The joint Pan Am-Aeroflot flight to Moscow from New York can add $1,100; searching for a discount flight to London or Moscow can save several hundred dollars.
A drawback of going with a British agency is applying for a visa on your own. If the Soviet embassy in Washington loses your materials or you apply with less than a month to spare, an expediting service, like Express Visa Service in Washington, (202) 337-2442, is worth the extra charges.
An Intourbureau trip through an American agency might be more convenient, and the extra cost could nearly vanish, depending on exchange rates. Try Ideal Tours, 56 West 45th Street, Suite 601, New York, N.Y. 10036, telephone (212) 764-8000, or Mir Corporation, 85 South Washington Street, Suite 210, Seattle, Wash. 98104, (206) 624-7289.
Although Intourist's prices during the warmer months remain stubbornly high, the agency has stepped in with its own special deals, including some trips under $1,000, for visitors willing to brave a Russian winter. Call General Tours, 245 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016; telephone (212) 685-1800 or (800) 221-2216.
Keep in mind that changes are in store at both Intourbureau and Intourist. Both are building new hotels: Intourbureau, a badly needed alternative to the Gavan in St. Petersburg; Intourist, several throughout the nation. And other ways to skirt Intourist are emerging all the time, as Soviet entrepreneurs, local and republic governments and foreign agencies jump into the business. -- A. R. M.

HEADLINE: Rx for a System in Crisis

BYLINE: BY BARRY MEIER; Barry Meier is a consumer reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
For half an hour, Edward Dillon has been watching television in a small basement room at the V.A. Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt., where he is an outpatient. It's not a talk show or movie that holds his attention, but a video in which patients and physicians speak in stark terms about prostate surgery. Dillon, a 74-year-old retired building inspector, has an enlarged prostate, a condition affecting more than 300,000 American men over age 50 each year. It is not life threatening, but causes such unpleasant symptoms as abdominal pain and difficulty urinating. Dillon's doctor asked him to watch the video to get a broad range of opinions about the benefits and drawbacks of the operation.
Some patients in the video say they are glad they had the surgery because they no longer experience pain and frustration trying to urinate. But others plainly regret it. Prostate surgery can damage the sphincter muscle, causing retrograde ejaculation, or dry orgasms. One man said that he was stunned at the effect the operation had on his sex life. 
 Dillon has been disinclined to have the surgery because his symptoms are mild and his doctor has not urged him to have it. Hearing this patient's story reinforces his opinion. Dillon is not alone in choosing to avoid a surgeon's scalpel. Of some 700 prostate patients who have seen the video, more than 70 percent have opted to delay surgery, including men with extremely severe symptoms.
Score a small victory for sexuality and the medical outcomes movement, a new kind of research being undertaken by a growing group of doctors who believe they've found a way to help solve America's snowballing health care woes. Outcomes researchers are attempting nothing less daunting than to find out which medical procedures work and which don't. The goal is not only to identify the treatments that can relieve symptoms or cure a disease, but also to determine whether patients are satisfied with the long-term results. These researchers argue that such information has two important benefits: it can empower patients to make informed choices about their treatment options -- with the help of educational devices such as the video on prostate surgery -- and it can help the Government and private insurers keep a rein on health care costs, which have increased an average of about 10 percent annually since 1980 to more than $604 billion in 1989.
Spurred by society's growing concern over the high cost of health care, outcomes researchers have seized on one of the most disturbing contradictions in medicine. Doctors may see their craft as a science, but more often than not they have little evidence to determine which treatments work best. Some studies suggest that tens of billions of dollars are wasted each year on diagnostic tests, drugs and surgery that are unnecessary, ineffective or possibly even detrimental.
Consider some hospital data from Iowa City and Tallahassee, Fla. A baby in Tallahassee is more than twice as likely to be born by Caesarean section as a baby in Iowa City. But as an adult, that Tallahassee baby is more likely to undergo back or neck surgery than its Iowa City counterpart. The difference appears to be the result of nothing more scientific than local medical customs. "For many conditions in medicine there are many options, and doctors often don't know which works best or which the patient would prefer," says Dr. John Wennberg, a leading outcomes researcher and a professor of epidemiology at Dartmouth Medical Center who helped develop the prostate video.
In a bid to put more science and accountability into the craft of practicing medicine, outcomes researchers have begun studies involving hundreds of hospitals across the country on the long-term benefits as well as side effects of various medical procedures. This year, the Federal Government is spending more than $62 million on such studies. They rely in part on such traditional sources of data as published scientific reports, insurance claims and hospital records. But they also include an element not often found in scientific research -- interviews with patients about their satisfaction with their treatment and its effects on their well-being. "We are really asking the question, what value are we getting for our health care?" says Dr. John E. Ware, director of the International Resource Center for Health Care Assessment at the New England Medical Center in Boston.
The answers are expected to have a powerful effect on the future of health care. Over the next few years, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, a unit of the Public Health Service, will use outcomes research to issue guidelines to doctors, nurses and other health care workers on how to treat dozens of conditions, such as diabetes, knee and hip problems, and gall bladder disease. In time, such guidelines will probably influence which procedures both Government and private health insurers choose to cover.
Many hospitals, insurers and large corporations such as General Motors and Procter & Gamble are also participating in outcomes research. Corporations, motivated by the desire to trim their health insurance costs, hope these studies will help them get the greatest medical value for their money. With evidence in hand that certain procedures are better than others, companies are aiming to play a role in selecting which diagnostic tools and treatments will be used when employees require medical care. "There is a growing appreciation that a lot of medical care is being provided to patients without anyone knowing what the impact is," says Dr. Howard Bailit, vice president for medical policy and programs at the Aetna Life and Casualty Company in Hartford.
Though still in its infancy, the outcomes movement is already sparking conflicts. Some advocates see it as a populist effort to empower patients, others as a means to control costs. But critics fear that the research will ultimately limit patients' choices, producing a "cookbook" style of medicine that addresses the needs of an average patient, without taking individuals into account. A number of experts simply dismiss outcomes research as a "soft" science, because it relies heavily on patients' feelings.
Much of the foundation for today's interest in outcomes research was laid by studies done by Dr. Wennberg of Dartmouth almost 20 years ago. In the mid-1970's, as director of a Federally funded program in Vermont that analyzed the use of services in the state's hospitals, he found that the rate of such common procedures as tonsillectomies, hysterectomies and prostatectomies varied widely from one town to the next. In Middlebury, for instance, about 7 percent of children under the age of 16 had had a tonsillectomy. But in Morrisville, only about 70 miles away, the rate for that age group was a whopping 63 percent.
Dr. Wennberg traced the mystery to five physicians in Morrisville who had been operating in a medical time warp. These physicians still believed that tonsillectomies were necessary to prevent upper-respiratory infections in children. But most doctors throughout the country had found that antibiotics could cure the majority of these infections, and they would remove a child's tonsils only if drugs didn't work. When told why most other physicians performed comparatively few tonsillectomies, the Morrisville doctors agreed to change their practice.
In another study, Dr. Wennberg found that the prostatectomy rate at one Maine hospital was four times higher than the rate at a hospital just a few miles away. Such variations can be driven by economic forces: residents of wealthy communities are more likely to have certain kinds of elective surgery, such as back and neck operations, than residents of poor areas, who may lack insurance or disposable income. But in this case, the two hospitals were in demographically similar places, and Dr. Wennberg surmised that the variations were the result of doctors' vastly differing beliefs about how to treat an ailment. Their beliefs, he reasoned, had been shaped by the schools and teaching hospitals where they had trained. Different schools subscribe to different medical theories, some lacking a strong scientific base.
In 1983, Dr. Wennberg and his colleagues undertook a landmark outcomes study of patients with benignly enlarged prostates. Many doctors believed that surgery could forestall potentially fatal complications like kidney and urinary tract disease. Other doctors thought surgery would provide only symptomatic relief and counseled patients to avoid the operation for as long as possible because of its unpleasant side effects.
After studying the Medicare and insurance records of several hundred prostate patients, the researchers reported in 1988 that men who underwent prostate surgery had a slightly decreased life expectancy. The study also found that some men were far more willing than others to tolerate the ailment's troubling symptoms, such as difficulty urinating. Some men with severe symptoms were less inclined to have surgery than patients whose condition was milder. The research indicated that one reason for avoiding the operation was that it can diminish sexual enjoyment -- an attitude that might surprise doctors who assume that elderly men are not interested in sex.
British researchers soon raised yet another question about the value of prostatectomies. While they eliminated symptoms in 80 percent of those treated, the symptoms subsided in 20 percent of the patients without any medical intervention.
In the late 1980's, the Rand Corporation, a research group in Santa Monica, Calif., assembled a team of physicians to review patients' hospital records to determine whether various procedures had been used appropriately. Among their findings: only 56 percent of coronary bypass operations appeared justified. Rand raised similar doubts about several other expensive procedures, including coronary angiography, an X-ray technique for diagnosing heart disease.
The dozens of Government-funded outcomes studies under way aim to identify other medical practices of questionable value. One study is looking at the diagnosis and treatment of lower-back pain, one of the leading causes of absenteeism in the United States. "This project is a monumental task because physicians are dealing with a wealth of uncertainties in treating back problems," says Dr. Richard A. Deyo, associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine and director of the five-year effort, which involves 22 specialists and tens of thousands of patients.
The researchers will assess the appropriateness of diagnostic techniques such as computerized tomography, which costs about $400, and magnetic resonance imaging, which can run as high as $1,000. They will also look at the effectiveness of different kinds of surgery intended to strengthen the spine and prevent future back problems.
Dr. Deyo says his group has already found enough data to question whether spinal fusion, an operation to stabilize the vertebrae, prevents further back trouble. "Those patients who had fusions were just as likely to require added hospitalization as patients who didn't undergo the operation," he says.
Though it will be years before doctors and policy makers have enough outcomes data to change the way medicine is practiced, there is considerable debate over how influential the information can -- and should -- be. The American Medical Association supports the concept of Government guidelines based on outcomes studies, but argues that they should be used only to educate doctors, not to determine reimbursement for health care. "We think that every case should be reviewed to determine what is most appropriate for the individual patient," says Dr. John T. Kelly, director of the association's office of quality assurance.
Insurers are eager to use outcomes studies to shape their coverage. "Depending on the quality of the data," says Dr. Howard Bailit of Aetna, "these studies could have a profound impact on how both public and private groups pay for services." But even outcomes pioneers such as Dr. Wennberg question whether the research will save cost-conscious insurers any money. For one thing, it is possible that some rarely used but extremely expensive procedures will prove most effective. And, unless researchers can work quickly enough to keep pace with medical advances, their work could soon become outdated.
Until more of the studies are completed, health care experts can only speculate on whether they will meet the lofty expectations that many people have for them. In the meantime, one thing is clear, says Dr. Wennberg: "There is going to be constant warfare over how to use this research."

HEADLINE: When the Market Sags Under a Big Developer

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
TO all of the ex's in Jerome Kretchmer's busy life -- ex-assemblyman, ex-city commissioner, ex-political hot-shot -- he can now add one more: ex-developer, at least for the time being.
After building more than 1,400 apartments in New York City and Westchester County, Mr. Kretchmer has hit the same housing slump that has stymied a lot of other builders and made them contemplate the meaning of life with no new projects to pursue. 
 The end came for Mr. Ketchmer when the last of the 59 condos in his artfully designed project on West 90th Street, Columbus Commons, was recently sold at a loss. Most of the others had been auctioned for far less than the three and four hundred thousand dollar prices so hopefully expressed in the offering plan. He lost a lot of money, he said, and so did his lenders, but he has retained his cheer.
"It's over, it's built, it's good for the community, a lot of good people are living there, it's behind us," he said. "I got everything I wanted except money."
Mr. Kretchmer grew up in New York, graduated from New York University's former Bronx campus and took a law degree from Columbia. He and his wife, Dorothy, reared two daughters and a son who went through the city public school system. For a while Mrs. Kretchmer operated her own string of women's apparel stores, The Holding Company, while Mr. Kretchmer climbed the political ladder.
He served as a Democratic state assemblyman from the old Chelsea/Hell's Kitchen Third District from 1963 to 1970, as Mayor John V.Lindsay's head of the Environmental Protection Administration from 1970 to 1973, and as minority counsel to the State Senate from 1975 to 1977. In between he ran local campaigns for John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Mayor Lindsay, and worked to protect Democratic interests in the 1980 reapportionment.
But after that, he moved into his long stretch as a housing developer.
"In my opinion, politics is something you either have to be all the way in or out," he said.
Mr. Kretchmer still has his two successful restaurants, the Gotham Bar and Grill on 12th Street west of Fifth Avenue, and the Mesa Grill on Fifth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets. He has occasionally taken a consulting job with other developers and with lenders, principally to help work out problems arising from the soft residential market. He recently addressed a group of savings bank executives to argue the wisdom of staying with the developers of troubled projects, rather than assuming that taking a project back and assigning it to someone else will necessarily produce a better result.
And he still has his years of thoughtful concern about the city to keep him busy.
Mr. Kretchmer said he got his first troubling whiff of a slump in the city's economy two years ago, when he won a franchise to build a restaurant in the restored Bryant Park, but could not find any backers. A key component of any recovery in housing development, he believes, is a renewal of the expired 421 and J-51 tax breaks for new and rehabilitated housing projects.
"What I really want to do again is build housing for the same people who come to my restaurants, people who want to live in New York and raise their children in New York and who earn what is by New York standards a reasonable living," he said. "That is what has become so hard to do."

 BODY:

Interest on Advance Rent
 
Question: After taking early retirement I sold a home and moved to Manhattan. I rented an apartment in a co-op building before I had a new job. Because I was not employed when I signed the lease, the only way I could get the apartment was to pay the entire year's rent of $21,000, in advance. Does the management owe me interest earned on the lump-sum payment? . . . Shirley Granahan, Manhattan
 
Answer: Yes. Theodore L. Marks, a lawyer specializing in real estate, said Sec. 7103 of the New York State General Obligations law requires that money given as security or advance rent, if it is in excess of one month, be kept for the benefit of the tenant. It also requires that in rental properties of six or more units, security or advance rent must be put in interest-bearing accounts. The tenant has the right to the interest, less 1 percent for administrative costs.
 
Replacing Appliances
 
Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in a building converted to a co-op. I had an old, leaking refrigerator, an oven with a split door and an unrepairable dishwasher. The landlord was indifferent to my requests for replacement. I arranged with the superintendent to install replacements at my expense. Do I have a right to recover my expenses in exchange for a rental increase? . . .Patricia Goodman, Manhatttan
 
Answer: No. Your landlord is under no obligation to reimburse you. The laws that cover rent-regulated tenants give them the right to working kitchen appliances. But landlords can repair appliances or replace them with used ones. If landlords supply new appliances, however, they may add 1/40th of the cost to the rent and the rent increase becomes permanent.
The leverage that tenants have when faced with owners who will not replace broken appliances is to file complaints with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which can order rent reductions in cases where owners do not provide full services.
You may be able to get your landlord to pay for the appliances if you can show that raising your rent would give him a financial advantage. The division's rent administration office is at Gertz Plaza, 93-31 Union Hall St., Jamaica, N.Y. 11433
 
Liability for Lease
 
Question: Four years ago my husband put his mother into a studio apartment closer to us. She was able to live alone and pay all her own expenses, but the owner would not rent to her because of her age, 84 years. My husband signed the lease. Recently she became ill and had to be moved to a nursing home. She will not return to the apartment. We feel his mother may have been the victim of age discrimination in not being able to sign the lease herself. Will my husband be responsible for the lease? . . Judith Lavanga, Randolph, N.J.
 
Answer As a general rule of law, the person who signs a lease is legally bound by its terms. But according to Richard Kahn, a Hackensack, N.J., lawyer specializing in real estate, under New Jersey law, if rent is not paid the landlord has the duty to mitigate damages by making a good-faith attempt to find a new tenant who would pay comparable rent. If a new tenant's rent is lower than what the current lease calls for, or if it takes several months to find a new tenant, the owner may make a claim for the losses.
Mr. Kahn said the age-discrimination claim would be problematic. New Jersey statutes do not specifically address age discrimination with regard to public accommodations or real property.
"While clearly the mother-in-law is a member of a protected class," Mr. Kahn said, "it would be very difficult for her to prove that she was denied the privilege or benefit since she was, in fact, not refused the opportunity to reside in the apartment."
Other factors may have included her financial circumstances at the time. Moreover, because she lived in the apartment for four years, a claim would be too late. The New Jersey Division of Civil Rights requires that discrimination claims be brought within 300 days of a claimant's notice of a discriminatory act.

HEADLINE: New Lines and New Life For Furniture Maker

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
ETHAN ALLEN Inc. -- the 60-year-old Connecticut company that is one of the nation's best-known furniture producers -- is being propelled into new product diversity and marketing clout by an unusual chief executive who arrived in the United States in 1965 as a political refugee. The executive, Farooq Kathwari, a native of Kashmir, is showing American business leaders how to take a tired company and give it a completely new spin.
In 1989 Mr. Kathwari, now 46 years old, led a group of company managers, dealers and other investors in a $385 million leveraged buyout of Ethan Allen from Interco Inc., a St. Louis conglomerate. Since then, by applying new disciplines, motivating efforts and marketing skills, he has imbued the company, based in Danbury, with new life. 
 "Sixty percent of our individual items were created in the last two years," said the soft-spoken executive with evident pride. "We started that process six years ago, when our research showed us that consumers no longer were buying early-American furniture as their predominant style. Our sales were not growing, and we decided to diversify into other furniture styles and accessory products."
 
Attention to Quality
 In addition to its traditional line, the company's diversified offerings now include modern American and country French furniture and a new kitchen collection. The effort to expand the Ethan Allen line required massive internal changes and new attitudes among dealers.
Two plants were closed, and others were retooled for the new styles. Factories were added to produce bedspreads, pillows, mirrors and clocks. Quality control, which Mr. Kathwari said was long a "culture" at Ethan Allen, was further improved, he said, and the old 300-truck delivery fleet was replaced by larger more fuel-efficient vehicles. Company executives who believed that big changes were vital stayed, including Clint Walker, the former president, who has remained as the head of quality control for wood furniture.
The biggest transformation was among the several hundred Ethan Allen dealers, who had been prone to add products not made by the company. Mr. Kathwari put his foot down on that practice, and while there was "some noise" from the dealers, he said, none left the fold.
The company also set up a school at its headquarters for all the sales personnel, who are now called designers, in the 300-some dealerships. As many as 1,000 troop in annually for four and a half days of seminars and briefings at Ethan Allen College. They also compete for trophies in a design and sales contest.
"In this way, the people closer to the consumer are motivated by what we are doing and can go back and further motivate the consumer," Mr. Kathwari said. The groups gather in the Danbury headquarters and in the adjacent flagship store and stay at the nearby Ethan Allen Inn, which is also owned by the company.
Although Ethan Allen's chief may have rattled his dealers with his all-or-nothing dictum, he nevertheless endeared himself to them by removing their need to stock backup inventory and to deliver goods to their customers. Ethan Allen sells only through its dealers, who need only have samples on the floor. The company takes the furniture directly to the customers, delivering wood furniture in 3 weeks and upholstered goods in 8 to 10 weeks.
 
Running for His Life
 Mr. Kathwari's connection to Ethan Allen began in 1973, when he and Nathan Ancell, then the company's chairman, agreed to start a joint venture, KEA International, to develop non-furniture products, like floor coverings, lighting and decorative accessories.
But only eight years earlier Mr. Kathwari was running for his life. As a 20-year-old political science graduate of Kashmir University, he was arrested when his political activities offended the Kashmiri Government. He escaped from his captors, finding his way to the United States. He lived in Brooklyn, N.Y., and one of his first jobs was with a printing company.
"I printed envelopes," he recalled. "Six months later I was running the place."
Soon after, Mr. Kathwari was surprised, when his grandfather in Kashmir sent him a collection of candlesticks and other household accessories worth $15,000. Scrambling for space to put the items, Mr. Kathwari offered them to any dealers on consignment. He had to do his own auditing of inventory, he recalled, because not all dealers liked to tell him what was sold.
By that time, he had a job at Bear Stearns, the stock brokerage, and he was working toward a master's degree in business at New York University as well as starting his own upholstery fabric importing company. In 1968 he moved to New Court Securities Corporation, now known as Rothschild Incorporated, where he became a vice president involved in administration and in the company's bond portfolio.
When he left New Court in 1973, Mr. Kathwari made his deal with Mr. Ancell, a founder of Ethan Allen. Their venture, KEA International, was merged into Ethan Allen in 1980, and Mr. Kathwari moved up in quick steps: vice president that year, senior vice president in 1981, executive vice president in 1983, president in 1985 and chairman and chief executive in 1988.
Mr. Kathwari's rapid advancement was "probably due to my national background," he said. "In Kashmir there's a saying that nature is your teacher. With only a four million population, rugged natural environment and political turmoil, there is a tight family structure in the country, and you have to be responsible for your family. I think that upbringing has given me my motivation and my endurance."
And Ethan Allen will probably never be the same again. Sales are expected to reach about $650 million this year, Mr. Kathwari said, and profits are up, too, despite the recession.
An appropriate homily is posted prominently in Ethan Allen's headquarters. It reads, "What man altereth not for the better, time altereth for the worse."

HEADLINE: Barns, Symbols of the Past, Are Preserved for the Future

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT'S barns have been put on the endangered-species list. As fewer people in the state operate farms, the barns that have long dotted the landscape are being torn down. Some just fall down.
The barns are "symbols of what we used to be," said Mary Neustadter, director of real estate services for the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, which recently called the state's barns "threatened sites." 
 Some barns have been rescued for continued farm use or for new lives as homes, businesses or museums. The Connecticut Trust urges people to get involved in saving barns, and a preservationist in Bethel has suggested a zoning change to help preserve the structures.
 
Keeping Their Jobs and Looks
 Yesterday's barns were not built for today's farming equipment and methods, said John Bartok, a professor of natural resources at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. "Old barns don't fit in with new technology," he said.
But some old barns receive treatment that lets them hold onto their jobs -- and their looks.
David Rathbun keeps sheep, horses and hay in the barn that has stood on his family's farm in Stonington since before the Civil War. Recently Mr. Rathbun replaced the barn's wing that was lost in a 1938 hurricane and made numerous repairs, searching out old windows and timbers to maintain the period appearance.
"When you build a barn, you don't want to spend a tremendous amount," he said. "I like using second-hand."
David Stiles's barn in Southbury, built in 1672 by his ancestor Francis Stiles, still houses the family's farm tools and equipment. A few years ago Mr. Stiles hired Richard Babcock -- a craftsman known as "Mr. Barn" -- to replace the rotting timbers and weakened roof.
"He went out to our woodlot and hand hewed replacement timbers," said Mr. Stiles. Now, he said, "the barn looks exactly as it originally looked."
A national program to preserve historic farm buildings -- called Barn Again! -- encourages farming uses for old barns. The program, which provides advice and gives awards for successful projects, is run by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Successful Farming magazine.
For some people, home is where the barn is. The Norwich home of Anne and Richard Sharpe had features like cow stanchions and a manure shoot when the couple acquired it in 1956. Mr. Sharpe, who had then just begun his career as an architect, got practical experience as he turned the century-old barn into a contemporary house. "It was his first hands-on project," recalled Mrs. Sharpe.
Mr. Babcock, who heads Babcock Barns in Williamstown, Mass., and Edward Cady, who operates East Coast Barns in Roxbury, have turned many barns into homes. They frequently dismantle a barn, board by board, and re-erect it as a house in another spot. They aim to keep the barn's appearance and respect its past, they said.
"I try to not just move a barn but to preserve its history and send that along with it," said Mr. Babcock, who researches and records the history of each barn he works with.
Some preservationists object to putting old barns or materials from them into new uses and locations, saying that such practices destroy or distort the past. Others favor what they call a more realistic approach.
"Would people rather see the barns bulldozed?" Mr. Cady asked. "I save them and put them back up."
Professor Bartok noted that some unwanted barns have usable timbers of chestnut, now rare. "You're not going to preserve or rebuild all barns," he said. "You're better off using the lumber. It's recycling."
 
A Community's Symbol
 Mr. Babcock said that he began working with barns because, "I saw something that was dying that was really important." He said he understood that some people wanted barns to stay barns and stay put. But, he said, "with that thinking, nothing would get done, and nothing would get saved."
Southbury residents cheered the recent moving of a landmark barn once slated for demolition. "The barn was quite a figurehead, a symbol of the rural atmosphere here," said Richard Perry, president of the Southbury Historical Society.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints bought the land where the barn stood, planning to demolish it to build a chapel. Local residents were greatly distressed until the appearance of what Mr. Perry called "an imaginative solution." The church donated money for Robert Parker Jr. to move the barn, piece by piece, to nearby land owned by Carol and Edward Winship. Mr. Parker had planned to build his new woodworking shop on the Winships' land. Instead he will work in the rebuilt barn.
"The barn will still be highly visible and close by," said Mr. Perry.
A plan to allow more uses of barns -- and thus improve the economics of preservation -- comes from Timothy Beeble, president of the Bethel Historical Society. He observed that Bethel and other communities have old barns in residential areas, where zoning regulations let people run a business in their houses, but only "allow you to keep your car and lawn mower in the barn," he said.
Mr. Beeble has proposed to the Bethel Planning and Zoning Commission that any use allowed in a house also be allowed in its barn, after a public hearing. "All we're asking is, Let us do it in the barn," said Mr. Beeble.
Sometimes effort and money can turn old barns into museums. But a circa-1880 barn in Fairfield, recently spared from razing, will not be housing exhibits on onion farming (once a big local business) "until the financial situation improves," said Chris Nevins, curator for the Fairfield Historical Society.
 
New Museum in Old Structure
 Roxbury is moving a 200-year-old barn about 100 feet to a new foundation on town property, where it will become the Roxbury Historical Society's museum. Having raised $20,000 for the foundation, the society now seeks $80,000 for repairs and exhibits. "It's quite an undertaking," said Robert Hodges, president of the society.
Some barns simply succumb. "Most of them deteriorate," said Professor Bartok. "I drive by them every time I go down the road."
In Monroe a town-owned, early 20th-century barn was recently demolished for parking space. The town offered the barn to anyone who would take it away, but all who expressed interest -- even someone who flew in from Chicago -- eventually turned it down.
Ms. Neustadter of the Connecticut Trust said she hoped people could be educated to see barns as important, threatened resources. Concerned local groups can accomplish a lot, she said.
Mr. Babcock said more people are recognizing the need to save barns. "This is good," he said. "It's like waking up the giant."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Connecticut Taxes;
Has Some of the Allure Faded? The Jury Is Still Out

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
"CONNECTICUT is still appealing for New York companies because of its lack of a personal income tax. It's surprising how powerful that is."
That was the word in March 1990 from the Commissioner of Economic Development for the state of Connecticut, Stephen B. Heintz.
Today, Connecticut has an income tax. Mr. Heintz is gone. And, understandably, the state's economic development officials are stressing a different perspective. 
 "In over 20 years in economic development, I've never seen a company come to Connecticut or leave Connecticut because taxes were the No. 1 thing," said Ralph F. Hedenberg, senior development agent in the economic development agency. "Certainly, in the overall decision-making, that's a factor. But it's never been a deciding factor. There are such things as geographic location, livability, education facilities, labor force availability -- those are the factors that companies are looking for."
It is always tricky to sort out why a company chooses to move. But even if taxes are not high on the official corporate agenda, they are surely on the minds of executives.
"The income tax does bring Connecticut and New York closer than they've ever been," said Steven Vitoff, spokesman for the New York State Office of Economic Development, "and to some extent, it levels the playing field. But tax considerations are not by any means the single deteminant in keeping companies within the state."
"People who were middle management moved to Connecticut because there was no income tax," said Richard Gretsch Jr., senior vice president of the Albert B. Ashforth commercial brokerage in Stamford. "Eventually, they became the decision makers. And when they had the chance to move the company, they moved it near their homes."
The absence of a tax "used to be touted as one of the big reasons why corporations moved their headquarters here," said Michael H. Siegel, executive managing director of the northeast region for the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage. "The leaders of those companies said, 'What I can keep in my pocket is a big number.' Today, that number has shrunk considerably."
"Anytime we impact one of our states," he said, "whether by raising tolls or doing something like an income tax, the perception is: 'Oh, no. Another additional tax we didn't have before. Why are we in this region?' We really do affect this decision to relocate out of New York not to a surrounding municipality, but taking a leap like W. R. Grace took -- after looking very hard at Connecticut -- and winding up in Boca Raton."
Many eyes are on the Morgan Stanley financial services concern, which may remain in mid-Manhattan or move to Stamford, where it has an option on an 11-acre site.
In February, the director of asset management for the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, Geoffrey Donoghue, said: "We see Stamford as an economic advantage for the firm and for its employees in real estate and personal income taxes."
And what does Morgan Stanley think now that Connecticut has a personal income tax?
Several telephone messages were left for Mr. Donoghue in the last two weeks that he never returned. Finally, on Monday, a spokeswoman for the firm said "there is a problem with him talking" to a reporter.
Of course, Morgan Stanley is not alone among New York companies that are thinking seriously about relocating to Connecticut.
"We're not hearing -- from companies or brokers or developers -- of any huge backlash or reaction to the income tax," said Joseph M. Ercolano, vice president for economic development at the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association, based in Stamford. "The number of calls we have received from companies interested in coming to Connecticut has not slacked off. It's increased in the past two months."
AS an example, he cited a holding company with about 50 employees that is now in mid-Manhattan and is weighing a move to Stamford next year. Because the company has yet to sign a lease, Mr. Ercolano said, he does not want to identify it further.
During a recent presentation to company representatives who were visiting Stamford, he said, the subject of the new income tax came up, but did not seem to excite concern.
"There were a couple of technical questions about the tax," Mr. Ercolano said, "but there wasn't a lot of complaining and wringing of hands. There was no indication from the higher echelon of the company that they would not move out here because of the tax."
Even with the new income tax, Mr. Gretsch said, Connecticut "still has a slight edge" regionally. He pointed to a study by the KPMG Peat Marwick accountancy, which compared the tax bills for a married couple with two dependents filing joint returns.
Take a couple with $85,000 in income -- $75,000 from wages, $5,000 from dividends or interest, $5,000 from capital gains.
If they lived and worked in Connecticut, their total tax bill would be $12,400 -- with the Federal Government taking $9,000 and the state taking $3,400. That is slightly higher than New Jersey, where the taxes would come to $11,700 and slightly lower than Westchester County, where they would have to pay $12,700. It is considerably lower than New York City, where the same incomes would be liable to a $14,100 tax bite.
"Connecticut and Westchester and Jersey are looking very similar tax-wise," Mr. Ercolano said. "Between Connecticut and New York City, there is still a large difference."
AMONG the changes that may be welcomed by executives is the reduction in the rate at which capital gains, interest and dividends are taxed. "To the extent that we're attracting companies that have a lot of individuals with income from those sources," Mr. Ercolano said, "there's no question that the tax change is a plus.'
There is also a rollback of the surcharge on the corporate tax, which will effectively reduce the rate from 13.8 to 11.5 percent.
"I liked two things in the package," said Alain Lebleu, president of Auguste-Thouard U.S.A., an affiliate based in Greenwich of the giant French real-estate concern. "No. 1 was reducing the sales tax, which was ridiculous at 8 percent. And secondly, having to pay the highest state corporate tax in the United States was another way to discourage people from doing business in Connecticut. Reducing the corporate tax was a must."
There is a hitch to the sales-tax reduction. Although it is coming down to 6 percent, it is being spread to cover more goods and services. "When we go out and hire a vendor to perform a service through us, that would be taxed," said Mr. Siegel of Cushman & Wakefield, which manages about 35 propeties in Connecticut. Subject to the tax, he said, were cleaning, maintenance, elevator repair, window washing and security services.
On the other hand, said Mr. Ercolano: "There will be a pass-through to users, but right now, operating costs are 30 to 50 percent less than New York City. If you add another 6 percent, they're still going to be far below the rates charged in New York."
One major corporate relocation has already been announced: the Richardson-Vicks health care and cosmetics concern is to move its offices out of Shelton by the end of 1992, joining its parent, the Procter & Gamble Company, in Cincinnati.
But taxes bear no blame, the company insisted. "The decision to move is strictly a business decision," said a spokesman, Mike Riess. "We've been in Connecticut since 1974 and in this facility since 1982. There is no dissatisfaction with the state or the community. The whole need is to bring our people together in one facility."

HEADLINE: Service Charges By Banks Scrutinized

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AMID growing concern that the state's banks need to be more responsive to consumers' needs, state legislators are considering several proposals that would make banking services more straightforward and accessible to a wider range of residents.
After recently enacting legislation that requires banks to offer low-cost "no frills" checking accounts to customers, lawmakers are now examining measures that would require banks to disclose all fees and account requirements in writing, provide free cashing of government checks and create basic savings accounts carrying minimal fees and opening deposit requirements. 
 The intensified interest in banking practices is underscored by a recent survey showing that consumers are paying significantly more in bank service charges despite the deregulation of the banking industry in the last decade. Consumer advocates said the deregulation had held out the promise of better services at lower costs. The report shows that over the last five years many banks have raised rates for regular monthly fees, increased service charges for bounced checks and returned deposits, set higher minimum balances to earn interest on checking account deposits and more than doubled fees for automated teller machine withdrawals -- despite the fact that the machines cost banks less for each transaction than a teller does.
The survey also concludes that only a small percentage of banks offer government-check cashing for non-account holders and that fewer than half of the banks surveyed provide complete listings of fees and account requirements in writing.
Though the actual dollar amounts involved are relatively small, consumer advocates say the survey illustrates the reality that some banks are making up for losses on bad loans and real-estate investments by increasing charges to banking consumers.
 
'A Necessity in Our Society'
 "A checking account has become a necessity in our society," said Jennifer Kohn, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, the New Brunswick-based advocacy organization that conducted the study. "People are paying a lot for these accounts, and they deserve better services."
The survey, which was based on a sampling of 76 banks throughout the state, indicated sharp percentage increases in the monthly fees charged for regular checking accounts that fall below set minimum balances. Since 1986, Ms. Kohn said, such fees have risen by about 50 percent -- to an average of $5.84 a month from $3.96. While some banks provide such accounts free to customers, others charge as much as $8 a month.
Charges for bounced checks and returned deposits also rose sharply. The average charge to a customer for bouncing a check in 1986 was $16.37. The current average charge is $20.51, with some banks charging as much as $30. And charges for deposits of checks that subsequently bounce have risen by about 90 percent, to an average of $6.93 from $3.64 in 1986.
 
Not Even the 'Consumer's Fault'
 "That's ridiculous," Ms. Kohn said. "A bounced deposit check isn't even the consumer's fault."
The highest percentage increase in fees was for transactions at automated teller machines, Ms. Kohn said. In a 1989 survey conducted by the advocacy organization, the average fee for a withdrawal at a cash machine, including free withdrawals at machines at one's "home" bank branch, was 43 cents. In 1991, the average fee had risen 102 percent, to 87 cents.
"It actually costs a bank less when a customer uses an ATM," Ms. Kohn said, referring to a report prepared by the Trans Data Corporation, a company based in Salisbury, Md., that provides economic analyses for the banking industry. That report, Ms. Kohn said, indicates that it costs an average of $1.05 for a teller-assisted transaction as opposed to 56 cents for a withdrawal at a machine.
"You would think that the customer would get the benefit of this advanced technology," Ms. Kohn said.
She added that while only three banks in the survey charged customers for using their home branch machines, nearly all banks charged for use of machines at different banks or branches.
"Banking has become big business," Ms. Kohn said. "Even local banks have been more interested in investing across the country than in investing across the street. Now the banks are in a mess, and they've been making up for their losses on the backs of consumers."
Some experts agree that consumers may now be underwriting some of the excesses of the 1980's.
"During the expansion years, a lot of sloppy habits emerged," said James W. Hughes, professor of urban planning and policy development at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.
But now, he said, increased competition, bad loans and expensive overstaffing have all contributed to making banks more concerned with trimming costs, cutting losses and beefing up the bottom line.
 
'A Substantial Retreat'
 "The banking industry is in a substantial retreat," Mr. Hughes said. "Foreclosures have virtually doubled in the past year. And consumers are paying a part of the price."
Bank officers, however, say the increase in fees accurately reflects increased expenses.
"Expenses go up, and those expenses include things that are beyond the control of the individual banks themselves," said Ben Schaffer, vice president of the Covenant Bank in Haddonfield.
In the 1970's, Mr. Schaffer said, banks were extremely competitive and offered free checking just to attract customers. "All businesses have 'loss leaders,' " he said, referring to the retailing practice of offering certain products below cost to bolster business on more profitable items.
But with checking accounts' having become nearly a necessity, Mr. Schaffer said, check processing has become increasingly more time-consuming, complicated and expensive.
"Everything costs more these days," he said. "And with costs climbing, convenience costs money."
 
Charge of $30 a Month
 The Covenant Bank is listed in the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group study as charging the highest fee -- $30 a month -- when an interest-bearing checking account dips below the bank's required minimum balance of $1,000.
"Everybody's pricing schedule is somewhat different," Mr. Schaffer said. "We had to set a fee, so we estimated what we thought would be our cost to handle the account. It was felt to be the fairest way to do it."
About six months ago, Mr. Schaffer said, in anticipation of recently adopted legislation requiring "no frills" checking accounts, the Covenant Bank established a basic checking account that requires no minimum balance and costs $2.50 a month and 25 cents a check. "That cost is not much more than it was in the 60's," Mr. Schaffer said.
Nearly all the banks surveyed have service charges on interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing accounts that fall below set minimum balances. Some banks, however, are able to provide virtually free checking regardless of the account balance and despite increasing costs and an ailing economy.
 
'Totally Free Checking Account'
 "If you walk in our bank and open an account and keep a positive balance, you will have a totally free checking account," said Marc Reitzes, president of the Equity National Bank in Waterford Township, in Camden County. "We feel that if we can keep our advertising budget trimmed and lend out the money that other banks spend on advertising, we can afford to offer free checking."
But the Equity National Bank imposes one of the highest charges for a bounced check. "We charge $30 on an overdrawn check," Mr. Reitzes said. "But we're not inhumane about it. A customer gets the first overdrawn check free. We give them a warning."
That, however, underscores another point made in the advocacy group's survey. Fewer than 40 percent of the banks surveyed provided complete listings of fees and account requirements in writing upon request. According to the survey, the Equity National Bank did not provide a written explanation of its bounced-check policy.
"We'd like to see a fees disclosure law that requires all banks to put their fees and balance requirements in writing," Ms. Kohn said. She added that 30 percent of the banks that eventually sent complete information did so only after a second request. "That's a pretty inexcusable way to conduct business," she said.
 
Bill Would Require Disclosure
 State Assemblyman John J. Roberts Jr., Democrat of Camden, agreed that banks should provide fees and account requirements to customers in writing and has sponsored legislation, now in committee, that would require such disclosure.
"We've found that many banks offer basic no-frills checking accounts," said Mr. Roberts, who is chairman of the Assembly's Financial Institutions Committee. He added, however, that such accounts "aren't an item that they are terribly interested in selling to their customers, so they don't provide information about it."
Mr. Roberts also sponsored legislation, recently signed into law by Gov. Jim Florio, requiring all banks that offer checking services to provide low-cost "consumer checking accounts," or "no frills" accounts.
 
'A Lot of Strings Attached'
 "In essence, 'free checking' is not free at all," Mr. Roberts said. "There are usually a lot of strings attached, like significant dollars on deposit or a lot of money needed to open an account."
The State Banking Commissioner, Geoffrey M. Connor, whose office is developing regulations for the consumer checking accounts, agreed that banks should be required to disclose account information but emphasized that the state should not be in the business of setting fees.
"Banks are for-profit businesses; they're not utilities," he said. "Their fees are not regulated and shouldn't be regulated. The answer really is disclosure, so customers can compare one institution with another and choose the institution they want to go to."
The Commissioner said the regulations for the consumer checking account would set the amount of the deposit required to open the account, the minimum balance below which a bank could charge a fee and a minimum number of free checks per month. He said that under the "best- case scenario," banks would be required to provide such accounts by by next April.
 
Low-Cost Savings Accounts
 Another banking bill now before the Legislature would require banks to establish low-cost savings accounts. Such accounts would provide for low initial deposits and low or no minimum balance requirements or monthly fees.
Yet another bill would require all banks doing business in the state to offer free cashing of government checks regardless of whether a person has an account in the bank. Residents without bank accounts, consumer advocates say, typically have to pay commercial check-cashing establishments to cash government checks.
Only four banks out of the 76 surveyed, the advocacy group study said, offer government check cashing for non-account holders.
Neal Fogarty, president of the Consumers League of New Jersey in Montclair, a consumer group that supports efforts to lower bank fees, set disclosure requirements and provide free government check cashing, said that the banking system was essentially a government-insured industry and should be more responsive to consumers' needs.
"We're simply asking for the old-time good-neighbor bank practices that were nearly universal before 1980," Mr. Fogarty said. "But there's been a sea change in the way some banks view their customers. Before 1980, customers were viewed as friends. Now they're viewed as profit centers."

FANTASY IN CROTON FALLS
"Prelude to a Kiss," Craig Lucas's fantasy about love transcending gender, will open the season at the Schoolhouse in Croton Falls with nine performances beginning Friday and ending Oct. 27. 
 The play opened at the Circle Repertory in Manhattan in March last year and moved to Broadway shortly afterward, where it played for more than a year, closing last May. It won an Obie and an Outer Critics Circle Award as best play and received several Tony and Drama Desk nominations.
The kiss in the title is given by a mysterious old man to a young bride just before her wedding, and the two exchange souls -- to the confusion of the husband.
The Schoolhouse production was staged by an Ossining company called Logodaedaly, which means playing with words. Albi Gorn was the director and Robert Dean the designer. Performances are scheduled for Fridays and Saturdays at 8 P.M. and Sundays at 4 P.M. Tickets are $10, $12.50 and $15. The Schoolhouse is on Route 22N and Owens Road. Take Exit 8 west off Route 684 and bear right toward Croton Falls. Call 277-8477 for reservations.
 
ABSTRACT OILS
 Drawing on the theme of "Prelude to a Kiss" is a new exhibition at the Schoolhouse Galleries in Croton Falls, on view through Nov. 17. Susan Bush's abstract oils evoke relationships between people, both lasting and passing ones, and the interlocking elements of nature.
Leonid Hushvahtov, a newly arrived artist from Tadzhikistan in the Soviet Union, is showing a series of paintings of musicians and artists and their need to establish communication with others through their work.
The gallery, in the Schoolhouse, is open free of charge Thursdays and Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. and Fridays and Saturdays from 1 to 8 P.M.
 
PUPPET SHOW AT SUNY
 Dinosaurs are the stars of "The Mammoth Follies," an entertainment for children from 5 to 11 years old devised by the Hudson Vagabond Puppets in the Japanese Bunraku tradition. A performance is scheduled for today at 3 P.M. in the Performing Arts Center of the State University of New York at Purchase.
The puppeteers, dressed in black, are visible but unobtrusive behind the puppets, manipulating them across the stage. Managing a 12-foot-tall tyrannosaurus rex and a 22-foot-long brontosaurus is no mean feat. There are also baby trilobites, trees called vegettes and other singing and dancing creatures from prehistoric times.
Lois Bohovesky, founder and director of the company, is a former member of Henson Associates, for whom she built puppets for "Sesame Street" and other productions. Her puppets are on exhibition at the World Trade Center each year at Christmas time.
Tickets for today's show are $13. Call the box office at 251-6200.
 
A FERRARO VISIT
 Geraldine A. Ferraro, former Democratic candidate for Vice President, will be the keynote speaker at the College of New Rochelle during a Conference on Public Policy and Nursing. The event, scheduled on Wednesday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. and mainly of interest to health-care professionals, costs $65, including lunch.
Workshops throughout the day will focus on the need and the techniques for approaching legislators on issues relating to nurses and nursing care. Ms. Ferraro will discuss government policy and concerns of health care in the United States. Call 654-5436 to register or obtain more information.
 
HISPANIC WOMEN
 "Hispanic Women: 500 Years of Leadership and Dedication" is the theme of the Yonkers Library's Hispanic Heritage Month celebration Saturday from 2:30 to 4 P.M. in the Getty Square Branch at 7 Main Street. About 41,000 of the city's 188,000 residents are Hispanic.
Argentina Palacios will tell folk tales in Spanish and English, and 25 members of the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club of Manhattan will perform Hispanic songs and dances.
Among the women honored for their contributions to Hispanic culture and welfare since 1492 are Capiliana, a 16th-century Peruvian botanist; Victoria Magana de Fortin, founder of El Salvador's first vocational school, and Matilde Hidalgo Narro de Porcell, the first woman to receive a medical degree in Ecuador.
Sobeida Cruz, community relations manager for the New York Power Authority, and Edward E. Velez, a lawyer and administrator for the State Department of Economic Development Small Business Division, are co-chairmen of the event. Admission and refreshments are free.
 
AT HUDSON RIVER MUSEUM
 A quartet of new exhibitions is opening this weekend at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers. At the entrance to the Glenview Galleries a new permanent orientation exhibition sets the stage for anyone visiting the museum with a scale model of the 1877 mansion. Samples of the building's carvings, upholstery fabrics, dining utensils and Victorian book bindings may be handled, and recordings explain it all.
To place the building in context with its history, a 20-foot wall bears a time line of notable events that took place between 1865 and 1925 here and abroad.
A three-part children's exhibition in the Glenview Galleries addresses the role of children in Victorian times, when adults believed that they should be seen but not heard, through photographs and other ephemera. A second part consists of a re-created nursery with furniture, toys and clothing that increased in variety and quantity during the Industrial Revolution. The third section deals with the introduction of mandatory education in the state in 1874, through books, photographs and documents. In all, more than 100 objects are displayed.
"Experiencing Sculpture: The Figure in American Art, 1850-1990" traces changing styles and techniques with works by Robert Arneson, Louise Bourgeios, Nancy Graves, Red Grooms, Seymour Lipton, Elie Nadelman, George Segal, David Smith and others. It will remain on view through Jan. 19 in the main gallery.
Recent welded steel sculptures by Helene Brandt and a selection of her large charcoal drawings tracing the development of the sculpture can be seen in the Voter Gallery through Jan. 12.
The museum, at 511 Warburton Avenue, is open Wednesdays through Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Thursdays from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. Admission is $3, $1.50 for the elderly and children. Call 963-4550 for more information.
 
JOBS WORKSHOP
 Those in midlife, which can be any age over 50, who are looking for new or different jobs may want to check into an American Association of Retired Persons program at Mutual of New York in Purchase. A free information session will be held Tuesday from 10 A.M. to noon, for which reservations can be made by calling 381-2048.
Workshop sessions, which cost $35, will take place Oct. 14, 17, 21, 18 and 31 and Nov. 7 and 14 from 9 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. Each session is limited to 20 people. Topics include matching up jobs with individual needs and abilities; understanding employment planning, the changing business world and attitudes toward aging; defining skills, interests and work experience as flexibly as possible, and learning how to apply job search skills. MONY is at 4 Manhattanville Road.

A New Americas Stamp
This year's Americas issue from the United States Postal Service serves as a sharp reminder that, despite the hoopla building up over the 500th anniversary of the first voyage by Columbus to the Western Hemisphere, he did not "discover" America.
The stamp, a 50-cent commemorative airmail, is part of an annual joint issue by the 25 nations of the Postal Union of the Americas, Spain and Portugal. The stamp is to be released on Saturday in Anchorage. 
 The design shows an Asian scanning the horizon in a re-creation of the first passage across what was then a land bridge connecting what is now Siberia and Alaska, a migration that probably took place 15,000 to 30,000 years ago. The land bridge is now submerged under the Bering Strait.
The legend around the top and right of the stamp reads "The First Americans Crossed Over From Asia." Although this theory has been generally accepted by archeologists, it has been contested by others.
Collectors who want first-day cancellations should buy the new stamps when they become available throughout the United States on Oct. 15, place them on self-addressed envelopes and send them in a larger envelope to America Airmail Stamp, Postmaster, 344 West Third Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska 99510-9991. There is no charge; the deadline is Nov. 12.
 
Philatelic Literature
 In connection with the Columbus quincentenary next year, the Collectors Club and the Philatelic Foundation are sponsoring what they describe as the first international exhibition of philatelic literature in North America.
Prizes will be awarded for reference books and special studies, stamp and auction catalogues, periodicals, columns, and audio-visual and computer programs.
The entries will be on display Nov. 4-14, 1992, at the Collectors Club, 22 East 35th Street in Manhattan.
Applications for exhibits must be submitted by Jan. 31. They are available from Philitex 92, c/o Philatelic Foundation, 21 East 40th Street, New York, N.Y. 10016. Most of the exhibits themselves are due Aug. 14.
 
Just for Fun
 The marketers of stamps from smaller nations, some of which derive foreign exchange from the export of offbeat philatelic material, help to create some odd juxtapositions of national culture and stamp design.
To wit: The Caribbean island nation of St. Vincent has just issued two miniature sheets of nine stamps, each a different design.
One might expect tropical fauna or some such. But the first sheet honors John Lennon, the Beatle. The second features an American singer and actress by the name of Ciccone from Bay City, Mich.; on stage she uses only her first name, Madonna.
And the neighboring nation of Antigua and Barbuda, perhaps because of the initials A and B, has issued eight stamps and two souvenir sheets featuring Archie and Betty, and of course Veronica and Jughead and all the gang, for the 50th anniversary of Archie Comic Publications.
Archie is depicted in various sports situations, and there is a tiny logo at the bottom of each stamp with the Olympic rings and "Barcelona '92," which may or may not lure hobbyists interested in the Olympics.
It is easy to be snide about such stamps, but as a bit of sauce, and especially as a way to entice young collectors, they have their place.
The marketer for the stamps in the United States is the Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation, 460 West 34th Street, New York, N.Y. 10001.
 
Under New Management
 The management of Stamps for the Wounded, which distributes stamps to veteran's hospitals and convalescent centers, has been taken over by the Lions International Stamp Club.
Stamps for the Wounded had been run for nearly 50 years by Herman L. Neugass, who died in Washington on Aug. 31 at the age of 76. Mr. Neugass, who was an economic consultant to the District of Columbia, died of leukemia, his family said.
Collectors who wish to contribute stamps or philatelic material of any kind should first send a description of the material to Stamps for the Wounded, c/o Lions International Stamp Club, P.O. Box 1125, Falls Church, Va. 22041. Contributions are tax-deductible.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Starting to Count On Castro's Fall

BYLINE: By Alison Leigh Cowan

 BODY:
Talk about planning ahead. It seems that half the world -- certainly half of Southern Florida -- is frantically preparing for the day when Fidel Castro, one of the world's last military dictators, falls or otherwise surrenders power.
Some Cuban-Americans are reserving boats they can use to ship desperately needed supplies to Havana. Others are selling their homes to raise cash they can use to start businesses there, or are negotiating with American companies to sell their products in Cuba once the market opens up. 
 Wall Street is also joining in the odds-making. Just as there are traders willing to bet on the outcome of takeover contests and the recent Soviet coup, so there are people dreaming up various "Cuban plays."
"There's a lot of rumbling that makes this thing look imminent," said Richard Lehmann, editor of the Defaulted Bonds Newsletter in Miami Lakes, Fla., who has heard from lots of interested investors on the subject. "There's a lot of receptivity to the idea that Castro is going to go."
Much of the investor enthusiasm stems from the economic miracle in Mexico, which saw its busted Government bonds rise from 30 cents on the dollar to 57 cents once it agreed to swap its old securities for new ones. "It's kind of a showcase," said Arthur Byrnes, director of Deltec Panamerica, which invests in out-of-favor securities. "So everyone looks around and asks where's the next big play, and clearly it's Cuba. Everyone thinks it's just a matter of time before Cuba has a phenomenal resurgence."
President Castro's political undoing is far from certain. Nonetheless, recent events in Cuba seem to have emboldened the theory. Last month, the Soviet Government decided to withdraw its troops from Cuba and end longstanding economic subsidies. That remarkable piece of news was followed by reports that Spain may have offered the Cuban president asylum in the Spanish town where his ancestors once lived.
Now come the speculators, and their bets are taking several forms. Some are scooping up long-forgotten Cuban stocks and bonds that haven't paid interest or dividends in years, reasoning that any new Government would mop up old debts or return seized property to attract money from the West.
Others are looking at hotel and casino companies that might want to help awaken Cuba's tourism industry from a 31-year slumber. "I think it's farfetched, but it shows how people are thinking," said Mr. Byrnes.
The best "bargains" seem to be the loans that several commercial banks in Canada, Germany, Japan and Spain made to various Cuban Government entities after Castro's rise to power. That paper, which is in default, was selling at 5 cents on the dollar earlier this year in the secondary market. Speculators have since driven it closer to 10.
Should a new Government agree to swap those old loans for new ones in a deal modeled on Mexico, those claims could rise as much as five- or sixfold, according to traders who specialize in Latin American securities. But United States citizens are prohibited from buying that paper under laws aimed at strangling the Cuban regime. That means only nonresidents using offshore companies can take advantage of the potential spreads.
Americans have to stick to stocks or bonds that were issued by companies before the revolution or pre-existing Government debt that Castro repudiated once he came to power. The pre-1960 Government debt is one popular play, and there is even one 1937 Republic of Cuba bond issue that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Last year, 722 of the bonds -- nearly 2 percent of all those outstanding -- were traded. Another 1,068 bonds traded through September of this year alone. In yet another sign of investor confidence, prices have doubled from 20 cents on the dollar early this year to the high 40's.
One problem with that strategy is that pre-1960 Government merchandise may be getting pricey, according to Mr. Byrnes, whose firm has some pre-1960 Cuban paper in "the far reaches of the vault."
That is because the price of that debt is already trading close to what it might be if Cuba were restructured as successfully as Mexico. He argued that investors who are not in danger of breaking the law might be wiser to buy more recent securities, issued after Castro's rise.
"If you're only going to buy one, buy the cheap one," he said. "On the other hand, if you're an American, the only one you can buy is the dear one."
There are also a handful of pre-1960 corporate securities to choose from, mostly sugar companies and railroads that have long since ceased paying interest or dividends. Rarely traded, many of them have been stashed in attics or drawers more for their value as wall-hangings than for their financial worth.
Such strategies are not for the faint-hearted. Like that of any illiquid security, prices will fluctuate sharply, especially since there are so few comparable trades.
"The pricing is very much an art, not a science," said John E. Herzog, whose firm, Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc., makes markets in some Cuban securities. For instance, his firm is currently offering 5 cents to 8 cents on the dollar for any Cuba Railroad Company, 4 percent bonds due in 1977 "depending on how enthusiastic the trader is when he is making the bid," said Mr. Herzog. His firm will also pay 25 cents for any shares of Cuban Electric Company that someone wants to sell.
Nor are there any guarantees that Cuba will ever repay its old debts. Mexico took care of its old debts because it wanted to borrow even more money. British investors received roughly 10 cents to 20 cents on the dollar in 1987 for their pre-1917 Czarist bonds and for their pre-1949 Chinese claims. American investors are still holding the bag.
Likewise, some hapless investors have been waiting for more than 150 years for Missisippi to pay off fewer than $10 million in bonds it issued in the 1830's, mostly in Europe, and later repudiated -- twice.

HEADLINE: In Southern India, a Glimpse of Asia's High-Tech Future

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India

 BODY:
Most people here still travel by bicycle, bus, motor scooter or on foot, and power outages are frequent. But with a growth rate surpassing any other major Indian city, Bangalore has achieved a reputation as the Silicon Valley of India -- turning what was once a sleepy community into a bustling center of high-tech commerce, replete with traffic jams and honking Mercedes-Benz automobiles.
Several top American computer companies, including Hewlett-Packard, 3M, Texas Instruments and the Digital Equipment Corporation, have set up operations here, vying to supply hardware and software to a technology-hungry Asia. The companies hope to exploit vast markets in India, which has middle class estimated at more than 120 million people, and in other nations where affluence is growing. 
 Many have already entered smaller, more prosperous nations like Singapore, but are now setting more ambitious courses for the coming decades. "India is part of a strategic presence," said Bob Watson, the managing director of Texas Instruments in India. "In the long-term, we are interested in the larger markets of South and Southeast Asia as well as the Pacific."
That interest focuses especially on this pleasant city in southern India, whose temperate climate, outdoorsy style of life and leading scientific institutes make it India's answer to the San Francisco area. Tree-lined avenues, a golf course, health clubs, fine restaurants, pubs and hotels contribute to a cosmopolitan ambiance that helps draw many of India's best scientific minds.
Their talents and relatively low salaries are luring more and more Indian and multinational computer companies. "Bangalore is still a place where you can attract people to settle with their families, it's still a livable city," said Prakash Mutalik, general manager at Hewlett-Packard's software project here.
Senior Indian software and computer engineers, especially in the private sector, earn 10,000 to 15,000 rupees, about $400 to $600 a month -- less than the minimum wage in the United States. Senior academics earn about half as much.
And despite complaints about the painful plodding of a vast Government bureaucracy that demands innumerable forms filled out in duplicate and triplicate, executives are excited about their companies' progress.
"I think many corporations also understand that with a market of this size, it's better to establish a major presence early on in the game," said Shiv Nadar, the chairman of Hinditron Computers Ltd., the country's top domestic firm, which now has a joint venture with Hewlett-Packard.
This partnership, formed after Hewlett-Packard invested $23 million in H.C.L. stock, will make top-of-the-line computer work stations for Indian customers beginning this winter.
India has long been a difficult nation for Western companies to do business in. Wages are low, but so is productivity. It wants foreign investment and technology, but on its own terms.
In recent months, Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao has liberalized investment rules to give foreigners automatic approval for buying as much as 51 percent of a company, with an accelerated process for considering higher stakes.
The International Business Machines Corporation left the Indian market in 1977 after foreign ownership was limited to 40 percent. India's Commerce Minister announced in late September approval for I.B.M. to return in a joint venture with an Indian conglomerate, Tata Industries, to produce I.B.M.'s Personal System 2 computers and computer programs.
The influx of foreign and domestic computer companies has helped transform what was once a sleepy haven for pensioners into a traffic-clogged city of four million. Sleek Mercedes cars sweep past the swarms of bicyclists along streets full of potholes dug out by monsoons. Elegant, colonial-style bungalows are being demolished to make way for glittering new high-rise apartments and offices.
The gleaming white Digital building, with its broad satellite dish and a small, gentle Japanese garden in front (complete with a tiny wooden bridge and stream), exemplifies the city's abrupt modernization.
"When we came here a couple of years back, this place used to be partly a warehouse and partly a garbage dump and look at what we have now," said Mike Shah, chief operating officer of Digital Equipment (India) Ltd. Mr. Shah, a cheerful 46-year-old Indian, worked with Digital in the United States and elsewhere for 19 years before taking on the Indian project. His engineers and technicians assemble minicomputers and mainframes.
In Bombay and Bangalore, programmers aided by satellite communications write diagnostic software for the entire company. "The satellite link connects me instantly to 65 Digital subsidiaries across the world and the parent corporation," Mr. Shah said.
Business, although a fraction of Digital's output worldwide, is good. Sales rose to $350 million for the year ended March 1990 from $280 million for the year before.
The company payroll has grown to about 800 now from 335 in 1989, and Mr. Shah expects an additional 40 percent increase by next March. The Indian subsidiary began production after absorbing staff from H.C.L., which once represented Digital here.
Computer services are a key element of Digital's India operations. Besides handling customer requests and complaints, the company has set up five computer literacy centers in the country's five most populous cities: New Delhi, Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Bangalore. Some 40 full-time faculty members, all Digital India employees, offer instruction, and not just to the company's customers.
Digital India supplies hardware to some of India's major public and private organizations. Its software side put together a package that helped computerize and speed up reservations on the sprawling railroad network that carries about four million passengers every day.
The work at Texas Instruments India focuses on computer-aided-design programs that the company uses around the world to design semiconductors. Texas Instruments has been here since India began liberalizing its economy under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in the mid-1980's. The company, the first multinational to ask the Indian Government to arrange a dedicated satellite communications link, had 1990 revenues of about $2.4 million.
Not that the American companies and their Indian hosts are always in harmony. Mr. Watson, a native of Dallas, said easier regulations have not removed all frustrations for foreign companies.
Repairing a work-station circuit board outside the country was an ordeal. "It took seven months to get it out and bring it back because of customs rules," he remarked.
The Indians have some complaints about the Americans as well. The head of Bangalore's premier computer science center says that he is disappointed by the failure of these companies to invest in research and development at the the Indian institutions.
"There is nothing in terms of inter-action, we are basically providing them manpower," said N. Viswanadam, the chairman of the department of computer science and automation at the Indian Institute of Science. "In that way, the multinationals are not behaving differently from Indian companies."
Most of these companies still prefer to do their most sophisticated research back home. Professor Viswanadam had hoped they would provide scholarships or equip labs. "But their mandate is different," he said. "They seem to be here just to manufacture their product."

ECONOMY
 
The Family Leave Feud, Part 2 

No one can say President Bush shies away from a fight, especially if it looks as if he will win. So last week when the Senate passed its second parental leave bill Mr. Bush said he would veto it, just as he vetoed the first. The measure is opposed by conservatives and many small businesses. "It is portrayed as flexible. But 'flexible' and 'mandate' don't go hand in hand," said Tracy Wurzel of the National Federation of Independent Businesses in Washington. But many in the Senate say the United States is the only industrial country whose citizens can face dismissal for tending to ailing children. The measure would "insure that workers will not have to chose job over family in times of emergency," said Senator Wendell Ford, Democrat of Kentucky. The bill exempts the nation's highest-paid workers, as well as part-time employees. But it still covers about 46 million workers. That's too many, says Mr. Bush.
 
Cars Move Gently Out of Neutral
 
Finally, the consumer is putting a little gas in Detroit's tank. Sales of 1992 models and leftover 1991's (there are still a lot of those around) increased by 5.8 percent in late September compared with the same period last year. But these sales were not all high-test. Most of the increase came from a jump in fleet sales and from cash-back incentives. Both move metal off the lot, but return only slim profits to the auto makers. Still, an increase is an increase and suggests the car companies are starting to see some growth. September's showing is "consistent with the gradual recovery thesis," said Harvey Heinbach, an automobile analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company.
 
Can the Recovery Recover?
 
Rather than consulting the stars, the Commerce Department relies on its index of leading economic indicators to foretell the future. The Government must be scratching its head right now. According to the department, the index, which is supposed to show how the economy will do in the next six to nine months, had been showing steady increases over the last six months. But August showed no increase over July. That was perplexing. The index, which comprises 11 other indexes, saw only four of its key indicators rise. Taken together, the indicators say the recovery could use a little more adrenaline. "The economy seems to have lost some momentum over the summer," said Robert T. McGee, of the Tokai Bank Ltd., in New York.
 
Housing Does the Right Thing
 
At least the housing sector of the economy is beginning to behave. According to the Commerce Department, sales of new homes, which are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, jumped 6.7 percent in July.

Home Buyers in the Catbird Seat
 
Why are houses starting to sell? Economists say the market is beginning to work. But you don't need a Ph.D. to understand what that means. Loads of desperate sellers have dropped their asking prices. The result, according to the National Association of Realtors, is that housing is more affordable now than at any other time this year. The way they figure it, the average family, which earns about $36,533 a year, has about 112.5 percent of the income needed to qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the value of an average home. A year ago, the index was just 107.4. But the typical family in the Northeast had only 93.5 percent of the purchasing power needed to buy a median-priced home there. For the market to continue to work its magic, prices in the Northeast may have to fall even farther.
 
Grimmer News from Factories
 
The recovery may not have toppled over (yet), but it certainly has stubbed its toe. According to the Commerce Department, factory orders fell by 1.9 percent in July. That was not supposed to happen. Factory orders had been the economy's one engine of growth. The culprit in the latest report is orders for durable goods like refrigerators and washing machines. These big-ticket items fell by 3.9 percent in August. Since durables account for half of all factory orders, declines there signal trouble throughout the economy.

'Crummy' Employment Numbers
 
It's eerie. Unemployment fell by 0.1 percent in September, according to the Labor Depart ment, but the economists are not smiling. The reason they are so grim is that the unemployment numbers were uneven. "There was a drop in manufacturing employment and that's our strong suit," said Alan Sinai, of the Boston Company. "Let's just say it's a crummy recovery," he said.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Kerkorian Climbs Into Chrysler
 
Now that the Chrysler Corporation has slipped into the junk category (its bonds, that is, not its cars), the company must pay a premium to borrow. So it was no surprise last week when the company issued 35 million new shares of stock to raise money. Those shares were quickly gobbled up by optimistic investors eyeing Chrysler's new products and hungry for a bargain. The stock sold for $10.125 a share. The hungriest investor of all was Kirk Kerkorian. The reclusive financier bought $60.75 million worth of stock through his Tracinda Corporation, increasing his stake in the auto maker to 9.8 percent -- an eyelash under the 10 percent level where Chrysler's anti-takeover measures kick in.
 
Time's Wounds All Healed?
 
Time Warner Inc., one of the nation's biggest media companies, has been looking for a foreign suitor with deep pockets for almost a year to help cut its $8.5 billion in debt. Last week rumors were circulating that Japan's Toshiba Corporation and C. Itoh & Company would together invest as much as $1 billion in Time Warner. When those rumors hit the streets, Time Warner stock jumped $2.125. It finished the week at $83.875.
 
GTE Hangs Up on Sylvania
 
These days investors prefer big companies to be narrowly focused. The theory says narrower businesses are easier to manage (at least outside Japan). Following this notion, the GTE Corporation, which had $21.4 billion in sales last year, said it would shed itself of its $2.3 billion electrical products group. "When people invest in phone companies they want to invest in phone companies," said Jack B. Grubman, of Paine Webber.
 
Shoe Drops for I.B.M. and Apple
 
They have been letting tantalizing details escape for months. Even so, last week's announcement of a pact between Apple Computer and the International Business Machines Corporation still generated excitement. John Sculley, Apple's chairman and Jack D. Kuehler, I.B.M.'s president, said they will share chips, software and designs for a new generation of PC's and work stations. They also said they would set up two new companies. One -- Taligent -- will develop advanced operating systems using state-of-the-art object-oriented programming. The other -- Kaleida -- will develop hardware and software to put pictures, sound and video into PC's and work stations. But the companies' first products won't exactly be rushed into production. "It's pretty clear today that a lot of this stuff is years away," said Michele Preston, an analyst with Cowen & Company.
 
No Halcyon Days for Upjohn
 
It was a highly unusual move. Britain's slow-moving Ministry of Health, which usually follows its American counterparts on regulatory issues, took the lead last week and banned the sale of the prescription drug Halcion. The United States Food and Drug Administration, somewhat perplexed, said it has no plans to do the same. Halcion is made by the Upjohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich. According to British drug officials, new information suggests that Halcion can cause some terrible side effects, including loss of memory, depression and, most worrisome, episodes of violence. More than seven million Americans take Halcion, contributing to the drug's projected 1991 sales of $260 million.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Kaifu's October Surprise
 
The Japanese are quick to point out that the word "wa" means harmony. It is a concept, they say, that is supposed to permeate the society. Don't tell that to the politicians. Japan's lawmakers are a bareknuckled bunch. Though popular with the voters, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told his colleagues last week that he would not seek another two-year term when his expires later this month. That makes him the third Prime Minister in as many years. (The other two, Noburo Takeshita and Sosuke Uno, lost their jobs in scandals). Mr. Kaifu faced a scandal of his own in the financial markets. It was enough to cause his Finance Minister -- and rival -- Ryutaro Hashimoto also to announce his resignation last week. But Mr. Kaifu's problems went deeper. He went afoul of the leadership of the Liberal Democratic Party by threatening on his own to call an election. It will take some time before wa permeates the Parliament.

A Publisher's Soviet Coup
 
Moscow may not have come up with a way to create a market economy, but Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has found out how to make money in the West. Rather than talk about the failed coup for free (Barbara Walters beware) he sold his story to HarperCollins for about $500,000. The book will be rushed to stores by month's end. The only decision left is who gets the movie rights.
 
In the Soviet Union, the means of production may have fallen into disarray, but there was one thing outsiders were sure of: Moscow was swimming in gold. Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the author of Moscow's latest economic reform plan, sees it differently. He says Moscow only has $3 billion in gold, not the $15 billion previously estimated. Others in the Government have disputed that claim. If Mr. Yavlinksy is right, Moscow's credit-worthiness may fall still lower.

Mr. Guccione Cleans House at General Media

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
As recently as a year ago, Robert Guccione was on a growth binge. His closely held publishing company, General Media International, seemed to be branching out in all directions. Building on his flagship properties, Penthouse and Omni, Mr. Guccione launched Longevity, a health magazine, in 1988. Last year, General Media acquired Compute as well as three car magazines.
But late last month, the binge came to an end, at least for now, when General Media announced that 120 people companywide -- about 18 percent of the 650-member staff -- were being let go. The company also said that it was merging the staffs of Compute and Omni, a science magazine, by moving Omni's editorial operation from New York to Greensboro, N.C., where Compute is based. 
 General Media is just the latest in a long line of publishing companies to announce cutbacks as the recession lingers on. Time Inc., for instance, also announced layoffs last month.
"Like everyone else, we were overstaffed as a result of the bounteous 80's," Mr. Guccione said last week.
But unlike most in the business, the flashy Mr. Guccione seems resolutely upbeat. He insists that the layoffs at his company were ordered for reasons of prudence and not out of desperation. While Mr. Guccione declined to disclose sales and earnings figures, some industry numbers seem to bear him out: Penthouse was up 18 percent in ad pages through the first eight months of the year and Omni was up 12 percent, compared with an average magazine decline of 10 percent, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
Not all the numbers are positive, however. During the first half of the year, Penthouse circulation fell 10.3 percent, to 1.5 million, while Omni dropped 18.4 percent, to 755,000.
In any event, no one expects the 60-year-old Mr. Guccione to cut back any time soon on his opulent style of life. The townhouse he shares with his wife, Kathy Keeton, on Manhattan's East Side comes complete with a swimming pool and museum-class art collection. Ms. Keeton is vice chairman of General Media.
As for the future, Mr. Guccione sees new growth coming from the Soviet Union, of all places. In 1989, Omni became the first American magazine to be sold in the Soviet Union for rubles. As part of the deal, 20,000 copies of the official magazine of the Soviet Academy of Sciences are distributed to Omni readers here.
Mr. Guccione has been opening the door wider ever since. General Media now has 200 employees in the Soviet Union and is busy publishing a rash of Soviet scientific journals and technical papers, translating them into a variety of languages and selling them to scientific groups all over the world.
"There's enormous profit in publishing their scientific journals," said Mr. Guccione.
For their part, the Soviets apparently see no contradiction in a company that publishes both a sex magazine and serious scientific journals. Penthouse and the Soviet Academy? Strange bedfellows, indeed.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
What's Happening With Windsor?

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
One of the largest stock funds in the United States has announced a plan to bring in new managers for part of its portfolio, and in light of the fund's excellent record, it is worth asking whether holders should be worried about the changes.
The $3.2 billion Vanguard Windsor II Fund -- the 15th largest of the nation's 1,000-plus stock funds -- has been managed by Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, a firm that handles roughly three-quarters of the fund's assets, and Invesco Capital Management. 
 But Invesco recently acquired the Financial Funds Group in Denver, which competes with Vanguard, and is now marketing the funds under its own name. Because of that, John C. Bogle, Vanguard's chairman, and Invesco have agreed to part ways to avoid conflicts of interest. Windsor II shareholders will vote on a proposal to replace Invesco at a meeting set for Oct. 22; if approved, the new management will take over on Nov. 1.
The upheaval at Windsor II "makes me a little wary," said Dan Wiener, editor of The Vanguard Adviser, an independent investment newsletter based in Brooklyn.
Vanguard began Windsor II in June 1985 after it closed Windsor to new investors because cash was flowing into the fund more quickly than it could be carefully invested. Windsor, the industry's second-largest fund, is managed by John B. Neff, one of the most prominent of all mutual-fund managers. Yet Windsor II has outpaced its big brother.
Both are "value" funds, which buy out-of-favor stocks with low price-earnings ratios. But Windsor II is more diversified than Mr. Neff's fund. Mr. Neff makes big bets with his $7.9 billion fund, which holds an average of only 70 to 80 stocks. Windsor II, whose assets are much smaller, holds roughly the same number of stocks, but its holdings are distributed over more industries.
Too much diversity can backfire in stock funds. When a fund owns too many stocks, its performance tracks the average of the market as a whole. So Mr. Bogle could be expected to be wary of overdiversifying Windsor II. Yet Vanguard wants to replace one manager -- Invesco -- with three, and it seems reasonable to ask whether more managers mean even more diversity.
Mr. Bogle insists that Windsor II investors will see "no change in the nature or direction" of the fund's portfolio. He says Invesco's share is being divided among three managers, selected from 20, to position the fund for future growth.
Two companies will each handle about $270 million, roughly 9 percent of the fund's portfolio. Equinox Capital Management uses a blend of quantitative and fundamental analysis to identify medium- and large-capitalization stocks. Tukman Capital Management specializes in concentrated portfolios of well-managed companies in growing businesses.
The remaining $200 million or so will be handled by Vanguard's Core Management Group, a unit of the company that manages the $5.1 billion in Vanguard's seven index funds. Its Windsor II stake will be entirely managed on a quantitative basis, meaning that stocks are selected from a group of 250 stocks with below-average price-earnings ratios, above-average yields and other criteria.
Right now, Invesco manages about half of Windsor II's 80 stocks. Of the new managers, Tukman will manage 10 or 15 stocks, and Equinox will manage 25 or so. Mr. Bogle said the Core Management Group would select an additional 40 or so, for a total of roughly 80 stocks. After accounting for overlap with the Barrow, Hanley portfolio, the new management arrangement is expected to add roughly 20 stocks to the fund's total portfolio.
As for performance, Mr. Bogle says that the Invesco portion of Windsor II returned an annual average of 17.6 percent and that Barrow, Hanley's performance was "substantially identical."
Right now, Windsor II has about 50 cents of "unrealized capital gains" per share. Unrealized gains are created when securities owned by a fund increase in value. The gains are realized -- and taxes are owed -- when the securities are sold. Assuming that Invesco may have realized some of those gains by year-end anyway, Mr. Bogle estimates that Windsor II shareholders may receive an additional 35 to 40 cents a share of capital gains in 1991, rather than several years down the road, as the new managers replace some of Invesco's holdings.
What's an investor to do? John Reken thaler of Morningstar Inc., a mutual-fund rating concern, says that because Windsor II "is not extremely idiosyncratic, it's easier to pull out one manager and plug in another." He calls it a "good fund with competitive returns and below-average risk."
Mr. Wiener of The Vanguard Adviser newsletter recommends that investors hold their shares of Windsor II, but he is worried about the possibility that the number of issues held by the fund may increase sharply. If the number of shares approaches 125, he said, "I would start to get nervous."
For investors who can handle more risk, Mr. Wiener prefers Windsor. Through August, Windsor had gained 25.8 percent this year, compared with 21.5 percent for Windsor II. "The difference is likely to rise as the economy pulls up because John Neff favors the unloved cyclicals that do well in the early stages of economic recovery," he said.

HEADLINE: And Not a Personal Computer in Sight

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
It is the office of the future that looks like a relic from the past: people working with note pads, blackboards and Post-it Notes, and not a personal computer in sight. It's a place where nerdy-looking shirt badges are de rigueur.
What makes this scene state-of-the-art-to-be is that the pads, boards, Post-its and badges are all "talking" to each other via tiny infrared light-emitting diodes or radio transmitters. 
 The badges keep track of where, when and with whom the wearer is spending time and receive messages on liquid crystal displays. The pads and other writing surfaces serve as the tabula rasa for a powerful -- but hidden -- network of computer machinery that surrounds workers like a cocoon. Information or instructions can be entered on the pads and boards in plain English, to be sent to similar surfaces in other offices or used to retrieve and store data from computers. The destination points could be down the hall or across the world.
This vision of a stripped-down high-tech office where the computers have disappeared into the woodwork is still years away from being turned into a reality.
But it has already signaled the revival of the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, where the vision is being developed. The legendary birthplace of many of the ideas that resulted in the modern computer industry, PARC is attracting new interest after a decade languishing in relative obscurity.
"The magic has returned to PARC," said David Patterson, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a leading computer designer.
If the magic pays off -- and many think it will -- the implications are far-reaching. It would give Xerox, which mishandled PARC's earlier efforts by botching product development and marketing, a rare second chance to become a dominant player in information systems by building on its still-strong foundation in the copying business. And it would help to keep the United States competitive in high technology during the 1990's.
An increasing number of experts say that the PARC office's all-encompassing high-tech environment -- based on an approach called ubiquitous computing -- could not only revolutionize the way personal computers are used but also radically change the way work is done.
As powerful as desktop computers are now, to many people they are still off-putting and awkward to use. In some cases, they have even become dangerous to use, giving rise to so-called repetitive stress injuries. Office productivity has actually remained flat for the past decade despite the widespread introduction of PC's.
 
Dumping the Keyboards
 The solution, PARC says, is to pull out the keyboards and make the technology as accessible as a pad and pencil, albeit a pad and pencil imbedded with electronics. With everyone tied together wherever they are by familiar office instruments, efficiency can only soar, particularly when it comes to group projects, researchers say.
"You want to use technology inside to keep the outside simple," said John Seeley Brown, PARC's director. "Technology is getting sophisticated enough to get out of the way."
To be sure, a pervasive technology that surrounds people with radio waves and hidden computers is not everyone's vision of an ideal workplace. The PARC office has already raised concerns about personal privacy and office safety, concerns that Xerox says it is addressing.
Ideal or not, PARC's project could not have been better timed. The computer industry is in chaos as such major players as I.B.M., Apple, Microsoft and Compaq cast around for a new model to replace today's desktop computer and jump-start flagging sales.
"We're approaching the end of the PC era and we haven't established the metaphor for the next phase of the information revolution," said Paul Saffo, a consultant who is a computer industry analyst at the Institute for the Future, a market research firm in Menlo Park, Calif. "Everything is up for grabs and the industry is just waiting for a new idea. Xerox is the only place that consistently comes up with new ideas."
 
Early Promise
 The situation is rich with irony. Many industry leaders are placing their bets for the next PC era on smaller and smaller portable computers inspired by an early PARC vision: the Dynabook, a tiny wonder machine that would function as an intelligent electronic companion. But while others are still feeding off of PARC's early ideas, PARC itself is striking out in new directions, hoping that this time Xerox will know how to capitalize on what it finds there.
Located in the foothills behind Stanford University, the Palo Alto Research Center was founded in 1970. In its early years, a small group of scientists and engineers designed the first personal computers and created a variety of technologies that continue to define the direction of advanced computing. Office networks, graphical computer displays with windows, laser printers and distributed computing systems, not to mention PC's themselves, were all the fruit of a fundamental rethinking of the modern office that went on here during the 70's.
But PARC's parent, based across the country in Stamford, Conn., was a risk-averse maker of photocopying equipment. In their book "Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal Computer," Douglas K. Smith and Robert C. Alexander recounted how Xerox executives refused to market PARC's personal computer, the Alto. Xerox's management never fully grasped the implications of personal computing and the company was quickly relegated to the sidelines when the International Business Machines Corporation introduced its PC in 1981.
Because their inventions languished, PARC's best researchers departed for such companies as Apple, Microsoft and Digital Equipment. It was those companies that produced commercial versions of innovations that PARC had pioneered.
In recent years, though, PARC has been attracting new talent and percolating new ideas, with much of the credit going to the 51-year-old Dr. Brown, who took over as director last year after serving as co-director for four years.
"John Seeley Brown is one of the creative outlaws, and the outlaws are running the shop now at PARC," said Mr. Saffo.
 
Closer Contacts
 Xerox also seems to have learned its lesson and is no longer isolating basic research from product development.
"The situation has changed a lot at PARC," said William Spencer, a former director of PARC who now heads Sematech, the chip-making consortium. "You have marketing people living there these days. With Paul Allaire as chief executive, contacts between Xerox's marketing and research sides are much closer."
One piece of evidence: Directly down the hill from the research center, construction workers are putting the finishing touches on Xerox's System Development Laboratory, where all of the company's software product development is to be consolidated. The software is now developed at a number of sites around the country.
Moreover, technological change may now be working in Xerox's favor. The gulf is rapidly narrowing between Xerox's paper-based copying machine business and digital computing systems that permit images and text to be stored, copied and manipulated electronically. Because of the shift, PARC's work has become central to Xerox's view of its future.
"In the 70's, PARC was started to diversify Xerox," said Michael Schrage, a high-tech consultant and writer. "In the 90's, PARC is being used to reintegrate the company."
Last year, Xerox introduced a high-end publishing system that represented the first step in its attempt to break down the wall that has separated paper documents from electronic documents. The Docutech Publishing System first scans a paper document and stores a digital image. It is then able rapidly to apply a range of computer technologies to the image, including image enhancement and optical character recognition.
The company says less costly versions of the Docutech system will be a component of Xerox's re-entry into the computing business.
 
Can It Sell?
 But if PARC has once again proven prescient in understanding and charting the evolution of personal computer technology, its parent has yet to show that it can do more than sell regular office equipment.
William Lowe, who led I.B.M.'s personal computer business before becoming head of product development at Xerox in 1989, says it is still unclear whether Xerox can market its digital innovations. Earlier this year, Mr. Lowe left Xerox to become president of the Gulfstream Corporation, a maker of business jets.
"An integration has taken place that will allow Xerox to get PARC's technology into products," he said. "The real issue is from a marketing and sales perspective. How do you sell systems to customers instead of copiers?"
The answer may well turn on how captivating Dr. Brown's "outlaw" creations turn out to be. And that will turn on the lure of ubiquitous computing, a system that Dr. Brown views as the new paradox of modern computing: As hardware and software systems become more powerful and shrink in size, they will surround us and disappear at the same time.
The driving force behind ubiquitous computing is the rapidly falling cost of even the most powerful microprocessors, the chips that are the heart of computing. That makes it economically feasible, Xerox researchers say, to imbue common office tools -- like note pads, blackboards and Post-its -- with computer "intelligence" and the capacity to create and transmit electronic documents.
In PARC's view, it is these writing surfaces -- and not computer screens -- that make the best "interfaces" between people and machines.
Information generated by PARC badges could in turn be used to add tremendous depth to future computerized storage systems. Because the badges monitor the wearer's every move and encounter, they should prove extremely useful in retrieving and sharing documents. For example, many people now remember documents not just by their content, but by where they were last used or the meetings at which they were generated. The badges would broadcast a nonstop stream of such minutiae to an unseen web of computers, which would then "wrap" each document in a coat of identifying information.
That would allow the PARC office to "keep track of the information that I call 'intrinsic,' " said Robert Spinrad, Xerox's director of corporate technology.
Collectively these intelligent office tools would push traditional computing tasks far into the background.
PARC is now thinking of computers "in terms of inches, feet and yards," said Mark Weiser, director of PARC's computer science laboratory, referring to the process of trying to package the technology seamlessly into badges, note pads and blackboards. Such an approach is the exact opposite of the current industry infatuation with virtual reality, in which the user puts on electronic goggles and a special glove to control a computer-generated environment. In virtual reality, the outside world disappears. At PARC, it is the computers that seem to vanish.
With the machinery gone, people take more of the spotlight, which may explain why Dr. Brown says research on new work practices is as important as research on new products.
Indeed, one of the things that has traditionally distinguished PARC from such other major American research centers as I.B.M.'s Thomas J. Watson Laboratory or A.T.& T.'s Bell Labs has been a willingness to make sociological as well as technological experiments. For example, during the 70's PARC gave hundreds of researchers personal computers, which then cost $30,000 each to build. In doing so, it proved the value of office networks that permitted researchers to share information.
Now the company is conducting similar experiments with ubiquitous computing technologies.
 
A Willingness to Spend
 "Xerox has always been willing to spend the dollars and invest the human capital," said David Liddle, a former Xerox executive and the president of Metaphor Computer Systems, one of the Silicon Valley companies that commercialized technology that originated at PARC and which was recently acquired by I.B.M. "It's one of the reasons I have a good feeling about their work in ubiquitous computing."
But Dr. Brown's single-minded devotion to studying the sociology of the workplace in addition to its technology has occasionally left some of his researchers perplexed. "After listening to John, I sometimes wonder why he doesn't fire us and hire a laboratory of anthropologists," said Bernardo Huberman, a PARC physicist.
Others worry that some of PARC's new technologies -- like the identity badges -- may be too invasive and threaten personal privacy.
"The amount of negative reaction is large enough that we have to deal with it," said Marvin Theimer, a PARC computer scientist. Some researchers are now exploring ways to permit people to work anonymously in ubiquitous computer networks.
But much basic work remains to be done before the first PARC office can open for business. The new style of computing is requiring a massive overhaul of traditional software systems, which have been designed to serve a stable structure of computers wired to fixed locations. In PARC's new world, the mandate is for motion. The software will have to be sophisticated enough to keep up with office workers as they move about and take their computerized badges and pads with them.
"Understanding, designing and building ensembles of computers is emerging as the intellectual centerpoint of computing and computer science," said David Gelernter, a Yale University computer scientist.
Yet with ubiquitous computing still in its infancy, PARC and Dr. Brown are already poking around for new projects that promise big breakthroughs.
Dr. Brown recently assigned one researcher, Ralph Merkle, to work full time on an even more radical approach known as nanotechnology, a speculative discipline based on building computer systems by controlling individual atoms. A few scientists now believe that nanotechnology will make it possible in the next two decades to build computers capable of performing thousands of times faster than today's supercomputers.
"This is the manufacturing technology of the 21st century," Mr. Merkle said. "I'd call this long-range applied research."
 
 
WORKING IN THE SHADOW OF HISTORY
 Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center occupies a special place in the history and culture of the computer industry.
In the early 1970's, it served as the base for a small group of researchers, led by Alan Kay, who literally re-invented computing. Until then, computers were refrigerator-sized monsters that sat in air-cooled glass rooms and were shared by dozens of users. By the mid-70's, the Kay group had made it possible to give each researcher a personal computer small enough to fit under a desk.
But in the 80's, Xerox mishandled PARC's research, turning the lab into a symbol of America's inability to capitalize on innovation. Said one scientist who joined the exodus of talented researchers who quit PARC: "I left because I wanted to see the results of my work under a Christmas tree."
Today, PARC is home to about 300 researchers working in areas as diverse as ubiquitous computing and natural language. The center is small by the standards of many of the nation's corporate research facilities.
There are five related labs on PARC's California campus: electronics and imaging, computer science, electronic documents, system sciences and electronic materials. A sixth lab, EuroPARC, was founded in Cambridge, England, in 1988 to study human-computer interaction and serve as a link to major European universities.
The research emphasis at PARC has shifted in the last decade from physics, basic science and electromechanical and integrated circuits to such current interests as digital systems, anthropology, linguistics and the use of color.
PARC is one of three Xerox research centers. A second center in Webster, N.Y., serves as a base for research in copying and color printing technology. The Xerox Research Center of Canada, in Mississauga, Ontario, focuses on materials research.
 
A ZEAL FOR CONNECTIONS
 Xerox is widely believed to have fumbled its opportunity in the computer industry because its Palo Alto Research Center remained isolated from the giant copier company during the 1970's.
Today, PARC's new director, John Seeley Brown, has a passion for making certain there is no separation between the laboratory and its parent.
Earlier this year, Dr. Brown wrote a widely read and controversial article in the Harvard Business Review titled "Research That Reinvents the Corporation."
In his article, Dr. Brown argues that the role of a corporate research laboratory is not just to invent new products and technologies; it must fundamentally transform the way the corporation functions as well.
"We have to marinate in the real problems of the corporation," he said. That means that it is crucial for laboratory managers to be grounded in the practical concerns of the corporation as well as to be on the cutting edge of technology.
Trained as a computer scientist and a mathematician at Brown and the University of Michigan, Dr. Brown came to PARC in 1978 from Bolt, Baranek & Newman, a Cambridge, Mass., think tank where he worked on artificial intelligence and learning systems.
His background in artificial intelligence led to a new interest at PARC in what researchers there refer to as "collaborative" technologies: computer systems that support and amplify the activities of small groups of office workers. To understand those dynamics better, Dr. Brown hired the first anthropologists at PARC.
This approach has led researchers to view writing surfaces that produce electronic documents -- and not personal computers -- as the heart of the modern office.

HEADLINE: All About/Musical Instruments;
In Search of the High-Tech Chord

BYLINE: By DAVID BERREBY

 BODY:
Horns and other big-band instruments were the hottest sellers when Manny Goldrich opened his music store in 1933 on West 48th Street in Manhattan, conveniently near Broadway and a still-thriving Tin Pan Alley. In the 1960's, the public's taste for Elvis Presley and the Beatles drove the shining saxophones into a single corner of the cavernous store, cramming the rest with guitars and amplifiers.
In the 80's, though, Mr. Goldrich's son Henry and grandsons Ian and Judd have had to change even more radically. Digital recording technology has revolutionized music-making, so that today's customers are as likely to be interested in ROM -- a computer's read-only memory -- as in reeds for clarinets. 
 With the retail music business getting more high tech, retailers have to do more than just make room upstairs for computers and software. They need well-trained people to explain how all the equipment works. "In 1982, we had 25 salespeople," Ian Goldrich said. "Today we have 81. Things are more technical and we need those skills."
Manny's Music, though larger than the average music store, is typical of the music retailing business, which is dominated by thousands of "mom and pop" operations.

 
 
An Adaptable Industry
The Cacophony Of Segments
 The country's 5,000 to 6,000 retailers of musical instruments are used to adapting to the shifting waves of fashion and technology. According to Brian Majeski, editor of Music Trades, an industry trade magazine, retail music stores sell about $3.5 billion a year worth of instruments and "sound reinforcement" equipment -- microphones, mixers and the like -- to an enthusiastic public with somewhat fickle tastes.
"The business is really an agglomeration of small markets that are pretty discrete," Mr. Majeski said. "There's the piano segment, which is overwhelmingly parents buying an instrument so a kid can take lessons. Then there are band instruments like clarinets and horns, which are bought for kids in school bands on lease-buy programs. The third segment is guitars and synthesizers, which is overwhelmingly young men between the ages of 13 and 25. Then there are the electronics, which are bought by hobbyists."
There are even smaller splinters, Mr. Majeski said. Percussion instruments, for example, are 3 percent of the market, and "some people are still buying accordions," he said.
The piano and band segments, which together account for about 27 percent of the market, have been held back in the last three years by slack consumer spending and by reductions in school music programs. The electric guitar and electronic markets, about 25 percent of the business, have also had lackluster sales. With consumers wary about the economy, overall instrument sales have been flat in the last three years, Mr. Majeski said. The one bright spot is acoustical guitars, whose sales have been climbing because of renewed interest in traditional instruments.
In many industries, such flatness might prompt mergers and liquidations at the margins, but most musical instrument makers, like retailers, are small family businesses and are reluctant to abandon a craft spanning several generations.
 
The Midi Revolution
Putting a Studio Into the Software
 Selling these instruments requires sophistication. David Rovin is typical of the generations of musicians who have supported their pursuits by working in a music store. But Mr. Rovin, a salesman at Manny's Music, sells software, not guitars.
Mr. Rovin works beside a wall crammed with computer screens and displays of programs aimed at making the musician's life easier. To demonstrate one big seller, he taps a few instructions into an Atari personal computer. The Atari is a favorite with music software makers, he said, because alone among PC's, it has a built-in musical instrument digital interface device, or Midi. As Mr. Rovin plays on a keyboard synthesizer next to the computer, the Midi translates the sequence of keystrokes into computer code.
On half of Mr. Rovin's computer screen is an image of a typical sound engineer's mixing device, its meters rising and falling with his playing, as a real mixer's would. Below this image, on the other half of the screen, is a musical staff. As Mr. Rovin plays each note, it appears, correctly notated, on the computer's screen. Once he's satisfied with this first track, a click of the PC's mouse allows Mr. Rovin to create a second track, and so on up to 18. The computer mixer allows him to blend musical tracks as if he were in a studio; the notater will allow him to print out the score.
The software, made by C-Lab, a company in Hamburg, Germany, sells for $479. In the three years it's been out, 50,000 programs have been sold, according to the manufacturer. Similar programs for I.B.M. and Macintosh computers are also available.
Music software makers are bullish on the potential market for musicians and for musical training, but Mr. Majeski, the trade magazine editor, is not so sure there are enough potential composers and mixers out there to make it a significant market. "The whole business was only about $15 million last year," he said.
Software advances have also drawn the interest of the Yamaha Corporation of Japan, the $2.7 billion instrument maker that was the first to market synthesizers and electronic keyboards in the 70's. For the last three years, the company has offered an acoustic piano with the modern version of a piano roll -- software that reproduces a great performance on the instrument. Of special interest to the company is that 70 percent of people who have bought grand pianos equipped with the device don't play themselves.
 
An Acoustic Backlash
The Revenge Of the Quiet
 As president of Washburn International Inc., Rudy Schlacher has to be a trend-watcher. The Buffalo Grove, Ill., company, which had sales of $40 million last year, is one of the largest guitar makers in the country. The prime market for Washburn's guitars is young men who want to be like the hot artist of the moment.
"MTV dictates what our industry will be for years to come," Mr. Schlacher said. MTV is now featuring an all-acoustic show called "MTV Unplugged."
Sales figures reflect the new interest in traditional instruments. Acoustic guitar sales, which plummeted from 2.5 million a year in 1972 to a low of 875,000 in 1983, have climbed back up to 1.5 million last year, according to the Guitar and Accessories Music Marketing Association.
Washburn is scrambling to produce enough acoustic guitars to meet the growing demand. The company's basic model, made in South Korea, sells for less than $200. Other models cost more than $1,000, and are made in the United States. The new acoustic trend has inspired a new form of high-tech instrument: the electric acoustic guitar.
"If you amplify a regular acoustic guitar and you don't do it right, it sounds like an electric guitar," Mr. Schlacher said. The answer, he said, is to build in devices that detect the vibrations of the guitar's body -- the inspiration was a motion-detection sensor used on jet-fighter wings -- and then amplify those vibrations, which are what give the instrument its distinctive sound.
Mr. Schlacher concedes that many buyers probably will never have an audience big enough to require its special features. But to the eager musician, he said, "it's not what you need, it's what you can afford. The music business is a dream business."
 
 
 
MUSIC'S ROCK AND HARD PLACE
LAST March, a concert at Carnegie Hall featuring Sting and Antonio Carlos Jobim brought to light a problem in the musical instrument business. The concert was dedicated to preserving the Brazilian rain forest with the proceeds going to the Rainforest Foundation International.
But many musical instruments are at least partly made from rain forest woods. For example, mahogany, which is a very hard rain forest wood and whose destruction is being protested by a number of environmental groups, is an ideal wood for guitar necks and backs. Mahogany is also used in some pianos and clarinets.
Then there is rosewood. Rosewood, which also comes from the Brazilian rain forest, is used for the sides and fronts of guitars.
Customers who discover they have been singing songs against deforestation accompanied by a product made of mahogany are not happy customers, acknowledges Rudy Schlacher of Washburn International Inc. "We get letters all the time," he said.
Washburn now gets its tropical woods from Indonesia. "We don't go to the Brazilian areas anymore, partly for publicity reasons, but also because of scarcity. And we're trying to work only with people who have a reforestation program," Mr. Schlacher said.
Still, he said, the supply of raw materials is "a massive problem." For example, "a good-quality piece of maple for a guitar body might have cost us $10 about ten years ago. Now it costs $60," he said.
Supplies are also an anxiety for the Yamaha Corporation. A piano, for example, has some 8,000 moving parts, many of them wood, said Ron Raup, a company vice president. "Solid spruce is the best material for sounding boards," he said. But Yamaha long ago abandoned ivory for its keys. "We developed a synthetic that feels just like ivory," he said.

HEADLINE: Toughest Fight Yet For Hydro-Quebec

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
Hydro-Quebec, the $50 billion utility that is wholly owned by the Quebec government, has powered a vast industrial expansion in the province. And the company is committed to further development that would almost double its output of inexpensive hydropower. But getting there might be a problem. For the first time, the company is encountering fierce resistance.
Hydro-Quebec's chief executive, Richard Drouin, has faced tough fights before. He took office three years ago amid a labor battle in which unionized workers ransacked some of the company's executive offices. He has since brought a measure of labor calm and improved the reliability of the company's electrical service. 
 But he may have more difficulty carrying out the company's ambitious growth plans. Hydro-Quebec is now in the center of a storm over a proposed project that would spend 12.6 billion Canadian dollars to tap hydropower on the Great Whale River, which flows into Hudson Bay. The project is intensely opposed by the Cree Indians who live in the area and by environmentalists.
The dispute has spread to the United States, where opponents are pressing New York and Vermont to restrain purchases of power from Quebec even as growth in power demand is slowing. New York, which currently gets only a tiny percentage of its power from Quebec, has delayed until late next year a final decision on proceeding with a contract to pay 14.5 billion American dollars over 21 years for power from Quebec.
In this atmosphere of uncertainty about demand for its hydropower, the company's heavy use of debt to finance construction is causing some analysts to wonder if it will have sufficient revenue to pay off its bonds.
Mr. Drouin, however, expresses no doubts about the worthiness of the project. Still, he acknowledges with a diffident grin that the company's profile "is a little higher these days than we would like."
The 59-year-old Mr. Drouin went to school with the current Premier of Quebec, Robert Bourassa, at the College Jean-de-Brebeuf in Montreal, then took a law degree at Laval University in Quebec City. That early friendship, combined with Mr. Drouin's expertise in labor relations, won him the job that some say is equivalent to economics minister of the province. As a source of big construction projects as well as of hydropower, the company has long been an important engine of growth for Quebec.
The urbane, square-jawed, silver-haired executive, who as a sailor in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence often braves inhospitable seas, came aboard Hydro-Quebec three years ago, when the utility faced severe labor problems.
The rancor stemmed from the company's insistence on contracting out work instead of hiring additional workers or paying more overtime. Mr. Drouin reached an agreement with the unions under which company workers perform operating and maintenance work, while subcontractors handle new construction. Nonetheless, relations with the company's 25,000 workers are still touchy.
As chief executive, Mr. Drouin has tried not only to get a better handle on labor relations but also to improve the company's reliability. In the last decade Hydro-Quebec has been plagued by power blackouts and brownouts. But failures have already been sharply reduced, and Mr. Drouin's goal is to make Hydro-Quebec one of Canada's most dependable utilities by the mid-1990's.
The Great Whale construction project had already been set in motion by the time Mr. Drouin arrived on the scene. He has pursued it vigorously, saying expansion is essential for the well-being of the province, where the company's operating and construction activities in 1990 injected more that $7.5 billion into the economy, equivalent to 4.5 percent of Quebec's gross domestic product.
The entire province is believed to have a hydroelectric potential of about 50,000 megawatts, equivalent to the output of about 60 traditional power plants. The company has already developed about 25,000 megawatts, with plans for 20,000 more.
Noting that hydropower is "cheaper to develop and bring to major load centers than any other generating option," Mr. Drouin said he expects to be able to sell power in the northeast United States for 40 percent below other electricity producers.
But to continue tapping Quebec's hydro resources, the giant utility, which generates revenues of $6 billion a year and borrows about $4 billion a year, needs environmental approval to go forward with the 3,100 megawatt Great Whale project.
The project entails building dikes and dams, roads and airports, diverting four rivers and flooding an area slightly larger than Lake Champlain, in a region where 10,000 Cree and 5,000 Inuit make their home. Mr. Drouin insists that his company can carry out the construction work while preserving the environment and raising living standards of the native peoples.
The Cree and their lawyers in Montreal dispute this. They argue that the project will take a severe toll on the environment. They are fighting the project every inch of the way and now have help from North American conservationist groups, including the Sierra Club and the National Audubon Society. Entertainers are also getting involved; three rock concerts are scheduled for this week at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan under the title "Ban the Dam Jam."
The coalition recently won a significant victory. Quebec's Environment Minister, Pierre Paradis, announced on Aug. 22 that no work would begin on the Great Whale project until after there has been a thorough environmental assessment by the province, which will take at least a year.
In addition, a federal judge in Ottawa last month ordered the Canadian Government to undertake its own environmental review, and Ottawa and Quebec are weighing a joint assessment. But it cannot begin until the indigenous people agree to participate.
Quebec's Energy Minister, Lise Bacon, said the province needs the power and faces a choice of using either hydropower or nuclear power. "Do you want a nuclear plant to be built in Quebec?" she asked at a news briefing last week. In fact, Hydro-Quebec already operates two small nuclear plants.
When Mr. Bourassa and Governor Cuomo signed a power contract in 1989 under which Hydro-Quebec would provide 1,000 megawatts of electricity to New York State for 21 years beginning in 1995, they gave each other until next Dec. 31 to back out without penalty. Now both parties have extended the deadline until Nov. 30, 1992.
Richard M. Flynn, chairman of the New York Power Authority, said the state would use the time to reassess its power needs in light of the reduced growth in electricity sales resulting from the recession and from greater conservation. The growth has fallen to six-tenths of 1 percent annually from 1.5 percent in the mid-80's. This could mean changes in the contract to adjust delivery schedules.
Mr. Flynn said in an interview that the contract offered "significant environmental benefits" for New York. He cited a report of the state's energy office that hydroelectric power cuts "millions of tons" of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide pollutants that would otherwise pour out of from oil- and coal-fired power stations.
In addition, he calculates that Quebec power has saved the state's residents more than $600 million since 1978.
The Great Whale project is only the latest of a number of projects to open up the hydro resources of the north. A huge complex on La Grande River, a couple of hundred miles to the south of the Great Whale, was completed in 1985 and generates 10,300 megawatts of power. A second phase at La Grande is scheduled to add 4,500 megawatts in 1995.
In the next decade the company expects to spend some $64 billion not only on La Grande Phase 2 and the Great Whale but a vast new complex along the Nottaway, Broadback and Rupert Rivers, south of La Grande, which would generate 8,400 megawatts. It is also negotiating with Newfoundland to develop two big hydroelectric sites on the lower Churchill River in Labrador.
To get the funds for these tremendous capital-intensive ventures, the company has used retained earnings and borrowed heavily in local and foreign capital markets.
With long-term debt of $25.6 billion at the end of last year, including $7.5 billion in United States dollars, Hydro-Quebec already owes more money than all but a few other North American corporations, and some bankers have expressed uneasiness about future borrowing for the new ventures.
Robert Blohm, an American investment banker in Montreal, said the export contracts for New York and Vermont are intended to provide the bulk of the income needed to service the American indebtedness. If these contracts are annulled, he warned, the company could be "dangerously exposed to risk on the American portion of its debt."
But William Streeter, vice president of Moody's Investors Service, is less worried. He cites positive factors, including the company's "strong management," its "flexibility" in construction programs and its "very competitive" electricity prices.
There is no greater enthusiast of water power than Premier Bourassa himself, the 58-year-old leader of Quebec's Liberal Party, who has been provincial chief executive on and off since 1970.
In a book titled "Power From the North," published by Prentice-Hall Canada in 1985, Mr. Bourassa wrote: "Quebec is a vast hydroelectric plant in the bud, and every day millions of potential kilowatt-hours flow downhill and out to sea. What a waste!"
 
 
A BARGAIN FOR SMELTERS
 THE secret is finally out about how much big energy-hungry aluminum smelters and other metal refiners actually pay for the power they buy from Hydro-Quebec, the utility owned by Quebec's taxpayers.
The answer: precious little in bad times, more in good times. Under risk-sharing variable-rate contracts, prices are pegged to a combination of the inflation rate, the world price of the metal and the customer's profits.
For example, Norsk Hydro Canada Inc., operating a magnesium smelter at Becancour, Quebec, for its Norwegian parent, now pays 1.6 cents a kilowatt-hour. This is about half of what Hydro-Quebec charges other industrial users and a quarter of what the New York Power Authority pays.
Norsk Hydro is one of 13 heavy energy users that have invested billions of dollars in Quebec and have similar contracts. Of the 13, four are magnesium or aluminum smelters -- companies that use enormous amounts of electricity to separate and refine metals.
As times improve for Norsk Hydro, its payments for electricity would rise under the formula so that over the term of the contract Hydro-Quebec theoretically would fare as well as with its other industrial customers.
Still, there are questions about whether the smelters are being subsidized at the expense of other consumers, the taxpayers and competitors. The Utah-based Magnesium Corporation of America has brought a case before the United States International Trade Commission seeking duties to wipe out any competitive advantages Norsk Hydro may have gained from its contract with Hydro-Quebec.
Hydro-Quebec says no subsidy is involved. It calculates that it may lose as much as $125 million this year on the 13 agreements but that it can make a profit of twice that much if aluminum sales and profits recover.

Long-Term Bonds Are Out of Kilter

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The returns of funds holding United States Government bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds usually closely parallel each other. That is not true today.
The current returns of corporate bond funds reflect a traditional yield curve: the longer investors are willing to tie up their money, the greater the return. By contrast, investors in intermediate-term Government bond funds actually enjoy a greater return than holders of long-term bonds. 
 Eventually, Government bond funds' returns will move back into alignment. Because the United States economy is coming out of recession, the inverted yield curve -- where short-term performance exceeds the long-term -- is unlikely to last. For now, however, Government-bond-fund investors are not being rewarded for the extra risks inherent in long-term investing. The better choice today is to hold short- and intermediate-term Government-bond funds.

3 Places Where Brunchers Can Get a Taste of Dinner

 BODY:
The brisk breezes of fall inevitably bring the hungry brunchers, and this year, because of the slow economy, more restaurants than ever have decide to offer brunch. Some offer conventional fare like eggs Benedict and French toast, while others supplement that with items from the regular menu. Here are three spots worth trying, for brunch or Sunday dinner.
 
La Boheme
 24 Minetta Lane, near Avenue of the Americas, in Manhattan, (212) 473-6447 -- This popular Greenwich Village bistro has a country-setting feel with plank floors, wood-and-stucco walls and close tables the size of cutting boards that are draped with Provencal fabric and butcher paper. Prices are moderate and the kitchen turns out seductive roasts, lovely prepared seafood and thin-crusted pizzas. 
 Among starters are the zesty eggplant puree slathered over toasted French bread; braised endive with prosciutto; smoked trout with warm potato salad; and a mixture of goat cheese, sweet red pepper, onion and zucchini in puff pastry. The pizzas that come whizzing out of the brick oven have thin, deliciously blistered crusts and well-orchestrated toppings. Among those is a spiced chicken with tomato, onion and coriander.
For main courses there are a grilled half chicken served with caramelized shallots, garlic and mashed potatoes; lamb stew with curry accompanied with couscous; and pepper linguine pasta tossed with prosciutto, mushrooms and Marsala sauce. Desserts include a chocolate marquise with sabayon, and a warm thin-crusted apple tart.
Appetizers range from $4.50 to $6.50; entrees $12.50 to $16.50; desserts $4.50 to $6. Sunday hours are from noon to 11 P.M. (Review, Dec. 2, 1988).
 
 
Symphony Cafe
 950 Eighth Avenue, at 56th Street, in Manhattan, (212) 397-9595 -- On the ground level of the Symphony House apartment complex at 56th Street near Eighth Avenue, this grand expanse was designed by Jeffrey Beers, who also created China Grill in the CBS building on the Avenue of the Americas. Symphony Cafe is similarly colossal in scale, yet unlike the marmoreal and glacial China Grill, it extends warmth and a sense of neighborhood congeniality. The unpretentious menu and relatively moderate prices have made it a popular spot.
To begin there are braised snails with wild mushrooms; salad of greens with toasted goat cheese; duckling crepe with raisin sauce; and grilled shrimp with mustard sauce. Starting from the top on the main course selection is a knockout roast chicken with mashed potatoes; a New York strip steak with shoe-string potatoes; pan-seared salmon is garnished with golden globules of salmon roe and moistened with a basil butter sauce, and lamb chops come with a port wine sauce. Among desserts are warm apple tart with ice cream, and creme brulee.
Appetizers range from $4 to $9; main courses $14.50 to $25; desserts $4.50 to $5.50. Sunday dinner is 3 P.M. to 9 P.M.. A $15.95 prix-fixe brunch menu is served from noon to 3:30 P.M. (Review, April 7, 1989; Article, Oct. 19, 1990).
 
 
Voulez-Vous
 1462 First Avenue, at 76th Street, in Manhattan, (212) 249-1776 -- The glass-fronted contemporary dining room, at this moderately priced French bistro, gives scant hint of the rustic fare within. It is comfortable and mercifully muted by sound tile and has tinted-mirror walls, stout cushioned chairs and a sleek bar in the back. Jacques Rameckers, the genial owner, is a no-nonsense host who keeps tabs on his young, earnest staff.
Appetizers include the French staple, saucisson chaud, or garlicky country sausage; smoked herring with potato salad; brandade de morue, the garlicky codfish-potato puree; and French onion soup. For main courses there are cassoulet; a seafood choucroute with smoked salmon, trout, sturgeon, scallops and haddock; grilled salmon with a light lemony sauce and a concasse of tomato and cucumber, and coq-au-vin served with steamed potatoes and vegetables. Among desserts are profiterolles, and cappuccino frozen souffle.
Appetizers range from $4.75 to $6.75; entrees $14.50 to $18.95; desserts are $6.25 each. Sunday dinner service is from 4 P.M. to midnight. A $12.45 prix-fixe brunch menu is served from 11:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. (Review, Feb. 12, 1988; Article, Oct. 19, 1990).

HEADLINE: Keeping the Government Out of Housing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The suggestion ("How to Revive Housing Starts," Forum, Sept. 22) that states assist home buyers by underwriting "low-interest loans" to people whose income falls below some figure is unwise. The Government already offers a sizable subsidy to homeowners who write off the interest expense of their mortgages. If the Government didn't allow this, the Internal Revenue Service would have collected more money to reduce the Federal budget deficit. And if state governments took the risk of exposing their finances to potential default and foreclosure costs, taxpayers would have to be called upon to provide a bailout. 
 It is about time politicians and consultants realize that the American taxpayer is tired of being called to pay the cost of "neat ideas" invented by those who think they know what is best for the country. The remark by the author, Charles Lockwood, that state-sponsored homeownership would prevent the American republic from becoming one that is "a two-class nation of homeowners and non-homeowners," is a classic example of socialist talk that appeals to the human heart without being analyzed by the head.

HEADLINE: Yankees and Mets: The Forecast;
Harazin Aiming to Put A Stop to the Hurting

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Al Harazin, asked recently if he didn't feel he would be dealing from a hurting hand in the great baseball card game of off-season trades, smiled.
 "Probably," said Harazin, who will take over as general manager of the Mets on Monday. 
Asked his strategy, Harazin said, "Add more chips."
 Is this a bluff?
 The public gets to call Harazin on it as soon as the last out is made Sunday afternoon against the Phillies at Veterans Stadium and the curtain drops on the Mets' 1991 season. It began with the cynical premise that the Mets could lose Darryl Strawberry for nothing and be better off and ended with a front-office realignment, the firing of a manager and the rank residue of the club's first losing record since 1983.
 In comments that reflected a healthy break from the parsimony and personal ill will that colored Frank Cashen's sunset seasons, Harazin implied broadly that he disagreed with the former general manager's belief that the team possessed a competitively competent core of talent. And he hinted loudly that he would be more prepared to spend dollars to restructure and reoutfit the Mets.
 "Don't assume anything," he said. "Don't assume anything."
 Sorry, Al, it can't be resisted.
 What follows are a lot of assumptions -- first, about what the Mets, who lost yesterday to the Phillies, 1-0, can be expected to do before next season, and, second, about what the Mets should do to arrest a slide into even earlier summer irrelevance in 1992.
 
Look for This to Happen
 Dallas Green to Be Named Manager: The lock has become a long shot of late, with the prevailing theory being that Harazin would not want the threat Green may pose. Jeff Torborg may well bail out of Chicago and return to New York, but he has got as good a chance of landing with the Yankees as the Mets. The appointment of Mike Cubbage, the interim manager, would be a respectable and honorable decision, but it won't happen. Tom Trebelhorn, if removed in Milwaukee, would be likely to impress Harazin. But as a pure hunch, Green, without the job options he thought he would have, will become the intriguing option Harazin chooses.
 The Mets to Talk Seriously to Frank Viola: The negotiations -- and there is a chance they will be short and sour -- can be seen as absolutely vital to Harazin's entire poker game.
 The signing of Viola, which would on a practical level afford the Mets reliable innings pitched, could more importantly impress and maybe convince other interested free agents. A commodity like Bobby Bonilla will have clubs lining up as suitors, but after playing on a team that won consecutive NationalLeague East titles, he could interpret harshly an organization that allows Strawberry and Viola to walk without compensation in back-to-back off seasons.
Because of the uncertain physical future of Dwight Gooden and arguably because of Cashen's departure, the Mets appear more inclined to labor hard in negotiating with Viola. Gerry Hunsicker, the baseball brains alongside Harazin and not a charter member of the Viola fan club, has sounded conciliatory toward Viola of late and will no doubt try and sound convincing to Harazin when he underscores the indisputable value the left-hander represents.
 A failure to close a deal -- Viola's probable insistence on four years could scotch the talks quickly -- would make mandatory a major trade for a pitcher or the more economical but multiple signings of, say, Mike Morgan and Tom Candiotti.
 The Mets to Take a Real Run at Signing Bonilla: Bonilla, according to a source with the Pirates, has said he is genuinely intrigued by the idea of joining the Mets. He understands that the runaway assumption is that the Yankees want him more and will open their wallets wider, but he smiles at the kind of fit he might enjoy with the Mets and is perfectly agreeable to playing first base. The Mets, if reluctant to pay $5 million a year for a short-term deal, might lure Bonilla with added years at a lesser rate.
 The Mets to Find Out There Is No Market for Vince Coleman or Kevin McReynolds: The realization that the Mets overpaid at overextended terms a one-dimensional outfielder in Coleman and a left fielder in a multidimensional decline in McReynolds will have been made by others even if the Mets can't seem to come to it themselves. The burdensome contracts (three years at, $10 million for McReynolds; three years at roughly $9 million for Coleman) make a possible blockbuster trade less likely.
 Hang On to Gregg Jefferies: It will break the hearts of his detractors among Mets fans and the hearts of more than a handful of his teammates, but the team in all probability won't trade Jefferies. Harazin might be bold with the bucks in the free-agent market, but probably won't have the daring, in his rookie season as general manager, to trade the franchise's long promoted but slow to mature infielder.
 Howard Johnson Will Remain With the Mets and in Right Field, and Will Do a Good Impression of Hubie Brooks There: Asked who, if anyone was an untouchable on the Mets, Harazin said the names Gooden and Johnson. Enough said. Of course, enough can never be said to the Mets to convince them of the value of defense, and so there will be leads lost and games imperiled in 1992 by Johnson's miscues in right field, just as there were dark laughs galore in 1991 at the team's ghastly glovework.
 The Mets Will Make More Minor Moves Than Major Ones: Harazin, who is likely to be ill-equipped to be imaginatively shrewd, will be busy nonetheless. Mark Carreon could be traded, an able and veteran infielder like Oakland's free agent, Mike Gallego, might be signed, and a pitcher with health as his most glamorous aspect -- Kirk McCaskill? -- could be added.
 
Wish for This to Happen
 The Mets to Retain Viola: Keep him to three years and pay him what it takes. Credibility as much as cash is at question, and of course the two are linked when it comes to ticket sales for coming seasons. A rotation of David Cone, Sid Fernandez, Pete Schourek, Anthony Young and Wally Whitehurst for the start of 1992 won't have folks storming the turnstiles.
 The Mets to Sign Glenn Davis: A gamble of probably enormous proportions, but with the Orioles reportedly offering only a one-year deal for the first baseman who missed much of the season with a serious neck injury, the Mets might acquire him as a relative bargain if they were to offer him a multiyear package. If the Mets are convinced that Davis's physical liabilities are too considerable, then they should make every effort and pay every dollar to sign Wally Joyner of the Angels.
 The Mets to Sign Steve Buechele: Perhaps this would be falling victim to the sin of being seduced by a solid player having an extraordinary season as he campaigns for the contract to end his financial concerns forever. But it would be acquiring an unquestioned defensive plus -- not a silly notion if John Franco is going to be your closer -- with more pop in his bat that had been thought. It might allow the Mets to do the following.
 Trade Gregg Jefferies: One general manager has said teams would step on and over each other to snatch Jefferies and supposedly reap the benefits of a talent pent up because of the pressures of New York. Take all offers, take them seriously, exploit them by playing them off each other, enlarge them by offering to include Magadan in the mix. See if San Diego's catcher, Benito Santiago, can be obtained. The operating doctrine here is not to fret about what kind of player Jefferies becomes elsewhere. It's immaterial. The mistake would be in receiving too little value in return.
 The Mets Hire Cubbage as Manager: The fear that Cubbage, an organization man with no experience at the major league level, would suffer the fate of Harrelson is a fear founded in ignorance. Either Harazin can judge what Cubbage is as a man and manager or he can't. Either he is the next Harrelson or maybe, just maybe, the next Jim Leyland. Make up your mind and act without regard for a payoff in marquee value. Intelligence is the single greatest characteristic a manager can have in New York, and Cubbage's intellect is luminous.

HEADLINE: An Economic Forecast: Clouds but Some Sun

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
ONCE a year, the mountain comes to Mohammed. That is when well-known forecasters appear in Westchester to discuss the economy of the region at the yearly fall symposium sponsored by three of the county's leading business groups: the Westchester County Association, the Westchester County Bankers Association and the Westchester Business Partnership.
"We in Westchester are in danger of becoming too insular and talking only to one another," S. J. Schulman told an audience of 125 business and community leaders at the Rye Town Hilton at this year's meeting, on Sept. 27. "We need to hear other voices, like those of Richard Ravitch, former Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman and chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission, and Rosemary Scanlon, the chief economist for the Port Authority, to tell us about the region's economy and what we can expect for Westchester." 
 The symposium's participants conceded that with few exceptions, the economic problems facing Westchester were not much different from those facing Manhattan, New Jersey and Connecticut. But government, Mr. Ravitch and Ms. Scanlon said, isn't doing its part to battle the recession.
The Federal jobs program and funds for public works projects that were successfully used to fight recessions in the mid-1970's, they said, are lacking in the current downturn. "We had the CETA jobs program then; we have nothing now," Ms. Scanlon said.
Public Works Are Urged
"We need a strong state fiscal policy to help local governments," said Mr. Ravitch. "The city and state are linked together like Siamese twins." Both Ms. Scanlon and Mr. Ravitch urged state and local governments to make funds available for public works projects.
"The existing infrastructure is our greatest anchor to windward," Mr. Ravitch said, "yet the maintenance of the infrastructure is the first thing officials cut back. Why? Because nobody sees it, and nobody complains. And that is a serious mistake. Funding for public works should be increased, not cut, during a recession. In that way we can build our way out of the current mess and in doing so, create jobs."
Saying that lower real estate prices will mean opportunities in the real estate market for new investors, Mr. Ravitch chided officials in New York City for not taking the current drop in real estate values into consideration in the city's own budget projections.
Most banks in Westchester, said James J. McDermott Jr., a symposium participant, are doing fairly well because they have the capital to ride out the storm.
 
Optimism on Westchester Banks
 "We're in pretty decent shape compared to those in Connecticut, where many are in deep trouble," said Mr. McDermott, who is the president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment banking and brokerage firm.
Bank consolidation this year has brought with it signs of stabilization, he said. "By combining forces, the banks bought a ticket out of recession. Such high-expense items as duplicate software systems and overlapping branches are being eliminated with the beneficial cost savings."
And there is cause for future optimism in the banking community, Mr. McDermott said, because, unlike a year ago, capital markets today are showing interest in good banks.
The healthy savings and loans are prospering, he said. "Yet I don't want to raise expectations too high. The banks have the tools they need to get out of trouble, and while there are many fine community banks around, the thrift crisis is still episodic. Outbreaks will continue to occur."
 
Problems in Insurance Field
 In addressing the problems of the insurance industry, Robert H. Vatter, vice president and economist of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in Manhattan, said that excess investment in junk bonds and real estate, plus sloppy writing of investment contracts, has hurt the insurance industry, which was already troubled by cash-flow problems when new business dried up.
"Currently, our industry is under a microscope, suffering from cultural shock," Mr. Vatter said. "At present, there are 2,300 life insurance companies in the United States. Some won't survive; others will merge." Consolidation will benefit the consumer, Mr. Vatter said, adding that one negative factor is the strong possibility of foreign companies buying American insurance companies.
Insurance companies can also expect increased competition from banks and brokerage firms, Mr. Vatter said. "However, the more complex the product, the less likely the competition," he added.
 
Unemployment Is Up
 Ms. Scanlon said unemployment in New York City is running ahead of the national average for the first time, and unemployment in Westchester is also up, which signifies a change from the low unemployment rate the county has enjoyed in recent years. During the first six months of this year, Ms. Scanlon said, the 17-county region of northern New Jersey and the New York City area lost 165,000 jobs.
"And what is equally disturbing is the lack of office starts and residential starts in the region," she said. "There were only 20,000 residential building permits issued for the 17 counties this year, and zero office-building contracts."
Nor was there any significant investment made in the infrastructure of the region, she said, adding, "Retail sales were also off, reflecting the pain in this recession."
The good news?
It is the downward slide of interest rates, Ms. Scanlon said. "Mortgage rates are lower so housing sales are beginning to pick up," she said, "and low interest rates encourage new construction. We've gained back competitiveness with other regions."
Yet, Mr. Vatter said, insurance jobs are being phased out of Manhattan because of the high cost of doing business there.
 
High Costs Hobble the County
 When asked if Westchester might realize a gain in jobs from insurance companies that would be moving their back office operations to the county, Mr. Vatter said: "No. In Westchester, the cost of housing and labor is too high. And there is congestion on roads like Route 287 to contend with. The insurance companies are setting up their back offices in places like Rensselaer, N.Y., and Wichita, Kan."
Ms. Scanlon said she sees signs of a slow recovery.
"Although the national economy is at a very uneven, rocky and uncertain point," she said, "it is under way. As for the future of the region, encouraging signs are evidenced by a small pickup in employment on Wall Street this summer and international aspects on the region's economy are hopeful.
But Mr. Ravitch said the recession is so deep that it will take years, possibly as many as five, before the economy rights itself. "Sixty million square feet of office space stands vacant in Manhattan, and yet to this day the city of New York projects an increase in asset value when the tax base has actually been decreased. I am staggered by the failure of government to deal with declining revenues in a good way."
Mr. Ravitch said he has cause for optimism. "Judging from the steady flow of new immigrants into the city, New York still offers opportunities to people from all over the world," he said. "Hundreds of them are successfully running small businesses here. And in doing so, they are revitalizing the city and keeping employment as high as it has been. The value of property in Chinatown and parts of Brooklyn and Queens, where the new immigrants have settled, has gone up, generating additional revenues."

HEADLINE: State Officials Draw Fire For Delays On Housing

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
HOUSING advocates across Connecticut say they are dismayed by the dismantling of the state's housing programs. Millions of dollars have been cut from the budgets of programs to develop low-cost housing, effectively gutting them, and some programs have been eliminated entirely. And critics contend that state officials have largely ignored groups that, by statute, are supposed to provide recommendations on housing policy.
A spokeswoman for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Michele Sullivan, said the problem is timing. The Governor has been busy with a budget crisis, she said. But Lisl Standen of Kent, a member of the state's Central Housing Committee for more than 10 years and its chairwoman for 6 years, recently stepped down, saying that the board -- established to advise the State Housing Department, the legislature and the Governor -- has been ignored. 
 State officials "don't want anything to be done," Ms. Standen said. "They have no philosophy, no plan, and they are not interested in developing one." Ms. Standen and others cited not only severe cuts to housing programs but also an apparent lack of interest in housing matters. "If the committee is not being listened to, either by the Governor or the Department of Housing, what's the point?" asked Marvin Farbman, a committee member and head of the Connecticut Legal Services Statewide Housing Unit. "By statute it's supposed to be providing advice on policy matters. But if the thing isn't working for Lisl, there's a problem as far as I'm concerned.
"With her leaving, I'm going to have to see if it makes sense for me to stay."
Margaret P. Reich, executive director of the Windham Regional Planning Agency, said the Governor's office still has not appointed a chairman to the Windham Region Housing Council, despite repeated requests. But under state law, only the chairman, appointed by the Governor, can convene a meeting. The law allows the council to apply for money to cover its secretarial and postage costs, but the request for funds must be approved at a meeting. And without a chairman there can be no meeting.
"So here we sit, without a regional housing council, without the ability to get the money to help us with secretarial costs, and a lot of housing things are happening in the region," Ms. Reich said.
 
'When Things Begin to Settle Down'
 Ms. Sullivan said: "We are currently looking for qualified candidates to fill the positions as soon as possible. But there has been no one chosen yet." The Governor and Housing Commissioner Henry S. Scherer Jr. "are very committed to housing," she said. "But all of state government is in a state of change at this point, and it may be something we have to look at later, when things begin to settle down."
Mr. Scherer, through his spokesman, Christopher Cooper, released a statement that said Ms. Standen's resignation was "a loss to the housing community."
Mr. Cooper said that while the Commissioner did not directly address Ms. Standen's charges that the committee is being frustrated in efforts to advance a housing policy, "from my own perspective, any time there is a change in administration, there is a period of transition."
He continued, "Sometimes, as efforts are under way to make sure the structure and laws and regulations are in the best possible form to facilitate, things can appear to be not moving forward as ambitiously as some people might hope."
Ms. Sullivan said the recent loans approved by the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority for the Ninth Square development in New Haven, which will have a large housing component, is evidence of the Governor's backing for housing, particularly in areas where low-cost housing is a pressing need.
That project, though, seems not to have satisfied many critics of the administration.
"We're still waiting for the administration to define its housing policy," said Jeffrey Freiser, executive director of the Connecticut Housing Coalition, which has 250 members, primarily nonprofit housing-development agencies. "Housing has been dealt a severe blow right from the start of this Governor's term. Housing did not seem to be a priority of the new administration. We were very disappointed, for instance, to see severe budget cuts in the Governor's recommendations for bonding for affordable housing."
The state's allocation to build such housing dropped to $53 million in the current fiscal year from $94 million in the previous year. Another $580,000 for the administrative costs of nonprofit housing agencies was eliminated altogether, Mr. Freiser said.
 
Rent Aid Cut in Half
 "Those groups are the only ones building housing for low-income families right now, and the grants that helped them keep the lights on and the doors open are gone," he said. "I don't know of any that have closed yet. But most of them have cut staff, and are just barely holding on."
A state program to forestall evictions was cut to $550,000 from $1.2 million at a time when unemployment is growing, and more people will need it, Mr. Freiser said, and a program to pay the rent for people in a temporary crisis has been halved, to $1 million.
Ms. Standen said she stepped down from her post reluctantly and after long deliberation. She testified on more than 30 housing bills before the legislature this year, worked with the legislative committees and was active in establishing housing policy, she said, but the executive branch has been moving slowly.
Ms. Standen, appointed by Mr. Weicker's predecessor, William A. O'Neill, said she had agreed in April to stay on after the new Governor's election but resigned last month after months of frustration.
In recent years the commissioner of housing has attended Central Housing Committee meetings, Ms. Standen said. But since Mr. Scherer took over, he has sent his deputy to a couple of meetings, never coming himself.
"It helped the morale of the committee when the Commissioner attended," Ms. Standen said. "People wanted to work because they felt they were appreciated."
Ms. Standen said the Commissioner asked the committee to select a member for a task force on housing but ignored the recommendation and chose his own appointee. He also did not provide any staff to help coordinate the annual housing conference traditionally sponsored by the Department of Housing and planned by the committee, so the conference will not take place.
"I think this committee could really help to ameliorate the affordable-housing shortage in the state," Ms. Standen said. "But it needs the backing of the state. There ought to be public discussion about the policy of the department -- about where they ought to be going."
 
'I Can Still Serve'
 Nancy C. Brown, executive director of the Greenwich Community Development Agency and a 10-year member of the central committee, has also resigned from her seat.
"I'm not as close to the problem as Lisl is, but I certainly sense that the administration has not put things to do with housing at the forefront," Ms. Brown said. "But I can still serve the state, and its housing program, through my other positions. I'm on the board of the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, for instance."
Mr. Freiser, meanwhile, said the coalition of housing agencies has recently been working with Mr. Scherer and is hopeful that there might be progress soon.
"At this point, nine months into the administration, we wish there was more good news to report," Mr. Freiser said. "But we're not ready to give up yet."

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: DR. MARK R. CULLEN;
The Evolution of Occupational Health

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
DR. MARK R. CULLEN, director of the Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine at Yale University, is also the author or co-author of more than 50 articles and editorials on the effects of job-related stress and exposure to asbestos, lead, oil and solvents.
These occupational diseases have received wider attention recently because of the publication of a study by the State Workers Compensation Commission that concluded that between 750 and 1,700 workers in Connecticut died of such diseases in 1988, the most recent year for which data could be compiled. In a recent interview at his office in New Haven, Dr. Cullen discussed occupational health. Here are some excerpts from the conversation. 
 Q. What are occupational diseases?
 A. It's important for people to realize when we talk about occupational diseases, we're not talking about a lot of diseases with strange names. We're talking about lung cancer, dermatitis, asthma, hepatitis, renal failure. We're talking about diseases that already have names, that don't sound occupational related. Lead poisoning sounds like an occupational disease. Asbestosis sounds like an occupational disease.
But most of them don't sound like occupational disease, and there's nothing about the name of the diagnosis that will separate a case of lung cancer in a retired 65-year-old chemical worker from a case in a grandmother who never worked outside the house.
Q. What are two or three of the most serious occupational hazards now in Connecticut?
A. The question is hard to answer, because there are a variety of diseases that are incredibly serious that aren't very common, thank God. We're starting to see the decline of asbestos diseases, or at least as many as we did 10 years ago. We don't see a lot of cases of lead poisoning from industry.
On the other hand, we're starting to see an enormous rise and a whole wave of occupational health problems that, from an economic point of view, may be incredibly important: for example, cumulative trauma disorder, problems caused by repetitive forceful motions at work, and disorders related to indoor air quality, so-called sick-building syndrome.
There's a tremendous risk of disease now in the health-care industry. As the classic industrial diseases start to wane a little bit, we're starting to see a whole new range of illnesses of technology. I think occupational health problems are no less prevalent than they were 10 years ago, but the spectrum of them is beginning to change.
Q. How responsive has the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration been to new trends in occupational medicine?
A. I think you have to understand the history of OSHA. In the late 1960's there were a couple of big mining disasters. You had some increases in the power of labor, and it finally got some national strategy for control of work-related disease. If doctors' textbooks said, in the 1960's, that there was no occupational disease, you couldn't tell that to an auto worker or a machinist or a chemical worker. It was no secret in occupational circles.
So Congress came up with a policing strategy that said, if you use chemical X, Y or Z, or machine X, Y or Z, you're going to have to follow certain rules. It was a tremendously effective strategy, in that over a decade many serious hazards came under control.
If high exposure to chemicals was reduced, you could bet that even though there were some violators, you'd have fewer problems, and you did, much as how, by having lower speed limits, you have fewer car accidents. But you don't get rid of all of it, and there are a lot of reasons for that. There are violators -- people still drink and drive, to use the analogy. Some had to do with the fact the rules were lousy and couldn't change fast enough. And some had to do with the fact the whole strategy was inherently limited, and some occupational health problems would not yield to that strategy.
OSHA has been very effective at doing what it was supposed to do. Could it have been better? Of course, if you tripled its budget and took out some of the political tampering. And without it we'd be dead in the water. But as a single strategy it was doomed to be limited, much as all the traffic rules in the world are not going to stop all fatalities. You need driver education and other strategies, the kind of things we're doing now in occupational health.
Q. Connecticut is moving rapidly toward a service economy. Do service-sector jobs have fewer occupational hazards?
A. Not fewer. Certainly, using the normal measures a public health person would use, morbidity and mortality, they are less serious. You can never meaningfully equate black lung with carpal-tunnel syndrome. Even though the rate of health problems might be comparable, the severity is obviously quite different. As we move to a service economy, the mortality will drop. But I feel like I will, unfortunately, be in business for a long, long time.
Q. How can we say which cancers, for instance, are job related, and not the result of life style, such as smoking?
A. The way we really answer those questions is wearing our public health hat. We don't ask, "Did Mr. Smith get his bladder cancer from his work in the dye manufacturing plant, or did he get it from smoking or from his alcohol consumption?" We know all three of those are risk factors.
What we do is look at the pattern of disease in a dye manufacturing plant and compare it with the incidence of disease in other industries. If people in that industry are dying at a rate three or five or eight times people in other jobs, who drink as much and smoke as much, we can say X percent of those bladder cancers are what we call "excess cases."
Q. With liability lawsuits being brought, is there more of an economic incentive to make the workplace safer?
A. Sure there is. With OSHA, it serves as a reminder to people that if they're making chemicals in 1991 that cause cancer, someday they may have to pay for that. To the extent that our legal system is designed to assign value to certain injuries, you bet it provides an incentive.
Unfortunately, the insurance industry, to some extent, blunts that. By collectivizing risk, insurance reduces the incentive of any individual to reduce their risk. If you didn't have car insurance, you'd drive real carefully.
Q. Is there a risk that some occupational disorders become popular and overdiagnosed?
A. Yes, there are certainly fads in environmental and occupational medicine, as there are in other areas of medicine. Part of it is catch-up from years of neglect. When we first started looking at the problems of repetitive trauma at the shipyard in Groton, the first observations were made by two area orthopedic surgeons who came to us, who had done hundreds of carpal-tunnel surgeries, and the men were not getting better. What was happening was people were going out and getting this surgery but not talking about it.
Now the pendulum swings too far. Now that we know carpal-tunnel strains are common among people who work at keyboards all day long, people are looking at themselves and their threshold for complaint is lower, and the incidence has quintupled in the last three years. There are a lot of people with relatively minor complaints who would never have sought medical treatment before who ask themselves, "Do I have the dreaded carpal-tunnel disorder?"
Relatively minor aches and pains of life are now being glamourized as cumulative-trauma disorders. But that, too, will find its norm. The most important consequence of the attention is people are paying more attention to work conditions, which is great, and people are stopping getting unnecessary surgery. Those two things alone will in the long run save society zillions of dollars.
Q. Speaking of the economics of occupational disorders, has anyone ever calculated what it is costing industry in lost productivity?
A. It's difficult to calculate. For many of these problems, such as chemical allergies or cumulative trauma disorder, there are no deaths to count. If you got the chief executive of a large company with a few drinks and honest, he'd say it's a cost of doing business, some people are going to be sick, and we're going to have an explosion or two. But this is a cost of doing business that may not have been counted on. We have a work force that is nonproductive, or underproductive, to some extent because of environmental factors that could be easily remedied. The usual way is to take the direct medical costs and the time lost from work. Those might be considerable underestimates if people in an office building are working at 30 percent below their potential productivity.
Q. Your clinic recently documented high levels of lead poisoning in workers who are scraping paint off bridges that were painted with lead paint. Given what we know about lead, how could that have happened?
A. There are vast segments of our professional society where you would expect there would be a high level of knowledge. For example, architects you would think would know about building materials and ventilation, but they have historically been taught nothing about the environment. Businessmen historically get no training in the environment. The people who are in decision-making capacities, such as contractors, have no specialized training. Where are they going to get this expertise?
And it is difficult to regulate. You can reduce lead levels in a factory, and draw blood samples to make sure the exposure limits are working. But if you have contractors working on a bridge, you've got guys working five days then go on to another contract, or you've got exposure conditions changing every 10 minutes. You can't have an inspector come in once a year to check on conditions.

HEADLINE: Shore Communities Assess Implications Of L.I. Sound Study

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
UNTIL recently, 1991 looked as if it would be a good year for the Long Island Sound. In August, Hurricane Bob wreaked havoc on land but was seen as a blessing for the 1,300-square-mile estuary. The storm stirred up the normally stratified layers in the narrow body of water, infusing them with oxygen and preventing the algae blooms, fish kills and other problems of previous summers.
But now there are disturbing reports from divers who are discovering lobsters and blue crabs dying on the Sound's floor off the Westchester shoreline. Their findings have scientists wondering whether these recent marine-life deaths are yet another symptom of the severe degradation of water quality in the Sound, or merely a separate and less-serious problem, perhaps just the aftereffects of an unusually long period of warm weather. 
 While marine biologists try to track down the immediate cause of the crustaceans' deaths, national, state and local officials are looking at the long-range picture: trying to understand the implications of a Federally financed study, released in early September, on methods for improving the health of Sound.
 
Nitrogen From Sewage Plants Is Cited
 The report, published by the Long Island Sound Study, identifies five problem areas: low dissolved oxygen, toxic contamination, pathogens, floatable debris and the health of living marine resources.
Initial data from the six-year, $5 million project -- paid for by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency -- indicate that hypoxia, a condition resulting from low levels of dissolved oxygen, is the most pressing problem affecting the estuary and "warrants immediate management action."
The interim management report identifies nitrogen, which enters the Sound from sewage-treatment plants and other sources, as the primary contributor to the low oxygen levels.
Hypoxia, scientists say, occurs when excessive amounts of nitrogen act as fertilizer for algae blooms. As the algae die, sink to the bottom of the Sound and further decompose, oxygen in the lower layers of the water is depleted.
And because the layers of the Sound tend to stratify during the summer months, new oxygen is often unable to reach the colder waters on the bottom. During hypoxic events, free-swimming organisms flee oxygen-depleted waters, while slow-moving crustaceans that live along the floor are unable to migrate and often die.
Using 1990 as a reference point, the Long Island Sound Study's four-member policy committee voted unanimously on Sept. 6 to begin taking steps to cap the amount of nitrogen flowing into the Sound from what it called "point sources," namely sewage-treatment plants.
The policy committee members include Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff, administrator of Environmental Protection Agency's New York Region; Julie Belaga, administrator for the Federal agency's New England office; Timothy Keeney, Commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection, and Robert Bendick, deputy commissioner for New York's Department of Environmental Conservation.
"We don't know yet how much nitrogen has to be removed to get the desired result," said Richard L. Caste, director of water management for the Environmental Protection Agency's New York office. "But for now, we've decided no more increases. Let's not allow the problem to get worse. We have to draw a line somewhere while we figure out how to solve the problem in the long run."
Implementing the recommendations of the Long Island Sound Study report for no net gain in nitrogen could prove costly. It may also mean a state-imposed building moratorium that representatives of the construction industry say will sound the death knell for businesses already debilitated by the current economy.
 
Upgrading to Cost $440 Million
 In Westchester, a nitrogen freeze would entail upgrading four waste-water treatment plants that feed into the Sound, at a cost of $440 million, said Adam J. Zabinsky, director of waste-water treatment for the county.
Of the four sewage plants, only one, the Blind Brook Waste Water Treatment Plant in Rye, is operating below capacity and could handle additional sewage. Although it is not now eliminating nitrogen, the Blind Brook plant could be retrofitted to do so at a cost of less than $200,000, Mr. Zabinsky said. The other plants -- in Mamaroneck, New Rochelle and Port Chester -- would require expensive construction to comply with the Sound study's no-net-gain policy.
"We're hoping for funding from the Federal Government," Mr. Zabinsky said. "But there may be no grant money. If there isn't, we're talking about a mind-boggling number."
If taxpayers in the four sewer districts, which serve Scarsdale, Rye, Larchmont, Mamaroneck, New Rochelle, Port Chester and parts of Harrison and White Plains, have to bear the costs of retrofitting and upgrading, it could mean a 300-fold increase in local sewer district taxes, Mr. Zabinski said.
While County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke agreed with the need to institute measures to clean up the Sound, he questioned why the policy committee did not pass restrictions on other sources of nitrogen entering the estuary, like water from storm drains illegally hooked up to sewer lines and runoff from golf courses that use herbicides.
Also, Mr. O'Rourke said he did not support a building ban, calling it a "Draconian measure."
If a building moratorium is imposed, the construction industry "would effectively be shut down," said Ross J. Pepe, president of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester and Hudson Valley.
"It couldn't come at a worse time," Mr. Pepe said. "The likelihood of our industry pulling out of its current slump is difficult to foresee with this action before us. We have a number of projects on the books ready to go. If a building moratorium goes into effect, we're dead."
 
Port Chester Mayor Opposes Ban
 In the village of Port Chester, Mayor Peter Iasillo predicted that a building ban would "virtually kill the city." Port Chester, he said, is in the process of developing a $250 million waterfront project.
"We need the ratables," Mr. Iasillo said. "A building moratorium isn't the answer. The problems with the Sound already exist. Meanwhile, we need to develop our shoreline."
A different note was sounded in Albany by Philip M. DeGaetano, director of water-quality management for the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
A building moratorium may not be imposed, he said. And the state may be able to provide some money for upgrading waste-water treatment plants through a Federal loan program.
Moreover, retrofitting and upgrading sewage plants may not be as expensive as some claim, Mr. DeGaetano said.
"There is a lot of overreacting going on," he added. "Necessity is the mother of invention. And when push comes to shove, people can get pretty ingenious and find cheaper ways of accomplishing things. We have to find the best mix of solutions."
 
'The Sound Is in a State of Collapse'
 From an environmentalist's point of view, however, a nitrogen freeze would not begin to solve the problems of Long Island Sound.
"These guys live in political la-la land asking for a no net increase when the Sound is in a state of collapse," said Long Island Soundkeeper Terry Backer.
"They're crazy," said Mr. Backer, who is employed by the Soundkeeper Fund, a 1,000-member activist organization based in Norwalk. "How I read it is that they're saying the current state of the Sound is O.K. But it isn't. We've added so many nutrients that we've driven the natural system completely out of balance."
"The symptoms of the Sound's pollution may have been less evident this year, but essentially nothing has changed," Mr. Backer said. "We're still getting cases of dead lobsters."
 
Seeking Cause of Lobsters' Deaths
 Marine biologists from New York's Department of Environmental Conservation and Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection are coordinating efforts to find the cause of death of the lobsters in the western waters of the Sound off Westchester's shoreline.
Mark Blake, marine fisheries biologist for Connecticut, said the dead lobsters were being tested for an infection known as gaffkemia. The rod-shaped bacteria are always present in the water, but lobsters and crabs can become infected if their resistance is down, Mr. Blake said.
"We really don't know why this is happening," he said. "But we're not raising any alarm now because not all of the lobster population is infected."
 
Record Years for Lobster Fishing
 Since the hurricane, there have been no hypoxic events in the Sound, and it is unlikely that the deaths are related to the larger problems of the Sound, especially since 1990 and 1991 were record years for lobster fishing, Mr. Blake said.
"It could be that the Sound got warm very early this year and stayed warm later than usual," he said. "Maybe the lobsters' resistance was down because of the weather. And perhaps there's a more virulent strain of the gaffkemia bacteria out there. Frankly, at this point, we have more questions than answers."
While officials digest the first set of data from the Sound study's interim report, the final Long Island Sound Study report is being prepared and is to be released in November next year. It is expected to include a comprehensive conservation and management plan for the Sound, which has been designated an estuary of national significance under the Federal Clean Water Act.

BYLINE: by Nancy Marx Better

 BODY:
After 25 years in the finance industry -- including a decade as senior vice president of a major bank -- a graying, distinguished-looking New Yorker recently found himself out of work, the victim of a corporate "downsizing." Now he spends his days reading trade periodicals, revising his resume and writing letters to potential employers. He doesn't mind such job-hunting activities, with one exception: making his daily round of phone calls.
"It's awkward to call somebody you've been out of touch with for a long time and explain your situation," said the banker, who asked that he not be identified. "You think, 'maybe I should have called three months ago, when this first happened.' You don't know how to talk about it with former colleagues; you want help, not sympathy." 
 The out-of-work banker is not alone in his reluctance to use the telephone. Career counselors, corporate psychologists and outplacement advisers report a growing epidemic of "telephonophobia," the fear of making tough phone calls in tough times. This particularly strikes executives accustomed to granting favors -- job offers, say, or informational interviews -- rather than asking for them.
"When these people had jobs, everyone returned their calls right away," said Kate Wendleton, director of the Career Center at the New School for Social Research in New York. "Now they may have to make 10 calls before somebody speaks to them. It can be quite discouraging if they don't manage their expectations properly."
Ann Marie Sabath, president of At Ease Inc., a Cincinnati-based executive consulting firm, notes a rising demand for "phonogenic" training. "Many executives haven't learned to handle themselves properly on the phone," she said. "They aren't aware of how to create a good impression, which can make networking calls more difficult."
Executives used to making multimillion-dollar decisions in a snap often contract the worst cases of telephone phobia.
"They can't stand calling their peers to ask for help," said Dick Beston, a senior vice president at Drake Beam Morin, the international outplacement firm based in New York. "They have the best contacts, but they aren't willing to use them. They're the ones who've been victimized as never before by this recession."
Thus, on a late September morning, the unemployed banker gathered with two dozen laid-off executives in Drake Beam Morin's mid-Manhattan offices for a seminar on phone phobia. The leader, Ted Fuller, chief operating officer of Communispond, a New York-based communications consulting firm whose clients include General Motors, American Express and Time-Warner, rattled off the three cures for telephone phobia: The afflicted had to become better speakers, develop a positive attitude and follow a disciplined routine. For high-level executives -- who often come equipped with good speaking skills -- the latter measures are key.
"Many executives can make presentations before hundreds of people, but they can't pick up the phone and ask for a simple favor," he said. "They're used to being in the driver's seat, not the passenger seat."
Indeed, his audience offered a variety of excuses for avoiding calls. One retail executive related a series of attempts to reach a former business associate. "I've left a stack of messages already," he said. "I'm afraid to seem like a pest."
Across the conference table, a marketing executive agreed. He noted that in his previous position, he rarely had time to offer advice to job hunters -- particularly unfamiliar individuals. "I know what it's like to have strangers demanding my time," he said. "I don't want to keep bothering a busy person, especially in this economic climate."
Nonsense, Mr. Fuller said. More and more, he believes, busy executives are making time for job-hunters' calls.
"People are curious about what it's like to be laid off, especially if they're in high-risk places like banks and advertising agencies. They don't want to hear, 'Hey, you could be next,' but they're probably thinking that," he said.
Mr. Fuller instructed the displaced executives to phone at least 10 sources each day, including three new prospects -- all of whom have been previously contacted by letter. Particularly nervous ones can use the "poker-chip strategy," stacking 10 poker chips on one side of the desk and moving them, one by one, to the other side as each new call is made. In advanced cases of phone phobia, executives might chat with a friend first, to relax on the phone.
For many, the biggest worry isn't what to say to a stranger on the phone; it's how to handle his or her secretary. Mr. Fuller suggests making calls from 8:30 to 9:30 A.M. and from 12:30 to 1:30 P.M. "That's when the secretaries aren't blocking their bosses' phones," he said. "There's a better chance you won't hit the screen."
Other communications experts advise different tactics. "Don't try to sneak around the secretary; make her your friend," said Ms. Wendleton. "If you keep calling, sooner or later she'll get her boss out of a meeting to talk to you."
That may be the only way, since Ms. Wendleton warns against leaving a return number. "Tell the secretary you'll be in and out all day, and you'll have to call back. That way you won't feel rejected," she said.
Of course, telephone phobia isn't a one-way street. John Connellan, president of the Executive Technique, a Chicago counseling firm, finds stress at both ends of the wire. "Out-of-work executives may be frustrated at making calls, but think about the people at the other end who receive them," he said. "They can be stuck on the phone for hours. It's hard on them, too."

Help-wanted advertising showed little change in August, the Conference Board said Thursday. The seasonally adjusted index fell to 91 in August, a point below the July reading and 36 points below the figure a year ago. "The public is becoming more nervous about the fragility of the economy in general and about the prospect that their jobs might be in jeopardy," said Ken Goldstein, economist at the business-sponsored research group based in New York.

HEADLINE: 71 Billionaires On Forbes List

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The recession hurt some of America's wealthiest people, but most kept getting richer.
A record 71 billionaires populate Forbes magazine's 10th-annual ranking of the richest, up from 66 last year and up from 13 in the magazine's first ranking in 1982. And the net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans reached $288 billion -- the highest ever recorded by Forbes. The list, released yesterday, appears in the magazine's Oct. 21 issue. 
 Forbes said John Werner Kluge, the founder of the Metromedia Company, is worth more than any other American for the third straight year. At an estimated $5.9 billion, his worth is up $300 million from last year, the magazine said. But William H. Gates 3d, the founder of the Microsoft Corporation, moved up from 16th to second place and is closing the gap. His estimated worth is $4.8 billion, Forbes said.
The recession took its toll on some, mostly in real estate, including Peter S. Kalikow of New York, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and Harold Brown of Boston, who restructured debt after a Chapter 11 filing.
"Since 1989 the economy has slowed -- for blacks, for whites, for rich, for poor," Forbes said in an essay. "The median net worth of the Forbes 400 has stagnated since 1989, not even keeping pace with inflation."
While the inflation rate may be important for a factory worker with a family of four, cost-of-living increases are not as essential for people with a net worth of $275 million -- the bottom on Forbes's list and $15 million more than the lowest ranking last year.

Magazine Publishers Get Some Answers

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAPLES, Fla., Oct. 6

 BODY:
A new marketing survey of consumer attitudes may not solve the problems of dispirited magazine executives, but it will surely cause talk at the annual American Magazine Conference being held here amid the lush mangroves of the Ritz-Carlton hotel.
The report, which will be released on Wednesday, has some striking findings, among them: that readers are less preoccupied with health and fitness; that their idea of status has more to do with being in control of one's life than with having expensive possessions, and that their concern about the environment, which had been intensifying since the mid-1980's, has fallen off somewhat. 
 "People's needs and desires have changed," said Robert S. Shulman, president and chief executive of the marketing and social research firm Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, which conducted the study. "If marketers think all they have to do is turn up the dial on what they were doing in the 80's, they won't succeed."
 
A Profound Change in Attitude
 The report, commissioned by the Magazine Publishers of America, is a spinoff of the Yankelovich Monitor, an annual survey based on two-hour interviews with 2,500 people.
Mr. Shulman ascribes the end of the frenzy of the 1980's and the striking decline in consumer spending not to the recession but to a profound shift in people's values. His interviewers, he said, began to notice this change about five years ago, well before the economy began to decline
And everyone knows that much to their loudly proclaimed dismay, baby boomers are aging. Since they are the largest group in the population, whatever they do sets a trend.
"You naturally think more conservatively as you grow older and you are not in the mode of taking so many risks," said Paul Benjou, president of the media management firm Group One Communications.
Mr. Benjou said that in response to shifting priorities, marketers were becoming more involved in education and in special community projects.
 
Saying Is One Thing
 But as the Yankelovich report points out, what people say and what people do do not necessarily jibe. For instance, interviewees were given a list of "things that people have said worry them about their health and staying fit," and they were asked to say which ones bothered them. Answers seemed to indicate that the health and fitness craze was still in full flower.
The most worrisome concerns, according to the responses, were: maintaining the right weight, listed by 53 percent of the respondents; eating a balanced diet, 43 percent, and watching blood pressure, 30 percent.
When asked, however, whether in the last year they had actually kept to a healthier diet on a regular basis, only 26 percent of the men and 38 percent of the women said yes, down from 35 percent and 45 percent, respectively, for 1990. And asked if when they went out for dinner they ate what they wanted and did not worry about nutrition, 63 percent said yes, up from 59 percent last year.
 
'Tuckered Out' on Health
 "People were once very obsessed about their health, but they have gotten tuckered out," Mr. Shulman said.
As for the question about status, it should be instructive for magazine editors and advertisers alike. In recent years when asked what signaled status in their lives, consumers reported "traveling for pleasure" as the No. 1 status symbol. This year, travel came in fourth, with 52 percent of the respondents saying it was the best way to impress friends. Travel was topped by three new categories offered for the first time this year: "being satisfied with your life," which 63 percent said was the most important; "being able to afford the things that are important," 57 percent, and "being in control of your life," 57 percent.
As for the environment, concern had been found to have grown steadily since 1986, when 16 percent of the respondents expressed interest in it. By 1990, it had become of concern to 29 percent. This year, that figure dropped to 24 percent, its first decline in five years.
Researchers said that because of the intensive media focus on the issue and because so many environmental practices like recycling were actually occurring, people had been lulled into thinking they could relax. Nonetheless, a strong interest was expressed in choosing brands that make an effort to solve environmental problems.
 
Magazine Readers as a Group
 While the report drew on the general Yankelovich Monitor data, it also separated out magazine readers as a group and compared them with the overall respondents. Magazine readers were defined as people who read at least five magazines regularly. On the whole the reader group expressed more interest in shopping and in actively finding new products than the general respondents did, a finding the industry will certainly not fail to point out to its skittish advertisers.
The sample had a margin of error of 1.3 percent to 2.2 percent, depending on how many people answered the particular question.
At least one of the survey's findings should cheer magazine executives. Deep in the hearts of all publishers and advertisers is a yearning to view the world as a happy place where people leaf eagerly through magazines and rush out to buy the products they read about. Asked to describe their state of mind, only 9 percent of the regular magazine readers checked "not too happy," while 55 percent answered "pretty happy," and a whopping 36 percent "very happy."

HEADLINE: Lending When Bankers Won't

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Earlier this year, John Donovan, chairman of BMI Inc., a Summit, N.J., importer and distributor of door parts for buildings, needed to find a lender. Security Pacific Bank of Los Angeles, which had been his banker for six years, "made it clear that they did not want our business," he said, "not because of our creditworthiness but because they were cutting back on lots of companies our size."
Mr. Donovan, whose company has annual sales of about $10 million, tried the local New Jersey banks. But "they were so involved with the regulators," he said, "that they did not want to hear from me" unless he made a deposit equal to the credit line. 
 Snubbed by the banks, Mr. Donovan found the credit he wanted at MTB Banking Corporation, a New York-based financial company that makes loans but is not a traditional bank, since its deposits are not insured and it lacks direct access to a system for clearing checks and electronic money transfers.
 
Lower Rates Have Not Helped
 Stories like Mr. Donovan's are increasingly common, according to officials at commercial finance companies.
Although Washington policy makers are trying to encourage responsible lending to help stimulate the economy, the cutback in bank loans is widely cited as a cause of the recession and the anemic recovery. The Federal Reserve Board's moves to bring down interest rates have helped lower the prime lending rate to 8 percent, down from 10.5 percent at the beginning of 1990, but have not stimulated more lending by banks.
While bankers say they are not making loans because demand is low, commercial finance executives report unusually strong demand from business borrowers, despite the fact that the finance companies generally charge higher interest rates and fees than banks.
From the beginning of 1990 to the end of July this year, loans by finance companies to business increased by $41.2 billion, or 15.9 percent, to $300.2 billion. During the same period, business loans by American banks fell by $31.9 billion, or 6.2 percent, to $480.6 billion, according to Federal Reserve data.
The increase by finance companies "would have been even greater, except that some of the commercial finance firms owned by bank holding companies were instructed to keep volume down" said Leonard Machlis, executive director of the National Commercial Finance Association in New York.
Anthony K. Brown, a managing director of the Trading Alliance Corporation in New York, a commercial finance company, said, "There are lots of companies out there that have a solid business, but do not have the track record that satisfies banks." And, he added, "without financing, those companies have a hard time growing to a point where they will ever qualify for bank loans."
Mr. Brown, who founded Trading Alliance in 1988 along with two other former bankers from the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said that many large banks "have not learned the new rules of commerce, where it is the buyers and sellers of products who need credit."
Manufacturing companies, with whom the banks traditionally were most familiar, are often located overseas these days or in another part of the country far removed from the bank's local market, Mr. Brown said. But banks, he said, still seem uncomfortable lending money to the middlemen who increasingly are becoming their potential customers for loans.
For example, David Engel, president of Trendsellers Ltd., of Stamford, Conn., obtained orders from major merchants including Wal-Mart Stores and Caldor for backpacks and bags he wanted to import from China. But Mr. Engel found that no bank would provide the letters of credit he needed to pay the Chinese manufacturer. And since the goods had not yet been shipped to the department store buyers, there was no account receivable to offer as collateral for a loan.
But Trading Alliance recognized that the purchase orders from major discount stores were valuable, and provided Trendsellers with the letter of credit needed to import the goods. To protect itself from loss, Trading Alliance is overseeing the shipment of the goods, which it would seize if Mr. Engel's deal fell apart.
For their part, bankers attribute the decline in loans to weak demand from borrowers. "Our credit standards have not changed, and I still want to make as many loans as possible," said Frank Lourenso, an executive vice president at Chemical Bank who is in charge of lending to small and medium-sized businesses.
 "What has changed from a few years ago," he said, "is the condition of our customers and the economy, not our lending standards." Stepping up the level of bank loans in a weak economy, Mr. Lourenso said, is difficult because businesses cut back on inventories and borrowing.
Because most of Chemical's loans to businesses are unsecured, which means that they are not backed by assets like inventory or accounts receivable, Mr. Lourenso noted that there is always room for commercial finance companies to gain business by making secured loans to companies whose financial condition has weakened, but that are willing to put up collateral and pay the high rates charged by nonbank lenders.
As lawmakers wonder why the economy is not recovering more speedily, they have not been satisfied by bankers' claims of weak loan demand. Instead, they have preferred to criticize banking regulators for imposing tougher capital standards and for encouraging bank examiners to be more zealous in identifying bad loans and forcing banks to recognize the losses that result from those loans.
 
Choosing to Be Smaller <HE
Regulators' demands that banks strengthen their financial condition have caused some banks to scale back on new lending in order to become smaller. In that way, a bank's capital cushion for absorbing unanticipated losses is a larger percentage of its remaining loans.
Fearing a major pullback in bank lending, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in May that the time was not right for the Fed to push for increases in the minimum capital requirements imposed on banks. But his comments have not lessened the drive at many banks to improve their capital cushions. Even though all but a few of the nation's large banks already meet the minimum capital requirements set for the end of 1992, bankers know that they must have more than the minumum capital if they want permission to make acquisitions and enter new businesses.
 
Banks Under More Scrutiny
 Regulators say that examiners are merely following good business practice. Recognizing bad loans, even if doing so results in a loss to the bank, is a way of insuring that banks do not continue making unsound loans.
"The banks have a lot more people looking over their shoulder than commercial finance companies, so we can be more liberal in the type of transactions we do compared to the banks," said Howard Krollfeifer Jr., a senior vice president at the A.T.& T. Commercial Finance Corporation, a Morristown, N.J., unit of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
A recently published study by the New York Federal Reserve Bank concluded that the leading cause of the drop in bank lending to business last year was the heavy losses some banks suffered from their commercial real estate lending, followed by weak capital.
The sharpest declines in business lending, the study found, occurred at banks with the most exposure to bad real estate loans and with the weakest capital. Those two problems were especially powerful forces for cutting back lending in the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states, where the economy has been weakest, the study said.
Frederic Tordella, president of MTB Banking, noted that as banks tried to improve profits by cutting expenses, they had helped newcomers to the lending business quickly gain expertise. In laying off experienced loan officers, banks have "made the job of finding quality people in the lending field a piece of cake," he said of his company, a dealer in precious metals and foreign currency, which became active in the finance business about three years ago.
Mr. Tordella said the availability of experienced lending officers is one reason, Mr. Tordella said, that MTB, which has $26 million of capital and can lend up to $2 million to a single borrower, is putting more emphasis on its corporate finance business and less on other activities like gold trading and electronic funds transfers overseas.

HEADLINE: A Split Over Machine Tool Imports

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
For decades, machine tools have been regarded as a mundane but crucial industry, often figuring in American military and trade politics. They are the behind-the-scenes workhorses of an industrial economy, used for cutting, grinding and boring all sorts of products, including armaments.
In both World Wars, machine tools were officially earmarked for hurry-up production, regarded as vital to wartime mobilization. And in the 1980's, the decline of the domestic machine tool industry was seen as a symbol of both the plight of American manufacturing and Japan's export offensive. 
 Today, the industry is once again at the center of a debate that touches on the larger issues of trade policy and national security. The Bush Administration must soon decide whether to push to extend a five-year-old program of restraints on imported machine tools. And it promises to be a tough choice this time because of the growing complexity of global trade patterns and the recent changes in the geopolitics of national security.
 
Renewal Is Uncertain
 The Commerce Department is expected to make a recommendation within days on whether to renew the five-year program of restraints, which expires at the end of this year. The department's recommendation -- expected to be a call for renewal -- will then be reviewed by the Administration after consulting with other agencies, including the Defense Department and the United States trade representative's office. The outcome of that review is by no means certain, according to Administration officials.
The advocates and opponents of import restrictions no longer line up in neat camps. A handful of America's most competitive machine tool makers, for example, want the protections for domestic producers dismantled because they have had the curious effect of protecting Japanese market share and driving up the costs for many American producers.
One problem with the complex system of import curbs, they note, is that it defines an American machine by how much of the rudimentary cast-iron components are American-made but ignores the computer controls, which represent more and more of the cost of a modern machine tool. The largest supplier of such controls is a Japanese company, Fanuc Ltd.
So the free-traders say that those who favor restraints are taking a backward-looking "Maginot Line" approach to international competition. "The people who want to maintain the restraints are trying to fight a war that is already over," said Brian McLaughlin, president of Hurco Companies, an Indianapolis machine tool producer. "Protectionism doesn't work. The only way to revive this industry is to focus on research and development, to develop leading-edge technology and to compete globally."
For their part, the Japanese, who were the main targets of the curbs, are officially silent on the matter but would be happy to see the restraints renewed. The so-called voluntary restraint agreement serves to freeze Japan's large share of the American market, while restricting the advance of up-and-coming rivals like Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.
 
A Different World
 National security calculations today are also far different than when the Reagan Administration prodded Japan and Taiwan into the voluntary restraint agreement in 1986. Back then, the United States reasoned that it should not depend on foreigners for machine tools to make parts for missiles and bombs.
But those were still the "evil empire" days, when the Soviet military threat meant just that and before the Berlin wall had been torn down. "All these national security arguments have been deflated enormously because of recent events," said Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Most companies in the machine-tool industry and 200 members of Congress eager to protect jobs back home insist that the national security argument still holds. "National security is pre-eminent to commerce," said James Mack, the vice president for government relations at the Association for Manufacturing Technology, the industry's trade group.
The pure free-traders, Mr. Mack said, "want this country to be the Blanche DuBois of international trade politics -- always dependent on the kindness of strangers," in a reference to the faded Southern belle of Tennessee Williams's "A Streetcar Named Desire."
The restraint agreement allowed the Japanese producers to hold more than 50 percent of crucial machine tool markets like computerized lathes and machining centers, while warning other countries that they would be slapped with penalties if they rushed to increase their sales in the United States. The Taiwanese were pressured to join the agreement, partly to make it seem that the Japanese alone were not being punished.
Opponents of renewal argue that the restraint pact has increased their costs by forcing them to buy more expensive domestic-made components, irritated overseas buyers and had the "perverse" effect of protecting the Japanese producers since their share of the market was calculated when the yen was cheap and imports at a peak.
Yet the experience at Hurco, based in Indianapolis, shows the costs of the voluntary restraint agreement on one high-technology machine-tool maker. With sales of about $100 million a year, Hurco is a company that revived in the late-1980's by investing in research on computer controls and software, increasing productivity and moving aggressively into foreign markets. More than half of its sales are now overseas, including East Asia.
At Hurco, Mr. McLaughlin estimated that the restraint agreement had forced his company to increase its cost of making a machine tool by more than 10 percent. He said the company it was forced to buy more expensive components domestically, like the cast-iron base and housings on machine tools, instead of buying less expensive ones from Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. The additional cost in one of the cheaper $70,000 machines would be roughly $7,000, according to Mr. McLaughlin.
Hurco was also forced to invest $6 million in new patterns and in establishing new sources of supply for machined cast-iron parts so they could qualify as American machines under the restraint accord. That money, Mr. McLaughlin said, would have otherwise been invested in research on the computer controls and software that are Hurco's competitive forte.
The import restraints brand the United States as protectionist and thus can make selling overseas more difficult for American companies, according to Ray Blakeman, the chairman of the Met-Coil Systems Corporation, a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, company that has a joint venture in Japan and a sales office in Taiwan.
Mr. Blakeman, a former president of the machine tool trade association, wrote to its board in August to protest the group's support for an extension of the agreement. "We are riding a mule that is crippled and should be out to pasture," he wrote.
 
Plea for More Time
 Yet the proponents of continuing the import curbs say the agreement has safeguarded the domestic industry, allowing it to increase investment. An extension of three to five years, they add, would give the domestic industry the time it needs to regain competitiveness. The industry's revenues have increased slightly since 1986 to an estimated $2.9 billion this year, while employment has declined more than 8,000 people, to 60,150.
At K. T. Swasey, a machine tool maker in Milwaukee, Winthrop Cody says the import curbs helped give his company the breathing space it needed to invest heavily in computer-aided design equipment and training for engineers. He estimated that the productivity of his operations increased 25 percent in the last four years.
Without the import curbs, "countries like Japan and Taiwan would take even more of our market because they will cut prices to gain market share regardless of the cost," said Mr. Cody, president of Swasey, which is a subsidiary of the Cross & Trecker Corporation.
Economists and trade experts have generally scorned the use of voluntary restraint agreements in industries including autos, specialty steel, textiles and ball bearings as costly to consumers and of little genuine help to the protected industries. At best, the curbs may temporarily slow the shrinkage of a domestic industry and encourage foreign producers to set up factories in the protected country to sidestep the barriers. Indeed, the Japanese machine tool companies including Mazak, Okuma, Toyoda and Amada now have plants in the United States.
The real hope for the future of the American machine tool makers, some experts say, is to increase their competitiveness in their basic businesses and band together to develop new computer-controls technology to leapfrog the Japanese and other rivals.
A few such joint research efforts are under way. For example, a next-generation controller program, supported by $20 million from companies, the Air Force and the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, a research consortium in Ann Arbor, Mich., was begun in 1988. "That effort could have a monumental impact on American manufacturing," said Ed Miller, president of the center. "But it's not going to have an effect today or tomorrow."

Hurco's estimates of higher costs caused by import curbs.
* The cost of producing a finished machine tool increased more than 10 percent beause of a requirement to buy more expensive American-made cast-iron components.
* To meet the requirements of the voluntary restraint agreements. Hurco had to invest $6 million on new patterns for its machines and new sources for cast-iron components. Hurco says the money could have been used for research on advanced computer controls.
* Hurco lost a $3 million sale to company in Taiwan in 1989 because, the Taiwanese company told Hurco, it would not buy from an American company because of Washington's protectionist barriers to Taiwanese machine tools. (pg. D4)

New Focus On Decline Of Inflation

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
In fretful economic times, people often talk as if the only thing standing between the United States economy and permanent stagnation is the Federal Reserve's next move to trim short-term interest rates. But now, some economists contend, declines in inflation and long-term interest rates may be even more powerful stimulants for growth.
Lower long-term rates reduce the debt burdens of businesses and consumers, making it easier for families to buy homes and allowing companies to invest more in new technology. 
 "Nothing would be more helpful to the sub-par economic recovery than a sizable reduction in long rates," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns, the New York investment firm. And nothing, he might have added, would make a reduction in long-term rates more likely than solid prospects for lower inflation.
 
Expectations a Key
 Unlike short-term rates, over which the Fed exercises some control, long-term rates rise and fall with investors' expectations of future inflation and future demand for credit.
True, long-term rates can follow short-term rates lower when the Fed eases credit, if only because investors in short-term securities seek higher yields in longer-term maturities. But the extent to which long-term rates actually decline greatly depends on the confidence of savers in the soundness of their money. If people expect inflation to remain low, they are more likely to invest for the long term, helping to push down long-term rates.
The good news, reflected in the current bond rally, is that the United States, which used to have some of the highest long-term interest rates of any industrial country, is now on the low end of the spectrum.
 
Closing the Gap
 American rates on 10-year Government bonds -- the usual global yardstick, since many countries do not issue 30-year bonds -- have recently been just over 7 percent, compared with more than 8 percent in Germany and more than 9 percent in Britain.
Although Japan still has lower rates, at around 6 percent, the gap between Japanese and American rates has narrowed from more than 400 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, a few years ago.
This welcome decrease in the cost of capital mostly reflects the fact that the United States, once the most notable high-inflation country among the industrial powers, has joined the low-inflation crowd. So far in 1991, the Consumer Price Index has risen at a 2.5 percent annual rate, compared with 4 percent in Germany and around 3.5 percent in Japan.
Granted, a break from lower energy and food prices has pushed this year's actual inflation rate below the long-term trend. Nonetheless, a number of Fed officials, as well as many private forecasters, think the long-term rate is between 3 and 4 percent, compared with 4.5 percent in the five years leading up to the recession.
The Blue Chip consensus of 50 economists, compiled by Robert Eggert in Sedona, Ariz., which has been trimming its price forecast for a few months, sees 3.7 percent inflation in 1992. That, incidentally, is just about where the American public feels comfortable. According to a recent report by the Federal Reserve bank of San Francisco analyzing public attitudes toward inflation, Americans are intolerant of inflation when it exceeds 4 percent. New Zealanders, in contrast, grew disturbed when the rate reached 30 percent.
So far, there are plenty of signs, in addition to the slow money growth of the last four years, that suggest that inflation could remain subdued.
An index of leading inflation indicators from the Columbia University Center for International Business Cycle Research ticked up in September, but is running about 10 points below its level of two years ago.
 
Gains in Productivity
 And labor costs remain under control. The restructuring of some service industries, as well as the slow pace of overall hiring, suggest decent gains in productivity and muted pressure to raise wages.
In particular, points out Maury Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., government workers are no longer getting the higher-than-average pay raises typical of the last few years, because of state and local fiscal crises.
Actual price trends have also been encouraging. Inflation in services, far more persistent than in goods, has lately moderated in everything from rents and other housing costs to medical services.
And, as the bond rally itself suggests, inflation expectations seem on the whole to be improving. Commodity prices remain weak. And in a sign that executives do not see much inflation ahead, business appears to be determined to operate with ever-leaner inventories.
A drop in inflation in the first year or so of a recovery, it turns out, is the rule, not the exception. Even after the relatively short and shallow recession of 1969-70, which the recent downturn probably resembles most closely, inflation declined by about 1 percentage point during the recovery. Indeed, lower inflation, which reduces costs and lifts business profits and consumers' purchasing power, is one of the forces that help the economy to recover.
Should prices really stay well behaved, long-term rates could stay below 8 percent even if the economy is growing at, say, a rate of 2.5 to 3.5 percent next year. Mr. Harris said the spread between inflation and long-term rates was averaging about 400 basis points until the recession.
Besides, if investors gradually come to believe that the Fed really means what it has been saying about near-zero inflation, even that spread, which reflects the risk that inflation might be higher than expected, could narrow slowly.
In all, experts are beginning to conclude, America's improving track record on inflation may now be more important to future economic growth -- and to the bond rally -- than whether the Fed eases credit another quarter point this week.

HEADLINE: American Says Lebanon Captors Predict 'Good News'

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Terry A. Anderson, the American journalist held hostage in Lebanon since 1985, said yesterday in a videotaped interview broadcast by the Cable News Network that he had been told by his captors that "we can expect some very good news" soon.
Mr. Anderson, the Middle East bureau chief for The Associated Press, said his captors had not told him what the news would be. "I can only hope, of course, that it means some more people would be released on both sides," he said. 
 "We weren't told whether it would be me or Tom or Terry or someone else," he added, referring to the American Thomas M. Sutherland and the Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, with whom he said he had been confined. "But I don't think that is terribly important at this moment, which one of us goes free."
Mr. Anderson, who is 43 years old, said he had no information on any of the other Western hostages in Lebanon.
CNN said said it had obtained the 12-minute videotape, made yesterday "in the Beirut area," from an independent Lebanese television production company, Al-Mashrek. The network said that it had submitted questions to be asked of Mr. Anderson, but that not all of them had been used and some had been reworded. CNN said it had not paid for the tape.
The network also showed what it said was a statement in Arabic signed by Islamic Holy War, one of the Shiite Muslim groups holding Western hostages in Lebanon. CNN said the statement characterized the tape as a continuation of the process that started with the release of John McCarthy of Britain in August. The statement said the tape was a way of "showing our hostages stating their opinions, which serves practical steps to bring an end to the hostage case," The AP reported.
Mr. Anderson, the longest-held Western hostage, called on all parties to hasten efforts to free the nine Western hostages in Lebanon in a wide release of prisoners held in the Middle East. All captives should be freed, he said, not just Westerners but also hundreds of Lebanese detainees held by Israel.
His captors may have allowed the tape to be made in part to increase pressure on Israel to release more of the prisoners it holds in southern Lebanon. Israel demands the return or an adequate accounting of Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon.
 
U.N. Chief Praised
 Mr. Anderson, wearing a brown shirt and aviator glasses, said efforts by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations to secure the release of hostages in the Middle East "are enormously helpful."
"I can say," he added, "I think it is an absolute necessity that everyone involved in this process on both sides simply cooperate, that this is no longer the time for bargaining, that this is no longer the time for anyone to try to get some small advantage out of each step that might be coming to fruit here."
CNN delayed showing the full interview for several hours while it transcribed Mr. Anderson's words to provide subtitles across the bottom of the screen, since the audio track was poor.
 
Hears Daughter on Radio
 The network said Mr. Anderson told his unseen interviewer that he reads magazines -- he mentioned Time, Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report and The Economist -- and listens to radio broadcasts from the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corporation. With apparent pride, he said he had heard a radio interview with his daughter Sulome, who is now 6 and whom he has never seen.
Mr. Sutherland also heard his daughter Kit on a radio program, Mr. Anderson said. "He was amazed and impressed and didn't stop talking about it for a considerable amount of time," Mr. Anderson said.
"We have little bit of television," he added, "although most of it's inadequate. Of course, the English movies are rare."
He said his captors had treated him "with respect," adding, "We're treated as well as can be expected under these circumstances."
"Our guards do the best to make things easier on us," he said. "They give us the things we need. We get medicines when we need them."
He said he, Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Waite played chess every day.
"We talk about everything," he said. "Politics, religion. That's really been our saving, having people to talk to." He also said the food he is given was "not bad."
From parts of the interview that CNN carried early last night, it was not clear whether Mr. Anderson's captors watched from behind the camera as he was being questioned.
At one point he thanked his friends and family for "keeping the issue alive and not letting it come to a halt." Speaking to "friends and colleagues," he said: "We are grateful you haven't forgotten us. Keep up the good work."
