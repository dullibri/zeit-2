HIGHLIGHT: Argentina&#8217;s proposed tax amnesty only rewards cheats. 

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES - A person who cheats on taxes in Argentina is often described as vivo, or clever. There's a certain admiration for those who break the rules: It isn't difficult to see why when those who follow them often look like fools.
This was made clear again earlier this month, when President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's economic team unveiled a tax amnesty plan to legalize undeclared foreign currency, whether stored in offshore tax havens or under the mattress, without imposing any penalties. So much for the pledge by Kirchner's late husband and predecessor Néstor to jail tax evaders. 
Tax amnesties are nothing new in Argentina: If this one passes - and it almost certainly will - it will be the fourthsince the return of democracy in 1983 and the second under Mrs. Kirchner. But its timing has raised eyebrows, partly because of money-laundering allegations involving businessmen close to the president who have become extraordinarily wealthy during her administration.
The latest amnesty also seems to be a tacit admission that what Kirchner billed last year as a "cultural battle" against the dollar - a plan to get Argentines to start thinking in pesos and severely curtail the purchase of foreign currency - has failed. Desperate for dollars, the government no longer seems to care where it gets them: Ethical concerns come second to boosting the Central Bank's reserves, now at a six-year low.
Under the proposed amnesty, there are two options for legalizing cash. One is by exchanging undeclared dollars for a certificate of deposit from the Central Bank; this can then be used to buy real estate or construction-related goods. The other way is to buy a new three-year bond the government is likely to use to help fund YPF, the oil company that Argentina seized last year from Spain's Repsol.
The government hopes to get its hands on some of the $200 billion that Argentines are said to hold in undeclared cash, some $40 billion inside the country. Roberto Feletti, a lawmaker and formerly Kirchner's deputy economy minister, estimated that some $5 billion could be legalized this way.
But how many people will take the bait? Agreeing to bring money out of the shadows means trusting the government even as the amnesty exposes its desperation. It also seems to be an invitation for the taxman to look at your finances more closely, particularly since the government says it will investigate the origin of funds.
Another problem is that the measure amounts to yet another short-term fix for problems of the government's own making. It does nothing to resolve the fundamental economic issues that have discouraged investment, like high inflation, unsustainable spending and an overvalued peso.
Meanwhile, it leaves the vast majority of Argentines holding the short end of the stick, having to pay an ever-higher proportion of their income in taxes due to inflation. The same government that treats someone who takes out hundreds of dollars out of an ATM abroad as a criminal is offering to look the other way when it stands to gain billions.
The opposition senator Carlos Reutemann invoked a popular saying this week during the Senate debate over the amnesty: "El vivo vive del zonzo y el zonzo de su trabajo." The clever person lives off the dumb one, and the dumb one off his work.
The government's message couldn't be clearer: Evade and you will be rewarded.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: An Early Apple Computer for More Than $100,000

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Apple-1 computers, built in Steve Jobs&#8217;s family garage, have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent auctions, a run-up reflecting the company&#8217;s mystique, Steve Lohr reports in The New York Times. 

 BODY:
The astronomical run-up in the price of the original Apple-1 machines - made in 1976 and priced at $666.66 (about $2,700 in current dollars) - is a story of the economics of scarcity and techno-fetishism, magnified by the mystique surrounding Apple and its founders, as the company has become one of the largest, most profitable corporations in the world, Steve Lohr reportsin The New York Times. 
In November, an Apple-1, also commonly known as the Apple I, sold for $640,000 at an auction in Germany. That sale surpassed the previous record of $374,500 set only five months earlier at Sotheby's in New York. The next test of the Apple-1 market will come on Saturday, at the same auction house in Cologne, Germany, where the record sale took place in November.
Even the auctioneer, Uwe Breker, expressed some surprise at the price reached last fall. For this week's auction, the reserve price - the minimum sale price - is $116,000, and Mr. Breker conservatively estimated the likely range of $260,000 to $400,000. "But we will see," he said.
The auction market for the vintage machines, experts say, is thin and uncertain. For example, a nonworking Apple-1 failed to attract its reserve price of just over $75,000 at an auction last year in London. The record-setting auctions last year were of working originals, as is the Apple-1 going under the gavel on Saturday.
The sky-high prices suggest irrational exuberance. But technology historians say there is a rational appeal to possessing an Apple-1. "It is Apple's creation story, the physical artifact that traces this incredible success to its origins," said Dag Spicer, a senior curator at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Redefining the Fight

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
President Obama outlined his plan on Thursday to transition away from the continuous, global state of war that has gripped the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, describing a more targeted counterterrorism effort that would involve limiting his war power and reigniting the debate over how to fight terrorism, Peter Baker reports.
 

        
Under the counterterrorism blueprint the president described Thursday, the Central Intelligence Agency's duties would shift away from paramilitary work and to more traditional spying and analysis - a transition some experts say could take a while, Mark Mazzetti reports.

        
Refusing to resign from her position as head of the Internal Revenue Service's division on tax-exempt organizations, Lois Lerner was put on administrative leave on Thursday after invoking the Fifth Amendment and declining to testify before a House committee investigating the I.R.S., Jonathan Weisman reports.

        
The Senate confirmed Mr. Obama's nominee for a long-empty seat on an important appeals court on Thursday, but tensions mounted over a sluggish confirmation process portending tough times for other nominees, Jeremy W. Peters reports.

        
With the July 1 deadline looming to avoid a doubling of student loan interest rates, the House passed a bill on Thursday basing rates on market trends and cutting off federal subsidies. Unpopular with Democrats, the move is sure to lead to the next Congressional showdown, Jonathan Weisman reports.
Washington Happenings:

        
Mr. Obama will travel to Annapolis, Md., on Friday to give the commencement address at the United States Naval Academy, as he did in 2009. Later, he will sign a bill posthumously honoring the four girls killed in a Birmingham, Ala., church bombing in 1963 with a single Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor Congress can bestow.

HEADLINE: Obama and Christie to Reunite on Jersey Shore

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, will reprise their pre-election tour of the coastal areas ravaged by Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, a White House official said Friday morning. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - President Obama and Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, will reprise their pre-election tour of the coastal areas ravaged by Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, a White House official said Friday morning. 
"The president will speak about the importance of reigniting and expanding economic opportunity for middle-class families who were hard hit by the storm, and meet with businesses and homeowners who have benefited from the recovery efforts," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the trip has not been officially announced.
Just days before the 2012 presidential election in November, Mr. Christie and Mr. Obama, a Democrat, produced dramatic, bipartisan images of cooperation as they walked together along New Jersey's coast, surveying the damage and talking to displaced residents.
Mr. Christie was criticized at the time for his effusive praise of Mr. Obama by some Republicans who feared it would give the president a last-minute boost in his re-election campaign over Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts.
But Mr. Christie, who has at times been an outspoken critic of the president, waved aside the talk, saying that responding to natural disasters requires leaders to put aside their differences. He heaped praise on Mr. Obama for responding quickly and forcefully to help New Jersey in the storm's aftermath.
"If you think right now I give a damn about presidential politics, then you don't know me," Mr. Christie told reporters in the immediate aftermath of the powerful storm.

A replay of the side-by-side imagery of the two men will no doubt rekindle some of the same criticism, especially for Mr. Christie, who faces re-election next year and could also be contemplating a bid for the presidency in 2016.
Mr. Christie has carefully honed his image as a tough-talking conservative whose blunt language appeals to many in his party. But New Jersey is also a heavily Democratic state that typically demands that its leaders find a way to work across the aisle. Being seen again with the president could help.
But the challenge for Mr. Christie is to stoke his bipartisan appeal without undermining his appeal to conservative voters who hold the key to the Republican presidential nomination, which will begin in earnest in less than three years.
In the past, Mr. Christie has done that by carefully picking his moments to deliver harsh assessment's of the president's performance.
At a rally in Richmond, Va., last fall, during the last few weeks of the presidential campaign, Mr. Christie lashed out at Mr. Obama, saying the president had never learned how to lead anything, having served as a community organizer, state legislator and one-term United States senator.
"He's like a man wandering around a dark room, hands up against the wall, clutching for the light switch of leadership, and he just can't find it," Mr. Christie said at the rally just days before Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast.
That rhetoric was gone a few days later, replaced by praise for the president's effort.

HEADLINE: Some Borrowers Need More Equity to Sell Homes

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Rates of &#8220;underwater&#8221; homeowners continue to fall, an analysis finds, but higher equity may still be necessary to sell a home. 

 BODY:
The number of homeowners who owe more on their mortgage than their house is worth continues to drop, but many borrowers still haven't regained enough equity to afford to move, a new analysis finds. 
About a quarter of all homeowners remain "underwater," owing more than their home's value,according to a first-quarter negative-equity report from the real estate site Zillow. That's down from nearly 28 percent at the end of last year.
Zillow predicts the rate will fall to 23.5 percent by the first quarter of 2014, which will lift another 1.4 million homeowners into positive equity territory.
But for now, another 18 percent of homeowners with mortgages, while technically above water, still don't have enough equity to make a move, bringing the current "effective" negative-equity rate to nearly 44 percent, Zillow says.
Technically, a homeowner reaches positive equity when the market value of the home exceeds the remaining loan balance. But listing a home for sale, and buying a new one, generally requires equity of 20 percent or more to comfortably meet related costs, like sales commissions and a down payment on a new home.
Such homeowners probably can't afford a down payment, locking them into their current homes and helping to keep the inventory of homes for sale tight.
Without enough equity, such costs have to come out of a homeowner's pocket, leaving many stuck, said Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist. "You might not be underwater, but can you go out in the market and transact?" he said.
The "effective" negative-equity rate helps explain why healthy declines in the number of underwater borrowers haven't yet translated into more homes for sale, he said.
The only cure, he said, is time. As rising home values continue to build equity, they will eventually get to the point where more homeowners can realistically sell.
Of the 30 largest metropolitan areas that Zillow tracks, those with the highest "effective" negative-equity rates - including homeowners with 20 percent equity or less - include Las Vegas, 72 percent; Atlanta, 64 percent; and Riverside, Calif., 60 percent.
Zillow's negative-equity report looks at current outstanding loan amounts for owner-occupied homes, and compares them to those homes' current estimated values. Loan data is provided from TransUnion, one of the three major credit-reporting bureaus. (Other reports estimate current loan balances based on the most recent loan on a property.)
Is a lack of equity holding you back from selling your home?

HEADLINE: What Conservative Reformers Don't Like About Immigration Reform

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Limited-government egalitarianism and the case against the Senate immigration bill. 

 BODY:
As a kind of companion piece to my post earlier this week on mass immigration and liberalism's dilemmas, I thought I'd say something about a Matt Yglesias piece from a few weeks ago, in which he expressed a certain amount of bafflement at both liberals and conservatives who worry about immigration's impact on the fortunes of low-wage-earning Americans:
Liberals care not just about the size of the economic pie, but also its distribution. And it's perfectly appropriate to put greater weight on the economic needs of poor people than rich people. But in the low-skilled immigration calculus the poorest people-the immigrants-are the ones who receive the largest benefit. To the extent that you have more immigrants you have both a stronger moral case for redistribution to low-income natives (greater objective needs) and a stronger practical case for redistribution to low-income natives (greater fiscal capacity) but the idea of avoiding a small harm to poor people by inflicting a much-larger harm on substantially poorer people makes very little sense to me. 
... The conservative view of this manages to be even more puzzling, since in all other contexts conservatives strongly favor policy measures that increase the marginal return to capital and vehemently reject consideration of the distributional implications of such measures. Class war is a great evil to be avoided at all cost except in a case where the interests of the American working class can be putatively advanced by punishing the third world poor.
Reihan Salam had a lengthy response to this at the time; let me attempt a (slightly) shorter one. What Yglesias calls "the conservative view" here is not, as he well knows, the view of everyone on the right, and it isn't a coincidence that it's least likely to be shared by those conservatives who most fit his "up with marginal returns, don't worry about distributional implications" description: The Wall Street Journal editorial page, much of the Republican Party's donor class, many libertarian wonks, etc.
The current immigration bill's various right-of-centerskeptics, on the other hand, are often pundits who do write and worry, not necessarily about inequality per se, but about issues like wage stagnation, declining labor force participation rates, and weakening upward mobility from the bottom. (It's not a coincidence that their ranks include several of the liberal commentariat's favorite "reasonable conservatives.") It's just that, being conservatives, they - we - also worry about the growth of government and the permanent clientalization of the poor, and therefore we don't particularly like the logic of Yglesias's first paragraph, in which any problems created by mass immigration are to be solved through the simple expedient of higher taxes and increased government spending. (From a purely practical perspective, we also tend to doubt that it can be easily executed absent the kind of social solidarity that mass immigration often tends to undercut.)
What immigration reform's conservative skeptics would prefer, rather than a society that welcomes as many immigrants as want to come and also expands the welfare state apace, is a society that maintains America's historical balance between (at least relatively) limited government and (at least relatively) egalitarian arrangements of wealth, property and opportunity. If you don't care about the first issue, then it makes sense to be an open-borders liberal; if you don't care about the second, then it makes sense to be an open-borders conservative. But if you think that both matter, and that America's historical balance between liberty and opportunity is a precious and fragile historical achievement, then it isn't really much of a puzzle why you might favor admitting new Americans - especially those whose existing skill sets are a poor fit with the economy that we seem to be moving toward - at a somewhat slower pace (and in a somewhat different mix) than the Senate legislation contemplates.
And note that "somewhat slower pace." Nobody with any kind of significant megaphone or clout is arguing for policies that would return the United States to the immigrant-native balance that we had in the 1950s, and 1960s. If we do nothing but continue on our current course, the proportion of first-generation immigrants in the U.S. population will soon reach its highest point in nearly a century and then keep going up from there, and the proportion of first and second-generation immigrants will reach a historic high within a generation. What's up for debate right now is not whether the United States should welcome millions of immigrants and their children; it's just whether, given the state of the American experiment at the moment, it makes sense to welcome and try to assimilate low-skilled immigrants at an even faster rate. And I don't think it should be surprising that those of us seeking the (yes, perhaps chimerical) goal of a limited-government egalitarianism would be skeptical of the wisdom of that course.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Diplomatic Crash Pad for $11.59 Million

BYLINE: ROBIN FINN


HIGHLIGHT: A 3,600-square-foot, three-bedroom unit in the Dakota had been used by the Portuguese government. 

 BODY:
In further fallout from Portugal's fiscal meltdown, a grand and gracious apartment at the revered Dakota that had been used for four decades by that nation's dignitaries as its Upper West Side diplomatic crash pad and entertainment hub sold - down to the penny - for $11,593,237.50 and was the most expensive sale of week, according to city records. 
The eight-room residence at 1 West 72nd Street, No. 74, was listed for sale at $14.5 million last year and was reduced to $12.95 million in September. The monthly maintenance fee of $9,511 no doubt proved unsustainable to a government in the midst of fashioning a $107 billion bailout courtesy of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

The 3,600-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms, three baths and a powder room, along with three wood-burning fireplaces and the Dakota's typical complement of 12-foot ceilings, 10-foot-tall ash-and-mahogany doors, and elaborate mahogany woodwork and plaster moldings throughout. The 27-foot corner living room has Central Park views and a planting balcony, while the 24-foot dining room faces south; the bedrooms are all sequestered on a north wing. Pocket doors lead from the entrance gallery to a paneled library with a fireplace.
John Burger and Guida De Carvalhosa of Brown Harris Stevens represented the seller via its consulate general at 590 Fifth Avenue. The buyers are David Folkerts-Landau, the chief economist of the Deutsche Bank Group, and his wife, Maie Folkerts; their broker was Jason Haber of Rubicon Property.
Mr. Haber said the buyers, who live in London, intended to "make a museum-quality restoration."
 Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: A Freddie Mac Rule Change May Help Some Borrowers

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Baby boomers and other home buyers with limited incomes but substantial financial assets could qualify for low-rate conventional mortgages. 

 BODY:
A change in Freddie Mac's rules could help retiring baby boomers, and other home buyers with limited incomes but substantial financial assets, qualify for low-rate conventional mortgages. 
Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage finance company, actually changed the rule two years ago. But many borrowers and loan underwriters are apparently unaware of it, according to a blog post on the company's Web site.
Why would someone near or in retirement want to take on a mortgage? They may want to refinance an existing loan at a lower rate. Or, they may want to sell and downsize to a smaller property. The slow housing market and depressed home values have made that difficult for some, until recently.
Now, the housing market is improving, values are rebounding, and interest rates are still relatively low. Those improvements, plus the more expansive income eligibility criteria, may help more people move into new loans, said Brad German, a spokesman for Freddie Mac.
"Perhaps someone was waiting for home prices to come back so they could sell their home and responsibly combine part of the sale proceeds with a mortgage to buy a smaller home or a retirement home," he said in an e-mail.
The change allows lenders to take into account a significant portion of a borrower's financial assets when determining if their income qualifies them for a Freddie Mac mortgage. (Freddie Mac doesn't make loans directly; rather, it buys them and pools them for sale to investors, and guarantees them against default.)
For instance, under the new guidelines, a portion of assets like individual retirement accounts (I.R.A.'s) and 401(k)s can count toward a borrower's income eligibility.
The assets must be in a fully vested retirement account recognized by the Internal Revenue Service, and they can't be subject to a withdrawal penalty. (The change doesn't apply to accounts that are already being tapped, since that means they've already been taken into account in the borrower's income.)
To determine eligibility, the lender adds up the eligible assets; multiplies the total by 70 percent; and subtracts the funds needed to complete the transaction, like down payments, closing costs and escrows. Then, the remaining amount is divided by 360 months, and counted toward the borrower's monthly income.
Say you had an I.R.A. worth $100,000 and a down payment of $20,000, leaving $80,000 in assets to be used to determine your income for qualifying purposes. Seventy percent of $80,000 leaves $56,000, which is divided by 360 months, leaving roughly $155 a month added to your income.
The assets are separate from dividends, interest payments, trust distributions and Social Security payments, which have long been eligible for consideration when calculating a borrower's qualifying income.
The new requirements are "a potentially big deal" for many prospective home buyers, including the "rapidly growing" population of retirees and near-retirees who would like to buy or refinance a home, Freddie Mac says.
"We want to make sure people know about this option," Mr. German said.
Would this rule change help you obtain a mortgage?

HEADLINE: Why Did Citigroup Try to Overturn an Overhaul?

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Citigroup&#8217;s direct involvement in shaping a House bill suggests it feels that it should work behind the scenes to shape legislation for its benefit. Fears about its bottom line may have been what stirred it. 

 BODY:
Wall Street's true ambitions are often revealed in mind-numbing minutiae.
The latest example is Citigroup's participation in writing a House of Representatives bill that intends to roll back an arcane part of the Dodd-Frank financial sector overhaul. As The New York Times reportedon Friday, Citigroup's recommendations were reflected in more than 70 lines of the House committee's 85-line bill. 
The bank's involvement was something of a surprise. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Citigroup has not been a vocal critic of efforts to make the financial system stronger. It supported parts of the overhaul. Citigroup's reluctance to publicly press for changes may also be due to the fact that it received more bailout money than other banks, and performed poorly for a long time after the crisis. 
So what stirred Citigroup to get deeply involved in crafting the House bill? 
The proposed legislation attempts to soften a part of the Dodd-Frank Act that focuses on the market for derivatives, which are financial instruments that allow financial firms to hedge their risks or speculate. Banks make a lot of money from these instruments, entering into trades with other banks, investment funds and corporations. Even the most commonly traded derivatives, like interest-rate swaps, have much higher profitability than other Wall Street activities, according to bank disclosures. 
But the financial crisis revealed the enormous risks in the derivatives market. Derivatives allow financial firms to make big bets without having to put up sufficient money at the outset. The most chilling example of this during the crisis was American International Group, which placed staggering wagers on mortgages that it ultimately could not honor without taxpayer help. Dodd-Frank does a lot to remove such weaknesses. 
But the law also attempts to reduce a big perk that the derivatives market has enjoyed for years, and will for the foreseeable future. Most banks locate essentially all their derivatives inside subsidiaries that enjoy indirect taxpayer backing, either through deposit insurance or access to emergency lending from the Federal Reserve. The banks' trading partners like this arrangement because they get to deal with taxpayer-backed entities. 
If the clients had to do the same derivatives trade with a bank subsidiary that didn't have government support, they might ask for much better terms, reducing the profits for the bank. The perceived problem with this setup is that a whole range of derivatives activities, some of it speculative and risky, is effectively subsidized. 
Some writers of Dodd-Frank wanted certain types of derivatives to be "pushed out" of the bank entities that enjoy government backing. But even then there was strong opposition to such a move. 
The result was a pallid push-out. When Dodd-Frank became law, only a few types of derivatives had to be moved out of insured subsidiaries. All existing derivatives, no matter what they were, were allowed to stay inside the safety net. And regulators have effectively told banks they don't have to comply with the push-out until the middle of 2015. 
Even so, Dodd-Frank was reviled on Wall Street, and the new House bill would almost completely neuter it. 
The bill would allow the few types of derivatives that are slated for the push-out to remain inside taxpayer-supported entities. For instance, derivatives for betting on stocks and commodities would get to remain in the safety net. 
The one derivative that the House bill does push out are swaps on securities that are backed with a basket of assets, like mortgages, but even these would be allowed inside taxpayer-protected entities if they met certain conditions. 
Those favoring the House bill make arguments that will resonate with regulators. 
The push-out rule, they say, could shift derivatives trading into unregulated entities. It could also make it harder for the Federal Reserve to support the financial system during a crisis, since it couldn't lend to entities that deal in the pushed-out swaps. 
Such arguments are blunted by the fact that Dodd-Frank pushes out only a few types of derivatives. But those derivatives may be among the most profitable for banks. 
Take credit default swaps, which allow financial firms to bet on the creditworthiness of companies, countries and mortgages. The House bill significantly softens the treatment of such derivatives. Under Dodd-Frank, a bank would have to push out credit default swaps that don't trade through a clearinghouse, an entity set up to make sure market participants have the money to back their trades. The new bill effectively allows these "uncleared" swaps to stay inside government-insured banks. 
These swaps are likely to have attractive margins that would be depleted if they were pushed out. Uncleared instruments are a big part of the credit default swap market. Only about 10 percent of such swaps are centrally cleared, according to official surveys. 
Citigroup has a huge presence in this market. With some $3 trillion of exposure, the bank is one of biggest default swap dealers in the United States. Those swaps right now live inside an entity called Citibank N.A. that enjoys federal deposit insurance. Nearly $2 trillion of those swaps are based on companies or other entities with a junk credit rating. 
As it stands, the Dodd-Frank Act would push many of those swaps out. 
Perhaps that's why a Citigroup employee is writing legislation that would stop just that.

HEADLINE: This Is Not 2009

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
With the scent of scandal encircling the White House, some Republicans are already licking their chops over the 2014 midterm elections, while some Democrats are pre-emptively licking their wounds.
Not so fast, folks. Retract those tongues.
While it is impossible to predict what might drive voter attitudes in an election 18 months away, there are quite a few signs that 2014 will be nothing like 2010, which produced tremendous success for Republicans.
First, the electorate is less conservative. 
In May 2009, the Tea Party had just begun to flex its muscle and feel its power on a national level. Now, the movement has lost momentum.
An April 2012 Associated Press report included a finding from Theda Skocpol, a Harvard professor, that the number of Tea Party groups had fallen from about 1,000 to about 600. And a Washington Post/ABC News poll released this week found that the portion of people saying they strongly support the Tea Party, just 10 percent, was the lowest they had recorded since 2011.
Furthermore, according to a Gallup poll released Friday, the shares of Americans describing themselves as economic conservatives and social conservatives are down by more than a tenth since 2009, after having risen sharply following Barack Obama's election a year earlier.
The portion of Republicans who said their position on economic issues was conservative -- the Republican Trojan Horse for a retrograde social agenda -- has seen little movement since 2009, dropping just five percentage points, from 75 percent to 70 percent.
(On the other hand, the share of Democrats who describe their positions on social issues as liberal has increased, from 45 percent to 50 percent.)
Speaking of economic issues, the economy is experiencing a resurgence, at least in some quarters.
In May 2009, the United States economy was nearing the end of the Great Recession. The unemployment rate had risen to 9.4 percent from 5.5 percent the previous year. People were losing their homes to foreclosures in record numbers. The Dow Jones industrial average had fallen to about 8,500 from more than 13,000 the previous May. And the deficit tripled from the 2008 fiscal year to the 2009 fiscal year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
This had Americans rightfully worried and near-panicked about their economic prospects.
Now the economic picture couldn't be more different.
The unemployment rate has dropped to 7.5 percent. The Dow is above 15,000 and continuing to set records. The housing sector is rebounding -- ''Sales of previously owned homes reached the highest level in more than three years, with the share of foreclosure purchases shrinking, as the housing market continued its rebound last month,'' according to a report Thursday in The Wall Street Journal.
And the deficit is shrinking faster than expected, according to a report released last week by the budget office. The report found that if current laws are unchanged, ''Relative to the size of the economy, the deficit this year -- at 4.0 percent of gross domestic product (G.D.P.) -- will be less than half as large as the shortfall in 2009, which was 10.1 percent of G.D.P.''
This takes almost all of the air out of the Republicans' economic argument.
Lastly, legislative unease has become about what Republicans haven't done, rather than what Democrats have done.
By May of 2009, President Obama had already signed the huge -- though many still believe not huge enough -- stimulus package, Chrysler and General Motors were in need of a bailout and the ball was rolling on the president's historic health care law.
Conservatives were railing against what they saw as an unprecedented, ominous and ultimately ruinous expansion of government, driven by the president and made possible by a Congress controlled by Democrats.
Now, the tables have turned. Two of the most glaring legislative failures this year have ostensibly been the work of obstinate Republicans: the failure to avoid the sequester and the failure to pass expanded gun background checks legislation. According to that recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, most Americans still disapprove of the sequester's automatic spending cuts, and according to a Pew Research Center poll released Thursday, 81 percent of Americans still favor the passage of a bill expanding background checks.
The next hurdle will be immigration reform. But Republicans may find a way to derail that legislation, too.
The signs look positive for Democrats this spring. This is not to say that they should prematurely lift their glasses, only that they have no reason to prematurely throw up their hands.

HEADLINE: In Collapse Of Bridge, Vulnerability Is Highlighted

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; John Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MOUNT VERNON, Wash. -- The partial collapse here on Thursday night of a heavily used river bridge on Interstate 5 caused no deaths, but as the long holiday weekend began it underscored the vulnerability of a transportation system that hinges not just on high-profile water crossings and tunnels, but on thousands of ordinary and unremarked components that travelers mostly take for granted.
A 160-foot section of the 58-year-old four-lane steel truss bridge, which crosses the Skagit River about an hour north of Seattle, crumpled around 7 p.m., apparently after being struck by a truck carrying an oversize load, state officials said. Three people were injured, none of them seriously, when vehicles went into the river. 
But the ripple effects of the collapse could be huge -- for commuters, freight haulers, residents and businesses around the bridge on detour routes and for politicians in Olympia, Washington's capital. Lawmakers have been loudly and publicly wrestling over the hundreds of millions of dollars in state money needed to replace another aging bridge over the Columbia River that separates Oregon and Washington farther south on the Interstate 5 corridor.
Interstate 5 is the main north-south route from British Columbia to California, passing through both Seattle and Portland. Washington State's Department of Transportation has established detour routes through the cities of Burlington and Mount Vernon, which are separated by the Skagit River, but urged travelers to avoid the area if they can. More than 67,000 drivers cross the Skagit every day along that stretch of the Interstate, according to the state.
''Patience is going to be the watchword,'' said Gov. Jay Inslee at a news conference here. Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said that state transportation officials were scouring the country looking for a temporary, portable structure that might be brought in to span the river until the collapsed section can be replaced. But even if that happens, he said, the disruptions could last for weeks, at the least.
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board also arrived Friday to begin an inquiry into the accident's causes. The chairwoman, Deborah A. M. Hersman, said an early priority was to interview witnesses, especially the driver of the vehicle carrying the load that struck the bridge.
Whether it should be considered reassuring or alarming about the state of the nation's infrastructure, the Skagit River bridge had not been judged unsafe or structurally deficient, according to inspection records. The bridge and its approach lanes, totaling just over 1,100 feet, were only considered to be past their useful life span, meaning that the time had arrived for a bigger, broader structure. But even calling a bridge structurally deficient does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe, as federal officials often point out; it only means that at least one major component has deteriorated, and actions may be taken to address the issue, like restricting traffic to ensure that the bridge is not stressed beyond its limits.
''Obviously, this is a bridge that has lived a very long life,'' Ms. Hersman said. But, she added, based on performance and inspection records, ''It has been healthy throughout that life.''
Mr. Inslee said in an interview that a broader message of the collapse is that state financing for state transportation projects -- now under consideration in a special session of the Legislature -- can no longer wait, especially for the long-delayed Columbia River project.
''It shouldn't take an oversize load to let us know we have an oversized problem,'' he said.
Washington State faces a deadline this year to find money for the $3.2 billion project over the Columbia River, or risk losing up to $1.2 billion in federal financing. Oregon's Legislature has approved $450 million, but Washington State's $450 million share has been stalled. About $1 billion would come from tolls.
Building America's Future, an advocacy group founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and two former governors, Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, also issued a statement characterizing the bridge collapse as a ''call to action.''
''Regardless of how this happened, the collapse of the Skagit River Bridge in Washington State is a timely reminder of our nation's need to invest in critical infrastructure upgrades,'' Mr. Rendell said. ''Our nation's bridges, roads and highways are deteriorating before our eyes.''
But Washington's secretary of transportation, Lynn Peterson, said it was clear that money would remain tight. The bridge was constructed of four 160-foot sections, three of which could be restored to use pending inspection, she said.
''Under current fiscal constraints, there is no intent at this point to rebuild the entire bridge,'' she said.
The fact that a portion of a high-use highway could suddenly fall and fail without serious casualties was hailed by political leaders and residents as near miraculous. It also allowed immediate discussion of economic impacts, by Mr. Inslee and others, in ways that might have otherwise seemed crass or callous.
Mr. Inslee, in particular, urged people to support the small businesses in the area that he said could find themselves in trouble, with customers unwilling or unable to breach the creeping train of detoured vehicles.

HEADLINE: Budget Dispute Deepens a Rift Within G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans are locked in a widening internal dispute over future budget negotiations, splitting along generational and ideological lines on the party's approach to the central issue that drove the conservative surge in the Obama era: how to deal with the federal debt.
In full view of C-Span cameras trained on the floor this week, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine jousted with a new generation of conservatives -- Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky -- over the party's refusal to allow the Senate to open budget talks with the House despite Senate Republicans' long call for Democrats to produce a budget. 
It was the Old Guard versus the Tea Party, but with real ramifications, as Congress careens toward another debt limit and spending crisis this fall with seemingly no one at the steering wheel. The newer members say negotiations should go forward only with a binding precondition that a budget deal cannot raise the government's statutory borrowing limit.
''I have tremendous respect for this institution,'' Mr. Rubio said in an interview on Friday. ''But I'm not all that interested in the way things have always been done around here.''
Republicans made the failure of Senate Democrats to pass a budget a central talking point in the 2012 campaign, going so far this year as to pass legislation withholding Congressional pay if budgets were not approved this spring. Now, some Republicans say the fact that members of their own party are standing in the way of a House-Senate conference committee undermines their fiscal message.
''This to me is an issue of integrity,'' said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. ''We've pressed for a budget. We ought to go to conference.''
But the budget hawks have not budged, and they have even taken aim at their party in strikingly critical language.
''Here is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side of the aisle,'' Mr. Cruz said of his fellow Republicans. ''There are some who would very much like to cast a symbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow our friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt ceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome.''
Mr. McCain called the demands of his Republican colleagues ''absolutely out of line and unprecedented.'' The Senate passed the budget before dawn on March 23 after a grueling all-night session, he noted, saying it was time to try to reach a final deal with the House in a negotiating conference.
''Will this deliberative body, whether it is the greatest in the world or the worst in the world, go ahead and decide on this issue, so we can at least tell the American people we are going to do what we haven't done for four years and what every family in America sooner or later has to do -- and that is to have a budget?'' he asked. Although few of Mr. McCain's colleagues took to the floor to join him, many have expressed similar views.
Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Republican leadership, said that at this point, resistance had to give.
''I suspect senators have held back long enough on the decision to go to conference,'' he said.
Republicans who have made the deficit their central ideological focus are, in some sense, the dog that caught the bus. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated this month that the deficit for this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, will fall to about $642 billion, or 4 percent of the nation's annual economic output, less than half the 2011 deficit and about $200 billion lower than the agency had estimated three months ago.
The agency forecast that the deficit, which topped 10 percent of the gross domestic product in 2009, could shrink to as little as 2.1 percent of the G.D.P. by 2015, a level most analysts say would be easily sustainable over the long run.
And a conservative stamp is hitting the government, thanks to the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. On Friday, 115,000 employees at the Internal Revenue Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Housing and Urban Development and the small Office of Management and Budget -- 5 percent of the federal work force -- stayed home on unpaid furlough.
House Republicans had envisioned a plan to reach a comprehensive deficit reduction deal predicated on a showdown in July over the debt ceiling. That showdown was supposed to drive both sides back to the bargaining table, but a rapidly falling deficit, rising tax payments and huge infusions of cash from the newly profitable, federally controlled home financing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have scrambled those plans. Now, the debt ceiling may not have to be raised until October or November, in the next fiscal year.
Before then, unless a budget deal can be struck, Congress must pass bills to finance the government based on very different guidelines in the House- and Senate-passed plans. The House Appropriations Committee will have to draft a bill financing labor, health and education programs at $121.8 billion, a 19 percent cut from current levels even after the across-the-board cuts took effect. The bill to finance the Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency cannot exceed $24.2 billion, down 15 percent from the current levels after the cuts.
''There is not a member of our committee, Republican or Democrat, who is happy with these numbers,'' said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the committee.
The Senate has no intention of swallowing those cuts, so unless budget negotiators can meet and reach a deal, Congress will be headed back toward a crisis come Sept. 30, said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the Senate Budget Committee chairwoman.
''They could create crisis by having a government shutdown or holding everything back until November and threatening a debt default. That would be to their political detriment,'' Ms. Murray said. ''I think the American people have had it with that kind of hostage-taking.''
But Mr. Rubio said that he was not about to give in, and that a single senator might have the power to hold back negotiations indefinitely. ''I'm not sure this is an issue I can ever change my opinion on,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Measured by S.&P. Returns, Obama Is on a Short List

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
IN the 84 years that the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has been calculated, it doubled during the terms of only four presidents before Barack Obama's election in 2008. This month that number rose to five as the index climbed to more than twice what it was when he took office.
Through Friday, more than 52 months after he took office, the index was up 105 percent during his term in office, for a compound annual gain of 18 percent. 
There is, of course, more than a little good fortune in that statistic. Mr. Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, in the middle of a credit crisis that had caused prices to plunge and would cause them to keep falling for a few more weeks. It helps to start from a very low level. It also helps to have a central bank that drove short-term interest rates to zero, a step that both increased corporate profits and made bonds less attractive investments.
In fact, the United States stock market fell from record high levels this week, and world markets quavered, in part because of comments made by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, that the Fed might be able to begin to back off from its aggressive monetary stance later this year.
Even with this week's dip, however, the United States market has done better since early 2009 than any of the next nine largest economies in the world, as can be seen in the accompanying charts. Those charts reflect MSCI indexes, based in dollars, in each country except the United States, where the S.& P. 500 is used.
The United States market lagged many others early in the recovery. But as its economy kept growing, albeit slowly, and European economies faltered and worries grew that emerging economies might experience slower growth, the American market overtook the others.
Of the next nine -- ranked on the size of the economies in 2009, only India's market came close to the performance of the United States market since early 2009. Like the Chinese and Brazilian markets, it excelled early on but is now well below the peak it hit in 2011.
If you put your dollars into the Italian or Spanish stock markets when Mr. Obama took office, your shares would now be worth less than you paid for them. Over all, the world's stock markets outside the United States have risen less than two-thirds as much as the American one has.
The Wall Street performance has not made Mr. Obama particularly popular among financiers. Indeed, some of the language about the president's perceived support of socialism and hostility to capitalism during last year's campaign was the harshest seen in any campaign since 1936, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was seeking a second term and was strongly opposed by many financiers.
By the time Mr. Roosevelt died in 1945, the S.& P. 500 was 141 percent higher than it had been when he took office. But he was in office so long that the annual rate of gain was only 7.5 percent, less than half of the rate so far for the Obama administration.
The other presidents whose term in office included a doubling in the S.& P. were Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Each served two full terms, and none came close to the average annual gain so far under Mr. Obama. Mr. Clinton's 15.2 percent was the highest of that group. He had the good fortune to enter office when markets were relatively low and to leave just as the technology stock bubble was starting to collapse.
There is, of course, no guarantee that a market that rises will endure. Mr. Roosevelt's record would be better if he had left after one term in office; the market was lower when he died in 1945 than it had been when he took the oath of office in 1937 for his second term.
And the president with the best stock market record in the 20th century -- using the Dow Jones industrial average, whose history is longer than that of the S.& P. -- is Calvin Coolidge. The Dow rose 256 percent -- an annual rate of 25.5 percent -- from his inauguration in 1923 until he left office in early 1929. The market went up an additional 20 percent before the crash. But by the end of 1931 all of the Coolidge gains had been lost.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Under Obama, Stocks Do Better: President Obama this month became the fifth president to have the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index double from the level when he took office. Through Thursday, more than 52 months since he was inaugurated, the index was up 105 percent, or a compound annual rate of 18%. The latter figure is the highest for any president during the period during which the index has been calculated. Eight of the 10 economic sectors measured by S. & P. have done better, on an annualized basis, under Mr. Obama than under either of his two immediate predecessors. Since Mr. Obama took office, the United States stock market has performed better than markets in the next nine largest economies in the world.

HEADLINE: Tuition Protesters Still in Top Office At Cooper Union

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
As embattled encampments go, the president's office at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art is not exactly Zuccotti Park in the fall of 2011. Rather than a warren of improvised shelters with a loud drum circle, the gracious office has open views through seven arched windows, and the only percussion comes from the tapping of laptop keys.
On May 8, students moved in to protest the school's decision to charge undergraduate tuition for the first time in 150 years. Since that day, their perch atop Greenwich Village has become an Occupy Wall Street in miniature. A steady stream of students has passed through the office -- some staying for just a few hours, others for nearly the whole time -- to spread word about the rebellion, posting various satires and subversions to the Web, searching for a better solution to Cooper's financial crisis, eating catered meals and entertaining visits from well-known activists. 
The school's initial response was forceful: students were told they had an hour to vacate or face dire consequences. Bathrooms and water fountains were bolted and boarded up; armed guards were positioned throughout the building; fire exits were blocked. But within minutes, students said, 100 or so supporters made their way past the guards and into the office, where they locked arms in solidarity. A stack of pizzas somehow materialized, and soon the water fountains, bathrooms and fire exits were liberated.
Since then, the college has taken the opposite approach, essentially allowing students to come and go at will, a liberty that has allowed them to take their exams, shower and even get a comfortable night's sleep, always leaving behind a group of at least 15 or so to hold down the fort. Cooper's president himself, Jamshed Bharucha, paid a visit after people attending his presentation in the building's Great Hall goaded him into addressing the occupiers directly. Everyone talked until well after midnight, then he left and they stayed.
A few security guards are on hand, but they are unarmed, and in some cases no older than the occupiers; some have even taken to wearing ''Free edu'' T-shirts under their uniforms. So inside-out is the situation that supporters of the administration have resorted to the favored medium of grass-roots protests: a petition on change.org. ''Vacate the office immediately,'' it commands. ''The occupation of the school has created a poisonous and dangerous atmosphere that can potentially destroy the school forever.''
(As of Friday evening, around 500 people had signed, whereas a petition calling for the president and the board president to step down has attracted more than 2,000.)
Dr. Bharucha has been operating a government in exile from his home and other offices, doing what he can with e-mail and cellphones. ''They have a tremendous amount of passion for Cooper,'' he said diplomatically, ''so this reflects a very understandable expression of their passion and frustration.'' As for how long he was prepared to wait the students out, he said only, ''We're taking it one day at a time.''
Armed with a sense of righteous purpose -- and a Nintendo Wii for good measure -- a rotating cast of students has been debating strategy. (From a list of possible future actions: ''sculpture storage,'' ''get Jamshed another job,'' ''What if we all legally change our names to Jamshed Bharucha?'') They have been keeping the office exceptionally clean. And they have been getting their message out on virtually every known social media platform. The Free Cooper Union Facebook page now has more ''likes'' than the official Cooper Union page. On Wednesday night, they protesters held an online chat with incoming freshmen to let them know about recent events. (Tuition, on a sliding scale expected to top out around $20,000, will not be charged to anyone enrolled by this fall.)
''In a lot of ways we have become the P.R. team for the school,'' said Joe Riley, a fourth-year art student, nibbling on some trail mix.
An earlier occupation of the Peter Cooper Suite, in the same building, by 11 students last December, lasted a week and ended of its own accord. As for the conditions under which the current occupation might end, the students have no single answer. One student mentioned Dr. Bharucha's departure, another mentioned more voice for students in the running of the school. Some envisioned a different structure of governance altogether. Casey Gollan, a graduating art student, suggested, ''Maybe we don't need a president at all -- and boom!''
Whatever happens, they have been making the most of the moment. Alumni and supporters sign up online to cover all the occupiers' meals. Thai one day, Indian another; last week, someone sent platters of sushi. ''I've eaten better these past two weeks than I did the two weeks previous,'' one student said.
They set up red lights to illuminate the exterior of the office every night at sunset, and a tumblr page of people counting down to that moment. They put together an online photo gallery of the books on Dr. Bharucha's shelves (they got a chuckle out of ''Profiting from Education,'' though it is actually about Japanese-American joint ventures) and another gallery, called ''Jam's Head,'' of people holding pictures of Dr. Bharucha up in front of their own. They plan to open a free school and salon to coincide with next week's collegewide end-of-year show.
Commencement is scheduled for Wednesday. Mr. Gollan, who has been reading the book ''Can Jokes Bring Down Governments?,'' hinted that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's keynote speech might not be the only highlight. ''I would not be surprised if there were crazy plans for commencement,'' he said, ''and if I somehow got involved.''

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Rose 3.3 Percent in April

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rebounded in April, buoyed by greater demand for aircraft and stronger business investment. The gains suggest economic growth may be holding steady this spring. 
Orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, rose 3.3 percent last month from March, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That followed a 5.9 percent decline in March.
A measure of business investment plans increased 1.2 percent, and the government revised the March figure to show a 0.9 percent gain, instead of a slight decrease.
Companies ordered more machinery and electronic products last month, typically signs of confidence. More spending by businesses could ease fears that manufacturing could drag on the economy later this year.
Factories had been counting fewer orders at the start of the year, in part because slower global growth had reduced demand for exports. Economists had also worried that across-the-board federal spending cuts and higher taxes might prompt businesses to cut back on orders.
Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics, said the April report suggested that economic growth was holding up. He predicts growth in the April-June quarter will be at a rate of 2 to 2.5 percent, close to the 2.5 percent rate reported for the January-March quarter.
Still, the payoff from the pickup in business investment may not come until the end of the quarter, because the government looks at shipments when it measures the gross domestic product, not orders.
In addition, shipments of goods that signal investment plans fell in April, reflecting weaker demand at the start of the year.
''Business investment appears to have started the second quarter on a weak note but should rebound over the final two months of the quarter,'' Mr. Ashworth said.
The April increase pushed total orders to $222.6 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis, or 6.5 percent above the level of a year ago.
Orders for transportation goods gained 8.1 percent, reflecting a 16.1 percent jump in demand for commercial aircraft and a 53.3 percent increase in orders for military aircraft. Orders for motor vehicles increased 1.9 percent.
Excluding the volatile transportation category, orders rose 1.3 percent in April. That followed a 1.7 percent decline in March.
Still, other reports showed that factories continued to struggle in April.
The Institute for Supply Management reported that factory activity barely expanded in April, held back by weaker hiring and less company stockpiling.
And manufacturing output dropped 0.4 percent last month, the Federal Reserve reported this month. Auto companies produced fewer cars, factories made fewer consumer goods and most other industries reduced output.
The overall economy grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the January-March quarter, buoyed by the fastest rise in consumer spending in more than two years.

HEADLINE: Asian Tensions and the Problem of History

BYLINE: By JONATHAN TEPPERMAN

 BODY:
The political turmoil currently roiling Northeast Asia -- a region that should otherwise be basking in success right now -- can often seem bewildering to outsiders. One key to understanding, however, can be found in a surprising location: a single recent photograph.
On May 12, a journalist snapped a picture of Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, grinning from the cockpit of a fighter jet. Such politician photo-ops are neither unusual nor controversial in the West, where the worst thing they tend to provoke is eye-rolling (think of Michael Dukakis looking like Snoopy in a tank during his failed race for the presidency in 1988, or George W. Bush's landing on an aircraft carrier in May 2003, and beaming under a banner declaring that the war in Iraq was a ''Mission Accomplished'').
Not so in Asia, at least not these days: no sooner had the photograph of Abe appeared than howls of anger erupted across China, and one of South Korea's largest newspapers, Chosun Ilbo, excoriated him for his ''never ending provocations.'' 
One might have expected a picture of Japan's leader atop military hardware to have raised a few eyebrows in the region -- after all, his country is still officially pacifist. But few casual observers would have predicted just how much fury it produced, or the particular detail that sparked it. It turns out that the real outrage wasn't Abe's jet itself, but the marking on its side: the number 731. By unhappy coincidence, 731 also happens to have been the number of an infamous Imperial Japanese Army unit that conducted hideous chemical weapons experiments on live victims in Manchuria some 70 years ago.
That the gaffe -- seen as a deliberate insult by many Chinese and South Koreans but almost certainly an accident -- would trigger such furious condemnation speaks volumes about the explosive role history continues to play in Asia today, and helps explain why the region seems on the brink of not one but several conflicts.
To grasp history's power for disruption, consider first everything Northeast Asia has going for it. In many ways things could scarcely be better at the moment, and the region's powers should have strong motivation not to let anything rock the boat. After all, while most of the world struggles with the Great Recession, China, despite having just weathered a delicate leadership transition, is still humming. (Yes, the latest growth figures show some softening, but not the hard landing that many analysts feared.) South Korea, meanwhile, just democratically elected a strong, pro-American president, and the country's growth rate just hit a two-year high.
And then there's Japan, which, under Abe's unexpectedly able stewardship, has shrugged off nearly two decades of decline and is suddenly on a tear. Despite the market turbulence this week, the Nikkei stock index has been hitting five-year highs, Sony has just posted its first profit since 2007, and Japanese consumers are finally buying again.
Sure, North Korea has tried to complicate the political picture, but even Kim Jong-un's belligerence has proved more a blessing than a curse, since his temper tantrums only underscore the need for his neighbors to work together.
Yet, despite the many reasons to cooperate, those Asian neighbors aren't doing so -- at least on the strategic side, where things are about as bad as anyone can remember. Beijing and Tokyo are locked in an escalating squabble over the control of some desolate islets known in Chinese as the Diaoyu and in Japanese as the Senkaku islands, with armed ships from both countries playing a dangerous game of chicken in the waters offshore. Meanwhile, Japan is caught in a separate island spat with South Korea, whose president, Park Geun-hye, just spent a significant portion of a visit to Washington lambasting Abe -- who, as leader of the one other powerful democratic U.S. ally in the region, should be her closest friend.
The real source of all this bitterness, of course, and the reason it's so hard to resolve, is that it actually has little to do with the islands themselves, or with various other pretexts. As Abe's unfortunate photo-op highlighted, what's really at stake is the legacy of what happened in the region during the first half of the 20th century. That's when a rapidly modernizing Japan set out to establish itself against the imperial European powers by brutally carving out and exploiting an empire of its own in Korea, Northern China and elsewhere.
Seventy-plus years later, those events still rankle, and turn small problems into big ones. Take the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands. China claims that before Japan seized them in 1895, they were Chinese property -- and that the decision by Washington (which seized them in turn from Japan in 1945) to hand them back to Tokyo in 1972 only perpetuated a longstanding injustice. Now that China is strong again, Beijing intends to correct the record, however little value the barren islets actually have.
Or consider another flashpoint. Abe has recently distracted attention from his economic agenda by reviving talk about revising Japan's pacifist Constitution, one of his longstanding priorities. The prime minister's proposals, which include renaming Japan's ''Self-Defense Forces'' and allowing them to come to the aid of an ally like the United States if attacked, hardly seem radical. But Asian fear of Japanese militarism still runs so deep that even tiny moves like these create tremors.
All of which begs a big question: Why can't these countries just let the past lie, especially when doing so would be so clearly in their interests? Yes, there are plenty of ugly traumas to overcome. But Japan has been a pacifist, liberal democracy for nearly 70 years now, and it's hard to imagine it threatening anyone.
The answer is that no one will go first. The best thing that could happen for Asia today would be for Japan to apologize once and for all in a manner that is as clear, comprehensive and un-nuanced as possible. This means doing something like what Chancellor Willy Brandt of Germany did in 1970 when he fell to his knees before a monument to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, or when President Richard von Weizsäcker recognized the principle of Germany's ''collective responsibility'' a decade later.
Imperial Japan's crimes were not the same as Nazi Germany's. But democratic Germany has profited enormously from its open, non-defensive approach to the country's past, and democratic Japan would as well. Japan's victims, for their part, should press to have their legitimate grievances comprehensively addressed -- and then move on, as France, Russia and even Israel have done with the Third Reich's descendants.
But this, sadly, is unlikely to happen: Politicians in the countries concerned have too much to gain (or so they think) from continuing to stir the pot. Thus Japan likes to point out that it has already apologized multiple times for its misdeeds, and that it has even paid compensation in some cases. This is true. But it's also true that various Japanese politicians, catering to their conservative and contrition-weary base, continue to undermine those apologies by questioning them and the historical record.
When I interviewed Abe in Tokyo two weeks ago he was carefully opaque on whether Japan had been the aggressor in World War II, and defended the right of Japanese leaders to visit Yasukuni Shrine (where 13 Class-A war criminals are buried) by comparing it to America's Arlington National Cemetery.
Japan's neighbors, meanwhile, are just as guilty of exploiting the past for present ends. For all China's talk about lost sovereignty, for example, it's no coincidence that Beijing only started expressing interest in the Diaoyu/Senkaku after a United Nations survey suggested the presence of oil nearby in 1969. Chinese politicians also know that playing the victim card goes over very well at home. Stoking resentful patriotism is a handy way to distract the population from a raft of social and environmental problems and the hollowing-out of China's communist ideals. Why let facts get in the way?
Given such thinking on all sides, the chances are low that Asia will transcend its problems with history anytime soon. Yet that doesn't mean there's nothing the region's leaders could do to improve things. Short of a full accounting, there's another option that, though partial and unsatisfying, could help calm tensions. The idea, which China's new U.S. ambassador Cui Tiankai suggested to me in an interview recently, would be to simply shelve the thorniest issues and work around them.
That is not as crazy as it sounds. In fact, such a strategy has worked elsewhere -- between China and Taiwan, for example. Both Beijing and Taipei insist the island is part of China proper -- but both have tacitly agreed to live with the status quo (de facto independence) without forcing the issue.
Even Japan and China have tried something similar before. In 1972, China's prime minister, Zhou Enlai, struck a quiet deal with his Japanese counterpart, Kakuei Tanaka, to simply ignore the Diaoyu/Senkaku dispute. It worked: The understanding held for almost three decades, until a newly empowered China started testing the boundaries a few years ago and Japan bought the islands from a private Japanese citizen in 2012. (Tokyo claims it was only trying to prevent private building there; Beijing saw the purchase as yet another provocation.)
Striking a few new deals along these lines would not be easy today. In China especially, the nationalist demon would be hard to stuff back in its box. Nor would this approach salve the private pain of those, like former wartime ''comfort women,'' still seeking acknowledgement and reparations from Tokyo. But it would cool the region's boiling waters while letting all sides save face. And it might just be the only way to avoid an actual shooting war that no side, despite the overheated talk, wants or could afford.

HEADLINE: A Partnership for Growth

BYLINE: By BRAD SPURGEON

 BODY:
Rangnath Salgame is chief executive of growth ventures at Tata Communications, which owns one of the world's largest global telecommunications networks. In February 2012, Tata agreed to provide telecommunications connections and global hosting and content delivery services to the official Formula One Web site, Formula1.com. The company is also involved in broadcasting and entertainment, and has recently expanded into sports broadcasting, which includes Women's Tennis Association matches and Premier League Soccer in India. Last month, it became a technology partner of the Mercedes team. It is a subsidiary of the Tata Group, a conglomerate with more than $100 billion in revenue in many sectors, including steel, automobiles -- the automotive group has been involved in team and driver sponsorship in Formula One -- and information technology. Rangnath joined the company last year after spending many years at Verizon and Cisco Systems. India born and raised, he is based in New York and has lived in the United States for 29 years; he took an undergraduate degree in India, a master's in engineering at Virginia Tech and an M.B.A. at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He spoke to Brad Spurgeon of the International Herald Tribune about Tata's involvement in Formula One.
Q. How do you feel about Formula One, both personally and on a business level? 
A. It's my third race, so I attended two last season -- in Delhi and Austin. I didn't grow up with Formula One. I just knew a little bit about it through some friends who were car collectors.
On the business side, for me coming as an outsider it was fascinating to discover that this sport is so technologically driven. It's just absolutely mind-boggling the level of technological sophistication that goes into it. There is the designing and engineering of the cars, the data, information collected at the racetrack, the cars, the sensors on the cars and the decision making around it. It's just absolutely mind-boggling the complexity and how half a second or a second can make a difference. In the industry we come from, telecom, we think we are the only industry in the world which worries about nanoseconds and milliseconds, until I discovered Formula One is like telecom.
From a business perspective, what I discovered coming out of it was, if a sporting event of this sophistication is partnering with us and we are able to meet the demands of this demanding customer at an event, that says that probably we can do it for anybody in the world.
And we've just started hearing that our customers whom we're able to bring to Formula One events talk about it, and people who know about the sport, saying, ''You do it for Formula One? If you can do it for them then I'm sure you can do it for us.'''
Q. Monaco is considered the shop window, the jewel in the crown, the biggest corporate event for the series. But that's shifting because now we've got races in Delhi, Singapore, Shanghai -- the whole Asian part of the series. Is that more important to Tata?
A. Absolutely. It doesn't take away the importance from the Monaco race. I think it's still a jewel in sporting events, but it's the expansion of the sport that excites us. The market for this sport, China, Malaysia. So we as a Tata Group company, as Tata Communications, having roots in an emerging market like India, the kind of assets we bring for this sporting event is very exciting for us. What's really brought us to this partnership is because of the global nature of the sport.
Q. What's your general feeling about the future of the Indian market? Is it still capable of fueling a boom or is it just a bubble that could burst?
A. It's definitely not going up in smoke. Growth in India slowed down in the last two years, three years, from eight to nine percent growth now it's come down to five, six percent -- which for India is low.
But coming from the U.S. and Europe, it's a big growth still. India is a very interesting country from a development perspective. Over the past 20 years, a lot of the old large bureaucracy has been dismantled, a lot of structural reform has been made, so if you look at the trajectory of where the country is going I think it's unstoppable in terms of the economic growth, reduction of poverty and the expanding middle class.
Q. You have joined Formula One to help with its broadcasting needs at a time of great change in that medium. Can you outline that?
A. One of the big shifts happening in the media is that what we know as television is changing, going through a very profound change.
The old school of television, what we call linear television, is going to shift. And what linear means is in the world of television, the content was delivered to the consumer, as -- and when -- decided by the broadcaster.
The shift now is happening toward what we could call nonlinear TV, in which content is being delivered as the consumer demands it -- when the consumer wants to see it, how they want to see it, and what device they want to see it on: on a television, an iPad, Smartphone, tablet.
The second shift that's happening is the globalization of content, where the content being produced on one side of the world is being consumed on the other side, like basketball out of the United States is now consumed in China.
So if you combine these two trends, then the industry is being enabled and wants providers who bring a totally global infrastructure so they can enable this change.
And we can really be a force in this changing market.

HEADLINE: New Computer Attacks Traced to Iran, Officials Say

BYLINE: By NICOLE PERLROTH and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- American officials and corporate security experts examining a new wave of potentially destructive computer attacks striking American corporations, especially energy firms, say they have tracked the attacks back to Iran.
The targets have included several American oil, gas and electricity companies, which government officials have refused to identify. The goal is not espionage, they say, but sabotage. Government officials describe the attacks as probes looking for ways to seize control of critical processing systems.
Investigators began looking at the attacks several months ago, and when the Department of Homeland Security issued a vaguely worded warning this month, a government official told The New York Times that ''most everything we have seen is coming from the Middle East.'' 
Government officials and outside experts on Friday confirmed a report in The Wall Street Journal that the source of the attacks had been narrowed to Iran. They said the evidence was not specific enough to conclude with confidence that the attacks were state-sponsored, but control over the Internet is so centralized in Iran that they said it was hard to imagine the attacks being done without government knowledge.
While the attackers have been unsuccessful to date, they have made enough progress to prompt the Homeland Security warning, which compared the latest threat to the computer virus that hit Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, last year. After investigations, American officials concluded that the Aramco attack, and a subsequent one at RasGas, the Qatari energy company, were the work of Iran.
Taken together, officials say, the attacks suggest that Iran's hacking skills have improved over the past 18 months. The Obama administration has been focused on Iran because the attacks have given the Iranian government a way to retaliate for tightened economic sanctions against it, and for the American and Israeli program that aimed similar attacks, using a virus known as Stuxnet, on the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant.
That effort, code-named Olympic Games, slowed Iran's progress for months, but also prompted it to create what Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps calls a cyber corps to defend the country.
This week Iran denied being the source of any attacks, and said it had been a victim of American sabotage. In a letter to the editor of The Times, responding to a May 12 article that reported on the new attacks' similarity to the Saudi Aramco episode, Alireza Miryousefi, the head of the press office of the Iranian mission to the United Nations, wrote that Iran ''never engaged in such attacks against its Persian Gulf neighbors, with which Iran has maintained good neighborly relations.''
''Unfortunately, wrongful acts such as authorizing the 2010 Stuxnet attack against Iran have set a bad, and dangerous, precedent in breach of certain principles of international law,'' he wrote.
American officials have not offered any technical evidence to back up their assertions of Iranian authorship of the latest attacks, but they describe the recent campaign as different from most attacks against American companies -- particularly those from China -- which quietly siphon off intellectual property for competitive purposes.
The new attacks, officials say, were devised to destroy data and manipulate the machinery that operates critical control systems, like oil pipelines. One official described them as ''probes that suggest someone is looking at how to take control of these systems.''
The White House would not confirm that Iran was the source, but Laura Lucas, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said that ''mitigating threats in cyberspace, whether theft of intellectual property or intrusions against our critical infrastructure'' was a governmentwide initiative and that the United States would consider ''all of the measures at its disposal -- from diplomatic to law enforcement to economic -- when determining how to protect our nation, allies, partners, and interests in cyberspace.''
In the past, government officials have privately warned companies under threat. But Homeland Security was able to issue a broader warning because of an executive order, signed in February, promoting greater information sharing about such threats between the government and private companies that oversee the nation's critical infrastructure.
An agency called ICS-Cert, which monitors attacks on computer systems that run industrial processes, issued the warning. It said the government was ''highly concerned about hostility against critical infrastructure organizations,'' and included a link to a previous warning about Shamoon, the virus used in the Saudi Aramco attack last year.
That attack prompted Leon E. Panetta, then defense secretary, to warn of a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor'' if the United States did not take the threat seriously.
Saudi Aramco and RasGas both said that the attackers had failed in their efforts to infiltrate their oil production systems.
Government officials also say Iran was the source of a separate continuing campaign of attacks on American financial institutions that began last September and has since taken dozens of American banks intermittently offline, costing millions of dollars. But that attack was a less sophisticated ''denial of service'' effort.
Jeff Moss, chief security officer at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the private body that oversees the basic design of the Internet, said: ''For the last year, Iran has been focused on disrupting financial institutions' Web sites. If they are going after energy, and opening a multiprong front, at what point does it cross from annoyance to a threshold?''

HEADLINE: Haynes Johnson, 81, Journalist and Author, Is Dead

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX; Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Haynes Johnson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, television commentator and author known in particular for his long association with The Washington Post, died on Friday in Bethesda, Md. He was 81.
The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Kathryn A. Oberly, said.
Mr. Johnson, who joined The Post in 1969, was variously a writer, editor and columnist there before his retirement in 1994. He was previously a reporter on The Washington Evening Star, where he won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for coverage of the civil rights movement in Selma, Ala., and its aftermath. 
In his four decades in journalism, Mr. Johnson was widely esteemed for his coverage of domestic affairs in general and of the capital in particular.
Reviewing Mr. Johnson's book about the Carter administration, ''In the Absence of Power,'' in The Washington Post Book World in 1980, the British journalist Godfrey Hodgson called him ''one of the most perceptive, the best-informed, and the most levelheaded reporters in Washington.''
Mr. Johnson wrote more than a dozen books in all, including ''Sleepwalking Through History: America in the Reagan Years'' (1991), ''Divided We Fall: Gambling With History in the Nineties'' (1994), ''The Best of Times: America in the Clinton Years'' (2001) and ''The Age of Anxiety: McCarthyism to Terrorism'' (2005).
On television, he was a member of the original panel of the PBS program ''Washington Week in Review,'' first broadcast in 1967, and appeared on it regularly through the mid-1990s. Mr. Johnson was also a regular presence on PBS's ''NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' and in the late 1970s was a weekly commentator on the ''Today'' show.
Haynes Bonner Johnson was born in New York City on July 9, 1931. His mother, the former Emmie Ludie Adams, was a pianist; his father, Malcolm, was a newspaperman with The New York Sun. For The Sun, the elder Mr. Johnson won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for his 24-part series, ''Crime on the Waterfront.''
That series, which exposed the unsavory, often violent alliance of labor unions and organized crime on New York's docks, inspired ''On the Waterfront,'' the 1954 film starring Marlon Brando.
As a youth, Haynes Johnson worked as a copy boy on The Sun before earning a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri. After Army service stateside during the Korean War, he earned a master's in American history from the University of Wisconsin.
Mr. Johnson was a reporter on The Wilmington News-Journal in Delaware before joining The Evening Star in 1957. There, he covered a wide swath of national news, including the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy in 1961 and the epochal Selma-to-Montgomery marches of March 1965.
Later that year, several months after reporting on the civil rights protesters' hard-won gains, Mr. Johnson returned to Selma to record the struggle's less visible aftereffects.
The result was a special report, ''Selma Revisited,'' published in The Evening Star on July 26, 1965. In it, Mr. Johnson chronicled the discontents that had emerged among the city's blacks as they found their goals of equitable employment, housing and education even harder to realize than they had anticipated.
''Their leaders are struggling to regain precious momentum, but many of those who followed them so patiently are frankly bewildered and disillusioned,'' he wrote. ''Selma's Negro community is, in fact, in an hour of new and more subtle crisis -- a tragic crisis when it is contrasted with the soaring hopes and selfless devotion they and their friends demonstrated here such a short time ago.''
Mr. Johnson joined The Post as a national correspondent, where his portfolio included many presidential campaigns; he was later an assistant managing editor as well as a columnist there. He was a finalist for the 1983 Pulitzer Prize in National Reporting for his coverage in The Post of the impact of the recession on communities nationwide.
At his death, Mr. Johnson held the Knight chair of public affairs journalism at the University of Maryland.
His other books include ''Lyndon'' (1973, with Richard Harwood); ''The System: The American Way of Politics at the Breaking Point'' (1996, with David S. Broder); and ''The Battle for America, 2008: The Story of an Extraordinary Election'' (2009, with Dan Balz).
Mr. Johnson's first marriage, to Julia Erwin; ended in divorce. A resident of Washington, he is survived by his second wife, Ms. Oberly, a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals; three siblings, Michael, Paul and Sarah Johnson; five children from his first marriage, Stephen, David M., Katherine Autin, Sarah Johnson and Elizabeth Koeller; a stepson, Michael Goelzer; and six grandchildren.
Mr. Johnson's father, Malcolm, died in 1976, at 71. With Haynes Johnson's Pulitzer Prize a decade earlier, the two men became the first father-and-son writers to win the award.
''My father couldn't believe it,'' Haynes Johnson told United Press International in 1966, describing his win. ''I'm really more pleased for him than for myself.''

HEADLINE: With Little to Cheer, 3 Major Indexes End Week Lower

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
All three of the major stock indexes on Friday posted their first down week since mid-April, held back by lingering concern that the Federal Reserve might scale back the economic stimulus measures that have also propelled the markets' rally.
Still, the indexes closed well off their lows in sparse trading Friday ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend. The Dow Jones industrial average ended slightly higher, buoyed by a 4 percent gain in Procter & Gamble shares; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index both finished a shade lower. 
On Friday, the Dow gained 8.60 points, or 0.06 percent, to 15,303.10. The S.& P. 500 edged down only 0.91 of a point, or 0.06 percent, to close at 1,649.60. The Nasdaq dipped 0.27 of a point, or 0.01 percent, to 3,459.14. For the week, the S.& P. and the Nasdaq were down 1.1 percent, and the Dow was off 0.3 percent.
A 3.3 percent jump in April orders for long-lasting manufactured goods, like refrigerators and toasters, showed that the economy might be stronger than some had thought.
''A day like today is clear evidence that there is still money on the sideline to get into equities,'' said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, N.Y. Investors, he said, are ''looking for almost any excuse to get in.'' Over all, the market's declines have been short and shallow since November.
''Investors are taking advantage of down days to put more cash to work,'' Mr. Ghriskey said, ''especially when the decline is not based on something fundamental.''
Trading has been choppy since Wednesday as investors here and abroad grappled with the Fed's evolving stance on stimulus. The markets have been focused on the possibility that the $85 billion a month in bond purchases made by the Fed will be scaled back later this year, after recent Congressional testimony by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's latest meeting.
The minutes showed some disagreement among the policy-setting committee's members ''in terms of the approach moving forward, specifically the time frame'' of the unwinding of the Fed's stimulus efforts, said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Knight Capital in Jersey City, N.J.
The measures have been instrumental in a rally that has driven stocks to record highs, not counting inflation. Even as there is some fear that the Fed will exit too soon, many analysts say the eventual reduction of the bond-buying will come with an expansion of the economy and corporate earnings, which would continue to support equities.
Joe Bell, a senior equity analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, said many people had credited the Fed for the recent rally without considering improvement in the job market or the housing sector. ''The economy in general has been on a lot better footing than perhaps people have given it credit for,'' he said.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note barely moved on Friday, adding 1/32 to trade at 97 21/32, as its yield slipped to 2.01 percent, from 2.02 percent late Thursday evening.
Procter & Gamble shares rose 4 percent, to close at $81.88, after the company, the world's largest maker of household products, brought back A.G. Lafley as its chief executive on Thursday in the midst of a major revamping.
Tesla Motors rose to a 52-week high on Friday as bets against the stock decreased, suggesting another bout of short-covering in the electric carmaker's shares. Tesla stock jumped 4.7 percent, to $97.08, after rising as high as $97.95.
Abercrombie & Fitch was among the S.& P. 500's biggest losers after the retailer cut its profit forecast and said quarterly comparable sales fell 15 percent. Its stock lost 8 percent, to close at $50.02.
Shares of Sears Holdings plummeted 13.6 percent, to $50.25, after the retailer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Little Debate On Big Issues In Race to Fill Kerry's Seat

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
BOSTON -- For an election that was supposed to be about the big issues of the day, the special election in Massachusetts to fill the Senate seat vacated by John Kerry seems to be about everything but.
The big news this week was that Gabriel Gomez, the Republican candidate, called Representative Edward J. Markey, his Democratic opponent, ''pond scum'' for campaign ads that Mr. Gomez did not like.
And Mr. Markey, who has not been highly visible with retail events on the campaign trail, has also been missing votes in Washington, according to The Boston Globe. He has not cast a vote since May 9, missing the last 40, The Globe said, including one for legislation to approve the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project he has said he strongly opposed. 
His campaign said that Mr. Markey has been holding several behind-the-scenes events to line up institutional support from groups like the firefighters' union and that he attended several fund-raising events. The campaign also said that Mr. Markey had a 97 percent lifetime voting record; he was first elected to Congress in 1976.
Then there is Mr. Gomez's refusal to sign a pledge to keep undisclosed outside money out of the race. Mr. Markey has said the pledge is the central issue in the race and on Friday reiterated his challenge to Mr. Gomez to sign it. But so far, the only outside money in the race appears to be materializing on behalf of Mr. Markey.
NextGen, a group founded by Tom Steyer, a California billionaire and environmental activist who strongly opposes the Keystone pipeline, is preparing to get involved, according to his spokesman, Chris Lehane. In a memo to supporters, Mr. Lehane wrote that NextGen will be a ''politically disruptive force'' in the campaign, using online advertising and ''guerrilla marketing.''
Various Republican groups have said they were considering spending on Mr. Gomez's behalf, but they are waiting to see whether he shows signs of being able to win in deep blue Massachusetts.
Mr. Markey appeared at an electrical workers' union hall here on Friday to receive the endorsement of a fellow Democrat, Mayor Thomas M. Menino, whose machine can wield considerable clout in an election. The mayor praised Mr. Markey's stance against assault weapons and his ability to bring federal research money back to the state.
''This race has now been given a jolt of electricity,'' Mr. Markey declared.
Mr. Menino told reporters later that he would ''turn out my troops, that's all, like we always do,'' for Mr. Markey, and predicted he would ''win big'' on election day, June 25, because he did not see much enthusiasm for Mr. Gomez.
He conceded that he did not see much enthusiasm for Mr. Markey either but said it was ''building.''
In a brief scrum with reporters, Mr. Markey was pressed for why he had missed so many votes and for his reaction to being called ''pond scum.'' He said that he would not resort to name-calling himself and that Mr. Gomez was trying to distract from the issues, like an assault weapons ban, which Mr. Markey supports and Mr. Gomez opposes.
''This is a referendum on the Obama administration,'' Mr. Markey said at one point, with little elaboration.
After Mr. Markey left, a group of six electricians, a couple of whom are out of work, said in an interview that they would vote for Mr. Markey but they expressed little enthusiasm for him. They said that jobs and the economy were the most important issues for them but that Mr. Markey had not mentioned either in his speech, in which he instead lavished praise on Mr. Menino and focused on the assault weapons ban.
''Did he blow you away with his speech?'' asked one, who like the others did not want to be named because they were straying from the party line. ''Guns are not our issue,'' said another.
These electricians said they would nonetheless vote for Mr. Markey because he was a Democrat and Democrats support the Davis-Bacon Act, the Depression-era federal law that requires workers on public works projects to be paid the local prevailing wage. Decent wages, they said, were their bottom line.
One said he liked that Mr. Gomez had been a member of the Navy SEALs. ''That says to me he has a work ethic, and he could do this job of senator at half speed,'' he said. Still, he said he would not vote for him because Republicans are anti-labor.
None of them had heard the ''pond scum'' comment, but when told of it, said they thought worse of Mr. Gomez. Mr. Gomez had uttered it Thursday night after being asked about two of Mr. Markey's campaign ads against him.
In the first, a Web ad, the Markey campaign showed a split screen. On one side was an image of Mr. Gomez, who was the spokesman last year for a group that maintained that President Obama had politicized the killing of Osama bin Laden; on the other side was footage of Bin Laden from a video used by that group.
In the second, a television spot, the Markey campaign said that Mr. Gomez was ''against banning high-capacity magazines like the ones used in the Newtown school shooting.''
Mr. Gomez responded in speeches and in a campaign ad by mischaracterizing both Markey ads. He said that Mr. Markey had unfairly compared him to Bin Laden and that he had blamed him for the school shootings; neither Markey ad made such an assertion.
In an interview with National Public Radio, Mr. Gomez was asked about his response to the ads. ''To put me next to Bin Laden?'' he said. ''A former SEAL. Maybe he doesn't realize who actually killed Bin Laden. The SEALs did.''
Mr. Gomez added: ''For him to be as dirty and low, pond scum, to like, put me up next to Bin Laden, he's just got to be called what he is. It's that simple.''
The long-distance sparring has been going on since the two won their respective party primaries on April 30. They will meet face to face in at least two debates, the first on June 5 and the second on June 18.

HEADLINE: Trading Options, but Not Keeping Up With the Pros

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Some of the brokerage firms that helped pique American's interest in stocks are now luring them into something much riskier: stock options.
As the stock market soars to new heights, E*Trade, Ameritrade and Charles Schwab are advertising the potential rewards of options, which give buyers the right to buy or sell stocks at predetermined prices in the future. Options, like their cousins, futures, have traditionally been the domain of Wall Street traders. But the brokerage firms say futures and options can be profitable for ordinary investors, too -- a claim that, while true, does not square with many investors' actual experience.
''We're looking for newcomers who want to get serious,'' Schwab says on its Web site. 
While relatively little research has been done on the success ordinary investors have in trading options, analysis done for The New York Times by SigFig, a company that tracks 200,000 retail investors, showed that people who traded options last year received only about one-fifth the returns of people who did not trade options: 1.1 percent compared to 5.1 percent.
The brokerage firms do not release data about customers' trading, and they are generally hesitant to detail the expansion of this business. But it has clearly been an area of growth. An analysis of scattered data from company filings and presentations indicates that derivatives trading, which includes options, has risen at all the major firms since the financial crisis of 2008, which left many Americans with big losses in their investment portfolios.
At Ameritrade, which has been the most aggressive, derivatives trades accounted for about 40 percent of all customer trades last year -- more than double what it was just five years ago. A vast majority of those trades were in options.
The growth has been a big help for the online brokers at a time when stock trading has fallen. The commission on the average options trade is more than twice that on the average stock trade, according to TD Ameritrade's former treasurer, Michael Chochon.
''We're looking to continue to drive penetration in'' options and futures, Ameritrade's chief financial officer, Bill Gerber, said in a call with analysts in February.
But the results have been less of a clear victory for customers. Renaud Piccinini, who monitored customer accounts for Ameritrade before he left the company last year, said options could be used wisely in some circumstances. But he said he saw investors taking up options trading and ''blowing up'' on an almost daily basis. He said Ameritrade carefully tracked the risks its customers were taking but did not warn them until they were close to losing it all, if then.
''We knew that they were taking risky bets,'' Mr. Piccinini said. ''We knew inside the firm, but there was resistance to sharing that with the customer.''
Mr. Piccinini is now working with Mr. Chochon and two other former TD Ameritrade employees to create a program for retail investors, known as Prairie Smarts, that details the risks a prospective trade adds to a portfolio.
Steve Quirk, who oversees active traders at TD Ameritrade, said the former employees were criticizing the company to generate interest for their firm.
Mr. Quirk said TD Ameritrade gave investors a wide array of tools to gauge their risks, as well as significant education, before and after they started trading options.
''We hear from many, many clients that the more they understand about all the products that are available, the better equipped they are to deal with the market in any scenario,'' Mr. Quirk said.
The companies began their big push into this area after the financial crisis, with the purchase of smaller brokerage houses that focused on options. At E*Trade, filings indicate that options trades rose to 24 percent of all trades last year from about 17 percent in 2010, and the total number of trades also increased.
Customers at all the brokers must take a number of steps before they are permitted to begin trading, and they must attest that they have read an official 186-page document laying out the risks of options. But almost anyone can go through this process. And the brokers have broadened the pool of potential customers by allowing investors to trade options in their retirement accounts.
E*Trade's recent marketing material said: ''Every investor should learn how options trading could benefit them.''
Options generally represent the right to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at some point in the future -- allowing for a small initial investment that can lead to either big gains or big losses.
Investors have bought in for a variety of reasons. Some believe they will be able to use the leveraged nature of options to supercharge their returns and make up for losses suffered during the financial crisis. Others see options as a way to insure their stock portfolios against future losses.
But academic research suggests that on the whole, options traders do worse than stock traders, who, in turn, have been shown in many studies to underperform buy-and-hold investors. The most comprehensive study looked at 68,000 Dutch retail investors. It found that from 2000 to 2006, retail options traders lost an average of 4.5 percent each month, while people who just traded stocks lost 1.6 percent.
Daniel Dorn, a professor at Drexel University who has studied options investors, said studies of American options traders had not found them to be significantly more successful than the Dutch traders.
''You can very clearly say in the aggregate, this doesn't help individual investor portfolios,'' he said.
The brokers said they guarded against customer losses by allowing only wealthier and more experienced customers to proceed to more complex trading strategies. Joe Vietri, the chief executive of Charles Schwab's options subsidiary, OptionsXpress, said his company was careful about monitoring clients because Schwab wanted to keep them as customers for other parts of the business.
TD Ameritrade gives customer some tools that allow them to analyze the risks of individual trades. But Mr. Chochon, the former Ameritrade treasurer, said this was not enough to stop many customers from burning through the money in their accounts. This put a strain on the company, he said, because it necessitated expensive marketing campaigns to capture new clients.
''The churn of those clients was really expensive because you had to bring in a new customer,'' he said.
Mr. Quirk, at Ameritrade, denied that the company had trouble with clients burning out.

HEADLINE: Strategic Ignorance

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
In an age when knowledge is power, restricting knowledge is a power grab, creating the conditions of ignorance that allow bias, ideology and propaganda to flourish, unchallenged and unchecked.
So it is with two pending Republican bills that seek to curtail or end vital surveys by the Census Bureau and that could advance as early as next month, when lawmakers consider the annual appropriation for the Commerce Department, which includes the bureau's budget. 
One bill, introduced in the House by Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, would effectively end all surveys by the bureau, except for the decennial census, and even that would be limited to counting noses -- a silly interpretation of the census's mandate. Banning the surveys would make it impossible to compile reliable data on employment, productivity, health, housing, poverty, crime and the environment, to name a few of the affected fields.
This bill would be too wacky to worry about, but its lunacy makes the other know-nothing bill look moderate. That bill, introduced in the House by Ted Poe of Texas and in the Senate by Rand Paul of Kentucky, targets the American Community Survey. Started in 2005 to replace the long-form census, the survey is the indispensable source of information on factors that define American life, including family configurations, education levels, work and living arrangements, income and insurance coverage. Credible information is the basis for a responsive government, an efficient economy and, by extension, a functional society. It also gives American policy makers and businesses a competitive edge, because it encourages decisions based on hard data as opposed to guesses or other faulty rationales that dominate in the absence of credible data.
About three million people receive the survey every year, and, as with the census, answering it is required by law. Mr. Poe and Mr. Rand want to make it voluntary, which would make the results less reliable, and potentially worthless, because fewer people would answer and those who did would not be a representative sample.
Canada recently replaced its mandatory long-form census with a voluntary survey -- and now lives with the sorry results. To try to get an adequate level of response, the voluntary survey was sent to one in three Canadians instead of one in five, which increased costs. The response rate plunged anyway, from 94 percent to 68 percent. In a staggering one-fourth of Canadian communities, not enough people responded to make the data usable.
It may be months before President Obama's nominees for Commerce secretary and Census Bureau director are confirmed; in the meantime, there is no one to defend the survey. That increases the chances that the bill to make the survey voluntary could be slipped into the Commerce Department appropriation or other legislation. The White House needs to put someone prominent in charge of the issue now, or risk being caught off guard later.

HEADLINE: The Power Behind Manchester City Is Content to Stay Out of Sight in New York

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; John Otis and Robert Worth contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The setting was modest, the mood jovial, the dignitaries on hand pretty impressive. In the school cafeteria of P.S. 72 in East Harlem on Wednesday morning, professional soccer was nudged forward in New York City, with talk of a new team with prestigious owners and a new stadium designed specifically for the sport.
At a news conference in the cafeteria, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg rubbed shoulders with Hal Steinbrenner and Randy Levine of the Yankees, who will be the minority owners of the new team, and with Ferran Soriano, the president of Manchester City, the powerful English Premier League team, which will be the primary owner. 
On hand, too, were Don Garber, the commissioner of Major League Soccer and a man long committed to giving his league a foothold in New York City, and Claudio Reyna, the former captain of the United States national team and the director of football for the new team, which will be called New York City F.C.
Conspicuously absent, though, was Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi and the person who will essentially bankroll the new club. His investment group owns Manchester City, which, with the Yankees, paid a record $100 million for the right to own the 20th team in M.L.S. And the sheik's fund, the Abu Dhabi United Group, will spend hundreds of millions of dollars more to build a stadium, either in Flushing Meadows, Queens, or somewhere else in the city.
Such largess in absentia is not unusual for Sheik Mansour, who has a portfolio of political and economic responsibilities that include overseeing a major oil company and his country's sovereign wealth fund, which is thought to be worth $650 billion.
Keeping with that pattern, Sheik Mansour is not expected to be at Yankee Stadium on Saturday when his team takes on another top Premier League team, Chelsea, in an exhibition match. Since buying Manchester City in 2008 for $330 million, he has attended only one of its games.
But he is not an entirely passive owner. He is said to watch Manchester City matches regularly on television. And while he delegates the operation of the club to a group of executives and advisers, he approves major decisions, including significant player signings.
''We're a commercial corporation and we have our governance,'' Soriano said. ''Sheik Mansour is the main investor in Abu Dhabi United Group.'' However, he added, ''we don't expect him to be involved'' in the day-to-day operations of the New York team.
Instead, Sheik Mansour is expected to leave the details in New York to Soriano; Marty Edelman, a New York-based lawyer and board member of Manchester City; and -- when it comes to finding a site for the stadium -- Levine and the Yankees, who have experience in navigating city politics.
Khaldoon Al Mubarak, the chairman of Manchester City, a trustee at New York University and a close adviser to Sheik Mansour, may also become involved, even if he is not shaking hands at City Hall and inspecting potential sites for the stadium.
Mubarak is the face of Abu Dhabi to fans in Manchester. He attends many of Manchester City's games, and in New York City, he was instrumental in persuading New York University to build a campus in the emirate. Educated in the United States, he is considered politically savvy.
In many ways, Mubarak helps fill Sheik Mansour's larger ambitions for investing in soccer. Sheik Mansour and his advisers are known for making bold bets, whether doubling down on bank stocks during the financial collapse or making strategic purchases of technology companies.
Owning an M.L.S. team can be viewed in a similar light. The league, even with a team in New York, is a far cry from the Premier League in terms of popularity and potential profit. But with a low salary structure, M.L.S. has room to grow.
Investing in soccer has geopolitical dimensions, too.
''The U.A.E. ruling families want Americans to see them as progressive forces in the Middle East, worthy of American friendship and preferred treatment,'' said Jim Krane, a Gulf analyst at Judge Business School at Cambridge University. ''By currying favor with Congress and the U.S. public, the Abu Dhabi ruling family is arguing that it should not be sold down the river, as Mubarak was in Egypt, if the Arab Spring ever comes to the U.A.E.,'' he added, referring to the former Egypt president, Hosni Mubarak.
If Sheik Mansour had that intent in buying Manchester City, the strategy worked. Having long lived in the shadow of its more successful neighbor, Manchester United, Manchester City has seen its fortunes improve dramatically since Sheik Mansour bought the club five years ago and began spending hundreds of millions of dollars to add stars to the team.
After three seasons of gradual improvement, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2012, unseating Manchester United for its first top league title in 44 years. It also won the prestigious F.A. Cup in 2011 and nearly won it again this month. As it has risen, Manchester City has become an international sensation; television viewers of its league games have jumped 65 percent.
Once called ''a small club with a small mentality'' by Manchester United's legendary manager, Alex Ferguson, City no longer is. ''I've had many years of Manchester United fans having all the fame and glory, so it's nice to have a share of it now, too,'' said Jo-Maria Jones, a teacher in Manchester who has had season tickets to see City for 19 years. ''Suddenly, we were watching players we would have only dreamed of 10 years before.''
Manchester City has also reinvested in the area around its stadium, which is in a blighted part of Manchester. The team is constructing a youth academy; has built a plaza outside Etihad Stadium with bars, a stage for entertainers and giant TV screens; and has revamped the stadium itself. And well before Manchester City made a commitment to New York City F.C., it donated practice fields at Boys and Girls clubs in Los Angeles and Miami and at P.S. 72.
Now comes the quest to build a New York City stadium, a place Sheik Mansour, if he sticks to his habits, may rarely see.

HEADLINE: Russia Says Syria Will Attend Geneva Peace Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- The Syrian government has agreed to participate in an international peace conference coordinated by Russia and the United States, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
''We note with satisfaction that Damascus has confirmed its readiness in principle to participate in an international conference in the interest of the Syrians themselves finding a political path to a settlement of the conflict that has been devastating for the country and the region,'' the spokesman, Aleksandr Lukashevich, said in a statement.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and Secretary of State John Kerry agreed during a meeting in Moscow earlier this month to pull together the peace conference, with Russia responsible for bringing the government of President Bashar al-Assad to the table and the Americans focused on securing the participation of the Syrian opposition. The meeting is expected next month.
But even as Mr. Lukashevich said the Syrian government had committed to participating in the talks, he cited ''complicating factors'' that were undermining efforts to broker an end to the violence. 
He said some steps by the West at the United Nations in New York and in Geneva were counterproductive.
''It's regrettable that despite our persistent appeals to some partners, after the Russian-American initiative has already been announced, a decision on Syria was imposed on the U.N. General Assembly, which was lopsided in its character and contradicting to the consensus being formed in the world in favor of political settlement in this country,'' he said.
Last week, the 193-member General Assembly passed a nonbinding resolution calling for a political transition to end the civil war in Syria, putting the burden on Mr. Assad's government to stop the killing.
The United Nations' top human rights official, Navi Pillay, has repeated called for urgent action to halt the violence in Syria, underscoring the level of brutality of the conflict, calling for war crimes investigations on both sides and monitoring the rising death toll and refugee crisis. More than 80,000 people are believed to have died in the conflict, and hundreds of thousands of refugees have crowded into bordering nations.
But Mr. Lukashevich called the proposed peace conference ''a real chance to stop the bloodshed and suffering of the Syrians and ensure a peaceful, democratic future for Syria.''
''This opportunity should not be missed,'' he said.
A spokesman for Syria's main political opposition group responded to the announcement that the government would attend by saying there were no signs that it was really willing to produce ''a peaceful political solution.''
The spokesman, Khaled Saleh, speaking on the sidelines of a three-day meeting of the opposition in Istanbul, said, ''When any meaningful negotiation must start with good-will gestures, the regime continues using chemical weapons and heavily engages Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters on the ground.''
The Syrian opposition was meeting to elect a new leader and formulate its positions before the expected conference in Geneva . Mr. Kerry will fly to Paris on Monday to meet with Mr. Lavrov to discuss the Geneva meeting, an American official said.
Earlier this week, leading members of the group, the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, and top foreign affairs officials, including Mr. Kerry, held an 11-country meeting in Amman, Jordan, on the deteriorating situation in Syria.
At the start of the talks in Istanbul, members of the opposition group expressed hesitation about attending the Geneva meeting, and they asked for clarification on what to expect before committing to it, while emphasizing that such talks might be futile unless Mr. Assad was removed.
''We do not have too much illusion,'' said Ahmed Kamel, a member of the coalition. ''We know the regime, we know Assad, and we know that he would never quit power without force.''
Russia supports Mr. Assad's continued leadership, saying his presence would stabilize any transition. Members of the opposition group insist that he must not be a part of any future government.
''The international community says that they can remove Assad from power; so does the U.S.,'' Mr. Kamel said on the sidelines of the discussions. ''We just need to stop massacres until then.''
The meetings are intended to enlarge the 63-seat national coalition, the largest opposition group, with more members from the liberated areas inside Syria.
Disagreements, however, remained on how to secure representation by gender and ethnic and religious backgrounds, and how to establish trust for newer, little-known candidates.
The opposition group has been without a president since Sheik Moaz al-Khatib resigned the post amid political infighting in March.
At the start of the talks, Sheik Khatib put forward his own 16-step proposal for a political transition to a post-Assad government. Among other things, it would absolve all combatants involved in ''legal military action'' from prosecution and allow Mr. Assad and 500 people of his choosing, along with their families, to seek refuge in any country willing to welcome them.
Sheik Khatib's plan, published on his official Facebook page, would retain some members of the current government. Under it, Mr. Assad would hand power to Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa or Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi within 30 days of accepting the plan.
Subsequent measures include dissolving Parliament and transferring legislative powers to an agreed-upon candidate to handle the transition. Sheik Khatib added that the current government would continue to govern for 100 days, restructure the security and military apparatus, and release political prisoners.
But it is not clear whether any other members of the opposition coalition will support the plan. ''No one listened to him when he was still head of the coalition; why would they listen to him now?'' said an activist contacted via Skype in the suburbs of Damascus, the Syrian capital, who declined to give her name.
And it is unlikely to appeal to the rebels fighting Mr. Assad's army and its allies on the ground, who say they want Assad loyalists to pay for their actions.
Asi, an activist who works at a makeshift hospital in Qusayr, a Syrian town where clashes are raging between government forces and rebels, wrote on his Facebook page: ''This pathetic nobody Moaz, the dangerous, is calling for Assad to leave with 500 individuals and wants to absolve soldiers. You donkey, you're going to be tried before Assad, God willing.'' (The word for ''dangerous'' in Arabic is similar to Sheik Khatib's surname.)
Even if the plan did win support, Mr. Assad himself has repeatedly emphasized in televised interviews that he has no plans to leave Syria, and refuses to step down before presidential elections -- which he plans to enter -- are held next year.
Sheik Khatib portrayed his proposal as a response to ideas by Russia and the United States for a political solution, and a way to ''prevent the decay of Syria, its people, its land, its economy.''

HEADLINE: As Tourists Come and Go, Harlem Churches Lose a 10% Lifeblood

BYLINE: By KIA GREGORY

 BODY:
The tourists started lining up two hours before morning worship service on West 116th Street in Harlem. Most were dressed in everyday clothes, contrasting with the dark suits and prim dresses of the largely African-American congregation in the historic sanctuary of Canaan Baptist Church of Christ.
The Rev. Roger Harris, an associate pastor, made his way from the back of the line in his pinstripe suit. ''Good to see you, glad you came,'' he said, offering grins and handshakes on a recent Sunday. The tourists were herded to the balcony until, as in several churches in Harlem, they packed the seats there. Down below, where the congregation has dwindled over the years, there were plenty of empty seats.
The tourists often put offerings in the collection basket. But then they are gone. And so despite the draw, churches like Canaan are struggling. And at the heart of the struggle is a contradiction: As Harlem's fortunes rise, tithing -- the traditional source of the churches' money -- is fading away.
Harlem's historical base of African-Americans has been dwindling. Those who remain have regularly tithed, setting apart 10 percent of their incomes for their church, in times good and bad. But now that has changed, too. 
''Your tithers are your people who really keep your church going as a whole,'' said the Rev. Dr. Charles A. Curtis, the senior pastor at Mount Olivet Baptist Church and the chairman of Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement.
''With the drop in population,'' he said, ''you have less people to tithe.''
The Rev. Jesse T. Williams Jr., senior pastor at Convent Avenue Baptist Church, said, ''Giving is a form of worship, and an expression of thanking God for what God has given us.'' At his church, he said, tithes in recent years were down about 12 percent.
Canaan, now with 1,000 members, has lost 500 since 2000, which increased the amount of room available for tourists. Without the tourists, Mr. Harris said, the senior pastor would be ''preaching to an empty balcony.''
And tithes are down 20 percent, though other offerings at Canaan have been stable. It is not clear how much of that money comes from tourists.
Some churches have experienced drops in tithing of as much as 50 percent, said Deborah C. Wright, the chief executive of Carver Federal Savings Bank, leading them to seek loans from her bank.
''Clearly this is a transitional period,'' said Canaan's senior pastor, the Rev. Thomas D. Johnson Sr., who celebrated his seventh year at the church last month. ''I believe that Canaan and all of our strong churches in Harlem are determined not to become extinct. This institution must survive, not only for the congregation, but because of who we represent.''
The story of Canaan, and its current struggle, is shared by many of Harlem's churches. It was founded in 1932 in the spirit of what elders call a country church. Many early congregants were migrants from the South, sharecroppers under Jim Crow, steeped in a worship tradition. As more families came, the church grew.
The previous pastor, the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, led the church for almost 40 years, until he retired in 2004; he was an architect of the civil rights movement and an aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
''He was a fighter,'' said Mr. Harris, who has a goal of increasing church membership by at least 50 within the next year.
In 1970, Mr. Walker once stood on the trunk of a car near the church and, through a bullhorn, preached a sermon about drug-dealing in the neighborhood. ''We've been living dangerously for a long time,'' he told his curbside congregation of 300, and whoever else was within earshot, ''and we're not afraid to name names.''
The black church, he often said, was the primary resource for the black community. ''It is where black people have the ultimate decision-making power,'' he said in a 1979 newspaper interview. ''Black folks will pay church dues before they pay their rent.''
Under Mr. Walker, whose black-and-white portrait hangs in Canaan's lobby, membership swelled to the point where ushers had to put chairs in the halls. The Canaan that Mr. Johnson inherited, however, looks remarkably different. So does the neighborhood. Where African-Americans once made up the bulk of Central Harlem's population, they are now less than half. Economically, million-dollar homes and trendy restaurants glimmer amid stubborn pockets of blight.
Even in churches where membership has been steady, some pastors say, tithes have dipped. In recent years, food pantries have run bare, building problems have festered, and funds that help people make their rent, keep their electricity on or get a MetroCard to get to work dry up. Some community initiatives have been stalled. Church members always dig deep when pastors make pleas from the pulpit. But despite church holdings in real estate amid Harlem's rising property values, church operations are tied to the faithful.
''Everybody is affected one way or another,'' said Mr. Williams of Convent Avenue Baptist, located on 145th Street. ''People who have been here a long time, members who have owned their homes or brownstones 30, 40 years, have come up quite well. The other end of the spectrum being, we have members in the congregation who have lost their residences, lost their jobs.''
More and more, pastors say, church members bring their worries over layoffs and rent increases to them, and to the altar.
''The misery index in Harlem is still high,'' Mr. Johnson, 56, said.
''It's really something to walk through Harlem,'' he continued, ''and see people obviously struggling, and literally on the other side of the street see people walking toy dogs, and coming out of condos. We've got to bring them together. I think that's the bridge we have to build.''
Last Sunday, Canaan celebrated its 81st anniversary. And as part of his legacy, Mr. Johnson has been rethinking its ministry. He has ushered in a church Web site and started a men's ministry, a women's ministry, a young adult ministry and a social policy institute. He also revived the evangelism ministry, which over the summer will, in part, target Harlem's growing diversity.
''A multilingual church in a multicultural community, that's where we live now. That's the kind of Canaan that we're starting to build,'' Mr. Johnson said.
''Harlem is going to continue to evolve,'' he added, ''but we need to make sure we preserve the symbols. People aren't coming to look at the new condo that went up. They come for the Apollo, to walk down 125th Street and get a glimpse of what that looked like back in the day, and the churches where pastors like Walker preached.''

HEADLINE: James L. Tolbert, Lawyer to Black Hollywood, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
James L. Tolbert was in love. Marie Ross was, too. But she had little interest in marrying a man who pieced together his income by hosting parties and concerts in empty buildings. One of his gimmicks: selling food and drink out of an old hearse.
''He was just hustling,'' said Mr. Tolbert's son, Tony. ''She said he needed to have some kind of career. She said, 'doctor, lawyer or Indian chief.' '' 
Mr. Tolbert, a high school dropout, chose option 2, and went on to become one of the first black lawyers to represent black entertainers in Hollywood and to play a central role in an early effort to improve the way blacks were portrayed on film and to increase their numbers behind the scenes.
Mr. Tolbert, who was 86 when he died on April 22 in a hospital in the Los Angeles area, grew up surrounded by entertainers. His grandfather Willis Young was an anchor of the Los Angeles jazz scene in the 1930s, and the great saxophonist Lester Young was an uncle. After he graduated from Van Norman Law School in 1959, Mr. Tolbert began building a four-decade practice rooted in his family's connections.
His clients included the trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison, the actor and comedian Redd Foxx, and the singers Lou Rawls and Della Reese. Some of their success can be traced to the work Mr. Tolbert did as the young president of the Hollywood-Beverly Hills chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the early 1960s.
In June 1963, only weeks before the March on Washington, the N.A.A.C.P., mounted what some called the March on Hollywood, a political and economic campaign in which the organization promised to picket theaters, hold demonstrations and boycott major advertisers if film studios and unions did not portray blacks in more diverse roles and hire more of them to work in the industry.
At one news conference, Mr. Tolbert urged studios ''to have Negroes shown as they are, instead of as caricatures,'' and he challenged unions to hire at least one black worker for each production. Some unions later adopted an apprenticeship program but never implemented it, the N.A.A.C.P. said.
Some within the organization criticized Mr. Tolbert for not immediately insisting on advertising boycotts. But he portrayed himself as a moderate, preferring to press his case using practical arguments.
''We Negroes watch 'Bonanza' and buy Chevrolets,'' he told a group of broadcast and advertising executives in August 1963. ''We watch Disney on RCA sets. Jack Benny entertains us, and we buy General Foods products. Our babies eat Gerber baby foods, and we photograph them with Polaroid cameras.''
''We buy all the advertised products,'' he added, ''the same as you do.''
That September he noted that there had been some, if halting, progress in the kinds of roles black actors were receiving. But two years later the N.A.A.C.P.'s national labor secretary, Herbert Hill, complained that what progress had been made had been fleeting.
James Lionel Tolbert was born on Oct. 26, 1926, in New Orleans. He and two of his sisters moved to Los Angeles when he was 10. He enlisted in the Army after he dropped out of high school.
Tony Tolbert confirmed his father's death, saying the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to his son, Mr. Tolbert is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Ms. Ross; their daughters, Anita and Alicia; two grandchildren, and two sisters, Martha Taylor and Esther Ford.
Tony Tolbert, who is a lawyer himself and an administrator at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Law, said that his father's law practice was hardly glamorous, that the entertainment work was just a facet of it. The home phone frequently rang late at night with calls from clients who had been arrested and hoped to be bailed out of jail. The Tolbert house nearly always had guests, some for a night, others for six months. Mr. Tolbert rarely said no.
It had an impact on his son. For the last two years, Tony Tolbert has made his own house in Los Angeles available to a struggling family for $1 a month in rent while he lives with his mother.
''He was a save-the-world kind of guy, for sure,'' he said of his father.

HEADLINE: Battle for Syrian Town Spurs Sectarian Fighting in Northern Lebanon

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD and HANIA MOURTADA; Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The all-out battle for the Syrian town of Qusayr, pitting the Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah and Syrian armed forces against Sunni Muslim rebels, has spurred the worst sectarian fighting in years in the north of Lebanon.
Unusually fierce battles between militias in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli -- Sunnis against Alawites who are allied with Hezbollah and the Syrian government -- have kept schools and businesses closed there since Monday and left at least 24 people dead. Mortar fire and other heavy weapons have ravaged neighborhoods, a severe escalation from the usual sporadic gunfire that raised fears that the violence, usually contained in a few districts, would spread. 
The weak Lebanese government's official policy of dissociation from the Syrian conflict is increasingly in tatters as Lebanon faces its own political vacuum, coasting under a caretaker government and mired in disputes over how and when to hold elections. Worries here have mushroomed as the unexpected tenacity of rebels in Qusayr against better-armed opponents has given the battle strong symbolic significance. As the battle rages, it raises the question of whether Hezbollah will emerge emboldened or weakened -- both possibilities that could also unbalance Lebanon.
Though senior opposition leaders insist they are not calling for assaults on Shiite areas in Lebanon, some rebels use baldly sectarian rallying cries. Leaders of American-backed factions of the Syrian opposition call on fighters to rally to Qusayr and threaten retaliation against Hezbollah. They have issued derogatory statements about its revered leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and taunted Hezbollah as ''the party of the devil,'' a play on its name, which means Party of God in Arabic.
There are fears of attacks by the most militant among the opposition's sympathizers in Lebanon, fundamentalist Sunni factions active in Tripoli and the southern city of Sidon. Residents report that Hezbollah strongholds are on high alert for car bombs and other attacks.
Sunni fighters are widely believed to lack the capacity to mount a frontal assault on Hezbollah in Lebanon. But still, senior Lebanese and American officials have expressed growing fears of the kind of spillover that has happened in Tripoli as Hezbollah plunges more deeply into the Syrian war, riling Lebanon's Sunni militants, some of whom are fighting alongside rebels in Qusayr.
And some fear the violence could spread further. One Syrian refugee in northern Lebanon, in the Wadi Khaled area near the Syrian border, said he was alarmed to hear some Syrian and Lebanese Sunnis there discussing plans to attack civilian supporters of Hezbollah, including in the Dahiya, its hub in Beirut's southern suburbs.
''They want to attack the vulnerable part of Hezbollah, the rump,'' he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Muhammad, for his safety. He said that while he was unsure how serious the threat was, it revealed a level of anger that made him fear for the future.
The leaders of most Lebanese factions have political and economic interests in keeping the peace, but some have expressed new alarm in recent days. Even an ally of Hezbollah in Parliament, Alain Aoun, said in an interview that any intervention in Syria endangered Lebanon by fanning sectarian flames. Lebanon's president, Michel Suleiman, lamented Friday that Lebanese citizens were fighting one another in Syria and, in what he called ''a direct reflection'' of the Syrian conflict, in Tripoli.
''With our own hands,'' he said, ''we are turning Lebanon into an arena.''
In Tripoli, each side accuses the other of starting the battle to take pressure off its allies in Qusayr, where rebels are enduring withering attacks and Hezbollah has taken unexpectedly heavy casualties that appear to number in the dozens.
Rifaat Eid, the communal leader of the hilltop Alawite district of Jabal Mohsen in Tripoli and a staunch supporter of Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, blamed Sunni gunmen.
''An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,'' Mr. Eid wrote on his Facebook page. ''You will hear Jabal Mohsen roar.''
Maj. Gen. Ashraf Rifi, a retired senior security official from Tripoli, said Hezbollah, through Mr. Eid, started the fight to keep Sunnis from flocking to Qusayr after it realized its hope of taking the city in 24 hours was ''delusional.''
Sectarian tensions also flared in the southern city of Sidon at the funeral of a Hezbollah fighter who was raised as a Sunni and converted to Shiism. Followers of the extremist Sunni cleric Ahmad al-Assir, who has tapped into Sunni anger at Hezbollah's support for Mr. Assad and dominance in Lebanon, blocked streets to prevent the fighter from being buried in a Sunni cemetery.
Lebanese see little prospect for relief from negotiations on the Syrian conflict planned by Russia and the United States for next month, despite official confirmation from Russia on Friday that the Syrian government would take part.
On Wednesday, as two of the rebels' most prominent commanders videotaped themselves heading to Qusayr, one, Col. Abdul Jabbar al-Okeidi, declared, ''We're coming for you, Hassan Nasrallah!''
Hezbollah keeps its areas under tight control, but refugees from Syria have increased the Sunni population, and tension, in those places.
A Sunni resident of the Dahiya said Friday that Hezbollah officials urged him to notify them of any threats against him. He said he had seen 20 funerals of Hezbollah fighters in the past two weeks and heard Shiite shop owners criticizing Hezbollah's leadership over the losses.
Syrian rebel shelling has already killed civilians in Hezbollah-controlled areas of the Bekaa Valley. One Syrian rebel, who gave only his first name, Abdullah, said his battalion fired mortar shells last week at the Shiite town of Hermel from a Lebanese area near the border.
Hisham Jaber, a Shiite who is a retired Lebanese Army commander, said he believed Hezbollah would try to extricate itself from Syria after the fight in Qusayr to short-circuit sectarian tensions and internal dissent. He said he did not foresee war in Lebanon, but could not rule out sporadic clashes in Sidon and the Bekaa.
Mr. Suleiman, the president, stopped short of condemning Hezbollah's involvement in Syria. He declared that its traditional mission of opposition to Israel is ''more noble and more important than anything, and should not get bogged down in the sands of dissension, whether in Syria or Lebanon,'' especially as it has usually fought for ''a national, not sectarian cause.''

HEADLINE: Calm Boss Overseeing a Syrian Refugee Camp's Chaos

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN; Ranya Kadri and Tamir Elterman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ZAATARI, Jordan -- KILIAN KLEINSCHMIDT had a problem. The afternoon before Kuwait's ambassador to Jordan was scheduled to visit the overcrowded Syrian refugee camp here, children vandalized mobile homes that Kuwait had donated, stealing windows, doors and floor mats.
Mr. Kleinschmidt, who runs the Zaatari camp for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, called the police, but they were busy with a riot as thousands of Syrians tried to cram onto a handful of buses headed back to their embattled homeland.
''Naughty, naughty kids -- the best stone throwers on earth,'' said Mr. Kleinschmidt, 50, a ruddy-faced German whose résumé reads like a Wikipedia entry for the last few decades of international disasters. ''I don't know what I'm going to tell the ambassador of Kuwait tomorrow. He is going to be very upset. He wants to see these placed and happy families moving in there.''
About half the size of a small Manhattan studio apartment, the 161-square-foot and 194-square-foot trailers -- called caravans and costing $2,500 to $3,500 each -- are the most coveted commodity in Zaatari, separating the have-littles from the have-lesses. 
Moving families from tents to caravans is the cornerstone of Mr. Kleinschmidt's plan to overhaul Zaatari, where he took the reins on March 12 after a series of temporary directors. By July, he promises, all of the more than 100,000 refugees sprawled across Zaatari's five square miles will be in caravans, more than 25,000 of them. They are less than halfway there.
Mr. Kleinschmidt also wants to divide the chaotic camp into 12 neighborhoods, put up street signs and assign everyone an address. He envisions issuing business licenses in the vast, unregulated marketplace of corrugated tin stalls. He wants to install water and electric meters, too. And, eventually, he hopes for a biometric identification system and debit cards to cover food, health care and other services -- like the system he oversaw for more than one million displaced people in Pakistan.
But first: a secure fence -- better yet, a wall -- around the aid workers' compound, and Zaatari itself.
''Fences don't work,'' he told a representative from the European Union the day after the caravans had been looted. ''One message to the E.U. is, recruitment program for an East German wall specialist. I want to build a wall. I like walls.''
The son of teachers, Mr. Kleinschmidt grew up in Berlin and worked as a roofer, then joined a cooperative that raised 35 goats to make cheese in the Pyrenees. At 26, on a motorbike trip to Mali, he met an aid worker in a bar and ended up helping to build a school near Timbuktu.
He has been working for United Nations aid agencies pretty much ever since. He helped organize a camp for the so-called Lost Boys of Sudan; was in Mogadishu in 1993 during the military operation in which 18 Americans were killed and which inspired the book and movie ''Black Hawk Down''; spent two years as a sort of liaison to the Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka; coordinated one of the largest humanitarian airlifts in history for Rwandans caught in the rain forest in Congo; and, in between, worked in Kosovo, Kenya and Uganda. His nickname in aid circles is ''the Lion in the Desert.''
''What makes Kilian tick is the same thing that makes him difficult,'' said Pilar Robledo, who worked closely with Mr. Kleinschmidt for four years in Pakistan and now serves as a consultant to a project here run by the United States Agency for International Development. ''He is a man who thrives when mired in chaos, and seems like a different person when an emergency situation has normalized.''
Mr. Kleinschmidt has five children, one stepson and a 6-month-old grandson, from four relationships. His wife, a jewelry designer, is from the Caucasus and lives in Nairobi; they have not seen each other in two months.
In Jordan, Mr. Kleinschmidt's official title is senior field coordinator, with a salary of $14,000 a month. But he calls himself ''the International Mayor of Zaatari'' or, simply, the boss.
''I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss!'' he barked into the phone one morning. ''I decide everything,'' he explained later. ''Whether to fix a fence or to throw out a refugee -- everything.''
Deciding is one thing, doing another. Mr. Kleinschmidt still does not know exactly how many refugees live in his camp or how many aid workers operate there. Almost daily, there are demonstrations, often suppressed with tear gas; last month, a Jordanian security official was critically injured, prompting residents of villages near the camp to block access to it for hours, threatening the refugees' water supply.
''This is one of the most unruly places I have ruled,'' said Mr. Kleinschmidt, who sleeps several nights a week on a mattress on the floor of his caravan-office. ''The refugees are in sort of a vacuum in terms of who are the authorities. They think of us as the little brothers of Assad -- authority is evil,'' he said, referring to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.
One of the first things Mr. Kleinschmidt tackled was electricity. Throughout the camp, dangerous spaghettilike masses of wires pirate power to market stalls, tents and caravans. He said refugees had ''established their own power company,'' with Mafia-like gangs collecting payments and controlling connections. ''They have said, 'We will destroy the whole camp if you disconnect the power.' ''
So the boss had a summit meeting with a refugee he refers to as the electricity minister, promising to install a new, more powerful transformer if the spaghetti was unraveled. But this month, the Jordanian power company cut the camp's electricity for nearly eight hours because the bill for the first four months of the year, topping $1 million, had not been paid.
As for the caravan crisis, the Kuwaiti ambassador ended up postponing his visit. But later that week, while showing the South Korean ambassador the happy families moving into 388 of the 1,700 caravans his country had donated, Mr. Kleinschmidt was swarmed by complaints.
''This man, he is here about four months, and he doesn't receive anything!''
''The toilet is too far from my caravan!''
''I have a small daughter, I need a caravan!''
Mr. Kleinschmidt fought back. ''You're all so jealous,'' he said. ''If I give you, then he is coming and he is coming.''
The sun was starting to fall, and Mr. Kleinschmidt was called to a more serious situation. Since morning, six refugee families had been occupying new caravans intended for others. That meant the six families that had turned in their tents had no place to sleep.
The boss tried to reason with a refugee representing the squatters. If they returned to their tents, Mr. Kleinschmidt vowed, he would get them caravans after the weekend.
No deal.
''Look, brothers, everybody listen to me,'' Mr. Kleinschmidt told the growing crowd. ''Everyone in Zaatari will get a caravan. If you're all starting to take, to grab, it will not work, and we will stop, and nobody will get a caravan.
''If I accept that people just take what they want, we are finished here. We will leave and you can stay. They need to move.''
They would not. So instead of expediting their caravans, Mr. Kleinschmidt said he would cut off their ration cards.

HEADLINE: Devising a Strategy for Climate Change

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Climate Warnings, Growing Louder'' (editorial, May 19):
It was heartening to see The Times call upon the Obama administration to get on with steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially since we are at the 400 parts per million milestone of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a level not reached since long before humans arrived on the scene.
It was less heartening, however, to see you dismiss the possibility of Congress's ever enacting a tax on carbon. Yes, the Environmental Protection Agency could come out with strong restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, but such regulations will surely increase electric bills, with the poor and middle class shouldering the burden. A revenue-neutral carbon tax, with money rebated to all households equally, would bring down emissions and at the same time shield households from the economic impact of rising energy costs. 
President Obama cannot impose a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Only Congress can do that. The Times and other media outlets must not relieve our legislators of their responsibility to act on climate change.
MARK REYNOLDS Executive Director Citizens Climate Lobby Coronado, Calif., May 19, 2013
To the Editor:
You rightly pointed out that there is a need for executive action, as well as a strategy to combat climate change. Besides the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department, the Interior Department also needs to be called upon to fight the climate change crisis.
The president and the Interior Department should take a hard look at fossil fuel development. Last year, the International Energy Agency warned that two-thirds of the world's proven fossil fuel reserves need to remain in the ground, untouched. Yet the administration continues to move ahead to allow drilling in some of the most dangerous and risky places in the world, like the Arctic Ocean.
If President Obama is seeking easy solutions to stop climate change, stopping drilling in sensitive and risky areas should be at the top of his list.
CINDY SHOGAN Executive Director Alaska Wilderness League Washington, May 20, 2013
To the Editor:
Your editorial is unfortunately behind the times referring to ''enormous leakage of methane'' from gas wells and the pipes that bring natural gas to consumers. Greenhouse gas emissions from the natural gas delivery system are low, and America's natural gas utilities are committed to lowering them even further.
In April, the Environmental Protection Agency released its updated annual greenhouse gas inventory. Only 1.5 percent of produced natural gas is emitted from the point of production through delivery. That is a decrease of about one-third from 2010. The E.P.A. estimates that emissions from the natural gas distribution system alone in 2011 were 0.3 percent of produced natural gas. That is hardly enormous.
Today, natural gas meets almost one-fourth of the United States' energy needs. We welcome your call for leadership on this issue as we seek to engage in a fact-based dialogue about building a clean and secure energy future for our nation.
DAVE McCURDY Washington, May 20, 2013
The writer is president of the American Gas Association and a former member of Congress from Oklahoma (1981-1995).
To the Editor:
As carbon emissions increase, elected officials of the planet's second-largest polluter (after China) sit idle and bicker as to whether climate change even exists? Maybe those in Washington need to take another look and see what the real scandal is.

HEADLINE: China Plan Cuts The State's Role In the Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and CHRIS BUCKLEY; Chris Buckley reported from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- The Chinese government is planning for private businesses and market forces to play a larger role in its economy, in a major policy shift intended to improve living conditions for the middle class and to make China an even stronger competitor on the global stage.
In a speech to party cadres containing some of the boldest pro-market rhetoric they have heard in more than a decade, the country's new prime minister, Li Keqiang, said this month that the central government would reduce the state's role in economic matters in the hope of unleashing the creative energies of a nation with the world's second-largest economy after that of the United States. 
On Friday, the Chinese government issued a set of policy proposals that seemed to show that Mr. Li and other leaders were serious about reducing government intervention in the marketplace and giving competition among private businesses a bigger role in investment decisions and setting prices. Whether Beijing can restructure an economy that is thoroughly addicted to state credit and government directives is unclear. But analysts see such announcements as the strongest signs yet that top policy makers are serious about revamping the nation's growth model.
''This is radical stuff, really,'' said Stephen Green, an economist at the British bank Standard Chartered and an expert on the Chinese economy. ''People have talked about this for a long time, but now we're getting a clearly spoken reform agenda from the top.''
China's leaders are under greater pressure to change as growth slows and the limitations of its state-led, investment-driven economy are becoming more evident. This month, manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in seven months, according to an independent survey by HSBC. Economists are lowering their growth forecasts and weighing the risks associated with high levels of corporate and government debt that have built up over the last five years.
''There are quite a number of messages coming from these new leaders,'' said Huang Yiping, chief economist for emerging Asia at the British bank Barclays. ''They realize that if we continue to delay reforms, the economy could be in deep trouble.''
The broad proposals include expanding a tax on natural resources, taking gradual steps to allow market forces to determine bank interest rates and developing policies to ''promote the effective entry of private capital into finance, energy, railways, telecommunications and other spheres,'' according to a directive issued on the government's Web site. ''All of society is ardently awaiting new breakthroughs in reform,'' the directive said.
Foreign investors will be given more opportunities to invest in finance, logistics, health care and other sectors. For years, Western governments, banks and companies have complained that the China government has impeded foreign investment in banking and other service industries, despite promising to open up. The latest directive, however, did not give details about the specific changes to foreign investment rules that policy makers in Beijing have in mind.
China's leaders are also promising to loosen foreign exchange controls, changes that are likely to reduce price distortions in the economy and allow the market to determine the value of the Chinese currency, the renminbi. On Friday, the central bank, the People's Bank of China, issued a statement that repeated such vows.
The push does not signal the end of big government in China. The Communist Party, experts say, is unlikely to abandon the state capitalist model, break up huge, state-run oligopolies or privatize major sectors of the economy that the party considers strategic, like banking, energy and telecommunications.
Beijing seems to be pressing ahead because it has few alternatives. The economy has slowed this year because of fewer exports to Europe and the United States and slower investment growth. Rising labor costs and a strengthening currency have also reduced manufacturing competitiveness.
China's leaders, including a group of pro-market bureaucrats who seem to have gained in the leadership shuffle this year, seem to think that more government spending could worsen economic conditions and that the private sector needs to step in.
China is also facing significant changes in its demographics and drivers of economic growth. The population is rapidly aging, and the number of young people entering the work force has begun to decline. Those shifts are forcing China to upgrade its industrial operations and compete using something other than inexpensive goods and low-cost labor, analysts say.
Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and an authority on the Chinese economy, said government controls on interest rates, the exchange rate and the price of energy had resulted in a huge misallocation of capital and unbalanced growth. ''These reforms would raise household income and reduce savings, providing a double-barreled boost to private consumption,'' Mr. Lardy said.
To succeed, China's leaders will have to fend off powerful interest groups, as well as corrupt officials who have grown accustomed to using their political power to enrich themselves and their families through bribes and secret stakes in companies.
The previous administration, led by President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, also promised to deepen economic overhauls and strengthen the private sector. But analysts say they lacked the political clout needed to succeed. During their two five-year terms, the state's role in the economy actually expanded.
The new leaders, who took office in March after a once-in-a-decade leadership transition, seem more determined to change course. In his speech this month, delivered to party officials nationwide by teleconference, Mr. Li, the prime minister, said, ''If we place excessive reliance on government steering and policy leverage to stimulate growth, that will be difficult to sustain and could even produce new problems and risks.''
''The market is the creator of social wealth and the wellspring of self-sustaining economic development,'' he said.
He spoke of deregulation and slimming down the role of government.
''Li Keqiang thinks like an economist,'' said Barry J. Naughton, a professor of Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego. ''He wants the government to get out of the way.''

HEADLINE: The Closing of the Conservative Mind

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Is there new flexibility? No. 

 BODY:
Jonathan Chait has an interesting portrait of Josh Barro; Mike Konczal, citing this and also a longer discussion of "reformish" conservatives by Ryan Cooper, argues that there really isn't much to see here. I agree, and have been trying to pin down what I mean by that.
Start with the proposition that there is a legitimate left-right divide in U.S. politics, built around a real issue: how extensive should be make our social safety net, and (hence) how much do we need to raise in taxes? This is ultimately a values issue, with no right answer. 
There are, however, a lot of largely empirical questions whose answers need not, in principle, be associated with one's position on this left-right divide but, in practice, are. A partial list:
1.The existence of anthropogenic climate change
2.The effects of fiscal stimulus/austerity
3.The effects of monetary expansion, and the risks of inflation
4.The revenue effects of tax cuts
5.The workability of universal health care
I've deliberately chosen a list here where the evidence is, in each case, pretty much overwhelming. There is a real scientific consensus on 1; the evidence of the past few years has been very strong on 2 and 3; there are no serious studies supporting the view that we're on the wrong side of the Laffer curve; one form or another of UHC operates all across the advanced world, with lower costs than the US system.
So? You could, as I said, take the "liberal" position on each of these issues while still being conservative in the sense that you want a smaller government. But what the "reformish" conservatives Ryan Cooper lists do, in almost all cases, is either (a) to follow the party line on these issues or (b) to hint at some flexibility - and thereby cultivate an image of being open-minded - as long as the issues don't get close to an actual policy decision, but to always find a way to support the Republican position whenever it actually matters. 
But aren't there people like Bruce Bartlett or Josh Barro who really do break with the party line on some or all of these issues? Yes, but they are then immediately branded as "no longer conservatives", in a sort of inverted version of the none-dare-call-it-treason effect.
The point is that there remains essentially no room for independent thinking within the conservative movement.
Could you say the same thing about liberals? I don't think so. A few decades ago, you might have been able to draw up a somewhat similar list for the other side, involving things like the superiority of tradeable emission permits to command-and-control pollution regulation, the general undesirability of rent control, the benefits of airline deregulation, the absence of a usable long-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation (and hence the impossibility of setting a 4 percent target for unemployment). But many liberals eventually conceded the point in each of these cases (maybe even conceded too far in a couple), without being declared no longer liberal. The point is that being a good liberal doesn't require that you believe, or pretend to believe, lots of things that almost certainly aren't true; being a good conservative does.
And like Mike Konczal, I see no sign that any of this is changing.

HEADLINE: Untangling What Companies Pay in Taxes

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Though companies often make their tax situation as opaque as possible, citing complex calculations, much can be gleaned by looking at a standard measure in public reports over several years. 

 BODY:
 The tax filings of companies, like those of individuals, are confidential. When individual companies want to make the case that they pay large amounts of tax - as many do - they often point to complex calculations from their financial statements that portray the companies in the best light. For an outsider, it can be hard to know how many accounting assumptions go into these calculations and how accurately they reflect the company's actual tax payments.
But there is one standardized measure of corporate taxes that allows for meaningful comparisons among companies and industries. It is known as Cash Taxes Paid and appears in the public reports that companies are required to file for investors. The category reflects the combined amount of corporate income tax that a company pays in a given year, to foreign governments, the United States government and state and local governments. 
This number often varies significantly from year to year, depending on a company's accounting strategy and on how many tax breaks it qualifies for that year. As a result, a single year's Cash Taxes Paid number can be misleading. But in a 2008 academic paper, three accounting professors - Scott Dyreng of Duke, Michelle Hanlon of M.I.T. and Edward Maydew of the University of North Carolina - suggested that looking at several years, at least, could offer insight into corporate taxes. 
For a column for the Sunday Review this week, I asked S&P Capital IQ, a financial research group, to collect the last six fiscal years of Cash Taxes Paid for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Capital IQ then compared these numbers to the companies' pretax earnings, including unusual items, for the same six years. Together, the two statistics create an effective tax rate for each company, as well for various industries. 
The numbers show that oil companies and retailers pay relatively high tax rates, as you can see in this chart. Technology companies, pharmaceutical companies and utilities have lower-than-average tax rates. In all, the average rate for the S.&P. 500 was 29.1 percent over last six years.
The number helps make clear that despite a relatively high official corporate income-tax rate of 35 percent in the United States, most companies do not pay nearly that much, thanks to loopholes. Remember: the 29.1 percent includes not only federal corporate income taxes but also foreign, state and local.
Soft-drink companies are among those paying taxes well below average, partly because of their ability to locate the manufacturing plants for soda concentrate in low-tax countries, as I discuss in the column. Coca-Cola paid a combined tax rate of 15.25 percent between 2007 and 2012, while PepsiCo paid 21.31 percent. 
The companies chose not to discuss their tax strategies in detail with me, but each did issue a statement in response to my questions.
From Amanda Rosseter, a Coca-Cola spokeswoman:
The Coca-Cola Company is a compliant taxpayer globally, paying all legally required income taxes in the U.S. and every country in which our subsidiaries operate.
As a global company with products sold in more than 200 countries, more than 80% of our unit case volume is sold outside the United States. The fact that our effective tax rate is lower than some other companies in the S.&P. 500 is reflective of the fact that less than 20% of our volume comes from sales in the U.S., which has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.
 From Aurora Gonzalez, a PepsiCo spokeswoman:
We cannot comment on the tax rates of other companies or industries. PepsiCo's tax rate is driven by the tax laws and regulations of the approximately 200 countries and territories in which we do business, and we pay all of our tax obligations in full.

HEADLINE: Reducing Refinancing Expenses

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
New York homeowners looking to refinance an existing mortgage don't have to pay the state's mortgage recording tax all over again. Yet they may end up doing so if their lenders don't cooperate.
The state charges a recording tax on new mortgage debt. The rate varies by county, with the minimum being 1.05 percent of the loan amount. The rate is highest in New York City, where borrowers pay 1.8 percent of the loan amount for mortgages under $500,000, and 1.925 percent above that amount.
A city resident borrowing $600,000, for example, would be charged around $11,500 for the recording tax. 
But fortunately, homeowners aren't required to pay the tax again when they refinance. ''The borrower already paid the tax on the existing mortgage and is entitled by statute to an exemption from payment of the tax with respect to an existing principal balance a second time,'' said Guy Arad, a lawyer with Adam Leitman Bailey in Manhattan.
Still, borrowers who choose to switch lenders when refinancing sometimes get stuck paying it anyway.
Here's why: in order to skip the tax when switching lenders, borrowers must arrange for their existing lender to assign, or transfer, the mortgage to the new lender. The new lender then recasts the old mortgage to meet the new terms. But lenders don't always agree to do what's known as an assignment -- a 1989 amendment to state law gives them discretion to reject such requests, according to Douglas Wasser, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.
''The resulting cost to borrowers can be thousands of dollars in taxes which could otherwise be easily avoided,'' Mr. Wasser said. ''I've personally seen borrower frustration on this issue many times.''
Rolan Shnayder, a partner and the director of new-development lending for H.O.M.E. Mortgage Bankers in Manhattan, says this problem arises ''all the time.'' In his opinion, some banks refuse to do transfers to encourage customers to refinance with them. ''Even if their bank is offering the best interest rate, what if the borrower just doesn't want to deal with their bank anymore, or wants to transfer to a different lender because they have other business there?'' Mr. Shnayder said. ''There are a lot of customers who wish they'd known their lender wouldn't do an assignment before they signed their mortgage.''
The assignment process (a Consolidation, Extension and Modification Agreement) requires more time and paperwork than the usual practice of just paying off the old mortgage. And both the old and new lenders must be represented at the closing table, Mr. Wasser said.
Borrowers will likely have to pay extra legal fees, along with the old lender's assignment fee. Those fees should be weighed against the tax savings.
''I tell clients, if the mortgage tax savings are less than a couple of thousand dollars, the time, effort, aggravation and cost may not be worth the result,'' Mr. Wasser said.
Also, borrowers should be aware that if their new loan is larger than the outstanding debt on the previous loan, they will be taxed on the difference. For example, if the unpaid balance on an old loan is $300,000, and the new loan is for $500,000, the borrower will be taxed on $200,000 in new mortgage debt.
Mr. Wasser recommends that borrowers always ask what a lender's policy is on transfers before signing on. ''An educated borrower,'' he said, ''might know that uncooperative lenders should be avoided.''

HEADLINE: A Liberal, but No Limousine

BYLINE: By JACOB BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
A couple of months ago, Cynthia Nixon sent Alec Baldwin an e-mail that had nothing to do with a potential film project, a play that either of them might have been considering or even what to do about pesky tabloid reporters (although both actors are familiar with those).
Instead, Ms. Nixon was writing because she had seen Mr. Baldwin on television discussing the New York mayoral race and saying that he was leaning against the perceived front-runner, Christine Quinn, the speaker of the City Council, and toward Bill de Blasio, the public advocate. Ms. Nixon explained that she was thrilled to hear this and that she hoped she might be able to persuade him to deliver a formal endorsement on behalf of her candidate.
Soon enough, an e-mail came from Mr. Baldwin that Ms. Nixon later described as ''completely adorable.'' In it, he apologized for having assumed -- ''lamely,'' in his words -- that Ms. Nixon would be supporting Ms. Quinn (both, after all, are famous lesbians), and that he would be happy to endorse Mr. de Blasio. 
Ms. Nixon's entreaties didn't stop with the ''30 Rock'' actor. Over the next several weeks, she piled up endorsements and donations from Tony Kushner, Susan Sarandon, Sarah Jessica Parker and Jon Robin Baitz, among others.
She organized an LGBT benefit for Mr. de Blasio that featured gender-bending performers like Justin Bond, Flotilla de Barge and Tina Turnstyle. She is also a key member of the Women for de Blasio committee.
''There are weeks where four or five days in a row, I'm doing something with Cynthia,'' Mr. de Blasio said. ''She's that fully involved with the campaign.''
None of this comes as much of a surprise to Ms. Nixon's friends, who, over the last decade, have seen her become more and more involved with a number of high-profile progressive causes and emerge, along with Mr. Baldwin and Sean Penn, as one of the more prominent celebrity activists on the political left.
In the last two years, Ms. Nixon has traveled around the country to campaign in states where amendments to legalize gay marriage were on the ballot. She has gone to Washington to speak for Planned Parenthood and to protest rollbacks of Roe v. Wade. She went to Florida and Virginia on behalf of President Obama's re-election effort and to Minnesota, on behalf of Al Franken, a senator from that state. ''She's not dabbling at all,'' Mr. Franken said in a phone interview. ''We had given her material on what I had done, but she really internalized it and put it together in her own way. She knows what she is talking about.''
And, with her spouse, Christine Marinoni, the former New York director of the Alliance for Quality Education, Ms. Nixon has been a tireless advocate for increasing financing to New York City's public schools.
''She's incredibly bright, and she understands that there is an opportunity for her to be a voice when others might not have that opportunity,'' Ms. Parker said. ''Cynthia can stand in the front at a rally and speak because she will bring attention; she will have a presence that creates curiosity.''
Ms. Nixon's work as an activist dates back to roughly 2001, when she was on ''Sex and the City'' and became an advocate on behalf of public education.
She had grown up in Manhattan and had attended public schools. Her father was a radio journalist who spent much of the '60s covering the civil rights movement, and her mother was an actress who trained with Uta Hagen.
When Ms. Nixon had children, she said she never considered sending them anywhere other than public schools. Then, a recession hit and the city was faced with budget cuts, just as Ms. Nixon's daughter was entering kindergarten. So Ms. Nixon sprang into action. (Ms. Parker called it ''kind of her gateway'' into politics).
''Anything that could be cut was cut,'' Ms. Nixon said last week over a late lunch at the NoHo Star, where she was sitting in a booth in a trim black peacoat from Bendel's, a pair of fitted jeans and cowboy boots. ''The school was so overcrowded, kindergarten classes were housed in trailers in the back.''
So Ms. Nixon began attending rallies -- even got herself arrested protesting at City Hall. ''We marched on up, sat down and blocked the entrance,'' she said. ''The police very politely asked us to move, and we declined. They pulled up the police van and put us in.''
Soon enough, Ms. Nixon met Ms. Marinoni, who until recently worked for the Alliance for Quality Education, as well as Mr. de Blasio.
''Bill was then, as he is now, very much the education guy,'' Ms. Nixon said. ''Not only from being a public school parent himself, but sitting on school boards and seeing as I see that public schools are the cornerstone to how our city works and how our city offers opportunity and plans for its economic future.''
Still, it was the actress's relationship with Ms. Marinoni that garnered the most attention in the tabloid press. Before their involvement, Ms. Nixon had been heterosexual. She had two children with Danny Mozes, a teacher and photographer she had met in high school.
But once Ms. Nixon fell in love with Ms. Marinoni (they married in New York last year), she quickly came out publicly and began doing work on behalf of gay rights.
Last year, Ms. Nixon drew the ire of a number of gay activists when she gave an interview to The New York Times Magazine in which she discussed her relationship with Ms. Marinoni and seemed to question the idea that being gay is a fixed identity for everyone and cannot ever be a choice.
''I probably should not talk about this now,'' Ms. Nixon said, pointing out that any attempt to extricate herself from a controversy invariably winds up prolonging it.
Nevertheless, the experience annoyed her, because she thought she was being attacked, and because she believes gay men and lesbians have a multiplicity of experiences that ought to be acknowledged and celebrated rather than muzzled for the sake of political correctness.
''Different strokes for different folks,'' she said. ''My view of my sexuality is just my view. It has nothing to do with your view of your sexuality or even my view of your sexuality.''
Today, Ms. Nixon and Ms. Marinoni live near SoHo with Ms. Nixon's two children from her relationship with Mr. Mozes, as well as a child Ms. Marinoni conceived in 2010. They buy groceries at Whole Foods and ride the subway everywhere.
''What am I going to do, take a limousine?'' said Ms. Nixon, who is proud of what ''Sex and the City'' did for women but somewhat less enamored of the way it celebrated conspicuous consumption.
''It's an aspect of the show I never liked,'' she said. ''I remember when we screened the first movie in London, when Mr. Big shows Carrie that closet he's built for her and the entire audience clapped. I found that devastating. Maybe that's a strong word, but I was disheartened. Because I thought: 'Is this what these women in the audience think true love is? A man who has enough money to buy you a walk-in closet?' ''
Similarly, she's uneasy with the changing face of New York and its growing disparity of wealth. She can rattle off statistics about the percentage of children living in poverty in the city today (30 percent), and is eager for a mayor who she thinks will fight harder to secure affordable housing for the poor and the middle class.
''I've got to say, I'm not anti-Chris Quinn,'' Ms. Nixon said. ''I worked alongside her in the marriage fight, and I believe she was incredibly eloquent and incredibly effective. But apart from that particular gay issue, I don't see a lot of stuff where I line up with her.''
And as Ms. Nixon sees it, there's something rather nice about finally being at a point when an openly lesbian actress can oppose an openly lesbian politician. ''I think it's a sign of progress,'' she said. ''It's like the smoke has cleared in some way and gays, blacks, Caucasians and everybody is able to see beyond the person that might look like them, and go more for the person's voting record or the person's plan for the city.''

HEADLINE: The Classical World Draws Tourists Back

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
The sun was blazing above the Acropolis, draping the ivory pillars of the Parthenon in a golden sheen. The red-tiled roof of the ancient Agora museum glimmered in the heat, and a breeze ruffled the boughs of olive trees. On the rough cobbles of Plaka, a cafe-lined tourist area, crowds of camera-toting visitors paused to soak it all in.
Kostas, a waiter at the Diodos taverna, which offers a splendid view of the scene, smiled. A year ago, amid a political and economic crisis that fueled protests in central Athens and pushed Greece toward the brink of exiting the euro zone, the surrounding streets were hauntingly empty. But on a recent Saturday afternoon, Kostas, who only gave his first name, was scrambling to find an empty outdoor table to accommodate patrons.
''Greece is back!'' he exclaimed. 
If last summer was a dark spot for tourism in this crisis-hit country, travelers are returning in greater numbers this year, lured by discounts of up to 20 percent on hotels in major cities and on Greece's stunning islands, as well as assurances -- at least for now -- that Greece won't be ditching the euro and returning to the drachma after all.
''The Greek government is stable, and we are no longer under speculation that Greece will leave the euro,'' said Xenophon Petropoulos, a spokesman for the Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises. ''The value-to-price ratio is excellent at the moment, and that's helping to bring tourism back.''
With reports of anti-austerity protests last year and early this year fresh in people's minds, however, the first question being asked by travelers is whether it is safe to visit Greece. The short answer is yes.
''You may have activity in Syntagma Square,'' Mr. Petropoulos said. ''But 500 meters away, people are drinking beer in Plaka.''
Indeed, the number of demonstrations has dropped and, as Mr. Petropoulos noted, they are largely confined to Syntagma Square. Recently, some Americans asked this reporter about the far-right Golden Dawn group, which has used violence against ethnic immigrants. But locals are pushing back with protests and occasionally direct confrontation, resulting in a mild decrease in the group's vigilantism. There have been no reports of violence toward tourists.
These days, the main nuisance for travelers is likely to be transportation strikes to protest austerity measures. They have sharply diminished but still pop up sporadically on the Athens metro, among air traffic controllers and on ferry boats to the islands. Visitors are advised to check the Living in Greece Web site, livingingreece.gr/strikes, for updates and to consult the Web sites of their national Athens-based embassies for strike, safety and other information before traveling.
None of those concerns stopped Jim Wiseley, a teacher at Gobles High School in Gobles, Mich., from bringing his class of around 30 students on a Classical tour of Athens. One sunny afternoon in April, he sat with his mother and some students at the foot of the sacred rock on which the Acropolis is perched, enjoying a meal he had picked up at a taverna: feta and olives, tomatoes, grilled meats and freshly made tzatziki.
Mr. Wiseley said the American tour company he used was worried about people canceling trips to Greece this year. As a precaution, the group's hotel reservation was moved from the center of Athens to a location about half an hour away. ''But that wasn't really necessary,'' he said. ''There have been no safety issues here.''
Geoff Baylee, 17, a student from Gobles, gazed at the Parthenon with awe. ''It's breathtakingly surreal, especially when you know that the ancient Greeks built it in 15 years,'' he said. Mr. Wiseley's mother, Joan, 73, said she had snapped up bargains on gold jewelry and accessories. With numerous stores shuttered in central Athens amid the crisis, some shops were giving school groups special discounts of up to 60 percent.
Greece sorely needs the business. The economy has shrunk by more than 20 percent in the last five years, and unemployment recently topped 27 percent. The government is still laboring to repay international loans, and many average Greeks continue to feel the effects of an austerity program that has cut incomes and fanned social hardship.
Despite the travails, Greeks remain welcoming. ''We are eager to see visitors enjoy the splendors of Greece,'' Mr. Petropoulous said. The country hopes to draw in more than 17 million tourists this year, after international visits slumped by 5.5 percent last year to 15.5 million, Alexandros Vassilikos, the head of the Athens-Attica Hotels Association, said.
Hotel prices in Athens and its suburbs have dropped an average of 45 percent in the last three years, as have room rates on numerous islands, he added. Hotels near Classical sites just a few hours' drive from Athens have also cut their prices, including Delphi and the well-preserved ancient theater at Epidavros, where some of the first Greek tragedies were performed.
But deals are now luring travelers from Northern Europe, the Middle East and especially China, where the Greek government has engaged in a special outreach to lure newly affluent tourists. Already, reservations for hotels and cruises through July are up about 20 percent over last year. Tourism from the United States is also rebounding. Through the first few months of 2013, flights originating in the United States were up double digits from a year ago, aided by a drop in ticket prices and a strengthening dollar, Jeremy Boore, an analyst at Expedia.com, said. Much of the renewed interest was in Greece's second-largest city, Salonika, called Thessaloniki by the Greeks.
Meanwhile, there has been strong growth in bookings for hotels in the Cycladic islands, especially Santorini and Mykonos.
Last year, visitors, fearful of what would happen to reservation deposits if Greece reverted to the drachma, canceled their bookings or put them off. That was especially the case at upscale hotels on islands like Mykonos. This year, Mykonos hotel bookings made online are up 20 to 30 percent, with offers like 10 percent discounts for early reservations and 14-day stays for the price of 12, said George Zachos, a manager at Kyklomar Tours in Mykonos. ''We just hope that the politicians will let us alone this year to work without any bad surprises,'' he said.
On a recent weekday, tourists jammed onto a Blue Star Ferries boat, which left from the Port of Piraeus outside Athens and wound its way toward Santorini. Despite three decks connected by escalator and elevators, the boat was filled to capacity to accommodate travelers who had been stranded in Athens the day before because of a ferry strike.
Although it is famed for its high lava cliffs and whitewashed houses, even Santorini is working to burnish its image and recapture visitors.
The island's tourism board has proclaimed this year the Year of Gastronomy dedicated to ''the fruits of the dry volcanic land.'' Food festivals will be held throughout the summer, linking tavernas and high-end restaurants with wineries and romantic hotels.
At the Angel Cave Houses, one of the many lodgings overlooking Santorini's caldera, rooms were almost completely booked from May to July, said Athanasia Chalari, a manager. She was offering up to 20 percent discounts for nonrefundable bookings, after offering 50 percent discounts last year.
''Little by little things are coming back,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Lot of Elephants in the Room

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
Some people have been waiting to see the house in ''Clybourne Park'' for 50 years. And there it is, on Long Wharf Theater's Mainstage -- not at its best, because the owners are leaving and the living room is strewn with moving boxes. But look at all that space and the handsome wooden staircase and the door that leads to a real backyard. No wonder Lena Younger, the heroine of Lorraine Hansberry's seminal 1959 drama ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' was so proud to be able to move her five-member family there, after living in a cramped two-bedroom apartment on the South Side of Chicago. To hell with the fact that everybody else in the neighborhood was white.
What Bruce Norris's ''Clybourne Park'' does is imagine what happened in that house when the outgoing residents (and their maid and her husband) are informed that the buyers are black. Then the play revisits the house half a century later, when both the neighborhood and race relations have changed considerably -- and a little bit not. By 2009, the neighborhood has been predominantly black for decades. Now a white couple have bought the house and want to replace it with a McMansion. 
''Clybourne Park'' opened in New York at the Off Broadway theater Playwrights Horizons in 2010, in London in 2011 and on Broadway last year. It won the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the Tony Award for best play. The play's brilliance is pretty much universally acknowledged. ''It brings up questions that don't really have answers yet,'' said Alice Ripley, the Tony-winning actress (for ''Next to Normal'') who plays Bev, the white housewife, in Act I, and a yuppie lawyer in Act II. ''But Bruce brings them up in a way that's so revelatory. I don't think anyone's ever asked these questions before.''
Those questions are not all about black and white. As Eric Ting, the director, observed, people tend to say race is the elephant in the room in both acts, but there is more.
''It's more a play about otherness,'' said Mr. Ting, Long Wharf's associate artistic director. ''Race is simply another aspect of that. It touches on genderism. It touches on social dynamics, classism, American xenophobia. There are a lot of elephants.''
LeRoy McClain, who plays the maid's husband in Act I and a financial executive in Act II, agreed. ''You have a deaf character,'' he said, referring to Betsy (Lucy Owen) in Act I. ''You have black characters. You have characters on the lower end of the economic spectrum.''
There is a gay character (Jimmy Davis) too, who announces his sexuality while everyone else is getting emotional over the offensiveness of a joke about interracial prison rape. ''I guess you think sex between men is funny,'' he says.
So it goes in our supposedly more enlightened age.
''In 2009 they speak frankly but not necessarily directly,'' Mr. McClain said, referring to the second-act characters. ''We still talk around the issue.''
''That's the tragedy of the piece,'' he added. ''It's a comedy, but there's also a lot of sadness to be found. We're afraid of offending other people. We're also afraid of painting ourselves in an unflattering light. 'I don't want to be branded as a racist or a sexist.' ''
The cast's challenge is to embody characters living in two periods with very different social norms. Mr. McClain's Albert, in Act I, is a midcentury African-American who automatically calls white people ma'am and sir. But internally he may have much in common with Mr. McClain's sophisticated Act II character, who has informed opinions about Prague as a vacation destination.
''One of the things we've taken great care to explore in this production is that it is 1959 and there are certain accepted racial and social codes that blacks were used to having to conform to,'' Mr. McClain said. ''But Albert's very aware of what's going on.''
As the scene unfolds, ''Albert's language becomes a lot more blunt and forthright.'' He and Mr. Ting also take great care, Mr. McClain said, to give Albert ''a lot of nonverbal communication,'' conveying ''all the frustration kind of distilled.'' Ms. Ripley said she actually found Bev, in Act I, easier to play than her 2009 character, because it is harder to step back and see our own era in perspective. She also relates to what she sees as her midcentury character's idealism, ''trying to bring people together.''
''She considers Francine a very good friend,'' she added, referring to Bev's maid, played by Melle Powers. But Ms. Ripley conceded that the feeling is probably a long way from mutual.
Audiences who have never even heard of the play that inspired Long Wharf's current production will have no trouble appreciating it. ''That's never been a requirement,'' Mr. Ting said.
But for those who are familiar with ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' he added, ''I think you understand a little more of the richness of the world that Bruce has written about so penetratingly.''
''Clybourne Park,'' by Bruce Norris, is at Long Wharf Theater, 222 Sargent Drive, New Haven, through June 2. Information: (203) 787-4282 or longwharf.org.

HEADLINE: The Gift of Siblings

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
GIVEN what a mouthy thing I grew up to be, it's shocking to me that I began talking later than most children do. But I didn't need words. I had my older brother, Mark.
The way my mother always recounted it, I'd squirm, pout, mewl, bawl or indicate my displeasure in some comparably articulate way, and before she could press me on what I wanted and perhaps coax actual language from me, Mark would rush in to solve the riddle.
''His blanket,'' he'd say, and he'd be right.
''Another cookie,'' he'd say, and he'd be even righter. 
From the tenor of my sob or the twitch of one of my fat little fingers, Mark knew which chair I had designs on, which toy I was ogling. He decoded the signs and procured the goods. Only 17 months older, he was my psychic and my spokesman, my shaman and my Sherpa. With Mark around, I was safe.
This weekend he's turning 50 -- it's horrifying, trust me -- and we'll all be together, as we were at his 40th and my 40th and seemingly every big milestone: he and I and our younger brother, Harry, and our sister, Adelle, the last one to come along. We marched (or, rather, crawled and toddled) into this crazy world together, and though we had no say in that, it's by our own volition and determination that we march together still. Among my many blessings, this is the one I'd put at the top.
Two weeks ago, the calendar decreed that we Americans pause to celebrate mothers, as it does every year. Three weeks hence, fathers get their due. But as I await the arrival of my brothers, my sister and their spouses in Manhattan, which is where we'll sing an off-key ''Happy Birthday'' to Mark and drink too much, my thoughts turn to siblings, who don't have a special day but arguably have an even more special meaning to, and influence on, those of us privileged to have them.
''Siblings are the only relatives, and perhaps the only people you'll ever know, who are with you through the entire arc of your life,'' the writer Jeffrey Kluger observed to Salon in 2011, the year his book ''The Sibling Effect'' was published. ''Your parents leave you too soon and your kids and spouse come along late, but your siblings know you when you are in your most inchoate form.''
Of course the ''entire arc'' part of Kluger's comments assumes that untimely death doesn't enter the picture, and that acrimony, geography or mundane laziness doesn't pull brothers and sisters apart, to a point where they're no longer primary witnesses to one another's lives, no longer fellow passengers, just onetime housemates with common heritages.
That happens all too easily, and whenever I ponder why it didn't happen with Mark, Harry, Adelle and me -- each of us so different from the others -- I'm convinced that family closeness isn't a happy accident, a fortuitously smooth blend of personalities.
IT'S a resolve, a priority made and obeyed. Mark and his wife, Lisa, could have stayed this weekend in the Boston area, where they live, and celebrated his 50th with his many nearby college buddies. Harry and his wife, Sylvia, could have taken a pass on a trip to New York: they're traveling all the way from the Los Angeles area, their home. But we made a decision to be together, and it's the accretion of such decisions across time that has given us so many overlapping memories, which are in turn our glue.
I'm also convinced that having numerous siblings helps. If you're let down by one, you can let off steam with another. ''There's always someone else to turn to,'' said George Howe Colt, the author of ''Brothers,'' a 2012 book about brothers through history and about his own three siblings, all male.
''It's like a treasure chest: you have access to a lot of different personalities,'' Colt told me. ''With my brothers, I turn to them all. But I turn to them for different things.'' That's how it is in our brood, too.
Perhaps because the four of us belong to the same generation -- just over eight years separate Mark and Adelle -- each understands the others better than our mother, now gone, could ever understand us, or than our father ever will. And while our parents gave us values, we inadvertently assigned ourselves the roles we play. Popularity came more easily to Mark, so I resolved to be the more diligent student, needing to find my own way to stand out. Because Mark and I made relatively conventional choices, Harry, for a while, made less conventional ones: his claim to a distinct identity.
That's how it goes in a pack of siblings, and I sometimes wonder, when it comes to the decline in fertility rates in our country and others, whether the economic impact will be any more significant than the intimate one. For better or worse, fewer people will know the challenges and comforts of a sprawling clan.
Those comforts are manifold, at least in my lucky experience. With siblings to help shoulder the burden of your parents' dreams and expectations, you can flail on a particular front with lower stakes and maybe even less notice. Siblings not only pick up the slack but also act as decoys, providing crucial distraction.
They're less tailored fits than friends are. But in a family that's succeeded at closeness, they're more natural, better harbors. As Colt observed of his siblings, and it's true of mine as well, they aren't people he would have likely made an effort to know or spend time with if he'd met them at school, say, or at work. And yet a reunion with them thrills him more than a reunion with friends, who don't make him feel that he's ''a part of a larger quilt,'' he said. His brothers do.
My friend Campbell, who's as fond of her two sisters as I am of my siblings, put it this way: ''With a friend, I have to be more articulate. With my sisters, I can be my most primal self: inarticulate, childishly emotional. I'll have a fight with my sister and say, 'O.K., I know we're in a fight, but I need your advice on something,' and we can just put the fight on hold. They're the only people in the world you can be your worst self with and they'll still accept you.''
My siblings have certainly seen me at my worst, and I've seen them at theirs. No one has bolted. It's as if we signed some contract long ago, before we were even aware of what we were getting into, and over time gained the wisdom to see that we hadn't been duped. We'd been graced: with a center of gravity; with an audience that never averts its gaze and doesn't stint on applause. For each of us, a new home, a new relationship or a newborn was never quite real until the rest of us had been ushered in to the front row.
This weekend we clap for Mark, and as I plot his dinner menu and hit the liquor store, I have to decode what he wants. It won't be difficult. I have decades of history to draw from, along with an instinct I can't even explain.

HEADLINE: California Faces a New Quandary, Too Much Money

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Ian Lovett contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- After years of grueling battles over state budget deficits and spending cuts, California has a new challenge on its hand: too much money. An unexpected surplus is fueling an argument over how the state should respond to its turn of good fortune.
The amount is a matter of debate, but by any measure significant: between $1.2 billion, projected by Gov. Jerry Brown, and $4.4 billion, the estimate of the Legislature's independent financial analyst. The surplus comes barely three years after the state was facing a deficit of close to $60 billion.
At first glance, the situation should be welcome news in a state overwhelmingly controlled by Democrats, who have spent much of their time slashing programs they support. After last November's elections, the party has two-thirds majorities in the Assembly and the Senate, relegating Republicans almost completely to the sidelines.
Instead, the surplus has set off a debate about the durability of new revenues, and whether the money should be used to reverse some of the spending cuts or set aside to guard against the inevitable next economic downturn. 
At least seven other states -- among them Connecticut, Utah and Wisconsin -- have reported budget surpluses in recent weeks, setting the stage for legislative battles that, if not as wrenching as the ones over cuts, promise to be no less pitched. Lawmakers are debating whether the new money should be used to restore programs cut during the recession, finance tax cuts or put into a rainy-day fund for future needs.
The debate reflects uncertainty about whether the revenue is a one-time event, a result of state taxes on wealthy residents selling off investments at the end of last year to avoid increased costs as the Bush-era federal tax cuts expired. But it also illustrates philosophical differences about the role of government, about spending versus taxes and about the need, as Mr. Brown argued, to learn lessons from a decade in which many states saw the bottom fall out from their revenue collections.
''We're seeing a change in conversation in state legislatures this year,'' said Todd Haggerty, a policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''They're not talking about how to close a budget gap anymore, which is a welcome relief after years of that during and after the Great Recession. Rather, states are having conversations about how to allocate increased revenues.''
Nowhere does that battle promise to play out with more force and intricacy than in California, the state that underwent perhaps the most severe retrenchments in the country.
Mr. Brown, a Democrat who has always had a fiscally conservative streak, is leading the don't-pop-any-Champagne-corks brigade, saying that he would oppose significant increases in new spending and that the money should go into a rainy-day fund. His administration put out the lower $1.2 billion estimate.
''A good deal of the surge of revenues that we have seen since the beginning of the year is the result of higher-income individuals being able to realize some of their gains at the end of 2012,'' said H. D. Palmer, the director of external affairs for the California Department of Finance. ''We don't believe it is prudent to budget on the capital gains. It wasn't that long ago when we had the same experience during the dot-com boom. We don't want to see that movie again.''
In one particularly revealing moment, the office of the independent legislative analyst -- which has a history of scolding governors for unrealistically optimistic budget projections -- dismissed Mr. Brown's figure as pessimistic, saying extra revenue was closer to $4.4 billion. The report undercut Mr. Brown just as he and lawmakers moved into the final stages of budget negotiations, and it empowered Democrats and social service advocates eager to reverse budget cuts.
''I support the governor's call to pay down more debt aggressively, I support the notion of a rainy-day fund,'' said Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tem of the Senate. ''But I also believe that we have an obligation to make some limited but important investments in restoring some of what has been lost over the last four or five years.''
Vanessa Aramayo, the director of California Partnership, a group of organizations pushing for social service spending, said Mr. Brown was deliberately understating the state's financial health.
''The governor is attempting to leave a legacy of solving our state budget crisis,'' she said. ''But he's doing so on the backs of poor people in the state.''
Other Democrats said the Legislature should proceed with caution, given the history of financial gyrations in California and, no less important, concern that any perception that Democrats were on a spending spree could prove politically damaging to the party.
John A. Pérez, the speaker of the Assembly, said that he supported putting revenues into a contingency fund, but that some of the money should go to increase spending on programs like college scholarships for middle-class students.
''It is still uncertain how much of this is one-time money and how much is ongoing money,'' he said. ''Anything that is clearly one-time money we should treat as one-time money. What we're mindful of is that historically in California, we have a greater degree of volatility than in other states.''
A capital-gains tax windfall from investors aside, the state has erased its deficit as a result of improving housing and stock markets, a temporary sales and income tax increase approved by California voters and the cuts in spending.
The debate over what to do next is not exclusive to California.
In Connecticut, local government officials want the Legislature to use $150 million in new revenue to reverse a $93 million cut in aid to local governments. It has not been an easy argument.
''We're competing with hospitals and some social service programs for those surplus funds -- along with the governor's desire to put the money back into a rainy-day fund,'' said James J. Finley Jr., the executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
In Indiana, Gov. Mike Pence called for using any surplus to finance a 10 percent cut in income taxes. But fellow Republicans who control the Legislature, after initially supporting that notion, reduced the tax cut by half, reserving the money for other programs.
''Coming off of a five-year recession, there were so many things that had been forgone during that period of time, like funding education and road infrastructure,'' said State Senator Luke Kenley, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. ''The public and the leaders felt there were important things we needed to take care of first.''
And in Wisconsin, Democrats have pushed the Republican-led Legislature to use as much as $2.1 billion in new revenue to undo cuts.
''Last budget we had a deficit of $3.6 billion, and the talk was about shared sacrifice and targeting our public employees,'' said State Senator Jennifer Shilling, a Democrat who is on the Budget Committee. ''We need to invest any additional revenue back into our middle class.''
The disagreement in California is between members of the same party. Assemblyman Bob Blumenfield, the chairman of the Budget Committee, disputed Mr. Brown's projection of the extra revenue.
''The only way the governor can possibly come up with his numbers is if you assume the worst on every single variable,'' he said. ''That's just not going to happen.''
''We've made some brutal cuts,'' Mr. Blumenfield said. ''There's a lot of pain that's been spread across California, and we can't ignore that. But we have to be smart. We have finally clawed our way to stability, and we're not going to squander it.''

HEADLINE: North Korea Glosses Over Tensions After Its Special Envoy Visits China

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
BEIJING -- North Korea put a positive spin Saturday on the visit of its special envoy to China, but made no mention of China's push for the North to resume negotiations aimed at ridding the country of its nuclear weapons program.
An account by the official Korean Central News Agency in Pyongyang, its first report on last week's visit by Vice Marshal Choe Ryong-hae, was at odds with portrayals in China's state-run news media, which emphasized President Xi Jinping's strongly worded appeal that North Korea rejoin the so-called international six-party talks that were abandoned in 2008 when North Korea walked out. 
The North's news agency said that the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, whose belligerent behavior has annoyed China, sent a personal letter to Mr. Xi that referred to the deep friendship between the two allies that ''cannot be exchanged for anything.''
While he was in Beijing, Vice Marshal Choe made general references to being open to dialogue but never specifically mentioned the six-party talks, which China sees as a way to cool tensions in the region that have contributed to the United States stepping up its presence.
Chinese and American analysts said Saturday that the visit by Vice Marshal Choe, a member of Mr. Kim's inner circle, showed that North Korea was rattled by the prospect of China's moving toward North Korea's prime adversaries in the coming month -- the United States and South Korea.
President Obama and Mr. Xi are due to meet in California in early June, their first encounter since Mr. Xi assumed the presidency. How to deter North Korea's recent behavior, including its recent nuclear test and firing of missiles, is certain to be one of the top topics.
Park Geun-hye, the new South Korean leader, will later visit Beijing.
The three-day trip by Vice Marshal Choe, possibly to try to set up a visit by Mr. Kim, seemed to do little to repair the troubled relations between China and North Korea, said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Peking University.
In the wake of the visit, China -- the North's economic benefactor -- might make some humanitarian gestures, like increasing food aid after it had been curtailed, Mr. Zhu said. But the fundamental split on the question of halting the nuclear program was striking, he said, especially when Vice Marshal Choe failed to take Mr. Xi's lead on the six-party talks during their meeting.
''Obviously without denuclearization on the agenda, Beijing will not welcome Kim Jong-un's visit,'' Mr. Zhu said.
Still, faced with Beijing's demands, he said it was possible that Mr. Kim might come around.
Even if Mr. Kim were to agree, analysts say the likelihood of a resumption of the six-party talks -- which involved China, the United States, North Korea, South Korea, Japan and Russia -- is remote. The Obama administration and South Korea have indicated that they would insist on a pledge from North Korea that it renounce nuclear weapons as a condition for resuming the talks, a demand the North has so far rejected.
Ms. Park of South Korea, who speaks Chinese and has spoken warmly of Mr. Xi, said that she and Mr. Xi can do business together on North Korea, an attitude that no doubt displeases Mr. Kim in the North.
Moreover, with a state visit to Beijing, Ms. Park will be given the kind of pomp that Mr. Kim would almost certainly be denied, possibly increasing pressure on him to cooperate more fully with China.
''Kim Jong-un isn't about to receive treatment that is even remotely equivalent'' to Ms. Park's, said Jonathan D. Pollack, a Korea expert at the Brookings Institution. ''But does that mean that Pyongyang is about to make any meaningful concessions that reduce the growing pressures directed against them? I detect no signs of this at all.''

HEADLINE: Lauren Consky, Daniel Scolnic

 BODY:
Lauren Rebecca Consky, a daughter of Helene I. Consky and Dr. Charles L. Consky of Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, is to be married there on Sunday at the Ravine Vineyard to Daniel Moshe Scolnic, a son of Dorene T. Scolnic and Rabbi Benjamin E. Scolnic of Hamden, Conn. The groom's father is to officiate, with permission from the Office of the Registrar General in Ontario. 
The bride, 30, is a director at DCI Group, a public affairs firm in Washington. She graduated from McGill University and received a master's degree in international relations and economics from Johns Hopkins University.
Her father is an oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Niagara Falls, Ontario; his practice is managed by the bride's mother. He is also the chief of dental medicine for the Niagara Health System in St. Catharines, Ontario; a clinical instructor in dentistry at the University of Toronto; and a lecturer in dentistry at the McMaster University School of Medicine in Hamilton, Ontario.
The groom, 28, expects to receive a doctoral degree in astrophysics from Johns Hopkins in September. He is studying accelerating expansion of the universe in an effort to define dark energy, the substance that physicists believe makes up roughly 70 percent of the universe. His research is conducted in Baltimore for the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, a program at the Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii financed by the Air Force, with the mission of finding asteroids on a collision course with Earth. Mr. Scolnic graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Last year, he was recognized by the governor of Maryland as a volunteer mentor of young refugees in Baltimore.
His mother is a social worker at Yale-New Haven Hospital, and provides support for heart-transplant patients. His father, the spiritual leader at Temple Beth Sholom in Hamden, is the author of ''If the Egyptians Drowned in the Red Sea, Where are Pharaoh's Chariots?'' and other books. He is also an adjunct professor of Judaic studies at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven.

HEADLINE: Kerry, in Africa, Presses Nigeria on Human Rights

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON; Lydia Polgreen contributed reporting from Johannesburg.

 BODY:
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- Making his first visit to sub-Saharan Africa as secretary of state, John Kerry urged Nigeria on Saturday to uphold human rights as it steps up its fight against Islamic extremists.
''One's person's atrocity does not excuse another's,'' Mr. Kerry said, when asked about reports of serious human rights violations by Nigerian forces.
''We defend the right completely of the government of Nigeria to defend itself and to fight back against terrorists,'' he added. ''That said, I have raised the issue of human rights with the government.'' 
Mr. Kerry's visit to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the African Union comes during a trip that is mainly devoted to Middle East diplomacy. Since he left Washington on Monday, Mr. Kerry has traveled to Oman, Israel and Jordan, to which he will return on Sunday.
Even in Africa, the Syrian crisis was on his agenda. Mr. Kerry conferred with the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on the international conference the United States is trying to arrange next month in Geneva with representatives of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the Syrian opposition.
Mr. Ban talked with Mr. Kerry about his meetings with Russian officials in Moscow. Mr. Kerry is scheduled to meet with the Russian foreign minister in Paris on Monday to discuss the planning for the Geneva meeting.
As Mr. Kerry visits Africa, Nigeria is stepping up its fight against Islamist militants; France is preparing to hand over to an African force much of the responsibility for protecting Mali from Islamic fighters; and tensions between Sudan and South Sudan have flared.
President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria recently declared a state of emergency in the country's northeast provinces and ordered air and ground assaults against Boko Haram, a militant group. But reports that Nigerian forces have carried out extrajudicial killings, including against civilians, have become a problem for the United States, which provides law enforcement assistance and has cooperated with Nigeria, a major oil supplier, on counterterrorism issues.
Earlier this month, Mr. Kerry, in a statement, noted ''credible allegations'' that Nigerian forces had been engaged in ''gross human rights violations.''
Mr. Kerry returned to that theme on Saturday in a joint news conference with Ethiopia's foreign minister, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Asked about reports of human rights violations -- there have been reports of large-scale civilian killings by the army and police in Nigeria -- Mr. Kerry said the Nigerian government had acknowledged that abuses had occurred.
''They are working to try to control it,'' he said. But revenge was not an adequate strategy, he said.
What is needed ''is good governance,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''It's ridding yourself of a terrorist organization so that you can establish a standard of law that people can respect. And that's what needs to happen in Nigeria.''
Before meeting with the foreign minister of Sudan, Mr. Kerry noted that he planned to send a special envoy soon to work on reducing tensions between the countries.
The difficulties, he said, went beyond border disputes and involved the concerns of residents in the South Kordofan and Blue Nile States of Sudan who did not want to be compelled by the Sudanese government to live by strict Islamic rules.
''You have people who for a long time have felt that they want their secular governance and their identity respected,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''That's the fundamental clash.''
The tensions, he added, had been exacerbated by the support rebels in Sudan had received from South Sudan.
Mr. Kerry was scheduled to meet with the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, later on Saturday. At a March meeting in Cairo, Mr. Morsi promised to move ahead with negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, and Mr. Kerry announced that the United States would provide $250 million in assistance to Egypt. But concerns have mounted since that Egypt is not prepared to undertake serious economic overhauls.
The African Union, the organization that Mr. Kerry is in Ethiopia to celebrate, remains, half a century in, a work in progress. First molded by the Pan-African ideals of Kwame Nkrumah, who led Ghana in the 1950s and '60s when it became the first African state to break its colonial bonds, the union, then known as the Organization for African Unity, emphasized African self-reliance and independence.
But those notions quickly curdled into a doctrine that led African leaders to believe that they were above reproach. Autocratic, corrupt leaders like Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo; Idi Amin of Uganda; and Félix Houphouët-Boigny of Ivory Coast earned the organization the nickname ''dictator's club.''
In the 1990s, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, who saw the body as a way to extend his influence on the continent, bankrolled its reorganization as the African Union. Colonel Qaddafi pushed the idea of transforming Africa, a collection of postcolonial fragments divided by borders that were drawn arbitrarily by Western powers, into a vast, unified state that could play a powerful role in global affairs.
In 2009, Colonel Qaddafi was chosen as the African Union's chairman. His swearing-in ceremony looked like a coronation, and traditional African leaders hailed him as the ''king of kings.''
Thabo Mbeki, the former South African president, also tried to exert influence on the African Union, leading the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which he hoped would offer an alternative to Western-imposed aid and development plans. Its progress, like most African Union projects, has been mixed.
The African Union has increasingly taken a leading role in peacekeeping missions in some African conflicts.

HEADLINE: Up, Up and Away

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL. 
An economics reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE values of gold and silver have dropped like a stone in international trading markets. Coffee futures are hovering near a three-year low. But the price of one commodity has been rising as if it were lighter than air -- and in this case, well, it is.
The market value of refined helium gas has nearly doubled over the past five years, even as the Standard & Poor's benchmark commodities index, the GSCI, has fallen by some 20 percent. 
It's not a bubble. That's because the price has been driven up less by speculation than by old-fashioned fundamentals: there's more demand for the gas than ever and supply has not been able to keep up. Call it, rather, ''the helium balloon.''
The world, it seems, is running short of the second most abundant element in the universe -- and that's creating a major problem in a wide array of businesses.
You may think of helium as important only to birthday-party balloons and Frankie Valli impressions, but the gas has an extraordinary number of biomedical, industrial and national security uses, playing critical roles in the production or operation of M.R.I. machines, fiber-optic cables, flat-screen TVs, semiconductors, space launches, welding, military surveillance, air-to-air missile guidance and much else.
For many of those uses, moreover, there are no known substitutes. Helium's low boiling and melting points, the lowest of any element, make it ideal for cryogenic applications. And as the second lightest element, it's great for lifting things, from weather balloons to national-security dirigibles.
While abundant in the universe writ large, however, helium is not easy to capture. Much of the helium on earth leaks into space, and with only 5.2 parts per million in the air, it's not economically feasible with current technology to extract the stuff from the atmosphere. Instead, most of the helium that is sold on the market originates in natural gas fields underground and is salvaged as a byproduct of natural gas. Even then, only a handful of fields have a high enough concentration of helium to make extracting it financially worthwhile.
What makes this market saga particularly quirky, though, is the role played by the United States government. For much of the 20th century, the federal government had a domestic monopoly on the production of helium, which was used for airships, missile guidance and other national security measures. In 1960, it began a program to stockpile the helium it was extracting in an underground reservoir near Amarillo, Tex., amassing a debt of $1.3 billion in the process.
When, in the mid-1990s, lawmakers decided to pay down that debt, the government gradually started to sell off its helium holdings. But Congress made some odd decisions in that regard.
Typically, when the government wants to sell a public resource or asset to the private sector -- as with the wireless spectrum -- economists advise holding an auction so taxpayers get the highest price that the market will bear.
At the time, though, Congress determined that the market price was too low to cover its debt, according to John R. Campbell, publisher of CryoGas International and president of J. R. Campbell & Associates, one of the world's leading consulting firms on gases. So instead lawmakers just set a minimum price for the government's helium -- one that was about twice what buyers were paying on the open market at the time.
At first, buyers balked. But over the decade that followed, demand for helium in the private sector increased so much -- particularly in places like Taiwan and Korea, where the gas is used in manufacturing electronics -- that the government's price inevitably became the market one. Today, the price -- still set by a government formula -- is, if anything, lower than what the market would otherwise bear.
Just look at what has happened to the price of refined helium, the form of the gas sold to M.R.I. manufacturers and the like, which has nearly quadrupled since 2000.
The sky-high refined helium prices have forced Tokyo Disneyland to suspend the sale of balloons and disrupted the work of academic scientists who use helium for research projects in cryogenics and nanotechnology. And the shortages are about to get worse.
That's because, due to an odd technicality in the helium privatization law enacted in 1996, the government will effectively end sales from the reserve once its debt is paid off -- something that could happen as early as October, even though there's still a huge reservoir of helium left in the till.
Walter L. Nelson, director of helium sourcing and supply chain at Air Products and Chemicals, told a Senate committee earlier this month that ''30 percent of the worldwide supply will be essentially locked up, causing prices to skyrocket.'' That, he said, will leave some users with no ability to get the gas and will mean ''chaos in the economic sectors that now rely on helium.''
Lawmakers are now considering revising the law to let reserve sales continue even after the debt is paid, which helium users say would give other private sources of the gas in places like Qatar enough time to finally get onstream. There is also talk of introducing regular auctions to allow the helium price to float up or down to wherever the ''true'' market price is.
But the bottom line, says David C. Mowery, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, is that ''you've had lawyers doing natural resource economics. That's almost never what you want.''
No doubt, plenty of TV manufacturers, aerospace technicians and sad clowns would agree.

HEADLINE: Indians Grow Impatient With Taciturn Premier Amid Troubles

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- He speaks so softly that even his public comments are sometimes nearly inaudible. He has not held a formal news conference in India since 2011. And a pack of reporters were driven to hold a protest recently when he refused to participate in the routine political act of being photographed while filing for re-election in Assam State.
When India's technocratic prime minister, Manmohan Singh, came to office in 2004, his obvious shyness was widely applauded as a virtue, a sign of the probity and quiet dignity of this accidental politician. 
In recent months, however, Mr. Singh's diffidence has taken on a darker cast as he refuses to address a growing number of controversies swirling around him. The magazine India Today ran a cover article this month titled ''Dr. Dolittle,'' which called him a political liability. Tehelka, another major newsmagazine, asked on its cover, ''How long can the prime minister evade scrutiny in a season of scams?''
Rajdeep Sardesai, a television journalist and analyst, labeled Mr. Singh's reserve a curse in a recent column in The Hindustan Times.
''His silence is now construed as weakness, his limited communication seems evidence of a leader with much to hide, and the 'privacy' argument is now seen as a sign of political nonaccountability.''
The prime minister's wallflower personality has come to define India on the world stage. When Chinese troops camped out for weeks recently on mountainous territory claimed by India, Mr. Singh's muted response infuriated opposition politicians. And as the world's great powers -- the United States, China and Russia -- have sought closer ties with India in recent years, Mr. Singh has either quietly rebuffed them or left them wanting more.
Troubled by corruption scandals, Mr. Singh's Indian National Congress Party and its coalition partners in the government must face voters no later than next year. Their great hope is that a lackluster economy will rebound by then to provide enough of a lift to overshadow the coalition's missteps.
The most damaging controversy concerns the corrupt allocation of licenses to mine coal. Mr. Singh was the coal minister when the licenses were given out, so his role is central. But the country's leading corruption investigator revealed this month that Mr. Singh's office had demanded changes to what was supposed to be an independent inquiry into the scandal.
Mr. Singh's personal integrity, a signature asset in a country awash in political corruption, was suddenly in doubt. Members of his own party began calling for his resignation, albeit in anonymous remarks. Even allies who still believe in his honesty say that he is failing.
''In the Congress Party, people generally think that he is honest,'' a senior member of the party said in a recent interview, speaking on the condition of anonymity so that he could discuss internal party affairs. ''But they think, 'What is the point of this honesty?' It must be reflected in the quality of administration.''
Opposition politicians demanded the resignation of the law minister and, because of a separate bribery inquiry, the railways minister as well. And they renewed calls for Mr. Singh to resign as well. In the past, India's governing coalition has blithely brushed aside such demands. But after repeated criticism by commentators for a failure to act, Sonia Gandhi, the president of the Congress Party, met with Mr. Singh on May 10, and the resignations of the two ministers were announced the same day.
That meeting demonstrated once again the odd dynamic at the top of India's government. Mr. Singh holds administrative power; Mrs. Gandhi holds political power. Does Mr. Singh run the government or does Mrs. Gandhi? It is a question that has been asked again and again for nearly a decade, but it is one that neither Mr. Singh nor Mrs. Gandhi has chosen to answer convincingly. Even insiders say they have trouble explaining the relationship between the two, and a top party official recently said publicly that having two power centers had not worked well.
The two leaders sought this week to dispel rumors of a rift between them by publicly praising each another. ''There are no differences between the prime minister and me,'' Mrs. Gandhi said Wednesday. ''There is collective leadership.''
Few analysts interviewed were persuaded. ''It's taken an excessively long time for commentators to recognize how thoroughly incompetent as a prime minister Manmohan Singh is and how politically weak he has always been,'' said Ramachandra Guha, a historian and analyst.
The government's two-headed power structure has resulted in a confusing mix of policies. Over the past nine years, India's government has built a vast infrastructure of welfare programs to feed and employ the rural poor and give them access to private hospitals -- programs thought to result from Mrs. Gandhi's socialist tendencies. But the government has also sought to attract foreign investment by opening protected sectors of the economy like retail and airlines to foreign competition -- policies thought to result from Mr. Singh's economic realism.
''Sonia and Manmohan have long been at odds on basic issues, and that has resulted in policies and politics that are at best confused and at worst contradictory,'' said Sanjaya Baru, a former spokesman for the prime minister.
One of the few bright spots for the governing coalition is that its main political opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party, is in disarray. It was trounced this month in elections in a southern state, Karnataka, and a crucial ally in Bihar State has threatened to end its alliance. Its most prominent leader is a man reviled by many Muslims for having failed to prevent bloody riots in 2002.
So despite its many setbacks and worsening poll numbers, the governing coalition could win again next year. Some commentators have even suggested that Mr. Singh may serve a third term as prime minister, in part because Rahul Gandhi, Mrs. Gandhi's son, does not seem to want the job.
Pankaj Pachauri, the prime minister's spokesman, said the government's main problem was that neither Mr. Singh nor Mrs. Gandhi liked to brag, so few were aware of the government's accomplishments. As a result, the government this month began a $3 million advertising campaign focusing on its achievements and recently released statistics showing major gains in income and life expectancy and decreases in infant and maternal mortality.
''The gift of this prime minister to this country is five years of extra life for everyone,'' Mr. Pachauri said. ''And that's why Dr. Singh and Mrs. Gandhi have full confidence in each other.''

HEADLINE: Who Will Crack the Code?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- IRELAND and Singapore have no natural resources that make them obvious places to manufacture the concentrate used in soda, nor have they developed innovative new soda-making techniques. Yet they have nonetheless become global capitals for making soft-drink concentrate.
In Singapore, Coca-Cola recently opened a plant with the capacity to produce the underlying ingredient for 18 billion cans of soda a year. In Cork, Ireland, PepsiCo has located its ''worldwide concentrate headquarters,'' which until 2007 had been in New York. More than half of all PepsiCo soda sold around the world starts, as concentrate, in Ireland.
What Ireland and Singapore share is a low corporate tax rate. And because soda is such a simple product, with so much of its financial value stemming from the concentrate, Coke and Pepsi can reduce their overall tax rates by manufacturing it in low-tax countries.
Partly as a result, the industry paid a combined corporate income tax rate -- spanning federal, state, local and foreign taxes -- of only 19.2 percent over the past six years, according to an analysis for The New York Times by the financial research group S&P Capital IQ. The average rate for the companies in the Standard & Poor 500 was 29.1 percent. 
The soda industry's success at legally avoiding taxes shows why so many economists and tax experts believe the United States corporate-tax code is terribly flawed. It includes a notoriously high statutory rate that causes companies to devote resources to avoiding taxes. But it has so many loopholes that the effective corporate tax rate in the United States is slightly lower than the average for rich countries.
The decline in corporate-tax collection in recent decades has contributed to budget deficits. It has also aggravated income inequality: a company's shareholders ultimately pay its taxes, and with a smaller tax bill, shareholders, who tend to be much more affluent than the average American, see their wealth increase.
''It's clearly a broken system,'' said Michelle Hanlon, an accounting professor at M.I.T.
Corporate taxes burst into the spotlight last week, with the release of a Senate committee report on Apple's tactics to reduce its tax payments. More quietly, but perhaps more significantly, the House Ways and Means Committee has begun work on a potential overhaul of the tax code. Edward D. Kleinbard, a tax expert and former Democratic Congressional aide, said he had been impressed so far by the seriousness of the committee's work.
The effort has a long way to go, but if it succeeds, both liberal and conservative tax experts hope it will reduce the statutory rate while also eliminating tax breaks. The net effect could be to close the gap between companies that pay relatively little in taxes and those that pay much more. The market, rather than the tax code, would then play a bigger role in determining companies' success and failure.
Many voters, meanwhile, want to see companies paying higher taxes. In a Gallup poll last month, 66 percent of respondents said that corporations paid ''too little'' in taxes, compared with 61 percent who said the same about upper-income people, and 19 percent who said the same about lower-income people.
Low-tax companies are often large, global companies with the ability to use accounting maneuvers to shift earnings around the world. Having intangible assets (like a computer algorithm) or portable ones (like soda concentrate and pharmaceutical ingredients) can also help.
Carnival, the cruise-ship company, paid a minuscule 0.6 percent of its earnings in taxes over the past five years, according to Capital IQ. Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which owns the St. Regis, Sheraton, and W chains, paid 8 percent.
Amazon.com paid 6 percent; Boeing, 7 percent; Apple, 14 percent; General Electric, 16 percent; Google, 17 percent; eBay, Eli Lilly and Raytheon, 19 percent; and FedEx, 23 percent.
Individual executives also matter. The most creative can ''play a significant role'' in reducing taxes, according to a published study by the accounting professors Scott D. Dyreng, Edward L. Maydew and Ms. Hanlon. They built a database of 908 top executives who switched companies and identified some who were successful at holding down taxes wherever they went.
The professors did not name names. But a few executives -- like John Samuels, head of the General Electric tax department -- are famously shrewd.
Some companies with low tax rates, including Coca-Cola, have recently started a lobbying group called the LIFT America Coalition. Their main goal is to protect their advantages, if not bring down their taxes further. Other companies, like General Electric, are also major donors to Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and to Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
ON the other end of the corporate-tax spectrum are smaller companies and those whose businesses tend to be tied down, less easily moved than Coca-Cola syrup or technological know-how. The retailers Best Buy, CVS, the Gap and Whole Foods each paid a combined rate of between 35 percent and 40 percent over the past five years. Wal-Mart paid 31 percent. Oil companies also pay relatively high rates, with Exxon Mobil at 37 percent.
To many economists, a fairer system would not lavish billions of dollars of tax breaks on only some industries for reasons that are almost accidental. ''No one likes the current system,'' Donald Marron, a former official in the George W. Bush administration who is now at the Tax Policy Center in Washington, said, speaking for his fellow economists if not for corporate executives.
Why, for example, should the government tax a retailer that sells soda at a much higher rate than a company that makes soda? Public-health experts note that the soft-drink industry is an especially odd candidate for taxpayer generosity, given its central role in increasing obesity and health costs.
Mr. Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California, says the only kind of overhaul that can get through Congress is one that reduces the headline corporate tax rate, from its current 35 percent to between 25 and 28 percent. In exchange, Congress would also most likely force companies to pay more taxes on their overseas profits.
Business lobbyists like the LIFT coalition are pushing for the opposite: lower overseas taxes. They say that Washington puts American companies at a disadvantage by trying (if often failing) to tax their overseas operations on top of the taxes that foreign governments collect. Instead, many companies want a so-called territorial system, in which only the local government imposes a tax.
The weakness in such a system, of course, is that some countries allow companies to operate almost tax-free. And in a globalized economy, many companies have figured out how to put much of their operations in those countries. Thus Ireland has become the world's cola maker.
One compromise being discussed in Congress is a version of the territorial system -- but with a minimum tax for any overseas operations. If companies were not paying at least that minimum to a foreign government, they would have to pay the difference to Washington.
So many companies are paying such low tax rates that even a modest minimum tax may result in a tax increase. Doubtless, though, the companies and their lobbyists will do the work to figure out how any proposed overhaul will affect them. If Congress is really going to reverse the long slide in corporate tax collection, it will have to make enemies along the way.
Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: More Guns In the Sky

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS DAWIDOFF. 
Nicholas Dawidoff is the author of five books, including the forthcoming ''Collision Low Crossers.''

 BODY:
Confidential. For N.R.A. internal. Now that the Senate has voted down new gun control laws and we have the president on the defensive -- never thought I'd say it, but God bless the I.R.S.! -- we have a real opportunity to guide Congress along a common-sense path that will further ensure the freedoms of peaceful, law-abiding citizens. Herewith, talking points on the next crucial phase of our work. Please distribute to all concerned elected officials who share our love of liberty and public safety.
Objective: 
We aim to pass laws that will allow passengers to carry guns on commercial airplanes; this will make business class the safest place in America.
Talking Points:
Experts say, ''This is the most progressive means of preventing hijacking in aeronautic history.''
Air Marshals are good people, but on a modern aircraft anyone can nod off. Our plan mitigates snoozing risks. And consider the budget savings when every flyer becomes a Citizen Air Marshal (CAM).
CAMs eliminate the need for uniformed personnel patrolling our nation's terminals. Now trained personnel can be deployed to the domestic and international hot spots, including war zones and schools.
Duty-free ammo sold on international flights is good for the American economy.
Airport gun marts are another surefire economic success story.
Metal detectors are costly; we make them instantly obsolete.
The appealing smell of well-oiled metal provides a fragrant antidote to exotic French cheeses in carry-on bags.
All that fresh fowl available just out the window offers a local and sustainable improvement for in-flight meal quality and is also far more nutritious than snack-packs.
Popping a cap is an excellent fallback means of summoning flight attendants when in-seat situations are urgent and the call button is on the fritz.
Travelers trapped in the toilet can now disable locks and free themselves without disturbing anyone.
Long flights are the ideal venue for time-consuming and oft-delayed projects like gun cleaning and improving clip-changing speed, where every microsecond counts.
Finally, a few suggested P.S.A. ''situationals'' you can use with video to help you sell the consumer benefits of our new initiative:
The ordinary ticket-holder at last has recourse in the face of lengthy delays.
All flights to Houston overbooked? One lone bumped citizen can personally divert the 9:20 to Minneapolis.
You're charging me baggage fees? Don't think so, bud.
What do you mean I can't stow my hunting dogs in the overhead?
Listen neighbor, you sure you don't want to trade me for my middle seat?
Twenty-third in line for takeoff? Hello, priority!
Air pressure hurting your ears? D.I.Y. vent creation, baby.
Annoying dude back in row 35 won't shut up about his golf game? Hey Tiger Woods, meet my shooting iron!
O.K., fellow citizens. Keep fighting the good fight. It makes no sense to insist on guns being checked in baggage where they are of no use to anybody. If the good guys can't have guns on planes, only the bad guys will have guns on planes. We get this done and then we move on to our goal of co-sponsoring with the N.F.L., helping it improve player safety with our suggestion that the offense and defense be armed during games. And remember, air guns don't kill people, air people do.

HEADLINE: Alien, Yet Familiar

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
BURBANK, Calif. -- In a dimly lighted editing suite here on the Warner Brothers lot, blinds drawn for maximum secrecy and walls decorated with signs and posters celebrating ''Star Wars,'' Indiana Jones and ''Game of Thrones,'' Zack Snyder was discussing his philosophy on the totemic character who arguably gave rise to every fantasy series of the last 75 years: Superman.
For too long, said Mr. Snyder, the director of ''Man of Steel,'' a new Superman movie that Warner Brothers will release on June 14, modern-day interpretations of this DC Comics superhero had been apologizing for the outdatedness of his origins; they sought to conceal him in contemporary trappings instead of embracing an essential mythology that, he said, was as bulletproof as the character himself.
''When they try to dress him up,'' Mr. Snyder said here a few weeks ago, ''put him in jeans and a T-shirt or a leather jacket with an S on it, I go: 'What? Guys, it's O.K. It's Superman. He's the king daddy. You should all be bowing down to him.' '' 
What his film tries to do, he said, is ''respect the S.''
At this point, Deborah Snyder, Mr. Snyder's wife and producing partner, had to correct him on one fundamental detail they had updated for ''Man of Steel.'' ''It's not an S,'' she said with a laugh. ''It's a symbol of hope.''
Hope is a quality that Mr. Snyder, a director of comic-book adaptations like ''Watchmen'' and ''300,'' and his colleagues have been clinging to as they finish work on ''Man of Steel,'' an entrant in the crowded summer-movie arms race more than two years and $175 million or more in the making.
Yes, ''Man of Steel'' is the latest effort to rejuvenate a decades-old pop-culture franchise and, in doing so, renew both the fortunes of Warner Brothers as it searches for new blockbusters and the career of Mr. Snyder after recent misfires. But it is being built on the back of a character who, for as often as writers and filmmakers have lately tried to reinvent him, has proved particularly unsusceptible to attempts to make him more relatable. Audiences seem to want him to be grounded, at the same time that they want to believe he can fly.
It is strange that Superman, the smiling, soaring Moses-Jesus hybrid who ushered in the era of superhero comics, should be struggling at the multiplexes in an age when every other studio movie seems to feature a man in a cape, a mask with pointy bat-ears or a high-tech suit of iron. The qualities that have made Superman timeless have not necessarily made him relevant to this particular time, with its roster of ironic and loudly violent protagonists, but it was this paradox that made Mr. Snyder eager to take him on in ''Man of Steel.''
''He's a really cool mythological contradiction,'' said Mr. Snyder, who is still boyish and scruffy at 47. ''He's incredibly familiar Americana and alien, exotic, bizarroland, but beautifully woven together.''
He added: ''All of us, in a weird way, are that same kind of contradiction -- no one's that simple.''
His film stars Henry Cavill of ''The Tudors'' as Kal-El, a survivor of the destroyed planet Krypton who on earth becomes the costumed champion Superman but disguises himself as the all-too-human Clark Kent.
''Man of Steel'' retains traditional elements, like Superman's tension between his natural Kryptonian father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), and his adopted earth dad, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner), and his attraction to the perpetually imperiled Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams).
The film also emphasizes the world of Krypton before its annihilation -- a bleak, utilitarian planet with sophisticated if downright creepy technology -- and the treachery of the Kryptonian villain Zod (Michael Shannon), who finds Kal-El on earth. The result is an unapologetic science-fiction spin on Superman, and while that may shatter audiences' expectations for pure, unalloyed realism in ''Man of Steel,'' Mr. Snyder said this approach was built into the DNA of the character.
''If you follow him back logically and try to understand him,'' he said, ''you end up at a sci-fi solution.''
This was the same conclusion reached by Christopher Nolan, the director whose hit ''Dark Knight'' films have modernized Batman for the paranoid post-Sept. 11 era, and the screenwriter David S. Goyer when they first conceived of ''Man of Steel'' while puzzling over the plot of ''The Dark Knight Rises.''
Though Mr. Goyer grew up admiring the Norman Rockwell-esque charm of the 1978 ''Superman'' movie, directed by Richard Donner and starring Christopher Reeve, he never felt much connection to its hero.
''I used to imagine that I was Batman,'' Mr. Goyer said, ''but not Superman.''
His thinking changed when he looked at Superman in his earliest incarnation, written and illustrated by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in the late 1930s. Here was a character whose fundamental mythology was still in flux -- even his signature power of flight was not yet established, and he instead leapt great distances -- and whose most transformative quality had seemingly never been seized upon.
''If he really were an alien,'' Mr. Goyer said, ''when the world finds out that he exists, that in itself would be the biggest event in human history. That would change the world forever.''
While writing the script for ''Man of Steel,'' Mr. Goyer became a stepfather, a father and lost his own father, experiences that he said informed the who-am-I angst that his Superman struggles with.
''There's a scene in the movie,'' Mr. Goyer said, ''where a younger Clark basically says to Jonathan Kent, 'Why do I have to listen you? You're not my dad.' Which is exactly what my stepson said to me.''
Mr. Nolan, a producer of ''Man of Steel,'' said he thought of Mr. Snyder to direct the film because of his stylized takes on ''300'' and ''Watchmen,'' and his ''innate aptitude for dealing with superheroes as real characters.''
''That was what a new approach to Superman required,'' Mr. Nolan said. ''He understands the power of iconic images, but he also understand the people behind them.''
That Mr. Snyder had essentially dismantled the conventions of comic-book narratives in ''Watchmen,'' adapted from the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons about superheroes in a despairingly real world, did not dissuade Mr. Nolan from offering him the assignment.
''It's ironic but it's a very productive irony,'' Mr. Nolan said with a chuckle. ''You're dealing with a filmmaker who has deconstructed this mythology and now has to reconstruct it. That's a fascinating challenge for him.''
Yet, when Mr. Snyder was approached for ''Man of Steel,'' it was something he and Ms. Snyder had to think about. ''We were both, like, 'I don't know,' '' he recalled. ''Is Superman cool? Is that good? Do we want to do Superman?''
Like his ''Man of Steel'' collaborators, Mr. Snyder had difficulties sympathizing with the extraterrestrial and all-powerful character, a fact that was not helped by the many attempts at reinventing Superman in recent years.
In the last decade alone, he has been the focus of any number of comic book reboots, the television series ''Smallville'' and Bryan Singer's 2006 film ''Superman Returns,'' a homage to Mr. Donner's movies that never quite took off the way the ''Dark Knight'' movies did. Yet Superman remains a character no one wants to give up on, for reasons both nostalgic and economic, and because, as Mr. Snyder put it: ''This iconography is tested. It's in our psyches.''
What drew Mr. Snyder in as he first read the ''Man of Steel'' script (while Mr. Nolan and his wife and producing partner, Emma Thomas, waited in his driveway) was a vision of the character that felt both classical and contemporary. On the one hand, Mr. Snyder suggested that for Clark Kent to be fully fleshed out, not every moment in his maturation needed to be depicted.
''We assume that Clark is not a virgin -- I do,'' he said. " You don't see that, but that's the assumption.''
But as the ultimate version of a familiar story, that of a young man struggling to find his place in the world -- ''teenage angst on steroids,'' Mr. Snyder called it -- this Superman's tale contained elements he and Ms. Snyder had never seen before.
Ms. Snyder said, ''Finding a bearded Superman on a crab boat, it was like, wait a minute, that's not the Superman that we're used to.''
For Mr. Snyder, there was also the joy of casting prominent actors like Mr. Costner and Mr. Crowe, as well as Mr. Cavill, who had once been hired to play Superman in a canceled 2004 film whose fluctuating lineup of talent included McG as director and J. J. Abrams as screenwriter.
In a phone interview, Mr. Cavill was blasé about his previous dalliance with Superman. ''That whole movie fell to pieces,'' he said, ''then another movie got made, not involving me.''
Having finally made ''Man of Steel'' almost a decade later, Mr. Cavill said he had learned to appreciate a hero who has spent his whole life hearing that he is special, while being told just as often that he must conceal the things that make him unique.
''Perfection without effort is, in itself, not perfection,'' he said. ''It's just gifted. Just being right because you exist isn't interesting. Doing the right thing, through hard work and the right decisions, is a better character.''
Mr. Snyder recognized that ''Man of Steel'' did not fit neatly into his oeuvre of stylized B-movies like his ''Dawn of the Dead'' remake and ''300,'' a retelling of the battle of Thermopylae, but he said he saw overarching connections.
''I feel like my movies have always been very subversive, even when people haven't perceived how subversive they really are,'' he said confidently. ''For me, what's subversive about Superman is that it's not subversive.''
That résumé also includes Mr. Snyder's 2011 action movie ''Sucker Punch,'' about an unlikely squad of heroines, which was pilloried by critics and sold $89 million in tickets worldwide on a budget of $82 million. Discussing that film, Mr. Snyder seemed to vacillate between acceptance that ''Sucker Punch'' had been a failure and disappointment that its larger ideas, about the depictions of women in fantasy narratives, had not been more widely received.
''Talking to people, they're like, 'No, that's not the movie that I saw,' and I'm like, 'But it's all there!' '' he said. ''I thought I was being too obvious with everything.''
Perhaps the greater frustration for Mr. Snyder was the fact that ''Sucker Punch'' -- filmed from an original script he wrote with Steve Shibuya, and not adapted from any comic book, video game or breakfast cereal -- had been rejected at a time when moviegoers are clamoring for original ideas, while they continue to go in droves to see franchise films (including, potentially, ''Man of Steel'').
''People complain but it's supply and demand,'' he said. ''The movie business is the first business that changes course. If suddenly everyone's like, 'Oh, people want to see movies about rabbits,' that's all you're going to get.''
Asked if he faced additional pressure to make ''Man of Steel'' work as the starting point for its own continuing series, Mr. Snyder said, ''This movie needs to come out,'' before any bigger questions could be addressed. ''If you start thinking, like, I need to set up a giant franchise for the studio because they're out of 'Harry Potters,' you can't do that,'' Mr. Snyder said, adding that it would lead to paralysis.
''You'd just stay in your house and curl up in a fetal position,'' he said, ''waiting for 'em to take you to the insane asylum.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Shift Poses Risk to Pakistan

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
From multibillion-dollar military aid to stealthy and secretive drone strikes, Pakistan, perhaps even more than Afghanistan, has been the central focus of America's 12-year war on Islamist militancy.
Now, as President Obama's landmark policy speech on Thursday made clear, all of that is changing. Drone strikes are dwindling, the war in Afghanistan is drawing to a close and the battle against Al Qaeda is receding.
Pakistani leaders who have long demanded an American exit from their region may get their wish, but a broader disengagement is also likely to diminish the financing, prestige and political importance Pakistan held as a crucial player in global counterterrorism efforts, and could upset its internal stability.
The diminution of the drone campaign may ease a major point of friction between Pakistan and the West, but the tribal belt in northwestern Pakistan, where about 360 drone strikes have landed in the past decade, remains a hotbed of Islamist militancy, largely outside government control. Although many senior leaders of Al Qaeda sheltering there have been felled by C.I.A. missiles, they have been largely replaced by committed Pakistani jihadists with ties that span the border with Afghanistan. 
With American combat troops leaving Afghanistan in 2014, and the drone campaign already winding down in Pakistan, analysts fear that unless the Pakistani Army can assert itself conclusively, the tribal region could be plunged into deeper chaos.
''It's going to be a lot of trouble,'' said Hasan Askari-Rizvi, a Pakistani academic and defense analyst. ''If the insurgency increases in Afghanistan, it will spill into Pakistan's tribal areas, where the Taliban will become very confident.''
For 12 years, the United States' security-driven policy has shaped power, politics and militancy in Pakistan.
After 2001, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who came to power in a military coup, established himself as a steadfast ally of the West; it underwrote his authoritarian rule, which lasted until 2008. The military received almost $17 billion in American military aid, and transfers of American military hardware, solidifying its position as the dominant arm of the state.
That relationship has also fostered resentment, and some Pakistani leaders welcome an American disengagement.
They blame America's muscular presence -- expressed through troops in Afghanistan and espionage and drone operations in Pakistan -- for an Islamist surge that has killed tens of thousands of Pakistanis, and they argue that it has been a recruiting tool for militant groups like the Pakistani Taliban.
''Less American involvement is good, not bad,'' said Hina Rabbani Khar, who served as foreign minister in the last government, and who said she warmly welcomed the tone of Mr. Obama's speech on Thursday. ''Drones help us lose the war. And the ideological space for these terrorists is the supposed U.S. occupation of Afghanistan. Once that excuse is not there, these people will have to face the music.''
America's dogged pursuit of fugitives linked to Al Qaeda -- first in Pakistan's cities, later in the tribal belt along the Afghan border -- led to a two-faced policy toward Islamist militancy. Pakistani officials secretly accepted, and in some cases encouraged, the American drone program, while condemning it in public as a violation of sovereignty.
Similarly, under pressure from Washington, Pakistan helped the C.I.A. arrest some jihadists, while it quietly sheltered other armed militant groups, like the Afghan Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, who were seen as furthering Pakistani interests in Afghanistan and India.
The American presence also created a giant blind spot in Pakistan's political psyche: with so much focus on American operations, Pakistani leaders used the United States as a scapegoat to avoid tackling some homegrown problems. Lurid tales of American espionage and other skulduggery abounded in the news media, promoted by politicians and mullahs but also fanned by real-life controversies like the shooting of two Pakistanis by the C.I.A. contractor Raymond Davis in January 2011.
Now that calculus is shifting for Pakistani policy makers. From now on, they will be less able to rely on the cloak-and-dagger workings of the drone program to have it both ways. Indeed, many fear a replay of the early 1990s when, after the departure of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the United States withdrew abruptly, leaving behind a cadre of fired-up Islamist fighters, and then imposed sanctions on Pakistan for its nuclear weapons program.
Behind the bellicose speech, there is a complex dependency on both sides. While Pakistan's powerful generals have grown to resent the United States, they also lean on American military aid as a steady source of income in an economy so shaky it may soon require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The generals also rely on transfers of American military hardware to keep their fleet of F-16 fighters in the air.
General Musharraf, the former president, recently admitted that he had secretly authorized American drone strikes in the tribal belt in the early days of the campaign, from 2004. Four years later, Pakistani officials quietly helped the United States assassinate Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, in a missile attack.
''I don't care if they do it as long as they get the right people,'' Yousaf Raza Gilani, then prime minister, told American officials in 2008, according to an American cable published by WikiLeaks in 2010.
Among the wider Pakistani public, though, the drones stoked anger, particularly over the issue of civilian casualties -- a factor acknowledged by Mr. Obama last week. At the same time, the C.I.A.'s success in assassinating senior Qaeda figures in the tribal region reduced the number of available targets.
Recently, as concern over drones mounted in the United States, the number of strikes in Pakistan dropped sharply, from about 130 at their peak in 2010, to just 12 so far this year. Civilian deaths also fell sharply, as the United States cut back on so-called signature strikes against clusters of militant suspects, which had caused the most casualties.
Now, Mr. Obama announced Thursday, American drones will attack only militants who pose an imminent threat to the United States, virtually ruling out strikes against the Pakistani Taliban, whose stated goal is the creation of an Islamist caliphate in Pakistan.
Still, the shift signaled good news for Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister-designate, who has vowed to make Pakistan less dependent on the United States. A scaled-back drone campaign will, at the very least, be one less issue to argue over.
It will, however, continue to exist, even if greatly diminished.
''This doesn't change much for Pakistan,'' insists Ahmed Rashid, author of several books on militancy in the region. ''The fact that the campaign will remain under the C.I.A., surrounded in secrecy, is quite depressing for Pakistanis.''
The central factor now, experts say, is the American withdrawal from Afghanistan next year. The United States will seek a smooth exit from the conflict; Pakistan will seek to retain influence in its western neighbor, while ensuring the flow of money and military assistance from the West.
As ever, the relationship is shaped more by threats than possibilities, a stark contrast with Washington's trade-based relations with Pakistan's traditional rival, India.
Still, few doubt that America will remain deeply involved in Pakistan, a country with a growing population of more than 180 million people, a network of seemingly indefatigable jihadi groups and a stockpile of over 100 nuclear warheads.
The question now is how Washington will pursue those enemies, and what level of cooperation it will enjoy from its Pakistani allies. ''The Pakistanis look to the U.S. for financial and other support; the Americans are pursuing senior Al Qaeda,'' said Shamila N. Chaudhary, a former Obama administration official, now with the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based risk consultancy.
''Even after 2014, that mutual dependency will not go away,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Hone the Job You Have Into One You Love

BYLINE: By SHANE J. LOPEZ. 
Shane J. Lopez is a senior scientist for Gallup and the author of ''Making Hope Happen: Create the Future You Want for Yourself and Others.''

 BODY:
OVER the past few months, American workers have been suffering from a major case of spring fever. Many of them, for the first time in years, are thinking about testing the waters of the slowly improving economy. They are looking for better jobs than those they've been clinging to throughout the recession. Maybe, they think, they can even find a job they love.
Based on my study of a representative sample of more than 8,000 American workers collected by Gallup, people who love their jobs: 
Use their strengths every day, as do their co-workers.
Feel that they are an important part of their organization's future.
Are surrounded by colleagues who care about their overall well-being.
Are excited about the future because of a leader's enthusiasm and vision.
So where can you find the special listing of jobs that meet these criteria? You won't find a special section of ''Jobs You Will Love'' in the classifieds or on Monster.com. There are no ads that read: ''Hopeful leader seeking employee who wants to love her job. Must be willing to do what she does best for many hours a day and feel that her fellow employees and I care about her. In exchange, she will be valued as an important part of our organization's future and receive a decent salary.'' That's because the jobs people love are made, not found.
By studying people who love their work, I came to realize that almost none initially landed the jobs they loved; rather, they landed ordinary jobs and turned them into extraordinary ones.
Amy Wrzesniewski, professor of organizational behavior at the Yale School of Management, says people reinvent their jobs by exercising the little bit of control they have at work. Through what she calls job crafting, people can reshape and redefine their jobs. In a paper she co-wrote, she says you can use your knowledge of what you do best to choose ''to do fewer, more, or different tasks than prescribed in the formal job.'' Changing the quality and amount of interaction with your colleagues, she says, can bring a renewed sense of belonging and purpose.
Making small changes in our daily activities can make a job more rewarding and engaging, but people who love their jobs also have bosses who inspire them, get the most out of them and truly care about them. That's no accident. People who want the most from their work go boss-shopping. They may change shifts or make lateral moves in a company or industry to work for bosses who can become influential leaders in their lives.
I interviewed a workplace consultant as part of a research project on people who love their jobs. She told me she'd been looking for a boss who would tap into her sense of purpose. Just as important, she wanted a boss who trusted her. That's what she got after she requested a switch to a new team in her company. She said her new boss ''treated me as an owner of the work and of the relationships I had with clients, and I felt the need to rise to the level of talent she must have thought I had.''
Should we teach soon-to-be college graduates to look for a good boss, one who inspires enthusiasm about the future? Brandon Busteed, executive director of Gallup Education, thinks so. ''At the end of every interview, everyone always asks: 'Do you have any questions?' '' he observes. ''That's when you should ask things like: 'How do you provide feedback to employees on how they are doing? What do you focus on: my strengths or my weaknesses?' ''
He added, ''And if the manager interviewing you never asks about you as a person or never does or says anything that shows they care about you -- that matters, too.''
A LOVE-WORTHY job isn't just for a privileged few -- say, those who went to certain schools or otherwise have the right résumés. With a deep understanding of what drives you and what you are best at, you can make almost any job more lovable.
I recently interviewed a person who makes this case. A clerk in a university maintenance center, she bounded up to me, proclaiming, ''I love my job!'' She described how she enjoys completing unexpected tasks and solving puzzling problems, always volunteering for work that others might find too demanding or involved. When I asked her why more people don't love their jobs, she said, ''Maybe they need more hope.''

HEADLINE: 'A' Is for Avoidance

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Even before last week's Senate hearing on Apple, it was clear that the aggressive use of tax havens and other tax avoidance tactics had become standard operating procedure for global American companies.
Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard were the focus of a similar Senate hearing last September, while Google, Amazon and Starbucks have drawn recent scrutiny in Europe. And, of course, there is General Electric, which achieved a perfect zero on its United States tax bill in 2010. In fact, G.E. was reputed to have the world's best tax avoidance department until Apple came along with tactics to stash some $100 billion in Ireland without paying taxes on much of it anywhere in the world and, apparently, without breaking any law.
And that is the problem. Rampant corporate tax avoidance may not be illegal, but that doesn't make it right or fair. 
As corporate tax revenue has withered as a share of the economy and as a share of total revenue, Washington has leaned more heavily on individuals to pay for government. In 2012, personal income taxes and payroll taxes raised $1.9 trillion, compared with $242 billion raised from corporate taxes, a disparity that contributes to widening inequality and, in turn, to a slow economy and less social mobility. Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that fully taxing the profits sheltered abroad by American corporations would raise an additional $42 billion in revenue this year, enough to end more than half the spending cuts in the sequester.
Yet it is not clear that lawmakers are committed to stopping widespread tax avoidance. Instead, they may further entrench the system, or even make it worse. The most immediate issue involves a tax repatriation holiday. Under the law, American corporations can defer paying tax on their profits as long as the money is held abroad. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing for a tax holiday, which would permit corporations to bring their foreign-held profits to the United States over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate.
A tax holiday in 2005 dropped the rate from 35 percent to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and boost investment, but it was a total policy failure. The repatriated money was mostly used for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance pay for employees laid off in corporate restructuring. The holiday rewarded aggressive tax avoidance, with 77 percent of the repatriated profits coming from tax haven countries, according to the Government Accountability Office.
Worse, that tax holiday encouraged American companies to come up with even more ways to shift profits abroad in anticipation of a second tax holiday. Since the last holiday ended, profits held in foreign countries have skyrocketed, according to expert testimony at the tax avoidance hearings in the Senate last year. American corporations now have an estimated $2 trillion stashed abroad.
Some American corporations are also lobbying for a new ''territorial'' tax system, which would, in effect, be a permanent holiday: profits made or shifted abroad would be forever untaxed in America, even if the country where the profits were held was a haven with no or low taxes. That would further encourage the shift of jobs, investment and profit abroad -- exactly the wrong policy direction.
Equally pernicious is the notion, shared by members of both political parties, that corporate tax reform should be ''revenue neutral'' -- meaning that it should simplify the code but not raise any taxes. That is absurd. It would leave the nation chronically short of revenue and increasingly reliant on working people to shoulder the tax burden.
Global corporations present difficult issues for which there are no easy answers, but it is clear what we should not do. And there are steps that can be taken in the short run to curb abusive tax avoidance. Corporations should be barred from deducting expenses against foreign-held profits on which taxes are deferred, as is currently allowed. Congress also needs to end a practice known as ''check the box,'' which allows companies to easily create the requisite corporate structures to shift profits offshore. Tax rules and enforcement must be tightened to ensure that profits attributable to patents, design, marketing and other intangibles developed in the United States are indeed taxed in the United States. A more permanent fix would end tax deferral of foreign-held profits, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.
The revelations in the hearings on Apple and other companies have given Congress all the evidence it needs to justify new corporate taxes. But there are no signs yet that it has the courage to impose them.

HEADLINE: The Oil Extremists

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. SEMPLE Jr.

 BODY:
The federal Energy Information Administration reported in March that at some point this year -- maybe in the fall, maybe next month, maybe tomorrow -- United States crude oil production will surpass imports for the first time since 1995. This is an important milestone. It does not mean that America has reached energy independence, not by a long shot. That is and will remain an elusive dream for a country that uses one-fifth of the world's oil while possessing little more than one-fiftieth of its reserves.
What it represents, instead, are two remarkable developments: one, technological refinements that have allowed the oil industry to tap large and previously inaccessible deposits of oil and gas, mainly on private land in places like Texas and North Dakota; and two, a steady decline in oil consumption, driven in part by new automobile efficiency standards aimed at doubling the fuel economy of cars and light trucks. 
You would not know any of this if you listened only to Doc Hastings, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and his like-minded Republican colleagues in the House. To hear them tell it, domestic oil production has fallen off a cliff (when in fact it is at a 21-year high, despite cutbacks in the Gulf of Mexico following the BP oil spill) and the oil industry is in chains, paralyzed by conservationists and federal regulators who cling to environmental values, like the need to preserve a measure of wilderness for wildlife and humans alike.
Mr. Hastings and friends tried hard in the last Congress to undermine many basic environmental laws and open up huge swaths of America's public estate, onshore and offshore, to drilling, including the coasts of Maine, California, Oregon and Washington (Mr. Hastings's home state), as well as all the waters off Alaska. That they failed has not diminished their appetites. Last week, one of Mr. Hastings's subcommittees held hearings on several bills that would destroy much of the balance between resource preservation and extraction that President Obama and Ken Salazar, former interior secretary, sought to achieve.
One bill, from Scott Tipton of Colorado, would essentially establish energy development -- mainly of fossil fuels -- as the primary use of the public lands. A second, from Doug Lamborn, also a Republican from Colorado, would overturn the Obama administration's sensible reforms of the oil and gas leasing process by setting impossibly tight deadlines for drilling permits, discouraging citizen participation and lawsuits. The bill would also reinstitute a discredited Bush administration plan to extract oil from shale rock in the Rocky Mountains.
The third bill, from Mr. Hastings himself, would fast-track federal approval of drilling permits, roads and pipelines in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve, a 23-million-acre reserve rich in both wildlife and fossil fuels and long a source of contention between industry and conservationists. The Hastings bill would nullify Mr. Salazar's carefully balanced compromise by giving oil development top priority.
On Wednesday, the full House approved a bill giving Congress the power to approve the hugely controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. It was an essentially meaningless vote since this is Mr. Obama's decision to make. But the argument advanced for the pipeline -- that it is essential to America's energy independence and thus its security -- is the very same argument that the Republicans have made to justify their proposed pillage of federal lands. It is an argument that Mr. Obama has resisted so far and should continue to resist for the rest of his term.

BUDGET BARGAINING
In 2011, lawmakers struggled with how to address a multibillion-dollar revenue shortfall. Now, the Legislature has a much different problem. Tax collections are surging and state coffers are flush, in large part because of an oil drilling boom. 
Before the session began, it was clear that three issues would drive the budget debate: restoring the 2011 education cuts, finding money for water infrastructure projects and addressing a financing crisis at the Texas Department of Transportation.
With a Rainy Day Fund of about $12 billion, some legislators were hopeful that all three could be resolved. That became less likely as a debate emerged among Republicans: Is the fund there to address revenue needs during recessions and in the event of natural disasters? Or is it meant to preserve the state's high bond ratings so that lawmakers can continue borrowing money cheaply? Rick Perry and a contingent of Tea Party-friendly Republicans insisted that the latter was crucial, and they pushed for withdrawing as little from the fund as possible.
Others said the state would be just fine with a savings account $6 billion lighter. A deal backed by budget leaders last week had legislators spending about $3.9 billion from the fund.
As the factions fighting for school and water financing gained traction, those focused on transportation were not as successful. Transportation Department leaders said the agency needed to address congestion, but lawmakers did not get worked up over the issue this session.
In the final week, Democrats resigned themselves to coming up short of their goal to fully restore $5.4 billion in cuts to education. But far-right lawmakers and conservative activists also failed in their efforts to maintain all the cuts. AMAN BATHEJA

 BODY:
If Texas' less-than-theatrical 83rd legislative session is remembered at all, it will be known for accords, not discord.
Lawmakers put down their partisan swords to expand financing for water infrastructure, women's health, public education and the mentally ill, steering almost entirely clear of bitter ideological battles over immigration enforcement and abortion.
The state's Republican majority pulled its weight in a few major areas: passing legislation requiring drug screening for unemployment benefits and blocking measures opening the door for an expansion of Medicaid, the joint state and federal health care program for children, the disabled and the very poor, under the federal health care overhaul.
But Republicans themselves warded off some of the session's most anticipated battles, like Senator Dan Patrick's ''school choice'' effort to finance scholarships so public school students could attend private schools. 
And House Speaker Joe Straus's reluctance to tackle redistricting -- though Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and Attorney General Greg Abbott wanted to -- was an effort to keep Democrats in the fold. That effort seems unlikely to last if the governor calls legislators into a special session on the issue.
Indeed, many of the lawmakers' hardest-fought initiatives this session -- preventing wrongful convictions and prosecutorial misconduct, overhauling high school diploma requirements and high-stakes testing, and curbing the authority of regents of the state's public university systems -- did not fall along party lines.
Behind the curtain, there were many forces at play: a more robust state budget; the biggest freshman class in years; a Republican base just small enough to require allegiances with Democrats or the Tea Party, depending on the issue; and the soon-to-be-revealed political aspirations of Mr. Perry, along with the chessboard of elected officials waiting for him to make his move.
In many ways, the most gripping stories of the 2013 legislative session happened outside the House and Senate chambers. EMILY RAMSHAW
SPECIAL SESSIONS
Special sessions are like ''Fight Club'': other than Gov. Rick Perry and his trusty dachshund, Lucy, nobody knows for sure if and when there will be one, and nobody knows what it will be about. But this being a legislature, everyone feels free to speculate. Lawmakers have talked among themselves about the possibility for weeks.
Mr. Perry has said he wants lawmakers to address water and transportation issues, cut taxes and write a balanced budget that leaves enough money in the Rainy Day Fund to maintain the state's triple-A bond rating. If they do not complete his wish list, he could summon them for a special session on one of those topics.
As this session came to a close, the only open question was whether the tax cuts that were made were big enough to keep the governor happy, but a hitch in any of those issues could force lawmakers into overtime.
A couple of other issues remain. A state district judge found Texas' financing plan for public schools unconstitutional. Lawyers on both sides expect an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. Depending on the content and timing of a ruling by the top court, legislators could be forced to return for a special session before their regular session in 2015 to patch the budget.
Then there is redistricting. Attorney General Greg Abbott wants lawmakers to ratify court-drawn maps that were used in 2012, freeing the state from defending maps drawn by lawmakers in 2011 that are still tangled up in litigation. If the governor agrees to go along, that could mean a quick special session -- perhaps as early as this week.
And Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst has a list of special session topics, too: anti-abortion bills, drug screenings for welfare recipients and allowing the carrying of concealed firearms in university buildings. ROSS RAMSEY
SPECIAL INTERESTS
Special interest groups on the far right were a noisy bunch this session, but in many ways their bark was worse than their bite.
When the conservative advocate Michael Quinn Sullivan took aim at an expensive water deal or a transportation-financing plan that would have raised vehicle registration fees, the Tea Party set in the House showed strength in numbers.
Still, the influence of groups like Mr. Sullivan's Empower Texans and the Texas Public Policy Foundation was mixed, particularly when compared with their successes in 2011.
Their efforts to keep the Rainy Day Fund intact have failed; the legislative budget deal would ask voters to spend $2 billion of it for water projects. Any tax relief approved this session will be smaller than they had hoped for. While they avoided a Medicaid expansion under the federal health overhaul, there has been little movement to formally ask the Obama administration for block grants.
Other groups had bigger successes. Homebuilders, who played a key role in blocking immigration enforcement legislation last session, helped derail a measure to crack down on worker misclassification and payroll fraud in the construction industry.
In legislation to prevent wrongful convictions, the Texas defense bar successfully removed language requiring defense lawyers to open their files to prosecutors. The measure only forces prosecutors to turn their records over to the defense.
But Texans for Education Reform and Texans Deserve Great Schools, two groups that tried to pass school choice legislation, underperformed, despite hefty spending. Although they got the cap on charter schools raised, there will be no scholarships to send public school students to private schools. EMILY RAMSHAW
BUDGET BARGAINING
In 2011, lawmakers struggled with how to address a multibillion-dollar revenue shortfall. Now, the Legislature has a much different problem. Tax collections are surging and state coffers are flush, in large part because of an oil drilling boom.
Before the session began, it was clear that three issues would drive the budget debate: restoring the 2011 education cuts, finding money for water infrastructure projects and addressing a financing crisis at the Texas Department of Transportation.
With a Rainy Day Fund of about $12 billion, some legislators were hopeful that all three could be resolved. That became less likely as a debate emerged among Republicans: Is the fund there to address revenue needs during recessions and in the event of natural disasters? Or is it meant to preserve the state's high bond ratings so that lawmakers can continue borrowing money cheaply? Rick Perry and a contingent of Tea Party-friendly Republicans insisted that the latter was crucial, and they pushed for withdrawing as little from the fund as possible.
Others said the state would be just fine with a savings account $6 billion lighter. A deal backed by budget leaders last week had legislators spending about $3.9 billion from the fund.
As the factions fighting for school and water financing gained traction, those focused on transportation were not as successful. Transportation Department leaders said the agency needed to address congestion, but lawmakers did not get worked up over the issue this session.
In the final week, Democrats resigned themselves to coming up short of their goal to fully restore $5.4 billion in cuts to education. But far-right lawmakers and conservative activists also failed in their efforts to maintain all the cuts. AMAN BATHEJA
BAD BEHAVIOR
For those who reach for the popcorn whenever they spot drama unfolding on the House or Senate floor, the 2013 session was a bit of a letdown. Lawmakers largely sidestepped the most contentious issues, at least in public.
It would have been hard to surpass the riveting theater of 2011, in which a House member displayed a transvaginal probe as a debate prop, and protesters cried ''Criminal!'' and ''Treason!'' from the Senate gallery over the death of a bill that would have criminalized invasive body searches by Transportation Security Administration employees.
Much of that session's rancor centered on volatile issues related to abortion and illegal immigration that Gov. Rick Perry had deemed ''emergency items.'' He did not designate any emergency items this session.
Even fights over the budget have been more congenial, an unsurprising outcome given that the Legislature has had the luxury of debating where to invest rather than where to cut.
The angriest debates emerged in the fight over a measure to create a state innocence commission. During a Senate committee hearing, the brother of an exoneree who died while wrongly imprisoned shouted at Senator Joan Huffman, Republican of Southside Place, over her pivotal opposition to the bill. Days later, the bill's author, Representative Ruth Jones McClendon, Democrat of San Antonio, began using a parliamentary procedure to kill several of the senator's bills in retaliation for Ms. Huffman's opposition.
On Tuesday night, Democrats used several delay tactics to run out the clock on a bill to create a drug-testing regimen for some welfare beneficiaries. But they could not forestall a bill on drug tests for unemployment benefits. AMAN BATHEJA
TOP LEADERS
Two years ago, Rick Perry was at the height of his power, driving the Legislature to produce tough new restrictions on abortion, pass new curbs on lawsuits and enact deep budget cuts. This session, he fell into a more traditional role: nudging a lot and threatening when necessary, but otherwise compromising, even with Democrats.
Mr. Perry played a major role in knocking off a bill that would have used increased fees to pay for expanded transportation financing. He also put a lot of political capital behind passage of a $2 billion water infrastructure upgrade and a large business franchise tax cut.
While he still has veto power, Mr. Perry faces the prospect of making concessions on the details. Though he insisted on $1.8 billion in tax cuts, the Legislature was, at last check, leaning toward giving him less. Education financing, at the insistence of Democrats, is also set to rise more than Mr. Perry had urged.
House Speaker Joe Straus and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst faced similar pressure to compromise. Mr. Straus had initially criticized Mr. Dewhurst's plan to let voters decide whether money should be taken out of the Rainy Day Fund to pay for water, transportation and education programs. In the compromise reached by the two chambers, voters will be asked to approve financing for only water projects.
''The legislative process, when it's working normally, forces people to move off their ideal position,'' said Jim Henson, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a Texas Tribune pollster. ''It does look like everyone's going to have to give a little something.'' (U.T.-Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.) JAY ROOT
FRESHMEN
Even geniuses have to learn the ropes. Somewhere in the Legislature's huge freshman class, there may be a genius. It is too early to know.
This much is known: 41 people in the 150-member House were serving in their first legislative session, along with three former representatives who returned after losing their seats in 2010. The 31-member Senate got six new members this year.
The big numbers in the House led to some substantial changes. For example, a group of conservatives banded together several times during the session to influence debates on the budget, pensions and ethics legislation.
This freshman class will be more influential when the members learn their way around the Capitol. The traditional advice for new legislators is blunt: ''Sit down and shut up.'' Many of them took that seriously. Some did not. And some got schooled for opening their mouths in debate, with senior members ribbing them good-naturedly as they presented their first bills, and much more roughly when they challenged or amended other bills -- especially for political reasons.
The freshman class and the large sophomore cohort together include most state officeholders who might be classified as exponents of the Tea Party. When they are engaged, they can swing issues, like using the state's Rainy Day Fund. That is partly because of their numbers and partly because other Republicans are wary of crossing Tea Party voters who have an outsize voice in primary elections.
That power can only grow when they gain some experience. ROSS RAMSEY
WHAT'S NEXT
The Legislature has all but finished the business of the regular 2013 session, and all eyes will be on Rick Perry as he weighs major decisions on the policy and political fronts.
First, he will have to decide whether to sign or veto the state budget, which might not have everything he wanted; a tax cut, which probably will not reach the $1.8 billion he insisted on; and scores of other measures -- from new ethics rules to education reforms -- hurtling toward his desk. He has until June 16 to sign or veto legislation; if he does neither, the legislation becomes law.
Even if the must-pass budget legislation survives, there are several avenues toward a special session this summer and beyond.
Attorney General Greg Abbott wants a session so the Legislature can adopt the redistricting maps put into place by the federal courts. And if voters do not approve financing for an enormous water infrastructure plan, lawmakers could be back sooner rather than later to find the money.
Later, a fix for the school financing system, already deemed unconstitutional by a state court, might prompt another.
All the while, Mr. Perry will have to decide whether he is running for re-election, running for president, or both. Or even none of the above.
He has said that he will send a signal about his future in June, just months before the filing deadline for the 2014 elections. There are numerous signs he will step aside and let Mr. Abbott become the heir apparent. But Mr. Perry is keeping the decision under wraps, and anyone who knows him has learned to expect the unexpected. JAY ROOT

HEADLINE: On the Horizon, Five Reasons to Smile

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
THE state of the economy is far from ideal, but some very definite positives are brewing. It's not just that we are continuing to recover from a deep recession; we are also seeing signs that America's long-term future may be looking up, too.
The case for optimism is hardly open-and-shut. The economy's problems include high unemployment, mediocre productivity gains and stagnant or slow-growing earnings for most income classes. Still, let's consider five indicators that the future is starting to brighten: 
MORE DIPLOMAS The nation's high school graduation rate has risen -- to 78 percent in 2010, the Education Department says in its most recent estimate. That's obviously still not where it should be, but it's the highest figure since 1974. (For a long time, the rate was under 70 percent. After decades of stagnation, the graduation rate started to turn up in 2000, and the growth has been robust for more than a decade.)
On average, these additional high school graduates -- not to mention college degree recipients -- will find better jobs and enjoy better health, long-lasting benefits that will be reaped for many decades.
NEW KNOWLEDGE, LESS COST When it comes to education, an even greater productivity gain may be on the way. This month, for instance, the Georgia Institute of Technology announced a new online master's degree in computer science, for a price of no more than $7,000.
It's part of a trend toward less expensive education and certification. The examples are numerous: the Khan Academy offers free online instruction in mathematics and other topics, and Coursera and other companies have popularized online courses for millions of users.
How far these trends can be pushed is unclear, but it can no longer be argued that the basic technologies of education haven't changed in decades or even centuries.
LOWER HEALTH CARE INFLATION The growth rate in health care costs has been slowing for the last four years. In some years, in fact, it's been no higher than the growth rate of the economy as a whole. And much of the change appears driven by efficiencies, rather than by the recent recession. This is documented in a paper by David M. Cutler, an economics professor at Harvard, and Nikhil R. Sahni, a fellow at Harvard Business School; it appeared in the May 2013 issue of Health Affairs.
This cost deceleration isn't guaranteed to stick, but the danger that sharply rising health care costs, compounding over time, will crash the entire economy is now somewhat reduced.
POWERING AMERICA FOR LESS We appear to be at the start of a new era of cheap energy. Through advances in both oil and natural gas production, the United States is again becoming a leading exporter of fossil fuels.
Many of the nation's economic troubles, like slow productivity and income growth, began about the same time that America's first age of cheap energy came to a sudden end, in the early 1970s. The effect of today's energy boom on broader productivity remains to be seen, but it could prove a source of further gains. Unfortunately, cheap natural gas isn't the path toward sustainable green energy, although it is cleaner than coal and has helped the nation make some progress in reducing emissions.
MOBILIZING THE CREATIVE This final development, concerning the fate of talent in lesser-developed nations, is perhaps the most fundamental. If you were born a genius in Shanghai in 1960, for example, your chances of making much contribution to the larger world were small, because China was largely isolated back then -- and extremely unfree economically. It now does a much better job of mobilizing its considerable natural talent.
While the populations of countries like the United States are aging, the number of innovative young people worldwide has never been higher. Countries like China, India, Brazil and Russia, despite recent slowdowns in growth, still are making progress in improving their educational systems and scientific networks. That increases their ability to supply technological innovations -- or scientists and entrepreneurs -- to the United States. These gains can be reaped in coming decades.
Note, too, that none of these trends can be reduced to breathless or utopian claims about the future of information technology, even though each is intertwined with tech progress in subtle ways. Further breakthroughs in technology, perhaps in the field of quantum computing, could add substantially to these positive trends.
The first decade of this century was largely a lost one, economically speaking, for the average American household. And in the beginning of this decade, median household income has actually dropped, during a time of ostensible economic recovery. Yet the longer-run picture, finally, can be given a partly optimistic gloss. These trends may not ultimately be the dominant ones, but if we're looking for a positive narrative about the American economic future, some important pieces are starting to fall into place.

HEADLINE: Yemen Making Strides in Transition to Democracy After Arab Spring

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
For more than two months, 565 people representing a cross section of Yemen's population have gathered in a luxury hotel on the outskirts of Sana, the capital, trying to hammer out the shape a future government will take.
It is called the National Dialogue Conference, and it is the closest any of the 2011 Arab revolutions has approached to a peaceful, broad-based transition from despotism to democracy.
''It is the only negotiated transition that exists in the context of the Arab Spring,'' said Jamal Benomar, the United Nations special adviser on Yemen. ''It is a genuine process, nothing has been cooked in advance.''
President Obama focused renewed attention on Yemen last week with his speech on national security, both for the American drone attacks there and for the scores of Yemenis still held in the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. He said that he was lifting the moratorium against repatriating Yemenis, which was seen in Yemen as an endorsement of the national dialogue's progress in creating more political stability. 
More than half the remaining 166 prisoners are Yemenis, and among them 56 are low-level inmates long cleared to go home. They are expected to be transferred on a case-by-case basis. Mr. Obama had barred their repatriation after Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula, or A.Q.A.P., a militant group based in Yemen, claimed responsibility for trying to blow up a passenger plane headed to Detroit in 2009.
The Yemeni government is hoping that the United States will help underwrite a new program to rehabilitate the detainees, said Rajeh Badi, a media adviser to Yemen's president. Washington must provide evidence of wrongdoing if it wants any of them put on trial, Mr. Badi said. The fear that they might join extremist groups is ''exaggerated,'' he said.
A common sentiment among Yemenis is that the low-level detainees have suffered enough, and that the 56 due to be released are likely to pose little danger. Over all, there are about 90 Yemenis in Guantánamo, Mr. Badi said, and Yemeni officials doubt anyone still considered a real threat will be released.
But in Washington, critics of the Obama administration tend to focus on recidivism. Exact numbers for Yemen are vague, particularly since the estimated two dozen sent home previously faded away from any government oversight in the chaos of the 2011 revolution.
Perhaps the most spectacular example of recidivism is Said Ali al-Shihri, the deputy head of A.Q.A.P., who has been reported killed at least twice by the American and Yemeni governments, yet rises Lazarus-like each time. A Saudi repatriated from Guantánamo, Mr. Shihri fled to Yemen in 2008 after graduating from the Saudi rehabilitation program.
In Yemen, optimists laud the dialogue process as a successful -- if messy and imperfect -- attempt to forge a more representative political system. Pessimists fret that it is merely a lull in the violence that troubled the country until about a year ago, with explosive issues like the desire of the south to secede posing the threat of bloodshed.
''We have not gotten to the solution,'' said Abdulghani al-Eryani, a political analyst and an adviser to the conference. But the dialogue ''changed the political dynamic and the balance of power in the country,'' he said.
He and others said they believed the dialogue could work in Yemen even though it failed elsewhere, most disastrously in Syria. First, the fragmentation of power, especially within the military, was such that no one faction thought it could prevail.
Second, a small group of elder statesmen cajoled the various factions into avoiding civil war. Third, the Arab Gulf states and the international community were united on Yemen. The United Nations Security Council was involved early, and it unanimously threatened international sanctions against anyone who threatened the peaceful transition.
''We finally got some benefit from being poor and insignificant,'' Mr. Eryani said. ''The international community is not fighting over interests in Yemen.''
But the problems of poverty, alienation, corruption, unemployment and weak or nonexistent government services, which spurred the revolution in the first place, have not evaporated, nor have powerful players retired.
Electricity shortages plague the capital, for example, because tribes angry at the lack of services cut the power lines. Saudi Arabia has provided assistance, but billions of dollars in aid pledged by Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have not been paid.
The southern secessionist movement is gaining steam, while the Houthis, a rebellious quasi-Shiite Muslim minority in the north, remain restless, although they joined the dialogue.
Al Qaeda has been chased from the territory that it ruled in the south, but it still carries out frequent attacks nationwide.
The national dialogue was supposed to address all those problems within six months after it started on March 18. Participants divided into nine specialized committees are forging a new constitution, and presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for February 2014. While they took to the task with gusto, the schedule is in doubt.
Most working groups ''have not come to the so-called nitty-gritty,'' said Abdul Karim al-Iryani, a former prime minister and one of the men who shaped the dialogue. ''They are discussing general things.''
A plenary session is scheduled for June 8 to review progress, and many expect an extension of four to six months.
The biggest issue shadowing the dialogue is that most of the top political leaders in the south, an independent Marxist country before unification in 1990, are pushing for separation. Most are boycotting the dialogue, so if the conference agreed on a federal system, it is unclear whether they would accept it.
Among the political players, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ruled Yemen for more than three decades, still leads the General People's Congress, or G.P.C., the former ruling party that has not been disbanded and wields significant influence. Of 22 provincial governors, for example, 17 are still G.P.C. leaders.
Many analysts say they believe that Mr. Saleh, granted immunity for stepping down, is plotting a comeback through the elections. A G.P.C. victory would make him a kingmaker but would probably inspire a new street revolution, analysts said.
Islah, the Muslim Brotherhood branch in Yemen, is part of a coalition called the Joint Meeting Parties and so could probably not dominate a future government the way Islamist groups have in Egypt and Tunisia.
But the power-sharing agreement between the two main factions that paved the way to the national dialogue has subsequently spawned a form of paralysis. Each faction wants an equal share of government posts, which means, for example, that many ambassadors, including a new ambassador to Washington, have not been appointed because of endless haggling.
The military is plagued by personal, tribal and regional alliances, said April Longley Alley of the International Crisis Group. But it is the one area where the leader of the interim government, President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has promoted some reform.
A year ago, for example, checkpoints separated the fiefs of three military commanders in Sana. Those are gone, although some violence persists.
The dialogue participants stopped work in protest for one day last week after tribal gunmen killed two southern youths who had the temerity to try to overtake a wedding procession in Sana. ''Remember, this is still a country where private citizens own tanks,'' noted one diplomat.
Mr. Saleh's son and heir, Ahmed, was retired as the head of the Republican Guard, which is being folded into the regular military. The military powers of Mr. Saleh's main rival, Gen. Ali Mohsen, have also been curtailed, although he remains in the presidential palace as an adviser.
Yemenis and outside analysts worry that with those old rivalries bubbling under the surface, the former power brokers are not going to cede willingly to new players who have a role in the national dialogue, including women, youths and minorities. But so far the dialogue has balanced all those competing interests.
''They are not shooting at each other, they are not even shouting at each other, which is a good start,'' said Fazli Corman, the Turkish ambassador to Yemen. ''No one can stop the process.''

THE GUNS AT LAST LIGHTThe War in Western Europe, 1944-1945
By Rick AtkinsonIllustrated. 877 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $40
ON the day Paris was liberated from Nazi occupation, two trucks screeched to a halt in front of the Ritz. Out jumped several dozen French Resistance fighters, armed to the teeth and led by a burly American with a large mustache. The French ''irregulars'' were so in awe of the man they referred to as ''le grand capitaine'' that they had taken to copying what the photographer Robert Capa called his ''sailor bear walk'' and machine-gun diction, ''spitting short sentences from the corners of their mouths.''
The leader swaggered up to the hotel bar and placed his order: ''How about 73 dry martinis?'' Ernest Hemingway went on to liberate the Ritz of a great deal of alcohol. ''We drank. We ate. We glowed,'' recalled one of his men. 
That cameo is just one of many unforgettable scenes in the final installment of Rick Atkinson's epic trilogy about America's war in Europe, a book that stitches a multitude of such small but telling moments into a tapestry of fabulous richness and complexity. Atkinson is a master of what might be called ''pointillism history,'' assembling the small dots of pure color into a vivid, tumbling narrative.
The first book of his Liberation Trilogy, ''An Army at Dawn'' (2002), followed the war in North Africa and won a Pulitzer Prize for history; ''The Day of Battle'' (2007) described the war in Sicily and Italy. This final volume starts with D-Day in June 1944 and ends with the formal German surrender at Reims 11 months later.
This is war told through the eyes of the privates and the generals, the newspaper correspondents and the civilians, the great and remembered as well as the ordinary and forgotten; it is war fought on the beaches, in hedgerows and through the streets, village to village, river by river, evoking the smells, noise and texture of battle as the great Allied army poured into Normandy and then battled across Western Europe, toward Germany and victory.
The craft is in the detail, and the telling deployment of numbers: the 2.3 million pairs of eyeglasses manufactured to keep the United States Army clearsighted; the German snipers awarded 100 cigarettes for every 10 kills, and an Iron Cross and a wristwatch from Himmler for 50; the 3,500 percent expansion in the American armed forces, in a war that cost the United States the equivalent of $4 trillion.
At the start of America's war, a fighting man had to have at least 12 of his original 32 teeth; by 1944 he could be sent into battle with none at all, just one eye, or deaf in one ear. He didn't even need to have a trigger finger.
Atkinson, a former staff writer at The Washington Post, knows just when to release the touching, trenchant or horrifying fact. While Hemingway was gorging on Champagne and creamed spinach at the Paris Ritz, American liberators were simultaneously discovering the windowless torture chambers at a nearby German barracks, where some of the Nazis' victims lived just long enough to leave testaments scrawled in pencil or charcoal on the walls: ''Gaston Meaux, my time is up, leaves five children, may God have pity on them.'' Or, more simply, ''Revenge me.''
The narrative line can be confusing. We shift from one battlefront to another, and from one side to the other. Individuals appear and then vanish, never to be heard from again. But the deliberately pell-mell quality of the writing merely adds to the sensation of battles fought at full tilt. For this is what war is like: clear in hindsight, but bewildering and chaotic to those caught up in it.
War is traditionally depicted as tactics, moves on a chessboard, the collision of brute power and military technology. But war is also about character and personality, individuals making choices and decisions in the heat of battle, inspired, calamitous, unfortunate and plain lucky (the quality Napoleon most prized in his generals). The path to victory was anything but smooth: the ''dissonance and puerile backbiting'' between the Allies and among the generals was too often paid for in blood.
Characters are drawn in a few bold lines. Here is Field Marshal Walter Model, ''Hitler's fireman,'' sent in to shore up the Führer's crumbling Western Front: ''a caustic, devout Lutheran with an adhesive memory, a taste for French red wine and a belief in the prodigal use of firing squads for shirkers.'' Here is Gen. Bernard Montgomery, towering in his conceit, once described as ''tense as a mousetrap,'' convinced he ''knew the way home,'' and Gen. George S. Patton, that strutting, inspiring, foul-mouthed rooster, with his repellent love of battle: ''Could anything be more magnificent? Compared to war, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance.''
Atkinson is less sure-footed in describing the fighting itself. There are only so many ways to describe men shooting, bombing or otherwise trying to kill one another. At times, his language strains to capture yet another high-explosive encounter: ''torrid orange sheaves of flanking fire''; an attack that ''slammed against the 30th Division front in scalding, scarlet gusts.'' The accidental killing of Allied troops by their own side is described as ''fratricide,'' an unnecessarily emotive word for a horrible mistake common to all wars.
The overheated prose contrasts with the deliberate understatement of the men fighting and dying. ''We shall have to send the soldiers in to this party seeing red,'' Monty says on the eve of D-Day, employing a British euphemism for killing frenzy. ''Do not worry if you do not survive the assault, as we have plenty of backup troops who will just go in over you,'' Royal Navy commandos were told, as if, having failed to survive the assault, they might be worrying about anything at all.
When the D-Day invasion proves successful, the most one British officer can come up with is a diffident double negative: ''We were not unpleased with ourselves.'' Atkinson sees these soldiers, rightly, as heroes, paragons of an ancient warrior breed, ''stalwart men, those stout hearts celebrated in song.'' But that is not, with a few exceptions like Patton, how they saw themselves. Mostly, they wanted to get on with it and then return to their families. ''If I could get home,'' Dwight Eisenhower wrote his mother back in Kansas, ''I could lie down on the front lawn and stay there for a week without moving.''
The Liberation Trilogy is a monumental achievement, about 2,500 pages in all, densely researched but supremely readable. Atkinson marshals a vast array of material with aplomb, never losing sight of the grander picture as the troops slog on. The German Army was crushed by a combination of logistical brilliance, firepower, raw courage and an American ''economic juggernaut that produced much, much more of nearly everything than Germany could.'' Churchill called America's war effort a ''prodigy of organization.'' The same can be said of this book.
After all the noise and fury, it is the quiet moments that echo in the memory. In October 1945, Henry A. Wright, a widower, was waiting at the train station when the bodies of his three sons came home -- Frank, killed on Christmas Eve in the Battle of the Bulge; Harold, dead of his wounds in a German P.O.W. camp; and Elton, killed in Germany just two weeks before the war ended. Their coffins were placed in the bedroom of the farmhouse near Springfield, Mo., where each had been born.
''Neighbors kept vigil overnight, carpeting the floor with roses, and in the morning they bore the brothers to Hilltop Cemetery for burial side by side by side beneath an iron sky.''

 BODY:
THE RULE OF THE CLAN What an Ancient Form of Social Organization Reveals About the Future of Individual Freedom By Mark S. Weiner Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.
Almost since its inception, there have been two views of modern government: one sees it as a defender of personal liberty through protection of individual rights; the other sees a constant threat to liberty that must be held in check. There's no question where Weiner, a professor of constitutional law, comes down on the issue: ''The belief that individual freedom exists only when the state is frail misunderstands the source of liberty.'' To illuminate what these societies stand to lose should they abandon their commitment to a healthy state, he delves into one of humanity's oldest political organizations: the clan. These ''societies of 'Status,' '' based on kinship, provide a foil to individual rights by revolving around the group (explaining, for example, why a feud can be ended without direct restitution to the person who was originally harmed). But Weiner doesn't simplify his argument by dismissing or condescending to the clan system; he engages with the very real benefits provided by one of the most durable political associations in human history. Weiner stresses the urgency of his subject for reasons stretching from national security (he attributes early missteps in the war on terror to ignorance of clan structures) to self-preservation (fighting against the rise of clannishness in our own societies). This erudite, quick-paced book demonstrates what the mix of modernity and clans can create: ''medieval Iceland plus Kalashnikovs.'' 
OVERHEATED The Human Cost of Climate Change By Andrew T. Guzman Oxford University, $29.95.
The reality of man-made climate change has come to feel less like an abstraction and more like an immediate threat to life as we know it. Guzman, a law professor at Berkeley, would seem to strike at the right moment with a book about the human toll our warming planet will exact. His predictions -- new virus strains caused by mass migration mixed with unsanitary conditions; nuclear tensions aggravated by resource competition -- provide a peek into a terrifying world where the climate has warmed by two degrees Celsius by the end of this century, a relatively conservative estimate. With this shift, climate change could displace as many as five times more people than World War II -- nearly one in 35 of the current global population. But Guzman wanders from his self-professed aim too often, delving into the well-trod territory of climate-change deniers and the mechanics of melting glaciers and vanishing atolls. Readers might expect an expert on international law and economics to offer more on the interventions that will save or ruin societies as they march toward our hot new world. While his historical examples of famine and water shortages provide some insight, there's a frustrating lack of detail on how countries will respond to similar crises today -- and tomorrow. As Guzman acknowledges, the outcomes of climate change are likely to be ''uncomfortable and brutal.'' The questions we ask about this future should be too.
BAD PHARMA How Drug Companies Mislead Doctors and Harm Patients By Ben Goldacre Faber & Faber, $28.
In today's global health industry, outright fraud, while real, does not pose the greatest threat to an individual's care. Instead, Goldacre argues, it is the ''missing data'' and ''nudges and bumps that stop a trial from being a fair test'' that have led him to declare, ''Medicine is broken.'' The author of the 2008 takedown ''Bad Science'' (as well as the popular Guardian column of the same name) now has the ''dark art'' of drug creation in his cross hairs, and while the result is an at times overwhelming march through the pitfalls of clinical trials, academic journals and government regulation, it is also an eye-opening glance into a world of experts who have failed us. Goldacre, a doctor, mentions the usual Big Pharma critiques, touching on the ethical morass of human trials and the infuriating dirty tricks pharmaceutical firms use to market their drugs both to patients and to doctors. But the book distinguishes itself by looking primarily at the poorly designed trials and outright testing manipulations that have led to ''a market flooded with drugs that aren't very good.'' The technical talk can be dense, and the book drags when Goldacre, trying to deflect accusations of cherry-picking, gets mired in discussions of research analysis. But he also drives home the point that when it comes to health, ''research is not abstract: it relates directly to life, death, suffering and pain.'' Indeed, it is precisely because of the excruciating complexity of these issues that multinational pharmaceutical companies have been able to do as they please.
A HISTORY OF FUTURE CITIES By Daniel Brook Norton, $27.95.
''Arriving at each new city,'' Italo Calvino wrote in ''Invisible Cities,'' ''the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had.'' Brook provides just such an unexpected past in his persuasive and lushly detailed new tale of four cities -- St. Petersburg, Shanghai, Mumbai and Dubai -- offering an intellectual history of cities at the crossroads of East and West, rich and poor, modern and conservative. Beginning in St. Petersburg, which Dostoyevsky called ''the most abstract and intentional city on the globe,'' Brook explores the architecture and urban planning of these megacities to understand the aspirations of their founders and inhabitants. In Shanghai, we meet the foreign colonizing ''Shanghailanders'' who, despite their purely capitalist intentions, created a global metropolis that became ''the crucible for a distinct Chinese modernity.'' In Mumbai, the Raj's ''bizarro London'' gave rise to new stylistic and political hybrids, from ''Bombay Gothic'' architecture to the Indian National Congress. But Brook's argument is not just a historical one. His modern ''future city'' is Dubai (and, by extension, other booming cosmopolitan centers of the East and South). While Dubai's excesses are easy to mock -- it boasts not one but two replicas of the Chrysler Building -- Brook takes the city-state seriously. After all, in his reading of today's ersatz global architecture, ''the copies have become more important than the originals.'' Not content with the idea that millions flock to these cities merely for the promise of higher wages, Brook argues that the draw ''is more than just the lure of great wealth; it is the lure of participating in modernity.''

HEADLINE: There May Be a Pill For That

BYLINE: By DANIEL BERGNER

 BODY:
Linneah sat at a desk at the Center for Sexual Medicine at Sheppard Pratt in the suburbs of Baltimore and filled out a questionnaire. She read briskly, making swift checks beside her selected answers, and when she was finished, she handed the pages across the desk to Martina Miller, who gave her a round of pills.
The pills were either a placebo or a new drug called Lybrido, created to stoke sexual desire in women. Checking her computer, Miller pointed out gently that Linneah hadn't been doing her duty as a study participant. Over the past eight weeks, she took the tablets before she planned to have sex, and for every time she put a pill on her tongue, she was supposed to make an entry in her online diary about her level of lust.
''I know, I know,'' Linneah said. She is a 44-year-old part-time elementary-school teacher, and that day she wore red pants and a canary yellow scarf. (She asked that only a nickname be used to protect her privacy.) ''It's a mess. I keep forgetting.'' 
Miller, a study coordinator, began a short interview, typing Linneah's replies into a database that the medication's Dutch inventor, Adriaan Tuiten, will present to the Food and Drug Administration this summer or fall as part of his campaign to win the agency's approval and begin marketing what might become the first female-desire drug in America. ''Thinking about your desire now,'' Miller said, ''would you say it is absent, very low, low, reasonable or present?''
''Low.'' This was no different from Linneah's reply at the trial's outset two months before.
''When your partner initiated sexual activity over the past eight weeks, did you show avoidance behavior?''
''Yes.''
''Like earlier to bed?''
''Yes.'' Linneah's voice lurched louder; she laughed; it was a relief to talk bluntly.
''Do you have pleasant feelings when you're touched?''
''Yes.''
Later, after her appointment, she told me that in fact she has orgasms pretty much every time she and her husband have sex -- that wasn't the problem. ''There's something that's stopping me from wanting it,'' she said. ''I don't know what it is. I can't tell you what it is.''
She met her husband at a bar nearly two decades ago: she joked with him over a foosball table, watched him clown on the dance floor. ''I had a professor at college who talked about 'the attraction template.' My husband's right inside my attraction template,'' she said. She remembered his dark hair, his boyish looks, the way she'd felt they fit together, because they were both on the short side. ''And he's a stand-up guy. He has an excellent sense of what's right and what's wrong. He can make fun but not in a way that hurts anyone.''
When they were dating and out with other couples, Linneah would think, ''I just want to get home with him, I just want to get home with him,'' she recalled. But that lust had dwindled. Around the arrival of their second child in 2004, something insidious crept in, partly fatigue but partly something else that she couldn't name. She talked about her to-do lists, the demands of the kids, ''but let's face it,'' she said, ''sex doesn't take that much time.'' Rather than feeling as if she still wanted to grab her husband's hand and hurry him up the stairs in their small brick house, on many nights she waited in bed, somewhat like prey, though the predator was tender, though he was cherished.
Around once a week, her husband tried to reach through the invisible barriers she built -- the going up to bed early, the intense concentration on a book, the hoping he was too tired to want anything but sleep. ''He'll move closer to me in bed, or put his arm around me, or rub my back.'' She willed herself not to refuse him. And mostly, she didn't. Usually they had sex about four times each month. But it upset her that she had to force herself and that she put up those barriers to deter him from reaching more often.
''I'm scared that if it's slimmed to this by now, what's going to happen as we get older?'' she said. ''I want to stay close, not just psychologically, physically. I want to stay in love. I have a friend, they have sex so intermittently, every three months. She is so unhappy. I don't want that to happen to me.'' She longed for a cure, a tab of magic. As she got into her car in the parking lot at the center, she hoped that her first set of pills had been placebos, that she'd been given fakes for the first eight weeks, that today she was driving away with the real drug and that their sex life would be transformed.
Half a century ago, the birth-control pill offered women the ability to switch off ovulation, to separate sex from reproduction. It played a part, as the '60s got under way, in propelling a host of profound changes, cultural as well as reproductive, societal as well as intimate -- in how women saw themselves and lived their lives, starting with the notion of women being above all baby makers and mothers. The promise of Lybrido and of a similar medication called Lybridos, which Tuiten also has in trials, or of whatever chemical finally wins the race for F.D.A. approval, is that it will be possible to take a next step, to give women the power to switch on lust, to free desire from the obstacles that get in its way. ''Female Viagra'' is the way drugs like Lybrido and Lybridos tend to be discussed. But this is a misconception. Viagra meddles with the arteries; it causes physical shifts that allow the penis to rise. A female-desire drug would be something else. It would adjust the primal and executive regions of the brain. It would reach into the psyche.
Beckoned by ads on the radio and in newspapers and on Craigslist, in the fall of 2011 women across America began applying to be among the 420 subjects in the Lybrido and Lybridos studies. Plenty were turned away when the trials filled. Lack of lust, when it creates emotional distress, meets the psychiatric profession's clinical criteria for H.S.D.D., or hypoactive sexual-desire disorder. Researchers have set its prevalence among women between the ages of about 20 and 60 at between 10 and 15 percent. When you count the women who don't quite meet the elaborate clinical threshold, the rate rises to around 30 percent. For a minor fraction of all the sexually indifferent (or repelled), the condition has been lifelong, regardless of whom they're with or how long they've been with them. For middle-aged or older women, menopause and its aftermath may play a role, though its importance is much debated. For a sizable segment of the undesiring, the most common antidepressants, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can be the culprit. Millions of American women are on S.S.R.I.'s, and many of them would have good use for a pill to revive the libido that has been chemically dulled as a side effect of the pill they take to buoy their mood.
But for many women, the cause of their sexual malaise appears to be monogamy itself. It is women much more than men who have H.S.D.D., who don't feel heat for their steady partners. Evolutionary psychologists argue that this comes down to innate biology, that men are just made with stronger sex drives -- so men will settle for the woman who's always near. But the evidence for an inborn disparity in sexual motivation is debatable. A meta-analysis done by the psychologists Janet Hyde and Jennifer L. Petersen at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, incorporates more than 800 studies conducted between 1993 and 2007. It suggests that the very statistics evolutionary psychologists use to prove innate difference -- like number of sexual partners or rates of masturbation -- are heavily influenced by culture. All scientists really know is that the disparity in desire exists, at least after a relationship has lasted a while.
Dietrich Klusmann, a psychologist at the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany, has provided a glimpse into the bedrooms of longtime couples. His surveys, involving a total of almost 2,500 subjects, comprise one of the few systematic comparisons of female and male desire at progressive stages of committed relationships. He shows women and men in new relationships reporting, on average, more or less equal lust for each other. But for women who've been with their partners between one and four years, a dive begins -- and continues, leaving male desire far higher. (Within this plunge, there is a notable pattern: over time, women who don't live with their partners retain their desire much more than women who do.)
Lesbian couples seem to fare no better, and maybe worse, in keeping their sexual ardor for each other. The term ''lesbian bed death,'' coined by the University of Washington sociologist Pepper Schwartz in the '80s, has been critiqued as overstatement but not quite as fiction. ''In the lesbian community, the monogamy problem is being aired more and more,'' Lisa Diamond, a professor of psychology and gender studies at the University of Utah, told me. ''For years, gay men have been making open arrangements for sex outside the couple. Now, increasingly, gay women are doing it.''
Klusmann's results are echoed by Lori Brotto, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia who has worked clinically with scores of H.S.D.D. patients and who recently led the American Psychiatric Association's attempt to better delineate the condition in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. (H.S.D.D. is being reconceived as sexual interest/arousal disorder, S.I.A.D.) ''The impact of relationship duration is something that comes up constantly,'' she told me about her therapy sessions. ''Sometimes I wonder whether it'' -- H.S.D.D. -- ''isn't so much about libido as it is about boredom.''
But desire resists comprehension. Whether it is mainly a raw drive or a complex emotion is a question that has bedeviled psychiatry for decades. And the fading of desire can seem impossibly intricate. Is it a result of a lack of intimacy or its cause? One theory holds that it's a challenge for both sexes to maintain passion over the long-term because it's threatening to desire the same person from whom we seek security and true understanding. It leaves us feeling too vulnerable. As Stephen A. Mitchell, one of the leaders of relational psychoanalysis, described it: ''Sustaining desire for something important from someone important is the central danger of emotional life. What is so dangerous about desiring someone you have is that you can lose him or her.'' Mitchell argued that ultimately the emotional meshing and vulnerability of committed relationships can become the most rewarding source of eros. Esther Perel, a couples therapist and author of ''Mating in Captivity,'' emphasizes a separateness at the heart of longstanding passion. ''Many couples confuse love with merging,'' she writes. ''This mix-up is a bad omen for sex. To sustain élan toward the other, there must be a synapse to cross. Eroticism requires distance.''
''What protects desire in monogamous partnerships is a great empirical question,'' Brotto said. ''I don't think there have been any good studies.''
Brotto, who is married and has three children, went on: ''I'm a woman in a long-term monogamous relationship. I myself have felt firsthand very high passionate desire, which then wanes. I can relate to my patients completely.'' Sometimes she discusses the option of open relationships. But even to contemplate this alternative is to ignite fears in both women and men, and those override the pining for lust.
How much easier it would be if we could solve the insoluble by getting a prescription, stopping off at the drugstore and swallowing a pill.
I watched the initial stage of the Lybrido and Lybridos trials at the offices of Dr. Andrew Goldstein, a gynecologist in Washington. Like the rest of the practitioners at the 16 research sites across the country that Adriaan Tuiten contracted to conduct the studies, Goldstein had to make sure that every applicant was in a stable relationship. Tuiten didn't openly acknowledge monogamy as the core of the desire problem, but he knew he couldn't use single subjects who might well find new lovers during the course of the trials. Their results might have to be tossed out because, with or without chemical aids, new lovers bring surges of lust.
Goldstein was involved in other desire drug trials, then stopped taking part in them for a while, out of disappointment and frustration. He was optimistic, though, that Tuiten's company, Emotional Brain, would succeed with the F.D.A.; Tuiten's approach, he said, was far more scientifically ''fine-tuned.'' (He doesn't stand to profit from Lybrido or Lybridos, he says; he is paid his usual fee for each subject's office visit and also receives around $2,500 a year from Emotional Brain for occasional work on an advisory board.) He recounted for me the way his patients lament the disappearance of lust. ''They use terms with real emphasis, words that are violent,'' he said. " 'This is like someone cut off my arm.' 'This is not how I see myself.' 'This is like something's been ripped away from me. Stripped away. Stolen.' ''
Among the applicants for the trials whom Goldstein interviewed was a law student. After five years with her boyfriend, she couldn't trick herself into the desire for him she once felt; she could only trick him into believing she still felt it. ''I don't like to hurt his feelings,'' she said. ''I'm a team player.'' There was a divorced mother of three who sensed herself slipping into the same sexual disinterest with her current partner that she recognized from the slow death of her marriage. ''When we split up,'' she said about her ex-husband, ''it was like going through a second puberty. So I attributed what had gone missing to who he was.'' She talked about the way her kids had always drained her energy, about getting her disabled son to his therapy appointments. But now that she was starting to feel sexually deadened with her boyfriend, she had doubts about those explanations.
Every woman raised a mix of possible reasons. There were the demands of graduate school, the demands of children, the demands of work, medical issues, men who weren't always as kind or nearly as engaged as they could be. But at bottom there seemed to be one common cause: they had all grown tired of sex with their long-term partners.
''I just want to know,'' a woman asked Goldstein at the end of her interview, after talking about the man she'd spent the last several loving years with, ''is this medicine going to work? Am I going to get my freak back?''
One subject in the study was Zita, a 31-year-old who favors frilly blouses and wears a heart-shaped pendant, a gift from her husband. They've been married for 6 years, together for 11. ''It was great,'' she told me about their beginning. ''We were like jackrabbits.'' Then eagerness became avoidance: there was nighttime cleaning that had to be done, or homework for a physician's-assistant course that couldn't wait. She hoped her husband would be asleep by the time she slid into bed. She still found him attractive, ''but I don't know, I don't know how to explain it. Over time, his sex drive decreased a little, and mine decreased kind of drastically.'' The couple had tried some role playing, without much effect for her. One day she was on Craigslist and stumbled on the ad for the trials. She quickly signed up. When she told friends about it, they wanted in, too; they were distressed over the same decline. But there were no spots left.
Consider the lengths to which scientists go to try to understand the workings of female desire: Using a laboratory gadget that measures vaginal blood flow while women watch varieties of pornography. Having women wear headgear that tracks the precise movement of their pupils, hundreds of times per second, as they gaze at X-rated images. Studying female hamsters and even arachnids mating as a way to glean insight into women's sexual psyches. Wiring women's necks and forearms to what they are told is a polygraph machine while they fill out surveys about their sex lives, their answers then compared with those of women who aren't wired up -- and compared in turn with the responses of men. These are all attempts to see around or beneath the societal messages and cultural influences that may distort women's sexuality and constrain its expression, even in our seemingly unconstrained times. (Yes, the lie detector had a much bigger effect on the women than the men, greatly increasing the number of partners women said they'd had sex with.)
The equipment can seem bizarre and the laboratory situations comical -- picture a woman in a lounge chair with her pants around her knees, a tampon-shaped tube in her vagina and a cord running from this device to a console while she stares at a video of gay men partaking in foreplay -- but then, sex research has always had an absurd if valiant quality. In the '50s and '60s, William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson filmed and observed hundreds of subjects having intercourse in their lab, in an effort to determine whether all female climaxes are clitoral in origin. That debate goes on even today. Barry Komisaruk, a neuroscientist at Rutgers University, buys plastic rods, heats them in his oven at home, bends them into dildos shaped to isolate different genital sensations and aims to settle the orgasm question once and for all.
One general principle about women's desire has been widely embraced since at least as far back as Victorian times and prevails still: that female eros is, innately, much less promiscuous -- much more dependent on commitment and trust, much more sparked by closeness, much better suited to constancy -- than male sexuality. It has surely been comforting to anyone concerned with the preservation of social order to think that, a few exceptions aside, half the population has a natural predisposition toward sexual stability. In recent decades, this idea has been bolstered by evolutionary psychologists, whose ''parental investment theory'' goes like this: because men have limitless sperm while women have limited eggs, because men don't have to invest much in reproduction while women invest not just their ova but also their bodies as they take on the tolls and risks of pregnancy and childbirth, males have been hard-wired, since eons ago, to expand their genetic legacy by spreading their cheap seed, while females are inherently made to maximize their investment by being choosy, by securing a male likely to be a good long-term provider.
The logic turns our assumptions about male and female sexuality into inborn inevitabilities. But to read the journal articles that promote this line of reasoning is to see the flimsiness of its foundation. In a seminal 1993 paper, whose conclusions have made their way from academia into popular consciousness, David M. Buss and David P. Schmitt, psychology professors now at the University of Texas at Austin and at Bradley University in Peoria, Ill., highlighted research showing that, in comparison to college-age men, college-age women say they want far fewer sexual partners over the course of their lifetimes. Similar evidence runs throughout the article. But what exactly does this type of data demonstrate: that women are innately less promiscuous in their longings than men, or that women are taught to feel that they should be?
Studies conducted recently are beginning to hint that female eros isn't in the least programmed for fidelity. These range from close focus on the sexual habits of our primate ancestors to research exploring women's wish for casual sex. An experiment led by Samantha Dawson, a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Queen's University, in Kingston, Ontario, and another by Stephanie Both, a psychologist and assistant professor at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, looked at the issue in another way. Heterosexual women and men watched pornographic film clips while their vaginas and penises were monitored. The subjects watched a one-minute sex scene repeatedly, with breaks in between to let genital blood flow return to a baseline state. Dawson's and Both's results show women's responses leaping at first, then, in Dawson's study, tracking the rapid downturn of the men, and in Both's, plummeting while the men's reactions stayed surprisingly constant. When the researchers introduced what are called ''novel stimuli,'' in this case new clips of pornography, ''vaginal pulse amplitude,'' like penile engorgement, spiked immediately.
In research published last year, Meredith Chivers, a psychologist at Queen's University, played pornographic audiotapes for heterosexual women and compared, among other things, genital reactions to scenarios involving a handsome male stranger or a hunky male friend. The friends made the machine flatline. The strangers made it jump.
How much can we extrapolate from studies like these? Maybe conclusions aren't in order, but certainly we should doubt what evolutionary psychology has taught us.
The search for a female-desire drug has been an obsession of the pharmaceutical industry for more than a decade, largely because the release of Viagra, in 1998, showed that gigantic sums of money can be made with a quick chemical solution to sexual dysfunction. But while Viagra and its competitors deal with the simple hydraulics of impotence, the most troubling difficulty for men, the psychological complexity of depleted lust has so far defeated industry giants. Yet it's important to note that Viagra isn't entirely without influence on the mental state of desire. The mechanics of the body and the mysteries of the mind are intertwined. Give a man an erection, and his sensitized nerves and enhanced feelings of power are going to feed his drive. Women, research has shown, are less cognizant of genital arousal, and probably for this reason, Viagra-like substances haven't done enough to raise women's ratings of desire in past experiments, even while the chemicals have added to blood flow. Tuiten's Lybrido employs a Viagra-like chemical as one-half of its arsenal, in the hope that it will be effective in combination with a substance that more directly targets the brain.
When Tuiten, a disheveled, youthful 58-year-old, told me the story of how he conceived of Lybrido and Lybridos, there was something sad and funny and metaphorically perfect about it -- it was a tale of scientific ingenuity stemming from a young man's broken heart. Tuiten was in his mid-20s when his girlfriend, a woman he'd been in love with since he was 13, abruptly decided to leave him. ''I was -- flabbergasted. You can say that?'' he asked me, making sure, in his choppy English, that he was using the right word. ''I was shocked. I was suffering.'' He was an older university student at the time; before that, he'd been a furniture maker. The breakup inspired a lifelong quest to comprehend female emotion through biochemistry and led to his career as a psychopharmacologist. ''I'm a little bit -- not insane,'' Tuiten said. ''But. There became a need for me to understand my personal life in this way.''
The neural networks of eros, though, are only vaguely known. Tiny subregions and crucial pathways in the brain have been identified -- blurrily, speculatively. Some progress has been made by looking at what sites in the brain light up when people watch slide shows of pornography while lying in magnetic-resonance-imaging cylinders. But the images just aren't exact enough. The brain's interwoven networks are too intricate for the technology to properly view them.
So we rely on rats. And one of the world's masters of rat lust is Jim Pfaus, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Concordia University in Montreal, who wears hoop earrings and used to sing in a punk band called Mold. The various drug companies, including Tuiten's, regularly consult with him. A few floors below his office, hundreds of rats court and mate in stacks of Plexiglas cages. Pfaus and his grad students inject the rodents with this or that compound to block one aspect of desire's biochemistry and isolate another. Or they kill the rats right after a moment of craving or copulation. The brain is then extracted, frozen and shaved into wafers, microns thin, by a device resembling a mini cold-cut slicer. Pfaus peers at these specimens under a microscope to figure out which clusters of neural cells went into metabolic overdrive while the rodent was in a sexual frenzy.
As Pfaus explains it, sexual desire for both women and men seems to begin in two low-lying brain zones: the medial preoptic area, which looks like a pair of minuscule oblong balls, and the ventral tegmental area, which is shaped something like a canoe. From this primitive center, the neurotransmitter dopamine, the molecular essence of desire, radiates outward through the brain. ''A dopamine rush is a lust-pleasure, it's a heightening of everything,'' Pfaus says. ''It's smelling a lover up close -- a woman inhaling that T-shirt. . . . It's wanting to have; it's wanting more.''
A number of other biochemical ingredients are critical to the most basic understanding of sexuality. But two of them -- the hormone testosterone and the neurotransmitter serotonin -- are especially important. Rising from the ovaries and from the adrenal glands that sit atop the kidneys, testosterone rides the bloodstream to the brain and, by means not fully known, stokes the production and release of dopamine. (Blood-borne estrogen, which derives from testosterone, may also be involved in this process.) And then there's serotonin, dopamine's foil. It allows the advanced regions of the brain, the domains that lie high and forward, to exert what is termed executive function. Serotonin is a molecule of self-control. It instills calm, stability, coherence (and, too, a sense of well-being, which is why S.S.R.I.'s, by bathing the brain in serotonin, can counter depression). Roughly speaking, dopamine is impulse; serotonin is inhibition and organization. And in sexuality, as in other emotional realms, the two have to work in balance. If dopamine is far too dominant, craving can splinter into attentional chaos. If serotonin overwhelms, the rational can displace the randy.
Yet knowing the biochemical components of a woman's desire is one thing; manipulating them quite another. LibiGel, a testosterone gel made by BioSante, which reached women's bloodstreams through the skin, was one of the medicines that preceded Lybrido and Lybridos. When F.D.A. trials ended in 2011, the results showed that the product didn't do any more for sexual interest than a placebo.
Three years ago, Linneah took part in a trial of another drug, Boehringer Ingelheim's Flibanserin, a nonhormonal pill that tinkered directly with neurotransmitter systems. Linneah swallowed a dose every day -- and waited. So did her neighbor and another friend, wives who didn't much desire their husbands anymore, either. They'd all taken reassurance in one another's indifference and shared their amazement about another neighbor: ''She was married as long as I was,'' Linneah remembered, ''and she had four kids and she was P.T.A. president, and she was ready to go with her husband 24/7, and we were all like, Wha?'' That spring of the Flibanserin trial, Linneah and her friends agreed that they weren't sensing any shift. Then, as now, Linneah thought maybe she'd landed in a placebo group. When Boehringer Ingelheim presented its data, an F.D.A. advisory board was not impressed with the results.
Bremelanotide, another nonhormonal medication (this one taken by nasal inhaler), was tested in 2006 and 2007. It generated, in a fair percentage of subjects, great waves of lust. Unfortunately, there were side effects like sudden jumps in blood pressure and bouts of vomiting. (LibiGel, Flibanserin and Bremelanotide are again being tested; this time, Bremelanotide is being delivered via injection.)
Tuiten's pills work somewhat differently than the drugs that came before them. For one thing, both Lybrido and Lybridos contain two active chemicals, timed so that their effects converge. Each drug tampers with the interplay between serotonin and dopamine, giving dopamine, carrier of lust, a temporary edge.
Both drugs have a peppermint-flavored testosterone coating that melts in the mouth. When the exterior is gone, the woman swallows a delayed-release inner tablet. In Lybrido, this inner pill is a close cousin of Viagra. The idea is that the Viagra-like molecule, by making extra blood flow to the genitals and adding to swelling and sensation, will work in conjunction with the testosterone. Together they will stir the mind to be more aware of erotic impulses; together they will help spark dopamine networks. Lybridos uses a compound called buspirone instead of the Viagra-like substance. Buspirone was originally used as an anti-anxiety medication, and if taken every day it can elevate serotonin in the brain. But as long as it's taken no more than every other day, it has a unique short-term effect: for a few hours, serotonin is suppressed.
To help predict which women will most benefit from which drug, Tuiten has blood drawn from each subject and examines genetic markers related to brain chemistry. Tuiten also asks subjects questions about their comfort with sexual feelings and fantasies. Since our dopamine and serotonin networks are reinforced or attenuated by all we learn, all we think and do, he believes that the answers may provide clues about a given woman's neurotransmitter systems, which he uses as part of his diagnostic method.
This interplay of experience and neural pathways is widely known as neuroplasticity. The brain is ever altering. And it is neuroplasticity that may help explain why hypoactive sexual desire disorder is a mostly female condition, why it seems that women, more than men, lose interest in having sex with their long-term partners. If boys and men tend to take in messages that manhood is defined by sex and power, and those messages encourage them to think about sex often, then those neural networks associated with desire will be regularly activated and will become stronger over time. If women, generally speaking, learn other lessons, that sexual desire and expression are not necessarily positive, and if therefore they don't think as much about sex, then those same neural networks will be less stimulated and comparatively weak. The more robust the neural pathways of eros, the more prone you are to feel lust at home, even as stimuli dissipate with familiarity and habit.
''We had sex five times a week when before it was once a week,'' Zita told me shortly after she'd finished her supply of Lybrido. And she wasn't enthusiastic about that weekly intimacy. With the drug, she said, ''I wanted to have sex even after we had sex. I would feel horny, and I got like a throbbing sensation, like I had to do something or it was going to bother me all night. I would just want more.'' When I asked how her husband felt about her taking the medication, she laughed."Happy,'' she said.
Tuiten published some results from small, preliminary trials in the March issue of The Journal of Sexual Medicine. His full data, which he has just finished tabulating and will soon be taking to the F.D.A., show Lybrido bestowing unmistakable benefits in desire -- and in rates of orgasm. (The outcomes for Lybridos aren't thoroughly compiled, but he says that early results look about as positive.) Tuiten is confident that the F.D.A. will send him to do another larger set of trials, which will involve about 1,200 subjects. Plenty of drugs fail at that stage of replication. But if all goes well, by 2016, Lybrido and Lybridos might be on the market.
Is it possible, after all, that through the pharmaceutical industry a fairy-tale ending could come to pass? Perhaps the fantasy that so many of us harbor, consciously or not, in the early days of our relationships, that we have found a soul mate who will offer us both security and passion, till death do us part, will soon be available with the aid of a pill.
But of course swallowing a tablet can take us only so far. Chemically enhancing a woman's desire might play out in all kinds of ways within a relationship. Some couples might feel closer, others might feel desolate because, despite more sex, their bond isn't stronger. Wives might yearn for the old seductive efforts of their husbands, even if those gestures stopped working long ago. Women might feel yet more pressure to perform: Why not get that prescription? their partners might ask; why not take that pill? And men, if they are willing to confront the truth, might not be so happy about the reminder, as their partners reach for the pill bottle, that their women need chemical assistance to want them. All the agonies that have existed since the dawn of monogamy will still pertain, many of them coming down to the craving to feel special.
Beyond what might happen in millions of bedrooms, it's even more difficult to foresee what societal transformations might be stirred. Just as with the birth-control pill, a foreboding not only about sex itself but also about female empowerment may be expressed in a dread of women's sexual anarchy. Over the last decade, as companies chased after an effective chemical, there was fretting within the drug industry: what if, in trials, a medicine proved too effective? More than one adviser to the industry told me that companies worried about the prospect that their study results would be too strong, that the F.D.A. would reject an application out of concern that a chemical would lead to female excesses, crazed binges of infidelity, societal splintering.
''You want your effects to be good but not too good,'' Andrew Goldstein, who is conducting the study in Washington, told me. ''There was a lot of discussion about it by the experts in the room,'' he said, recalling his involvement with the development of Flibanserin, ''the need to show that you're not turning women into nymphomaniacs.'' He was still a bit stunned by the entrenched mores that lay within what he'd heard. ''There's a bias against -- a fear of creating the sexually aggressive woman.''
Gaining control of their reproduction in the '60s affected not just women's sex lives but also everything from their social standing to economic empowerment. What might it mean for conventional structures if women could control, with a prescription, the most primal urge? So many things, personal and cultural, might need to be recalibrated and renegotiated, explicitly or without acknowledgment. The cumulative effect of all those negotiations could be hugely transformative, in ways either thrilling or threatening, depending on your point of view.
Maybe.
For her part, Linneah didn't see herself as doing anything revolutionary. This was about her marriage. She said that if this drug didn't work, she would sign up for the next experimental medication that came along. She seemed untroubled by the fact that we live in an age when it's possible to take a pill for nearly everything, or by the paradox that one of the problems this medication might be addressing is the desire-killing side effect of yet another type of psychotropic chemical, the S.S.R.I.'s. For her, the existence of the antidepressants that so many others take was proof that her problem would be solved.
''They've got all these meds for all these other psychiatric issues,'' she said, before driving away with her new batch of pills. ''Something's got to pop up that can help with this. Right? Right?''

HEADLINE: Sure You Saw a Flying Saucer

BYLINE: By MAGGIE KOERTH-BAKER. 
Maggie Koerth-Baker is science editor at BoingBoing.net and author of ''Before the Lights Go Out,'' on the future of energy production and consumption.

 BODY:
In the days following the bombings at the Boston Marathon, speculation online regarding the identity and motive of the unknown perpetrator or perpetrators was rampant. And once the Tsarnaev brothers were identified and the manhunt came to a close, the speculation didn't cease. It took a new form. A sampling: Maybe the brothers Tsarnaev were just patsies, fall guys set up to take the heat for a mysterious Saudi with high-level connections; or maybe they were innocent, but instead of the Saudis, the actual bomber had acted on behalf of a rogue branch of our own government; or what if the Tsarnaevs were behind the attacks, but were secretly working for a larger organization?
Crazy as these theories are, those propagating them are not -- they're quite normal, in fact. But recent scientific research tells us this much: if you think one of the theories above is plausible, you probably feel the same way about the others, even though they contradict one another. And it's very likely that this isn't the only news story that makes you feel as if shadowy forces are behind major world events. 
''The best predictor of belief in a conspiracy theory is belief in other conspiracy theories,'' says Viren Swami, a psychology professor who studies conspiracy belief at the University of Westminster in England. Psychologists say that's because a conspiracy theory isn't so much a response to a single event as it is an expression of an overarching worldview.
As Richard Hofstadter wrote in his seminal 1965 book, ''The Paranoid Style in American Politics,'' conspiracy theories, especially those involving meddlesome foreigners, are a favorite pastime in this nation. Americans have always had the sneaking suspicion that somebody was out to get us -- be it Freemasons, Catholics or communists. But in recent years, it seems as if every tragedy comes with a round of yarn-spinning, as the Web fills with stories about ''false flag'' attacks and ''crisis actors'' -- not mere theorizing but arguments for the existence of a completely alternate version of reality.
Since Hofstadter's book was published, our access to information has vastly improved, which you would think would have helped minimize such wild speculation. But according to recent scientific research on the matter, it most likely only serves to make theories more convincing to the public. What's even more surprising is that this sort of theorizing isn't limited to those on the margins. Perfectly sane minds possess an incredible capacity for developing narratives, and even some of the wildest conspiracy theories can be grounded in rational thinking, which makes them that much more pernicious. Consider this: 63 percent of registered American voters believe in at least one political conspiracy theory, according to a recent poll conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University.
While psychologists can't know exactly what goes on inside our heads, they have, through surveys and laboratory studies, come up with a set of traits that correlate well with conspiracy belief. In 2010, Swami and a co-author summarized this research in The Psychologist, a scientific journal. They found, perhaps surprisingly, that believers are more likely to be cynical about the world in general and politics in particular. Conspiracy theories also seem to be more compelling to those with low self-worth, especially with regard to their sense of agency in the world at large. Conspiracy theories appear to be a way of reacting to uncertainty and powerlessness.
Economic recessions, terrorist attacks and natural disasters are massive, looming threats, but we have little power over when they occur or how or what happens afterward. In these moments of powerlessness and uncertainty, a part of the brain called the amygdala kicks into action. Paul Whalen, a scientist at Dartmouth College who studies the amygdala, says it doesn't exactly do anything on its own. Instead, the amygdala jump-starts the rest of the brain into analytical overdrive -- prompting repeated reassessments of information in an attempt to create a coherent and understandable narrative, to understand what just happened, what threats still exist and what should be done now. This may be a useful way to understand how, writ large, the brain's capacity for generating new narratives after shocking events can contribute to so much paranoia in this country.
''If you know the truth and others don't, that's one way you can reassert feelings of having agency,'' Swami says. It can be comforting to do your own research even if that research is flawed. It feels good to be the wise old goat in a flock of sheep.
Surprisingly, Swami's work has also turned up a correlation between conspiracy theorizing and strong support of democratic principles. But this isn't quite so strange if you consider the context. Kathryn Olmsted, a historian at the University of California, Davis, says that conspiracy theories wouldn't exist in a world in which real conspiracies don't exist. And those conspiracies -- Watergate or the Iran-contra Affair -- often involve manipulating and circumventing the democratic process. Even people who believe that the Sandy Hook shooting was actually a drama staged by actors couch their arguments in concern for the preservation of the Second Amendment.
Our access to high-quality information has not, unfortunately, ushered in an age in which disagreements of this sort can easily be solved with a quick Google search. In fact, the Internet has made things worse. Confirmation bias -- the tendency to pay more attention to evidence that supports what you already believe -- is a well-documented and common human failing. People have been writing about it for centuries. In recent years, though, researchers have found that confirmation bias is not easy to overcome. You can't just drown it in facts.
In 2006, the political scientists Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler identified a phenomenon called the ''backfire effect.'' They showed that efforts to debunk inaccurate political information can leave people more convinced that false information is true than they would have been otherwise. Nyhan isn't sure why this happens, but it appears to be more prevalent when the bad information helps bolster a favored worldview or ideology.
In that way, Swami says, the Internet and other media have helped perpetuate paranoia. Not only does more exposure to these alternative narratives help engender belief in conspiracies, he says, but the Internet's tendency toward tribalism helps reinforce misguided beliefs.
And that's a problem. Because while believing George W. Bush helped plan the Sept. 11 attacks might make you feel in control, it doesn't actually make you so. Earlier this year, Karen Douglas, a University of Kent psychologist, along with a student, published research in which they exposed people to conspiracy theories about climate change and the death of Princess Diana. Those who got information supporting the theories but not information debunking them were more likely to withdraw from participation in politics and were less likely to take action to reduce their carbon footprints.
Alex Jones, a syndicated radio host, can build fame as a conspiracy peddler; politicians can hint at conspiracies for votes and leverage; but if conspiracy theories are a tool the average person uses to reclaim his sense of agency and access to democracy, it's an ineffective tool. It can even have dangerous health implications. For example, research has shown that African-Americans who believe AIDS is a weapon loosed on them by the government (remembering the abuses of the Tuskegee experiment) are less likely to practice protected sex. And if you believe that governments or corporations are hiding evidence that vaccines harm children, you're less likely to have your children vaccinated. The result: pockets of measles and whooping-cough infections and a few deaths in places with low child-vaccination rates.
Psychologists aren't sure whether powerlessness causes conspiracy theories or vice versa. Either way, the current scientific thinking suggests these beliefs are nothing more than an extreme form of cynicism, a turning away from politics and traditional media -- which only perpetuates the problem.

HEADLINE: Room to Dine; No Wall Views Please

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
It didn't take much thought for Stephanie Budijono and Jean-Francois Kagy to decide to settle in New York.
They met in Princeton, N.J., as graduate students at Princeton University, where she studied chemical engineering and he economics. Ms. Budijono, 28, now works in Princeton as a scientist, while Mr. Kagy, 31, works in Midtown East for an economic consulting firm.
The two toyed with the idea of living in New Jersey, but both prefer city life. As grad students, they often visited New York, sometimes just for dinner. When they returned to Princeton in the wee hours, ''we imagined living in the city and being just 10 minutes away from home,'' Mr. Kagy said. 
And they never agreed with friends who cited the difficulty they might eventually face rearing children in the city.
The Upper East Side felt homey and family-oriented, filled with children on weekends. With a price range between $700,000 and $900,000 for a co-op, the couple initially hoped for a three-bedroom, but these turned out to be too pricey. So they went looking for a two-bedroom with a well-ventilated kitchen.
''For us, the home is really important,'' said Ms. Budijono, who is from Indonesia. ''It's not only a place for us to sleep and shower, but a place for us to relax and hang out, and food is a very important part in our relationship. I like to cook and like to try out new recipes. People say New Yorkers don't eat at home a lot, but I do. I need to eat at home to be able to enjoy eating out.''
They also wanted a real dining area with room for a ''floating dining table,'' she said, so nobody would face a wall while eating.
Last year, Mr. Kagy, who is from Montreal, went to his first open house, in Carnegie Hill, to suss out what kind of co-op their budget would allow. As he left, Sabrina Kleier-Morgenstern, an executive vice president of Kleier Residential, waved him into her open house on the same floor. Recognizing her from the HGTV show, ''Selling New York,'' he pocketed her card.
He started walking the cross streets of the Upper East Side, back and forth, becoming familiar with the neighborhood. ''Maybe we can get more data points,'' he thought, referring to such information as liquidity requirements for co-ops. He contacted Ms. Kleier-Morgenstern.
Sometimes couples disagree on what they want, she said, ''but they really seemed to be in sync and have similar sorts of tastes.''
Often, places they saw were perfectly nice but had tiny second bedrooms or lacked dining space. A lovely prewar co-op in the Sutton Place neighborhood had a layout issue: with six steps up to the living room and down to the bedroom, the couple feared problems with reselling.
The location was a bit off, too: Though the apartment was across East 59th Street from the Bridgemarket, and though the view of the Roosevelt Island tramway was delightful, the couple didn't relish walking on First Avenue beneath the dark and noisy Queensboro Bridge overpass. The apartment, listed for $875,000, with maintenance of around $2,300 a month, later sold for $872,500.
The couple decided they would rather be nearer Central Park and farther north. They hunted efficiently, kept to a schedule by Daniel Kerin, an agent at Kleier Residential. ''I say it took a minute a block and two minutes an avenue, and we planned an itinerary,'' Mr. Kerin said. ''We are not time-wasters.''
The couple fell in love with a prewar co-op in the mid-80s near Park Avenue, listed at $832,000, with monthly maintenance in the $1,800s.
It was well located, near the 86th Street subway, and in a coveted school district. But they didn't like the brick wall just outside the living room and master bedroom.
They returned again and again. ''Each time we would go back and stare out the window and think, 'Does it really make sense, because the view is close to zero?' '' Mr. Kagy said. They turned the lights off and on, gauging the dimness or brightness.
''We thought maybe we could live with this, because we loved the apartment so much,'' Ms. Budijono said. ''We loved the kitchen, the lobby, the feel. Sometimes you cannot explain that.'' They agonized, and decided against it. The place is now in contract.
In the end, they returned to an apartment they had seen earlier, in the low 90s near Park Avenue -- a 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom, just at treetop level, with quaint row houses across the street.
The kitchen, though long and skinny, had a counter with seats by the window; the living room was large enough for a floating table. The bathroom had a tub as well as a separate shower stall. The master bedroom faces the street; the second bedroom looks over a ventilation system, but still gets sun and sky -- which is better than having a brick wall a few feet away.
The unit was listed at $829,000, with monthly maintenance of around $1,900. The couple purchased it in March for $800,000.
''They were very, very thorough,'' Ms. Kleier-Morgenstern said. ''This was a thoughtful, precise decision for them.''
Though they thought their apartment might be a bit far from the subway, it doesn't seem far because the walk is so engaging. The couple love Carnegie Hill's small shops and its relatively quiet streets, as they knew they would.
Being so thorough, Mr. Kagy said, they had returned many times to make sure that right after they moved in, they wouldn't be saying, '' 'Oh, gosh, how come we didn't see that and are stuck with it for the next five years?'
''This apartment came with no surprises. It is a two-bedroom. It is not as though we discovered a third bedroom.''

HEADLINE: Reinhart And Rogoff Are Not Happy

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: And I&#8217;m sorry they feel that way. 

 BODY:
Their letter is here.
This could go on forever, and both they and I have other things to do. So let me just state - clearly, I hope - where their analytical sin lies. 
To some extent it lies in the downplaying of causality issues - of whether high debt causes slow growth, slow growth causes high debt, or both high debt and slow growth are the result of third factors (as was the case in demobilizing postwar America, which they highlighted in their original paper).
But the more important sin involves the misuse of the "90 percent" criterion.
There is, as everyone in this debate has acknowledged, a negative correlation in the data between debt and growth. As a result, draw a line at any point - 80 percent, 90 percent, whatever - and countries with debt above that level will tend to have slower growth than countries with debt below that level.
There is, however, an enormous difference between the statement "countries with debt over 90 percent of GDP tend to have slower growth than countries with debt below 90 percent of GDP" and the statement "growth drops off sharply when debt exceeds 90 percent of GDP". The former statement is true; the latter isn't. Yet R&R have repeatedly blurred that distinction, and have continued to do so in recent writings.
And for a country with debt in the vicinity of the 90 percent level - as, for example, in both the US and the UK - the distinction is crucial. It's the difference between arguing that failure to impose an austerity program amounting to a few percent of GDP might reduce GDP a decade from now by a fraction of a percent at most - which is what the actual correlation suggests - to suggesting that it will reduce future GDP by 10 percent, which is what the threshold claim suggests.
Austerity-minded policy makers, of course, seized on the latter claim, citing R&R - and if the authors ever made an effort to correct this misconception, or indeed if they have ever even acknowledged that it's a misconception, it was done very quietly.
I'm sorry, but the failure to clear up this misconception has done a great deal of harm - and this harm is not significantly mitigated by various remarks in passing to the effect that austerity might be overdone.

HEADLINE: The Essayification of Everything

BYLINE: CHRISTY WAMPOLE


HIGHLIGHT: Why has the form invented by Montaigne &#8212; searching, sampling, notoriously noncommittal &#8212; become a talisman of our times? 

 BODY:
Lately, you may have noticed the spate of articles and books that take interest in the essay as a flexible and very human literary form. These include "The Wayward Essay" and Phillip Lopate's reflections on the relationship between essay and doubt, and books such as "How to Live," Sarah Bakewell's elegant portrait of Montaigne, the 16th-century patriarch of the genre, and an edited volume by Carl H. Klaus and Ned Stuckey-French called "Essayists on the Essay: Montaigne to Our Time."
It seems that, even in the proliferation of new forms of writing and communication before us, the essay has become a talisman of our times. What is behind our attraction to it? Is it the essay's therapeutic properties? Because it brings miniature joys to its writer and its reader? Because it is small enough to fit in our pocket, portable like our own experiences? 
I believe that the essay owes its longevity today mainly to this fact: the genre and its spirit provide an alternative to the dogmatic thinking that dominates much of social and political life in contemporary America. In fact, I would advocate a conscious and more reflective deployment of the essay's spirit in all aspects of life as a resistance against the zealous closed-endedness of the rigid mind. I'll call this deployment "the essayification of everything."
What do I mean with this lofty expression?
Let's start with form's beginning. The word Michel de Montaigne chose to describe his prose ruminations published in 1580 was "Essais," which, at the time, meant merely "Attempts," as no such genre had yet been codified. This etymology is significant, as it points toward the experimental nature of essayistic writing: it involves the nuanced process of trying something out. Later on, at the end of the 16th century, Francis Bacon imported the French term into English as a title for his more boxy and solemn prose. The deal was thus sealed: essays they were and essays they would stay. There was just one problem: the discrepancy in style and substance between the texts of Michel and Francis was, like the English Channel that separated them, deep enough to drown in. I've always been on Team Michel, that guy who would probably show you his rash, tell you some dirty jokes, and ask you what you thought about death. I imagine, perhaps erroneously, that Team Francis tends to attract a more cocksure, buttoned-up fan base, what with all the "He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises," and whatnot.
With such divergent progenitors, the essay has never recovered from this chronic undecidability. As a genre that emerged to accommodate the expressive needs of the Renaissance Man, the essay necessarily keeps all tools and skills at its disposal. The essayist samples more than a D.J.: a loop of the epic here, a little lyric replay there, a polyvocal break and citations from greatnesses past, all with a signature scratch on top.
There is certainly disagreement on the wobbly matter of what counts as an essay and what does not. I have generally found that for every rule I could establish about the essay, a dozen exceptions scuttle up. I recently taught a graduate seminar on the topic and, at the end of the course, to the question "What can we say of the essay with absolute certainty?," all of us, armed with our panoply of canonical essay theories and our own conjectures, had to admit that the answer is: "Almost nothing." But this is the force of the essay: it impels you to face the undecidable. It asks you to get comfortable with ambivalence.
When I say "essay," I mean short nonfiction prose with a meditative subject at its center and a tendency away from certitude. Much of the writing encountered today that is labeled as "essay" or "essay-like" is anything but. These texts include the kind of writing expected on the SAT, in seminar papers, dissertations, professional criticism or other scholarly writing; politically engaged texts or other forms of peremptory writing that insist upon their theses and leave no room for uncertainty; or other short prose forms in which the author's subjectivity is purposely erased or disguised. What these texts often have in common is, first, their self-conscious hiding of the "I" under a shroud of objectivity. One has to pretend that one's opinions or findings have emanated from some office of higher truth where rigor and science are the managers on duty.
Second, these texts are untentative: they know what they want to argue before they begin, stealthily making their case, anticipating any objections, aiming for air-tightness. These texts are not attempts; they are obstinacies. They are fortresses. Leaving the reader uninvited to this textual engagement, the writer makes it clear he or she would rather drink alone.
What is perhaps most interesting about the essay is what happens when it cannot be contained by its generic borders, leaking outside the short prose form into other formats such as the essayistic novel, the essay-film, the photo-essay, and life itself. In his unfinished novel "The Man Without Qualities," the early 20th-century Austrian writer Robert Musil coined a term for this leakage. He called it "essayism" (Essayismus in German) and he called those who live by it "possibilitarians" (Möglichkeitsmenschen). This mode is defined by contingency and trying things out digressively, following this or that forking path, feeling around life without a specific ambition: not for discovery's sake, not for conquest's sake, not for proof's sake, but simply for the sake of trying.
The possibilitarian is a virtuoso of the hypothetical. One of my dissertation advisers Thomas Harrison wrote a handsome book on the topic called "Essayism: Conrad, Musil, and Pirandello," in which he argues that the essayism Musil sought to describe was a "solution in the absence of a solution," a fuzzy response to Europe's precarity during the years he worked on his unfinishable masterpiece. I would argue that many of us in contemporary America these days are prone to essayism, in various guises, but always in the spirit of open-endedness and with serious reservations about committing to any one thing.
Essayism consists in a self-absorbed subject feeling around life, exercising what Theodor Adorno called the "essay's groping intention," approaching everything tentatively and with short attention, drawing analogies between the particular and the universal. Banal, everyday phenomena - what we eat, things upon which we stumble, things that Pinterest us - rub elbows implicitly with the Big Questions: What are the implications of the human experience? What is the meaning of life? Why something rather than nothing? Like the Father of the Essay, we let the mind and body flit from thing to thing, clicking around from mental hyperlink to mental hyperlink: if Montaigne were alive today, maybe he too would be diagnosed with A.D.H.D.
The essayist is interested in thinking about himself thinking about things. We believe our opinions on everything from politics to pizza parlors to be of great import. This explains our generosity in volunteering them to complete strangers. And as D.I.Y. culture finds its own language today, we can recognize in it Arthur Benson's dictum from 1922 that, "An essay is a thing which someone does himself."
In Italian, the word for essay is "saggio" and contains the same root as the term "assaggiare," which means to sample, taste or nibble food. Today, we like to sample, taste or nibble experiences: Internet dating, speed dating, online shopping and buy-and-try consumerism, mash-ups and digital sampling, the money-back guarantee, the temporary tattoo, the test-drive, shareware. If you are not satisfied with your product, your writing, your husband, you may return/delete/divorce it. The essay, like many of us, is notoriously noncommittal.
I certainly don't argue that no one is committing these days; it only takes a few moments of exposure to contemporary American political discourse to realize the extent of dogmatic commitment to this or that party, to this or that platform. However, for many, the certainty with which the dogmatists make their pronouncements feels increasingly like a bothersome vestige of the past. We can either cling rigidly to dissolving categories or we can let ambivalence wash over us, allowing its tide to carry us toward new life configurations that were inconceivable even 20 years ago. Essayism, when imagined as a constructive approach to existence, is a blanket of possibilities draped consciously on the world.
Essayism is predicated on at least three things: personal stability, technocratic stability and societal instability.
Montaigne certainly possessed the first. He grew up in a privileged family, spoke Latin before French, had the educational, financial and social means to lead a life of civic engagement and writing. While most of us probably didn't know fluent Latin as children (and never will) and aren't in a position to become high-ranking civil servants, we have a relatively high literacy rate and unprecedented access to technologies of communication and reserves of knowledge. Furthermore, as a counter-narrative to our supposed busy-ness, there's lots of evidence that we have plenty of idle time on our hands. Despite our search for distractions in any form, these empty hours give us time to contemplate the hardships of contemporary life. The thoughts just creep in if given the means.
Regarding technocracy, the maturation of print culture during the Renaissance meant that the great texts of Antiquity and newer philosophical, literary and scientific materials could reach a wider audience, albeit mainly composed of people of privilege. The experts of science and technology at that time siphoned some of the power that had been monopolized by the church and the crown. We could draw a similar analogy today: Silicon Valley and the technocratic business class still force the church and the state to share much of their cultural power. The essay thrives under these conditions.
As for societal instability, life outside Montaigne's château was not rosy: the Wars of Religion between Catholics and Protestants raged in France starting in the 1560s. Turmoil and uncertainty, dogmatism and blood: such circumstances make one reflect on the meaning of life, but it is sometimes too hard to look such a question right in the face. Instead, one asks it obliquely by wondering about those smallnesses that make up the human experience. Today, unresolved issues of class, race, gender, sexual orientation, political affiliation and other categories have created a volatile social dynamic, and, with our current economic instability to boot, it is no wonder that throwing oneself wholeheartedly toward any particular idea or endeavor seems a risky proposition to many of us. Finally, the bloody wars of religion and ideology continue to rage on in our time. In the early 20th century, when the French writer André Malraux predicted that the 21st century would be a century of renewed mysticism, he perhaps did not imagine that the pursuit of God would take such a politically volatile form.
Essayism, as an expressive mode and as a way of life, accommodates our insecurities, our self-absorption, our simple pleasures, our unnerving questions and the need to compare and share our experiences with other humans. I would argue that the weakest component in today's nontextual essayism is its meditative deficiency. Without the meditative aspect, essayism tends toward empty egotism and an unwillingness or incapacity to commit, a timid deferral of the moment of choice. Our often unreflective quickness means that little time is spent interrogating things we've touched upon. The experiences are simply had and then abandoned. The true essayist prefers a more cumulative approach; nothing is ever really left behind, only put aside temporarily until her digressive mind summons it up again, turning it this way and that in a different light, seeing what sense it makes. She offers a model of humanism that isn't about profit or progress and does not propose a solution to life but rather puts endless questions to it.
We need a cogent response to the renewed dogmatism of today's political and social landscape and our intuitive attraction to the essay could be pointing us toward this genre and its spirit as a provisional solution. Today's essayistic tendency - a series of often superficial attempts relatively devoid of thought - doesn't live up to this potential in its current iteration, but a more meditative and measured version à la Montaigne would nudge us toward a calm taking into account of life without the knee-jerk reflex to be unshakeably right. The essayification of everything means turning life itself into a protracted attempt.
The essay, like this one, is a form for trying out the heretofore untried. Its spirit resists closed-ended, hierarchical thinking and encourages both writer and reader to postpone their verdict on life. It is an invitation to maintain the elasticity of mind and to get comfortable with the world's inherent ambivalence. And, most importantly, it is an imaginative rehearsal of what isn't but could be.

HEADLINE: Preparing 9 Months for the Fruits of a Storm

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Late last October, Hurricane Sandy pumped six feet of water into the lobby of a residential building in downtown Jersey City, trapping Meaghan B Murphy and her husband, Patrick, in their apartment and leaving them without electricity for days.
Ms. Murphy, 37, deputy editor of Self magazine, is expected to give birth to her third child at the end of July. ''We were content with two children; three were not in the plan,'' she recalled. ''But with no power, no TV, no lights, even without that much food, there was not much else to do.''
''And my husband is so handsome,'' she added of Mr. Murphy, a 33-year-old private client manager for a bank. ''I couldn't resist.'' 
In rural India, sociologists have found links between improved electrical service and declining birthrates. In New York, Hurricane Sandy may have induced the opposite effect. Couples stuck at home for days with the lights out, elevators inoperable, and lobbies deluged may have had more time for romance.
Call it Sandy Syndrome.
Several New York hospitals are bracing for an increase in births during the last weeks of July and early August. That would be about nine months after power failures and floods caused by Hurricane Sandy paralyzed large swaths of the New York metropolitan area and kept couples at home.
The idea that blackouts, whether caused by storms or accidents, lead to a rise in births has become a virtual cliché. But it is not necessarily accurate, according to researchers. ''My first instinct is that people are home, they want to be together more and so there's an increased rate,'' said Dr. Michael R. Berman, medical director for labor and delivery at Beth Israel Medical Center. ''But after looking at some of the past catastrophes there wasn't.''
No statistically sound effect on births was found after the 1965 power failure in the Northeast. Nine months after the 2003 blackout in the region, the number of births in New York City actually dipped slightly compared with a year earlier.
A study several years ago in the Journal of Population Economics revealed a mild correlation between more births after minor squalls, but the opposite effect after severe storms like Hurricane Sandy. Other research found that birthrates sometimes rose during a hurricane, possibly the result of anxiety, but not necessarily nine months later. And the number of births in New York often peaks in July.
Still, officials at other local hospitals say that, based on patient due dates, they are anticipating increases of 10 to 30 percent in midsummer births compared with the last year.
''There's definitely an uptick,'' said Dr. Jacques Moritz, director of the division of gynecology at St Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. ''This is just old basic physiology. There's no Internet and no cable. What else is there to do?'
Dr. Moritz estimated that the number of women expected to deliver at his hospital at the end of July would be 10 to 20 percent higher than it was last year.
At NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, Dr. Amos Grunebaum, chief of obstetrics and gynecology, said, ''when we looked at the numbers, it's 20 to 30 percent busier than usual for the last week of July and going into that first week of August.''
One of his patients, Rachel DeGregorio, has a 3 ½-year-old daughter and had been trying for nearly two years to have a second child. She had even scheduled fertility treatments. Then the hurricane struck.
Ms. DeGregorio, 34, who has a doctoral degree in neuroscience, and her husband, Scott, a 33-year-old radiologist, spent the day stranded in their Upper East Side apartment after his office in New Jersey was closed because of the storm. Their son, who they are planning to name Jack, is due July 24.
''I have documented the day Jack was conceived,'' she recalled. ''We had sex three times, because Dr. Grunebaum said, 'the more the better.' ''
Ms. Murphy's brother and sister-in-law, lawyers who were stuck in their New Jersey apartment in the storm's aftermath, are expecting a baby a week after Ms. Murphy's is due.
Some doctors, while acknowledging the increase in the number of anticipated births, are reluctant to immediately make a correlation between the storm and the expected blip in the birthrate.
''Obviously, people are talking about 'Sandy babies,' '' Dr. Grunebaum said.
If there is an increase, it could be attributable to other factors, including an improving economy.
Still, Dr. Moritz said, ''I don't think the economy has gotten good enough to say that last October people were deciding to have babies.''
Caroline Hagood, a 30-year-old doctoral candidate at Fordham whose baby is due in late July, said that she was unaffected by the hurricane at home and ''wasn't conscious of Sandy's effect,'' but, nonetheless ''as a poet, I can't deny that there's something lyrical about the concept of a seize-the-moment hurricane baby.''
At New York Downtown Hospital in Lower Manhattan, Dr. Warren Licht, the former chief medical officer and now a specialist at the hospital's Women's Health Center, said his colleagues were anticipating a ''notable increase'' in deliveries for midsummer.
''It makes perfect sense,'' Dr. Licht said, ''that during a period of a prolonged loss of electricity, people take comfort in creating their own.''

HEADLINE: Concert Industry Struggles With 'Bots' That Siphon Off Tickets

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
As the summer concert season approaches, music fans and the concert industry that serves them have a common enemy in New York. And in Russia. And in India.
That enemy is the bot.
''Bots,'' computer programs used by scalpers, are a hidden part of a miserable ritual that plays out online nearly every week in which tickets to hot shows seem to vanish instantly.
Long a mere nuisance to the live music industry, these cheap and widely available programs are now perhaps its most reviled foe, frustrating fans and feeding a multibillion-dollar secondary market for tickets.
According to Ticketmaster, bots have been used to buy more than 60 percent of the most desirable tickets for some shows; in a recent lawsuit, the company accused one group of scalpers of using bots to request up to 200,000 tickets a day. 
Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, have stepped up efforts to combat bots, in part to improve the ticket-buying experience for concertgoers, but also to burnish the company's reputation with consumers. The result has been a game of cat and mouse between the company and the bots.
''As with hackers, you can solve it today, and they're rewriting code tomorrow,'' said Michael Rapino, Live Nation's chief executive. ''Thus the arms race.''
In late 2011, Ticketmaster hired John Carnahan, an expert on machine learning who fought online advertising frauds at Yahoo, to lead its anti-bot effort.
By monitoring the behavior of each visitor to Ticketmaster's site, the company can determine the likelihood of a customer being human or a machine. For example, a human may click a series of buttons at a range of speeds and in different spots on a screen, but bots can give themselves away by rapidly clicking on precisely the same spot each time.
A screen on Mr. Carnahan's desk in Los Angeles shows Ticketmaster's incoming traffic, with a rainbow of colors at the bottom and splotches of red on top representing suspicious activity. On a recent Thursday afternoon, the screen showed that the red visitors were making 600 times more ticket requests than those the system identified as being most likely human.
Bots are not kicked off the system, but rather ''speedbumped'' -- slowed down, sent to the end of the line or given some other means of interference, to allow a regular customer through.
''We're not trying to stop anybody from buying tickets,'' Mr. Carnahan said. ''We're just trying to make sure that a fan can buy the tickets.''
Ticketing bots are often inexpensive and programmed in countries beyond easy reach of American law enforcement. Rob Rachwald of the computer security company FireEye, which is not working with Ticketmaster, points out that one site -- available in English and Russian -- charges just $13.90 for the keys to 10,000 Captchas, those squiggly lines that test whether a potential customer is human.
In January, Ticketmaster replaced most of its old Captchas with newer and more sophisticated versions. The company is also introducing a system for mobile devices that aims to eliminate Captcha-style tests altogether.
Live Nation will not say how many of the 148 million tickets it sells each year are bought using bots, and in many cases it may not know. Few ever admit to using the programs; official groups like the National Association of Ticket Brokers, which represents many of the biggest resellers, condemn them and say they support anti-bot measures. But people at nearly every level of the concert business blame bots for wreaking all kinds of economic havoc.
''There are sold-out shows in reserved-seat houses in New York City where we will have 20 percent no-show, and that 20 percent will be down in the front of the house,'' said Jim Glancy of The Bowery Presents, an independent concert promoter in New York. ''It's speculators who bought a bunch of seats and didn't get the price they wanted.''
Concert promoters, artist managers and ticketing services say that bots are now an ever-present force, not only during the high-traffic moments when a big show officially goes on sale, but also at the odd moments when a promoter releases a few dozen extra seats with no announcement.
Darlene Schild, of Lincroft, N.J., may well have experienced the reach of bots firsthand recently when she tried to buy Justin Bieber tickets as an 11th birthday present for her daughter. Like any well-trained concertgoer, she fired up Ticketmaster's iPhone app just as the tickets went on sale, but after 15 fruitless minutes she gave up.
''The first thing that crossed my mind was that some ticket-buying service bought them all,'' Ms. Schild said. ''Or someone could dial quicker than me. Some technology -- something.''
Last month, Ticketmaster sued 21 people in federal court, accusing them of fraud, copyright infringement and other offenses in using bots to search for millions of tickets over the last two years.
The legal status of bots is unclear. They are banned in a handful of states, but those laws have proved largely ineffectual, and enforcement at the federal level has also been a disappointment to the concert business.
Three years ago, four men connected with a company called Wiseguy Tickets were indicted on conspiracy, wire fraud and other charges, for apparently using bots to get tickets to Bruce Springsteen, Hannah Montana and other concerts.
The case hinged on whether the men had committed actual crimes or had merely violated the terms of service on Ticketmaster's site; in the end three of the men were sentenced only to probation and community service (one remained at large).
''They got a slap on the wrist,'' Mr. Rapino said. ''It wasn't much of an actual deterrent.''
Not everyone is convinced that bots are the primary villain of the everyday concertgoer. The Fan Freedom Project, a nonprofit group financed by StubHub, has pushed for anti-bot laws around the country, and Jon Potter, its president, praised Ticketmaster for filing its lawsuit last month.
But he also criticized the industry practice of ''holds,'' in which sometimes large blocks of tickets are reserved for sponsors, fan club members and industry contacts, and never go on sale to the general public.
When it comes to the secondary ticket market, Live Nation has a complicated position. As much as it is trying to block bots, it also profits from the ticket resale market through TicketsNow -- its own version of StubHub -- as well as through deals with major sports groups, like the National Basketball Association. Mr. Rapino sees no contradiction in Live Nation's stance.
''I have no problem if you bought a Justin Timberlake ticket and you decide to go sell that ticket to somebody,'' he said. ''We would first and foremost want to make sure that the first ticket sold, that the fan has a shot to buy that ticket.''

HEADLINE: In Sales, 'Fast & Furious 6' Wins Fast and Furiously

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood expected a box-office drag race to end them all for the Memorial Day weekend, with two huge-scale sequels, both in categories most popular with younger men, opening in rare direct competition. But it turned out to be no contest at all.
''Fast & Furious 6'' raced to a projected $122.2 million in ticket sales for the four-day period, easily claiming the No. 1 spot at North American theaters, while ''The Hangover Part III'' blew a tire and overheated, taking in a disappointing $63.8 million since its arrival on Thursday. Despite the collapse of ''The Hangover'' -- Part II took in $135 million over its first five days in 2011 -- it was still a very good weekend for studios and theaters. 
Analysts projected total sales in North America of $323 million for the holiday period, more than the previous high mark for the same stretch, in 2004, when ''Shrek 2,'' ''The Day After Tomorrow'' and ''Troy'' contributed to $303.1 million in total sales after adjusting for inflation, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data.
''Star Trek Into Darkness'' (Paramount) was projected to take third place for the weekend, with ticket sales of about $48 million, for a two-week domestic total of $156.8 million. A new animated movie, ''Epic'' (20th Century Fox), was expected to place fourth, taking in a solid $44 million; it cost Fox about $93 million to make. And ''Iron Man 3'' (Disney) is anticipated to add $24.6 million to its pockets, for a four-week total of $372.7 million.
The differing fortunes of ''Fast & Furious 6'' (Universal) and ''The Hangover Part III'' (Warner Brothers) offer a window into movie franchise management in the social-media age. Ticket buyers -- even the highly forgiving ones who power the summer blockbuster season -- no longer appear willing to tolerate color-by-number sequels.
''The Hangover Part II'' received poor reviews and word of mouth, but most critics truly hated Part III, as evidenced by its positive score of only 21 percent on the review-aggregation site RottenTomatoes.com. ''Fast Five,'' meanwhile, delighted a majority of critics and generated positive chatter on Twitter and Facebook; ''Fast & Furious 6'' kept the quality going, receiving a 72 percent positive rating on RottenTomatoes.
''You cannot take anything for granted anymore,'' said Nikki Rocco, Universal's president for distribution about ''Fast & Furious 6.'' ''We never let up on this movie for one minute.''
Universal and a financing partner spent about $160 million to make ''Fast & Furious 6'' and at least another $100 million to market it. The movie, which has a multiracial cast led by Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Dwayne Johnson, was a smash among minority audiences; 32 percent of ticket buyers were Hispanic. Overseas, it was No. 1 in 59 countries, taking in $158 million, for a global total of $280.2 million.
''The Hangover Part III,'' which cost Warner and Legendary Pictures about $103 million to make and was backed by a similarly costly marketing campaign, opened in three foreign countries over the weekend, taking in about $19.2 million. ''The Hangover Part II'' took in a total of $332.3 million overseas -- an astounding amount for an R-rated comedy -- and international ticket sales for ''Part III'' are also expected to be strong.
''It wasn't what we expected, but we can still hold our heads up -- for an R-rated comedy to sell this many tickets in its first few days is still a pretty amazing feat,'' said Dan Fellman, Warner's president of domestic distribution. He added that he was hopeful about the weeks ahead, in part because ''there aren't a lot of comedies in the marketplace.''

HEADLINE: Consoles Moving Into Next Generation

BYLINE: By STEPHEN TOTILO. 
Stephen Totilo is the editor in chief of the gaming site Kotaku.com.

 BODY:
REDMOND, Wash. -- On a gray day here last week, Microsoft officials welcomed a few hundred people into a tent pitched on a soccer field at the company's headquarters. Microsoft was unveiling an appliance, the Xbox One, which takes up about as much room as a lazy house cat and is designed to be plugged into a television.
It is the latest in a generational line of Xboxes, PlayStations and Nintendos to arrive in the past quarter-century. To dedicated gamers, each generation is as relevant and real a part of the calendar as an Olympiad or a presidential election cycle. Gamers argue about which one is the best.
But the previous generation has stretched on longer than those before it and segues into the next at a time when there might be a meteor in the sky. Serious people discuss whether these new consoles, facing competition from cellphones and tablets, might be endangered. Untethered from a television, mobile devices -- which draw hundreds of millions of people to distraction with Angry Birds, Clash of Clans and Temple Run -- make gaming more convenient. The home console's appeal is dependent on the notion that gaming on a television still matters. 
The industry is at the start of its eighth console generation: the Xbox One, Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U. The Microsoft and Sony machines are planned for release this year; Nintendo's device shipped in November, for the 2012 holiday season. Generations typically last a half-decade and are preceded by the promise that the new, ever more powerful devices will improve the world's youngest major creative medium, make their manufacturers a lot of money and in some way reconfigure living rooms across the world.
The point of an Xbox is to ''bring the things you love to life,'' Don Mattrick, Microsoft's chief of interactive entertainment, said in an interview outside the Xbox One tent. ''You love entertainment. You love TV. You love games. This is going to be the premium experience for enjoying those things.''
Mr. Mattrick's challenge, like that of his counterparts at Sony and Nintendo, is to convince people that the game console and its ubiquitous controllers aren't going the way of the landline telephone or, in a threat that hits closer to home, the arcade machine. Just a few decades ago the home console was an upstart. By the late 1990s it was unseating arcade machines, gobbling the public's attention the way Pac-Man used to gobble all those dots (and quarters). Consoles like the Nintendo 64 and the Sony PlayStation brought the graphics and sounds of arcade-caliber gaming home and improved on them by offering richer, deeper worlds to play in.
The outgoing console generation started in 2005 with Microsoft's Xbox 360. Sony's PlayStation 3 followed a year later, as did Nintendo's Wii, with a motion-sensitive controller that turned it into a cultural phenomenon. In an age when iPhones are displaced every year, 2005-era console technology is nearly Paleolithic. It's a testament to the ability of programmers to squeeze performance out of an established hardware standard that new games on the Xbox 360 can still look and sound impressive in 2013.
Proponents of consoles argue that most mobile games, while increasing in appeal, lack key qualities of console gaming. ''They're very bite-sized, very light on the story, very light on the emotions and the different things that a proper sit-down-on-your-couch-with-a-50-inch-screen-and-surround-sound experience can provide,'' said Scott Rohde, who leads the highly regarded in-house American game development studios for Sony PlayStation.
Microsoft's vision for the Xbox One extends beyond gaming. It is designed to switch from playing games to showing cable television with a snap of the fingers. Older consoles simply played games, but newer ones are designed to play television shows and movies.
That shift in focus has been gradual but definite at Microsoft, which added one of its most popular features to the Xbox 360, the ability to stream movies through Netflix, in 2008. At the tent event Mr. Mattrick, a former video game designer, announced a deal with the N.F.L. that would empower the Xbox One to display an interactive fantasy league application on the right side of a TV while the left side displayed a live football game.
Mr. Rohde and Mr. Mattrick may be rivals in the current console generation, but they are joined by colleagues on both sides who argue that the increased horsepower and technical flash of new consoles can make video game characters appear to be more realistic and increase a player's emotional engagement. They suggest that better technology enables greater aesthetic achievement in their medium. This is by no means a settled point, nor even a universally shared belief of what it takes to advance the artistry of games. That view was in fact recently mocked at a recent conference for game creators by the independent developer Chris Hecker, who played a reel of proclamations by top console game developers who claimed that more powerful technology would beget more emotionally sophisticated gaming.
Mr. Rohde acknowledged that one of the more emotionally affecting games of last year, a graphically simple, narrative-heavy spinoff of the zombie comic and TV show ''The Walking Dead,'' could run on numerous platforms, from consoles to cellphones. He considers that game an exception and cited the PlayStation 3's forthcoming The Last of Us, a more graphically complex survival adventure set in a nearly photorealistic ruined United States, as an example that requires a powerful console.
Mr. Rohde also pointed to economics, saying that the low prices of many mobile games (around $1) restrict development budgets to a fraction of those for lavish $60 console games.
Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo have all begun courting independent game creators for their consoles. A common selection for 2012 game of the year was a smaller PlayStation 3 exclusive called Journey, a quiet, surreal nature-walk of a game made by a small team of developers whom Sony signed out of graduate school. One of the most popular games on the Xbox 360 last year was the console's version of the PC hit Minecraft, a building-block game designed nearly single-handedly by a developer in Sweden known as Notch.
For the Xbox One, Mr. Mattrick speaks of a smarter device that recognizes its users and adapts to them. His team has integrated the console with a new generation of Microsoft's successful visual and aural sensor Kinect. A result is something that might seem more futuristic and also a bit strange. The new Kinect can track gestures, read a player's heart rate by looking at his or her face, and respond to verbal commands. It must be plugged in for the Xbox One to operate, though the entire system can be turned off to alleviate concerns that it might spy on people.
The PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One are both expected to be released this fall, probably up against new devices from Apple and other mobile competitors. Games are likely to be popular on all of those machines.
''What's so exciting about this particular time in the history of gaming is that it's more wild than it's ever been,'' Mr. Rohde said. ''No one on the planet knows quite where it's going to go.''

HEADLINE: Geoengineering: Our Last Hope, or a False Promise?

BYLINE: By CLIVE HAMILTON. 
Clive Hamilton, a professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University, is the author, most recently, of ''Earthmasters: The Dawn of the Age of Climate Engineering.''

 BODY:
CANBERRA, Australia -- THE concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere recently surpassed 400 parts per million for the first time in three million years. If you are not frightened by this fact, then you are ignoring or denying science.
Relentlessly rising greenhouse-gas emissions, and the fear that the earth might enter a climate emergency from which there would be no return, have prompted many climate scientists to conclude that we urgently need a Plan B: geoengineering.
Geoengineering -- the deliberate, large-scale intervention in the climate system to counter global warming or offset some of its effects -- may enable humanity to mobilize its technological power to seize control of the planet's climate system, and regulate it in perpetuity.
But is it wise to try to play God with the climate? For all its allure, a geoengineered Plan B may lead us into an impossible morass. 
While some proposals, like launching a cloud of mirrors into space to deflect some of the sun's heat, sound like science fiction, the more serious schemes require no insurmountable technical feats. Two or three leading ones rely on technology that is readily available and could be quickly deployed.
Some approaches, like turning biomass into biochar, a charcoal whose carbon resists breakdown, and painting roofs white to increase their reflectivity and reduce air-conditioning demand, are relatively benign, but would have minimal effect on a global scale. Another prominent scheme, extracting carbon dioxide directly from the air, is harmless in itself, as long as we can find somewhere safe to bury enormous volumes of it for centuries.
But to capture from the air the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by, say, a 1,000-megawatt coal power plant, it would require air-sucking machinery about 30 feet in height and 18 miles in length, according to a study by the American Physical Society, as well as huge collection facilities and a network of equipment to transport and store the waste underground.
The idea of building a vast industrial infrastructure to offset the effects of another vast industrial infrastructure (instead of shifting to renewable energy) only highlights our unwillingness to confront the deeper causes of global warming -- the power of the fossil-fuel lobby and the reluctance of wealthy consumers to make even small sacrifices.
Even so, greater anxieties arise from those geoengineering technologies designed to intervene in the functioning of the earth system as a whole. They include ocean iron fertilization and sulfate aerosol spraying, each of which now has a scientific-commercial constituency.
How confident can we be, even after research and testing, that the chosen technology will work as planned? After all, ocean fertilization -- spreading iron slurry across the seas to persuade them to soak up more carbon dioxide -- means changing the chemical composition and biological functioning of the oceans. In the process it will interfere with marine ecosystems and affect cloud formation in ways we barely understand.
Enveloping the earth with a layer of sulfate particles would cool the planet by regulating the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth's surface. One group of scientists is urging its deployment over the melting Arctic now.
Plant life, already trying to adapt to a changing climate, would have to deal with reduced sunlight, the basis of photosynthesis. A solar filter made of sulfate particles may be effective at cooling the globe, but its impact on weather systems, including the Indian monsoon on which a billion people depend for their sustenance, is unclear.
Some of these uncertainties can be reduced by research. Yet if there is one lesson we have learned from ecology, it is that the more closely we look at an ecosystem the more complex it becomes. Now we are contemplating technologies that would attempt to manipulate the grandest and most complex ecosystem of them all -- the planet itself. Sulfate aerosol spraying would change not just the temperature but the ozone layer, global rainfall patterns and the biosphere, too.
Spraying sulfate particles, the method most likely to be implemented, is classified as a form of ''solar radiation management,'' an Orwellian term that some of its advocates have sought to reframe as ''climate remediation.''
Yet if the ''remedy'' were fully deployed to reduce the earth's temperature, then at least 10 years of global climate observations would be needed to separate out the effects of the solar filter from other causes of climatic variability, according to some scientists.
If after five years of filtered sunlight a disaster occurred -- a drought in India and Pakistan, for example, a possible effect in one of the modeling studies -- we would not know whether it was caused by global warming, the solar filter or natural variability. And if India suffered from the effects of global dimming while the United States enjoyed more clement weather, it would matter a great deal which country had its hand on the global thermostat.
So who would be turning the dial on the earth's climate? Research is concentrated in the United States, Britain and Germany, though China recently added geoengineering to its research priorities.
Some geoengineering schemes are sufficiently cheap and uncomplicated to be deployed by any midsize nation, or even a billionaire with a messiah complex.
We can imagine a situation 30 years hence in which the Chinese Communist Party's grip on power is threatened by chaotic protests ignited by a devastating drought and famine. If the alternative to losing power were attempting a rapid cooling of the planet through a sulfate aerosol shield, how would it play out? A United States president might publicly condemn the Chinese but privately commit to not shooting down their planes, or to engage in ''counter-geoengineering.''
Little wonder that military strategists are taking a close interest in geoengineering. Anxious about Western geopolitical hubris, developing nations have begun to argue for a moratorium on experiments until there is agreement on some kind of global governance system.
Engineering the climate is intuitively appealing to a powerful strand of Western technological thought that sees no ethical or other obstacle to total domination of nature. And that is why some conservative think tanks that have for years denied or downplayed the science of climate change suddenly support geoengineering, the solution to a problem they once said did not exist.
All of which points to perhaps the greatest risk of research into geoengineering -- it will erode the incentive to curb emissions. Think about it: no need to take on powerful fossil-fuel companies, no need to tax gasoline or electricity, no need to change our lifestyles.
In the end, how we think about geoengineering depends on how we understand climate disruption. If our failure to cut emissions is a result of the power of corporate interests, the fetish for economic growth and the comfortable conservatism of a consumer society, then resorting to climate engineering allows us to avoid facing up to social dysfunction, at least for as long as it works.
So the battle lines are being drawn over the future of the planet. While the Pentagon ''weaponeer'' and geoengineering enthusiast Lowell Wood, an astrophysicist, has proclaimed, ''We've engineered every other environment we live in -- why not the planet?'' a more humble climate scientist, Ronald G. Prinn of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has asked, ''How can you engineer a system you don't understand?''

HEADLINE: Entrepreneur Seeks to Offer High-Quality Education at Fraction of Cost

BYLINE: By D.D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
London -- When Sunny Varkey was 4 years old, his parents left him in the care of family members in his native India while they ''went to seek green pastures'' teaching English as a second language in Dubai in the late 1950s, in what was then a sleepy British protectorate on the southeast coast of the Gulf.
''My parents were brought over by Easa Saleh al-Gurg, who later became the United Arab Emirates ambassador to Great Britain,'' he said in a recent interview in London. ''Our family came with empty hands, but in those days the U.A.E. was a land of opportunity.''
Initially his parents' pupils came almost exclusively from local families, but the discovery of oil in Dubai in 1966 brought an influx of foreign workers, many from the Asian Subcontinent. Two years later, Mr. Varkey's parents opened Our Own English High School, the first private school in Dubai for Indian students. Meanwhile Mr. Varkey was completing his own education, first at a Catholic boarding school in India and then in Dubai, followed by a year at a college on the Isle of Wight, in Britain. 
''I did not study much,'' Mr. Varkey said. He joined his parents in 1970, just before Dubai gained its independence from Britain, and took over the company in 1980, starting with his parents' single school in Dubai.
Although he never attended university himself, he now runs GEMS Education, which claims to be the largest private provider of K-12 education in the world, and presides over a network of about 70 schools operating in 18 countries, from the United States to Britain, Egypt to China. His two sons, Dino and Jay, now hold senior positions at the company, making it a three-generation endeavor.
In addition to owning schools with a total of 130,000 students, the Dubai-based company also manages schools and school systems on government contracts and acts as consultants in the Philippines and several African countries.
Despite his company's growing influence, Mr. Varkey has long avoided the media spotlight. But with more recent moves into Britain and the United States, that seems to have changed. In February the company hosted the first Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai, bringing together 500 delegates to discuss the relationship between governments and the private sector. It included Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president who was recently named honorary chairman of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, the company's philanthropic arm.
Mr. Varkey cited the attendance of Mr. Clinton and former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain as evidence of his ambition to turn the annual gathering ''into the Davos of education.''
Mr. Varkey's increasing prominence has also brought greater scrutiny both of his business model and his educational philosophy. From the beginning, the GEMS schools in Dubai took for granted a kind of ethnic segregation.
''We had an Indian school, we had a Pakistani school. We also opened a British school,'' where ''we had key British teachers -- the head of school, head of curriculum, and so on, as well as a number of Asian teachers,'' Mr. Varkey said.
The company remains the largest employer of British teachers outside of the United Kingdom, as well as the largest employer of Indian teachers outside of India. Pay scales at each school are linked not to the local economy or the nature of the school, but to salaries in a teacher's home country.
And while the company boasts that it provides the same high-quality education at its least-expensive schools (where fees are approximately $750 a year) as it does at premium schools (where fees can exceed $40,000), there has been criticism at both ends of the scale.
GEMS announced last year plans to open six private schools in Britain charging between £8,000 and £12,000 -- or between $12,000 and $18,000 -- a year. That works out to roughly one-half to one-third of the price of more prestigious private schools like Eton or Winchester.
The head of Brighton College, in Sussex, which charges more than £18,000 a year and has no relation to GEMS, said that the only way to cut costs would be to increase class sizes. ''Any school that thinks it can stint on teachers' salaries and class sizes while still offering a first-class education is kidding itself,'' Richard Cairns, Brighton College's headmaster, told The Guardian.
When GEMS first came to Britain in 2004, it raised class sizes by as much as a third at a school in Milton Keynes, and parents complained.
In 2008, parents with children at the GEMS Jumeirah Primary School in Dubai wrote to Mr. Varkey after class sizes were increased. There have also been complaints about sharp increases in school fees and the closure of the Westminster School in Dubai after the country's school regulator would not raise a cap on private school tuition.
Jane Donovan's two daughters, now aged 10 and 7, have attended GEMS Wellington since they moved to Dubai three years ago. In Britain, they had attended a private school with similar tuition fees.
''I can see how it would be a struggle for parents who, for the first time, have to pay for education because there is no public option for them,'' she said, referring to the fact that expatriates in the U.A.E. do not have the same access to free public education that local citizens do, or that they would have had back in their home countries.
''But we were paying anyway back home, and we were very happy with the quality of teaching and school grounds at GEMS,'' Mrs. Donovan said.
When challenged on class size, Mr. Varkey pointed to airlines, which offer first class, business and economy seats on the same plane, or to Mercedes, which produces several classes of cars.
''The difference is facilities,'' he said. At Our Own English High School, an Indian girls' school in Dubai with 10,000 students, tuition is just $2,000 a year. ''But every graduate of that school went to university,'' he said.
One of the company's premium schools, also in the United Arab Emirates, offers students an Olympic running track, planetarium and swimming pool for their $40,000 a year.
Class sizes in the company's less expensive schools can reach 30 or 35 students. But Mr. Varkey says his customers know what they are getting. ''Indian middle-class parents are not the same as middle-class parents in the U.K.,'' he said. Indian parents ''want their children to get good grades to go on to a good university. They don't place much importance on tennis or golf.''
''You can't rely on a fee structure to determine the quality of a school,'' said Roopa Chan, a Dubai-based teacher who had taught English at a GEMS affiliate, Our Own Indian School. ''Maybe the infrastructure is good, and it's a posh environment, but that doesn't always guarantee greater quality.''
Mr. Varkey has ambitious plans for Britain, the United States and Europe; in September GEMS will open a school in Etoy, Switzerland, following the International Baccalaureate curriculum. However, the legion of South Asian expatriates who have moved overseas remain his core customers. ''They don't have social security, so they have to work their butts off to achieve,'' Mr. Varkey said.
As long as globalization continues, ''our business will remain recession proof,'' he said. He has just completed a $550 million round of financing to help the company continue to expand into countries where ''we can deliver a higher quality of education than the state can provide.''
Sara Hamdan contributed reporting from Dubai.

HEADLINE: Doing More for U.S. Veterans

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Memorial Day commemoration on Monday honors the 1.25 million Americans who have fallen for their country. It also affords an opportunity to show concern for living service members, active and retired.
The picture is complex and contradictory. The U.S. military is more capable than ever, and well provided for despite threats of mindless across-the-board spending cuts under the so-called sequestration. At the same time, the armed forces are plagued by soaring suicide rates and rising incidents of sexual assault and worn down by multiple tours of combat duty.
Conditions for veterans are similarly mixed. The Veterans Affairs budget has more than doubled in less than a decade; the United States and China are the only countries whose military budgets exceed what the United States spends on veterans alone. An updated version of the G.I. Bill has sent more than one million veterans to college. Thanks to White House prodding, employment opportunities for former service members are improving. Still, joblessness and homelessness are higher for veterans than the national average, and many face lengthy bureaucratic nightmares to get their military disability benefits. 
''Our active military force today is remarkable; never has a force been so continuously involved for so long in combat,'' says Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a Democrat who served as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division and is an influential voice on military matters. ''This service has taken a toll; we see many pressures. There are other pressures on those who've served before.''
Most experts agree with Mr. Reed's assessment of the current force.
''There never has been in the history of the planet a military even three-quarters as good as ours,'' said Michael E. O'Hanlon, a military affairs scholar at the Brookings Institution.
If the war in Afghanistan winds down next year, as President Barack Obama has promised, and if no new conflict arises, the military budget can be pared back, though more modestly and carefully than it would be under sequestration. Mr. O'Hanlon, a close associate of David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. chief, argues that the active-duty army and Marine levels can be reduced; the navy, rather than increasing the size of its fleet, can deploy its resources more efficiently, and the air force only needs about half of the new F-35 joint strike fighters it has ordered.
The social problems may be thornier. The suicide rate for active-duty personnel reached a record high last year. While the Pentagon is devoting more resources to mental health, tragedies remain too common.
About 15 percent of the military are women; sexual assaults have risen, capturing the attention of both the president and Congress. In the military justice system, commanding officers have the authority to change the penalties in an assault conviction; the administration and lawmakers are seeking to change that loophole. Some want to go so far as requiring an automatic dishonorable discharge for anyone convicted of sexual assault.
The outlook for veterans is full of good as well as disturbing news. The robust defense budget is largely intact, even under sequestration. And despite the unemployment rate of almost 10 percent among veterans of the post-Sept. 11 era, there's progress on the jobs front. The armed services' training and job placement efforts are better, and the continuing education benefits are substantial.
Led by the first lady, Michelle Obama, the administration has received commitments to hire veterans from major corporations, including Wal-Mart, McDonald's, Blackstone and Home Depot.
Serious problems persist. About 15 percent of all veterans are homeless, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
And the Department of Veterans Affairs has failed to fix the lengthy delays in processing benefits. More than 500,000 claims have been pending for more than four months; some are held up for years. This infuriates veterans.
Mr. Reed notes that the head of the V.A., Eric K. Shinseki, is himself a veteran with disabilities -- part of his foot was blown off in Vietnam -- and ''understands what these veterans are going through.'' He says the results so far are unsatisfactory, however.
Two-thirds of the senators have called on Mr. Obama to become personally engaged in addressing this debacle. Paul Rieckhoff, the founder of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that in March, he suggested to the White House chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, that the president should speak out on this issue. ''We're still waiting,'' Mr. Rieckhoff said.
Whatever the difficulties, the United States treats returning warriors with a regard, affection even, that once was lacking.
During Vietnam, ''the whole country turned against the war,'' says Colin L. Powell, who served as an army officer in Vietnam and later became chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of state.
Now, with a volunteer military, the public has shown appreciation and respect for veterans since the first Gulf War in the early 1990s, Mr. Powell notes with satisfaction.

HEADLINE: Trying to Revive Mideast Talks, Kerry Pushes Investment Plan for West Bank

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and JODI RUDOREN

 BODY:
DEAD SEA, Jordan -- In an effort to revive the moribund peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Secretary of State John Kerry announced a plan on Sunday to invest as much as $4 billion to develop the economy of the West Bank.
Sketching out a vision of a transformed Middle East, Mr. Kerry said an infusion of private sector investments could increase the gross domestic product of the West Bank by 50 percent over three years and slash unemployment, which now hovers around 21 percent, by two-thirds.
In highlighting the plan at a conference here of the World Economic Forum, Mr. Kerry hoped to spur Israel and the Palestinians to begin talks on a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement amid concerns that the window for initiating negotiations may begin to close.
''Negotiations can't succeed if you don't negotiate,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''We are reaching a critical point.'' 
Mr. Kerry said that the investments under the plan would be made in the areas of tourism, light manufacturing, agriculture, construction, energy and technology. The idea would be to give the Palestinians an incentive to negotiate and to ensure that a Palestinian state in the West Bank would be viable.
Neither Mr. Kerry nor his aides provided any details on what specific projects were envisioned, who might invest and what modifications might be required in Israeli restrictions on the West Bank for the plan to work.
Reporters traveling with Mr. Kerry were told to direct their questions to the ''quartet,'' a Middle East peacemaking group whose experts devised much of the plan. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain serves as the Middle East envoy for the group, which is made up of the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations.
A statement issued Sunday night by Mr. Blair's office said the economic initiative was intended to parallel the political process and not replace it. Officials from the quartet are still consulting experts on the Palestinian economy and will provide details about specific options ''in due course,'' the statement said.
As Mr. Kerry has tried to set the stage for negotiations, Palestinian officials said he had asked them to hold off on seeking membership in international forums to underscore their claim to statehood, a request they said they would comply with only until June 7. The Israeli government, meanwhile, has quietly refrained from issuing bids for construction in West Bank settlements or from announcing major building projects.
''Time is not on anyone's side in this,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''And changes on the ground could rob all of us of the possibilities of peace.''
After his speech, Mr. Kerry went to a private dinner at which his economic initiative seemed sure to be discussed. The guests included Mr. Blair; Tim Collins, a wealthy financier whom State Department officials have described as one of the advocates of the initiative; and the foreign ministers from Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
Mr. Kerry has noted that there are people in both the Israeli and the Palestinian camps who are skeptical of the peace process. Some of that skepticism was evident at the conference on Sunday.
President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority praised the business initiative while also noting that Palestinian youth had ''started to lose their confidence in the two-state solution because what they see on the ground makes them truly have no hope.''
In a forceful and at times angry speech, Mr. Abbas assailed Israel for failing to release Palestinian prisoners as outlined in previous agreements and for refusing to discuss the issue of Palestinian refugees outside of negotiations.
President Shimon Peres of Israel, whose own speech to the meeting was largely a lofty discussion of the yearnings of a young generation, pleaded with Mr. Abbas to save such issues for the negotiating table.
''When I listen to the arguments on both sides, I could say, 'Well, nothing can happen,' '' Mr. Peres said, diverging from his prepared text to address his counterpart directly.
''All these differences, they are deep, they are moving, they are important,'' Mr. Peres said to Mr. Abbas. ''All of this should be really done around the table. Let's sit together -- you'll be surprised how much can be achieved in open and direct and organized meetings.''
For all of those soothing words, Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, has questioned Mr. Peres's ability to forge peace, noting his largely ceremonial role. ''The only one who needs to be convinced, and I urge Mr. Peres to exert every possible effort to convince him, is the prime minister of Israel saying he accepts two states on 1967,'' Mr. Erekat told reporters here Sunday. ''He needs to say it.''
Before Mr. Kerry's speech, a group of Israeli and Palestinian business moguls gave their own impassioned call for negotiations, saying that ''the status quo, fraught with shattered hopes, is unsustainable and dangerous.''
The group, calling itself Breaking the Impasse, has met more than 20 times in the past year and includes about 300 executives of high-tech, construction, beverage and insurance companies, as well as banks, and many Palestinian investors from abroad. Representatives of the group said they met on Thursday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and have also met with President Abbas.
Leaders of the group said at a news conference that they would leave the specifics of how to resolve the conflict to the politicians. But Munib R. Masri, a Palestinian billionaire who is one of the leaders of the effort, later told the conference that the two states should be drawn along the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as a shared capital -- the standard line of the Palestinian leadership and a position Mr. Netanyahu was sure to reject.
''They call us the silent majority,'' Mr. Masri, chairman of the Palestine Development and Investment Corporation, said at the news conference earlier. ''We are not silent anymore. We are going to say our opinion in order to have a better life, for us and for our grandchildren in the future.''
Yossi Vardi, a venture capitalist considered a godfather of Israel's high-tech sector, said with emotion that he had lived most of his 70 years ''in the shadow of this conflict,'' and warned, ''The biggest risk is that we begin to treat it like a chronic disease, we begin to lose hope that it can be solved, though everybody agrees that it should be solved.''
Mr. Vardi told reporters: ''Enough is enough. Too much tears were shed by mothers. You may call us naïve, you may ask us what is new, you may have lost hope. But we are cursed -- we are going to continue to pursue it.''

HEADLINE: Americans and Their Military, Drifting Apart

BYLINE: By KARL W. EIKENBERRY and DAVID M. KENNEDY. 
Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired Army lieutenant general, was the United States commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and the ambassador there from 2009 to 2011. He is a fellow at Stanford, where David M. Kennedy is an emeritus professor of history. They are, respectively, a contributor to and the editor of ''The Modern American Military.''

 BODY:
STANFORD, Calif. -- AFTER fighting two wars in nearly 12 years, the United States military is at a turning point. So are the American people. The armed forces must rethink their mission. Though the nation has entered an era of fiscal constraint, and though President Obama last week effectively declared an end to the ''global war on terror'' that began on Sept. 11, 2001, the military remains determined to increase the gap between its war-fighting capabilities and those of any potential enemies. But the greatest challenge to our military is not from a foreign enemy -- it's the widening gap between the American people and their armed forces.
Three developments in recent decades have widened this chasm. First and most basic was the decision in 1973, at the end of combat operations in Vietnam, to depart from the tradition of the citizen-soldier by ending conscription and establishing a large, professional, all-volunteer force to maintain the global commitments we have assumed since World War II. In 1776, Samuel Adams warned of the dangers inherent in such an arrangement: ''A standing Army, however necessary it may be at some times, is always dangerous to the Liberties of the People. Soldiers are apt to consider themselves as a Body distinct from the rest of the Citizens.'' 
For nearly two generations, no American has been obligated to join up, and few do. Less than 0.5 percent of the population serves in the armed forces, compared with more than 12 percent during World War II. Even fewer of the privileged and powerful shoulder arms. In 1975, 70 percent of members of Congress had some military service; today, just 20 percent do, and only a handful of their children are in uniform.
In sharp contrast, so many officers have sons and daughters serving that they speak, with pride and anxiety, about war as a ''family business.'' Here are the makings of a self-perpetuating military caste, sharply segregated from the larger society and with its enlisted ranks disproportionately recruited from the disadvantaged. History suggests that such scenarios don't end well.
Second, technology has helped insulate civilians from the military. World War II consumed nearly half of America's economic output. But in recent decades, information and navigation technologies have vastly amplified the individual warrior's firepower, allowing for a much more compact and less costly military. Today's Pentagon budget accounts for less than 5 percent of gross domestic product and less than 20 percent of the federal budget -- down from 45 percent of federal expenditures at the height of the Vietnam War. Such reliance on technology can breed indifference and complacency about the use of force. The advent of remotely piloted aircraft is one logical outcome. Reliance on drones economizes on both manpower and money, but is fraught with moral and legal complexities, as Mr. Obama acknowledged last week, in shifting responsibility for the drone program to the military from the C.I.A.
Third, and perhaps most troubling, the military's role has expanded far beyond the traditional battlefield. In Iraq and Afghanistan, commanders orchestrated, alongside their combat missions, ''nation-building'' initiatives like infrastructure projects and promotion of the rule of law and of women's rights. The potential for conflict in cyberspace, where military and civilian collaboration is essential, makes a further blurring of missions likely.
Together, these developments present a disturbingly novel spectacle: a maximally powerful force operating with a minimum of citizen engagement and comprehension. Technology and popular culture have intersected to perverse effect. While Vietnam brought home the wrenching realities of war via television, today's wars make extensive use of computers and robots, giving some civilians the decidedly false impression that the grind and horror of combat are things of the past. The media offer us images of drone pilots, thousands of miles from the fray, coolly and safely dispatching enemies in their electronic cross hairs. Hollywood depicts superhuman teams of Special Operations forces snuffing out their adversaries with clinical precision.
The Congressional Research Service has documented 144 military deployments in the 40 years since adoption of the all-voluntary force in 1973, compared with 19 in the 27-year period of the Selective Service draft following World War II -- an increase in reliance on military force traceable in no small part to the distance that has come to separate the civil and military sectors. The modern force presents presidents with a moral hazard, making it easier for them to resort to arms with little concern for the economic consequences or political accountability. Meanwhile, Americans are happy to thank the volunteer soldiers who make it possible for them not to serve, and deem it is somehow unpatriotic to call their armed forces to task when things go awry.
THE all-volunteer force may be the most lethal and professional force in history, but it makes a mockery of George Washington's maxim: ''When we assumed the Soldier, we did not lay aside the Citizen.'' Somehow, soldier and citizen must once again be brought to stand side by side.
Let's start with a draft lottery. Americans neither need nor want a vast conscript force, but a lottery that populated part of the ranks with draftees would reintroduce the notion of service as civic obligation. The lottery could be activated when volunteer recruitments fell short, and weighted to select the best-educated and most highly skilled Americans, providing an incentive for the most privileged among us to pay greater heed to military matters. The Pentagon could also restore the so-called Total Force Doctrine, which shaped the early years of the all-volunteer force but was later dismantled. It called for a large-scale call-up of the Reserves and National Guard at the start of any large, long deployment. Because these standby forces tend to contain older men and women, rooted in their communities, their mobilization would serve as a brake on going to war because it would disrupt their communities (as even the belated and smaller-scale call-up of some units for Iraq and Afghanistan did) in ways that sending only the standing Army does not.
Congress must also take on a larger role in war-making. Its last formal declarations of war were during World War II. It's high time to revisit the recommendation, made in 2008 by the bipartisan National War Powers Commission, to replace the 1973 War Powers Act, which requires notification of Congress after the president orders military action, with a mandate that the president consult with Congress before resorting to force. This would circumscribe presidential power, but it would confer greater legitimacy on military interventions and better shield the president from getting all the blame when the going got tough.
Congress should also insist that wars be paid for in real time. Levying special taxes, rather than borrowing, to finance ''special appropriations'' would compel the body politic to bear the fiscal burden -- and encourage citizens to consider war-making a political choice they were involved in, not a fait accompli they must accept.
Other measures to strengthen citizen engagement with the military should include decreased reliance on contractors for noncombat tasks, so that the true size of the force would be more transparent; integrating veteran and civilian hospitals and rehabilitation facilities, which would let civilians see war's wounded firsthand; and shrinking self-contained residential neighborhoods on domestic military bases, so that more service members could pray, play and educate their children alongside their fellow Americans. Schools, the media and organs of popular culture also have a duty to help promote civic vigilance.
The civilian-military divide erodes the sense of duty that is critical to the health of our democratic republic, where the most important office is that of the citizen. While the armed forces retool for the future, citizens cannot be mere spectators. As Adams said about military power: ''A wise and prudent people will always have a watchful and a jealous eye over it.''

HEADLINE: A Critical Moment For Penn Station

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
The New York City Planning Commission last week took a significant but fatally flawed step toward improving the lives of millions of New Yorkers and others who use Pennsylvania Station, the nation's busiest transit hub.
The commission voted on Wednesday to limit to 15 years the permit that allows Madison Square Garden to operate atop the station. The commission urged the arena to seek a new home while the railroads using the station -- Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, Long Island Rail Road and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- plan improvements for when the Garden is gone. The Dolan family, owners of the Garden, had asked that the permit, which expired this year, be renewed in perpetuity.
The City Council now has two months to vote on the ruling, or it becomes the law on its own. The Council should not let it stand. 
It should vote to limit the permit to 10 years, as both the local Community Board and the Manhattan borough president, Scott Stringer, have recommended. And it must strike out that fatal flaw, a loophole buried 65-odd pages into the commission report.
That loophole allows the Garden's permit to be extended by the planning commission's director without any further public hearing or public review. The railroads and the Garden's owners may simply agree among themselves to a plan for improved access to the station and better circulation. The director could then sign off on the plan. The commission's report requires some safety improvements, but sets no performance standards, no milestones to be met.
This is an open invitation to a back-room deal and to wholesale compromise of the sort that has made what should be a showcase gateway for the city into a blight and a safety hazard. What the city deserves is a new, safer, up-to-the-minute station and the next Madison Square Garden.
Usefully, the commission report does call for the railroads and state and federal officials to work with the city in considering the relocation of the Garden and improvements to rail service. Supporters of the Garden, including the Real Estate Board of New York, have made a big deal out of the fact that the Dolans poured hundred of millions of dollars into improving their dilapidated and aging building.
But those costs will be amortized during the coming decade or so (the Garden receives millions of dollars in tax abatements every year), and investment was a business decision the Dolans made knowing full well that the arena's operating permit might expire. It isn't the public's responsibility to compensate them for that decision.
From the broader perspective of the city's financial future, limiting the permit provides an extraordinary opportunity for long-term economic development in the surrounding district. The area is on the verge of transformation with the coming of Hudson Yards, the extension of the High Line and someday, perhaps, even high-speed rail, all presently held back by the condition of the Garden and Penn Station.
So the City Council should seize this opportunity, setting real benchmarks for the arena and the railroads during the next decade.
An Interstate 5 river bridge collapsed in Washington State on Thursday. The country's infrastructure urgently needs rebuilding. On June 7 the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will hold a hearing on improvements to the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston. Penn Station and the woefully inadequate century-old rail tunnels below the Hudson River are perennial illustrations of our failing system. Such a crucial hub could instead become a model of commitment to the future.
And the Garden, which has moved several times before, should profit from another new home, linked to mass transit, in a booming district where the arena would be not a decrepit relic but the best sports and entertainment facility in the city.
It's up to the City Council now. Close the loophole. Make the next decade count.

HEADLINE: For Bloomberg and Bike-Sharing Program, the Big Moment Arrives

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
He festooned New York City with hundreds of miles of bike lanes and dispatched chairs and picnic tables to Broadway, where cars once roamed.
He helped finance plans to send the No. 7 train to the Far West Side, and carried the banner of congestion pricing, even if in vain.
But for all of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's efforts to reimagine transportation in New York, critics and supporters seem to agree on the one that is most likely to define his 12 years at the city's controls.
And it starts on Monday. 
With the introduction of a European-style bike-share system, billed by city officials as the first new wide-scale public transportation option in more than half a century, Mr. Bloomberg's longstanding bet on cycling has reached its climactic moment.
The lofty ridership predictions presented by Mr. Bloomberg and his transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, will no longer be theoretical. Opponents' admonitions of overstuffed streets and perilous pedaling will prove either prescient or exaggerated.
''It is the free market, if you think about it,'' Mr. Bloomberg said on Friday during his weekly radio show. ''If people want to use them, they'll use them. If people don't, they don't.''
The program, which is to begin with 6,000 bikes stationed across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, will face immediate scrutiny from residents, riders and elected officials whose love or hate for the endeavor seemed to intensify over the past year of delays.
The holdup, wrought first by faulty software and then by flooding to equipment stored at the Brooklyn Navy Yard during Hurricane Sandy, has given the rollout a sharper political edge. The system, which was supposed to begin last summer, will now be introduced through the peak months of an election year. And the crop of candidates -- many of whom have been lukewarm toward Mr. Bloomberg's cycling policies in the past -- will be watching closely.
''If this is a fiasco -- and to me, a fiasco is mostly that the bikes just don't get used -- then, yeah, it's going to tarnish the legacy,'' said Charles Komanoff, a transportation economist and longtime cycling advocate in the city. ''More important, it's going to make it easier for the next mayor to backtrack.''
But if the program is an instant success, he added, ''it'll mean that almost anybody imaginable who is mayor is going to have to stick with whatever this mayor has already done.''
For all the administration's legwork -- which included hundreds of meetings with community groups, elected officials, property owners and other stakeholders, and an online feature that received more than 10,000 suggestions for bike station locations -- precise demand for bike share is near impossible to gauge.
Though bike commuting has grown on Mr. Bloomberg's watch, the most recent city figures showed that commuter cycling remained flat in 2012 during the typical riding season of April through October. In the same period, cycling had increased by 26 percent in 2009, 13 percent in 2010 and 8 percent in 2011, according to counts conducted at commuter points like the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge and the Queensboro Bridge.
Some officials remain skeptical about the depth of citywide interest in cycling.
''The projections for bike share, I can't say I buy,'' said Councilman James Vacca, the chairman of the Council's Transportation Committee. ''But we have to accept them as a given at this point because we have nothing else to go by.''
Ms. Sadik-Khan dismissed the most recent in-season cycling figure as statistical noise amid years of consistent growth numbers. She also pointed to an increase in off-season cycling in recent months: From December through February, the Transportation Department said, commuter cycling increased by 23 percent over the previous year. And the bike share program has already sold more than 14,000 annual memberships, Ms. Sadik-Khan said.
Whatever the appetite for bike share, Ms. Sadik-Khan has long argued that cycling infrastructure must be built in advance of demand as a way to encourage riding. In this way, the bike share program could be seen as an inevitable outgrowth, a plan that required years of investments before becoming feasible.
''We didn't just drop this bike share system in overnight,'' she said. ''We spent five years installing more than 350 miles of bike lanes.''
Asked about some residents' view that the bike share system amounted to the final chapter in the city's tussle over bike use -- the playoffs after a regular season that has lasted years -- Ms. Sadik-Khan wondered if any more rounds could possibly remain.
''If this is the playoffs, what's the finals?'' she said. ''As far as I'm concerned, we're there.''
While city officials have said that bike sharing is beloved in virtually every location at which it has been tried, some beginnings have been bumpy. The Vélib' system in Paris, one of the largest programs in the world, saw a spate of rider deaths in its early years and suffered widespread theft and vandalism of equipment.
John C. Liu, the city comptroller and a Democratic candidate for mayor, has called for a helmet requirement for the program, and accused the city of underestimating its financial exposure in bike crashes. The city said that helmet requirements were found to depress ridership in other cities.
''I hope nobody gets hurt,'' Mr. Liu said in an interview recently. ''But this is thousands of bicycles on the streets of Manhattan, used by people who haven't ridden bikes on the streets of Manhattan.''
Elsewhere, bike share programs have had a long history of attaching themselves to the reputations of their municipal cheerleaders. London's rides are called ''Boris bikes,'' after Mayor Boris Johnson, despite the fact that Mr. Johnson was not the mastermind of the plan, but merely the man in office when the bikes were introduced.
''I hope people call them 'Mike's bikes' or 'Bloomberg's bikes,' '' said Howard Wolfson, a deputy mayor for Mr. Bloomberg. ''It would be a powerful affirmation of the legacy for him.''
But as the program makes its debut, there remains one high-profile holdout, intrigued by the idea of bike share but unsure if it is for him: Mr. Bloomberg.
He said during his radio appearance on Friday that his last meaningful contact with a bike was in 2002, when he bought one before a possible transit strike that never materialized. So would he ride on Monday?
''I will 'ooh' and 'ahh,' '' he said. ''Whether I'll get on one, I don't know.''

HEADLINE: Mayoral Races of '70s Offer Similarities, if Little Insight, to the Current Field

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In 1973, the early front-runner's campaign for New York City mayor stalled after revelations that he had refused to answer questions from a grand jury. A former mayor flirted with running again to derail would-be successors. A runoff was imposed to guard against a weak candidate winning the Democratic primary, as had happened four years earlier, and, not incidentally, to hamper a black or Hispanic candidacy.
In 1977, a serial killer was holding the city hostage. A blackout led to looting and thousands of arrests. A financial crisis added to the sense of a city in turmoil. Against that backdrop, the freshman incumbent, Abraham D. Beame, was struggling to fend off six challengers and avoid being the first elected mayor in more than half a century to be dumped after one term. 
This year's mayoral campaign in New York is shaping up as the most heavily contested -- and unpredictable -- in four decades, since 1973 when, like this year, there was no incumbent, and 1977, when the election was transformed into a referendum on Mr. Beame's leadership.
The city today is much different -- far less crime, relatively stable finances and an electorate that has shifted from heavily Jewish to one dominated by minority voters. But like those two earlier races, the 2013 campaign is filled with intrigue and is difficult to predict.
The chief take-away from 1973 and 1977 is that being a front-runner early on does not necessarily matter when the votes are counted.
This year, no candidate in the field of 11 so far is considered a shoo-in.
In a heavily Democratic city where the party's candidates have lost the last five mayoral races, no popular consensus has emerged even about what New Yorkers want in a new mayor, much less which candidate would be best equipped to lead the city.
In 1973, polls showed Representative Mario Biaggi of the Bronx to be the front-runner in the months before the Democratic primary. Then news emerged that he had secretly invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in responding to questions from a federal grand jury looking at, among other things, his ties to a racetrack owner.
A former mayor, Robert F. Wagner, briefly considered running to try to thwart the aspirations of other candidates, including Mr. Biaggi. And it was the first time a runoff was imposed because no candidate received 40 percent of the vote in a primary.
As it turned out, Mr. Biaggi wound up third in the field of four major candidates. Mr. Beame, then the comptroller, came in first but did not earn enough votes to avoid a runoff against Herman Badillo, a Bronx congressman hoping to become the city's first mayor of Puerto Rican descent.
But Mr. Badillo's ill-advised derision of Mr. Beame as ''a malicious little man'' during a particularly nasty debate helped seal his fate.
Mr. Beame won the runoff, 61 percent to 39 percent, and was easily elected the city's first Jewish mayor in November, succeeding John V. Lindsay, who had chosen not to run.
''It wasn't clear who was going to follow him, so you ended up flooding the field,'' said Fred Siegel, a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute. ''No one could stake a strong claim.''
By 1977, the city had plunged into a financial crisis and Mr. Beame's competency became a central issue.
It was a slugfest in which Mr. Beame faced former Representative Bella S. Abzug; Representatives Badillo and Edward I. Koch; the Manhattan borough president, Percy E. Sutton; Mario M. Cuomo, the New York secretary of state; and Joel Harnett, a civic leader whose major contribution to the campaign was a lawsuit that prompted the release of a federal report criticizing the mayor's stewardship.
Mr. Beame had been expected to serve only one term and to endorse Mr. Sutton, who would have been the city's first black mayor. But, buffeted by the city's brush with bankruptcy, he opted instead for personal and political vindication by seeking another term.
Gov. Hugh L. Carey engineered the Liberal Party endorsement for Mr. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, and pledged to support him regardless of who won the Democratic primary -- leaving Mr. Beame, the presumed front-runner, ''dumbstruck,'' as he put it.
When Mr. Beame declared his candidacy for the September primary, he and Ms. Abzug were still considered the two front-runners. Mr. Koch was believed to have no sizable constituency outside his East Side district, and Mr. Cuomo seemed to have no compelling identity. By late August, though, they had inched within striking distance.
''The best-known figures, Abe Beame and Bella Abzug, were the front-runners, and the least known, Cuomo and Koch, emerged in the end as the real competitors,'' said Mark Penn, who was Mr. Koch's pollster. ''It was really a wide open field in which the next generation of political figures emerged as the winners.''
Mr. Koch attached himself at the hip to Bess Myerson, a former Miss America, to help deflect rumors that he was gay, rumors that some Cuomo supporters sought to capitalize on.
On primary night, Mr. Koch and Mr. Cuomo were the top two finishers, with Mr. Beame close behind.
Mr. Koch beat Mr. Cuomo in the runoff and went on to win the general election.
''How do long shots win?'' said Doug Muzzio, a professor of public policy at Baruch College. ''They brand themselves. Ed Koch branded -- re-branded -- himself as a law-and-order reform liberal. The bottom line is that in a segmented field, you organize and get out the tribe. And what the results say is that pre-election polling was relatively meaningless. Right up to the election it could have been any one of them.''
A similar wide open dynamic is at play this year, said Hank Sheinkopf, a political consultant. ''Now we have everybody splitting in a nonideological environment, and that means anything can happen.''

 BODY:
9 P.M. (Lifetime) RING OF FIRE (2013) Jewel, the Grammy-nominated singer, stars in this adaptation of ''Anchored in Love: An Intimate Portrait of June Carter Cash,'' John Carter Cash's narrative about his mother's life. The story traces her childhood in the mountains of Virginia and her rise to fame with the Carter Family to her solo career and turbulent but enduring marriage to Johnny Cash (Matt Ross, above, with Jewel). Frances Conroy rounds out the cast as June's mother, Maybelle Carter; John Doe portrays her uncle A. P. Carter, and the Peasall Sisters stand in for the Carter Sisters. At 6 on Oxygen, Reese Witherspoon, in an Oscar-winning role, and Joaquin Phoenix, in an Oscar-nominated performance, portray Johnny and June Carter Cash in James Mangold's ''Walk the Line'' (2005). 
7:30 P.M. (Disney) TOY STORY 3 (2010) As Andy (the voice of John Morris) heads to college, Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), the Potato Heads (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Jessie (Joan Cusack) and Rex (Wallace Shawn) find themselves at the Sunnyside Day Care Center -- a place that its seemingly jovial patriarch, Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty), explains is where toys are played with every day. Or are they? ''When the truth about Sunnyside is revealed, the movie has fun evoking prison escape pictures and horror films, darkening the Pixar palette to captivating (and, to some small children, possibly frightening) effect,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Ultimately, this three-film, 15-year epic ''about the adventures of a bunch of silly plastic junk turns out also to be a long, melancholy meditation on loss, impermanence and that noble, stubborn, foolish thing called love,'' Mr. Scott added. ''We all know money can't buy it, except sometimes, for the price of a plastic figurine or a movie ticket.''
7:30 P.M. (Cinemax) SAVAGES (2012) Two Southern California marijuana dealers -- Chon (Taylor Kitsch), a cynical combat veteran, and Ben (Aaron Johnson, above right, with Mr. Kitsch), a soulful Berkeley graduate -- and their gorgeous significant other, O (Blake Lively), take on Mexican traffickers in what A. O. Scott, writing in The Times, called ''Oliver Stone's feverish, fully baked, half-great adaptation of Don Winslow's ferocious and funny drug-war novel of the same name.'' The film, he added, ''is a daylight noir, a western, a stoner buddy movie and a love story, which is to say that it is a bit of a mess. But also a lot of fun, especially as its pulp elements rub up against some gritty geopolitical and economic themes.''
8 P.M. (ABC) THE BACHELORETTE Desiree Hartsock, who appeared to be headed for a relationship with Sean Lowe before being sent home during the Week 8 rose ceremony last season in ''The Bachelor,'' gives love a second chance with 25 new suitors.
9 P.M. (A&E) THE GLADES As Season 4 begins, Callie (Kiele Sanchez) considers the marriage proposal of Jim (Matt Passmore), whose attention is refocused when the dead body of an heiress is found in a plantation house. In the second-season premiere of ''Longmire,'' at 10, Sheriff Walt Longmire (Robert Taylor) deals with a hostage crisis resulting from a botched prison transfer.
9 P.M. (C-Span) FIRST LADIES: INFLUENCE & IMAGE C-Span, in collaboration with the White House Historical Association, examines the public role and private life of Frances Cleveland, who became the first first lady to be married in the White House when, at 21, she wed the 49-year-old Grover Cleveland.
10 P.M. (ABC) BRINGING UP BABY: ROYAL EDITION In this special edition of ''20/20'' Barbara Walters reports on the hoopla surrounding the impending arrival of the first child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and future heir to the British throne.
10 P.M. (13) DETROPIA (2012) In this ''Independent Lens'' presentation, the filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady cast an appreciative eye on the postindustrial blight in Detroit as longtime residents reminisce about that city's glory days and newcomers lured by bargain-basement real estate offer hope for renewal. ''Information and analysis are always distant seconds to mood and impression,'' Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in The Times. ''Like the vegetation that's slowly transforming abandoned homes into so-called feral houses, Tony Hardmon and Craig Atkinson's photography softens the jagged edges of dereliction, capturing a blasted urban nightmare seemingly held up by sheer force of will.''

HEADLINE: A Rising Tide of Suicides, and Access to Guns

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''All the Lonely People,'' by Ross Douthat (column, May 19):
There is an eerie parallel between the rising number of suicides among men over 50 and the rising number of suicides among young veterans in their 20s and 30s. Twenty-two veterans commit suicide each day, on average. 
There is also a connection between suicide and unemployment, especially for men in their 50s, whose economic prospects take a dive.
This is also true for the once immensely responsible young men in the military who now face employment they view as valueless among co-workers with little sense of team loyalty or understanding of the greater mission that propelled these veterans to volunteer for the military.
These veterans were once part of a military that knew them intimately, with team members they could lean on and battlefield companions who would defend them with their lives. For many veterans, these elements have vanished in the civilian world, and the ensuing loneliness coupled with hopelessness at never finding them again is the motivation for ending it all.
Judith Shulevitz reports in The New Republic that the number of lonely Americans will surely increase. So, too, will the number of veteran suicides, especially for reservists, unaccustomed to bearing the brunt of war, who return to shattered small self-owned businesses, and jobs that have disappeared.
WESLEY PORIOTIS Founder, Veterans Across America New York, May 20, 2013
To the Editor:
Ross Douthat mentions the role of guns in suicide.
Suicides are nearly 62 percent of all gun deaths in the United States, and more than 50 percent of all suicides are committed with a gun. And that's not all.
Suicide rates are nearly twice as high in parts of the country with weak gun laws and higher rates of gun ownership. Alaska, Wyoming and Montana have the highest gun suicide rates -- 14 per 100,000 people -- and New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts have the lowest gun suicides, 2 per 100,000 people.
The reason for this disparity is clear. Gun ownership is higher in states with weak gun laws. People who have more ready access to guns are more likely to kill themselves with guns than people who don't have such easy access.
In fact, a gun in the home increases suicide risk by 17 times. And because guns are so lethal, 85 percent of suicide attempts with a gun are fatal, whereas other means are much less so.
If we care about reducing suicides in America, we need to address our gun problem.

HEADLINE: Let Them Make Their Own Jobs

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Entrepreneurship and freelancing are all well and good but cannot replace a strong job-creating economy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
Legend has it that Marie Antoinette, told of Parisians protesting the shortage of bread, impatiently exclaimed, "Let them eat cake." 
American Express's chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, adopted a kinder tone in his commencement speech this year at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, but offered a similar message. Acknowledging that jobs are hard to find, he emphasized that new technology makes it easier to invent them. 
Yes, and the price of cake may have fallen relative to bread, but that is slim consolation to college graduates who face weak demand for their hard-won skills either as workers or entrepreneurs. Their new diplomas may send them to the front of the employment line, but the jobs they find there don't offer as much money or career potential as before. 
A recent report from the Economic Policy Institute estimates that the inflation-adjusted wages of young college graduates declined 8.5 percent from 2000 to 2012. Graduating in a poor job market has long-lasting negative consequences.

Such lemony facts can be turned into lemonade and sold by the side of the road. The business news media brims with celebration of millennial entrepreneurship and the rise of freedom-seeking freelancers. 
But entrepreneurship goes up with joblessness partly because it just sounds so much more hopeful. It also looks better on a résumé, since reported spells of unemployment reduce job chances. 
Largely as a result of "jobless" or "unintended" entrepreneurship, the number of individuals starting businesses increased in recent years. But the number bailing out grew even faster. The Great Recession reduced self-employment over all because sole proprietorships and small businesses were so hard hit by the downturn. 
Scott Shane, professor of management at Case Western Reserve University, points out that the median family incomes of the self-employed declined sharply relative to others from 2007 to 2009. 
He also emphasizes that start-ups are not revitalizing the United States labor market. The number of people employed in one-year-old businesses declined by half from 1990 to 2010. 
"Despite the claim that recessions are a time of opportunity for entrepreneurs," he explains, "the Great Recession had a negative impact on U.S. entrepreneurship." The same can be said of the Not-So-Great Recovery. 
In 2012, the number of venture capital deals was substantially lower than in 2007. The total amount of venture capital investment declined as well, to about 75 percent (in inflation-adjusted terms) of that in the earlier year. 
A recent Congressional Budget Office report shows that small and medium-size companies had disproportionately greater job losses than large companies in recent years. The latest Intuit Small Business Employment Index registers levels far below that of 2007. 
These trends show that employment and entrepreneurship aren't substitutes but complements. 
The same factors that are hurting the job market are making it hard for start-ups and small businesses to succeed: consumers aren't spending enough money to create an expansion on their own, and austerity-driven cuts in government spending are weakening economic growth. 
As Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute puts it, the declining prospects of young college graduates are clearly the result of "a demand problem, not a skills problem." 
Individual effort and ingenuity can't guarantee success in either finding or inventing jobs. 
Our national problem may be that we assume entrepreneurs are superheroes who can leap over macroeconomic constraints in a single bound, especially if liberated from the villainous clutches of government. 
But entrepreneurs can be crippled by a shortfall of demand for the goods and services they offer. And like the rest of us, they need bread, or at least cake, to survive.

 BODY:
 NEWS Two rockets crashed into southern Beirut suburbs controlled by the militant Shiite group Hezbollah on Sunday, wounding four people. The attack, the first on the group's Beirut stronghold since the hostilities in Syria broke out two years ago, raised anxieties here that the fighting next door was beginning to revive Lebanon's own sectarian conflicts. Anne Barnard reports from Beirut. 
In this age of satellite imagery, digital records and the instantaneous exchange of information, most of Greece's land transaction records are still handwritten in ledgers, logged in by last names. No lot numbers. No clarity on boundaries or zoning. No obvious way to tell whether two people, or 10, have registered ownership of the same property. Suzanne Daley reports from Athens.

Details of investigations into leaks of classified materials in the United States also hint at the personal and professional costs for those implicated. Ethan Bronner, Charlie Savage and Scott Shane report from Washington.

 ARTS For a year and a half the artist Ai Weiwei and a sculptor friend oversaw a team of people toiling away in secret on one of his most political and personal projects: reconstructing scenes from Mr. Ai's illegal detention in 2011, when he was held for 81 days in a secret prison guarded by a paramilitary unit. What took shape this spring at an industrial space in the Chinese capital were six fiberglass dioramas that depict, at half-scale, his often banal daily existence as a captive of the vast government security apparatus.

HEADLINE: Buyout Offer Brings China Into the Orbit of Club Med

BYLINE: ERIC PFANNER, NEIL GOUGH and KEITH BRADSHER


HIGHLIGHT: A Chinese conglomerate, Fosun International, is playing an unusually visible role in the proposed acquisition of Club M&#233;diterran&#233;e, a famous European brand. 

 BODY:
 7:52 p.m. | Updated 
Fewer "crazy signs." More karaoke.
That could be the future for Club Med, the French resort operator, which said Monday that it had received a $700 million buyout offer led by its two largest shareholders, an investment unit of the French insurer AXA and a Chinese conglomerate called Fosun International.
The proposed deal gives a Chinese company an unusually visible role in the acquisition and development of a prominent Western brand, which was founded in 1950 by a Belgian water polo player and for years defined the packaged exoticism of beach vacations for Europeans and North Americans. Now, though, the ascent of the Chinese tourist is helping reshape the world's idea of the ideal getaway.
Club Méditerranée has long been known for the blend of escapist fun and Frenchness in its vacation formula - including the staff's frequent performance of synchronized, heavily gesticulated dance moves set to pop music. 
With Chinese co-ownership, Club Med cannot help becoming a bit less French. It has been hit hard by the euro crisis, during which its name has been borrowed by economists as an epithet for the debt-ridden and austerity-ravaged countries of Southern Europe.
Club Med is looking to emerging markets, especially China, for new customers and new resorts, which it calls villages.
"We have to accelerate our growth in emerging markets, the largest of which is China," Henri Giscard d'Estaing, chief executive of Club Med, said by telephone on Monday. "That takes time, and you need shareholder and management stability. The goal of this agreement is to provide that stability."
Club Med ventured into China in 2010, opening a village at a ski resort called Yabuli, in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. Since then Club Med has added a second Chinese village, in the southern city of Guilin, known for its unusual, tombstone-shaped peaks.
At Yabuli, which attracts mostly domestic visitors, Club Med has adapted its entertainment offerings to suit local tastes, adding karaoke evenings, for example. Mah-jongg tables have replaced the poker and bridge tables, or Scrabble boards, at other Club Med villages.
China overtook the United States two years ago as the world's biggest source of foreign tourists. Mainland Chinese made 70 million overseas trips in 2011. That outpaced the 58.5 million overseas trips by Americans the same year. And last year, China for the first time became the biggest spender in global tourism. Outlays by Chinese traveling overseas reached $102 billion, up 40 percent from 2011, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Germans and Americans ranked second and third, each spending about $84 billion on their foreign trips, the agency said.
Club Med, while sticking to the concept of all-inclusive packages, in which it was a pioneer, has gone through many changes, and owners, since it opened its first resort on the Spanish island of Mallorca in 1950. In the early years, the resorts were designed as prototypical New Age retreats, where the visitors mingled socially with the staff.
The offbeat atmosphere evolved with the times. The stereotypical Club Med customer of the 1960s and '70s was satirized in "Les Bronzés," a racy 1978 French film directed by Patrice Leconte, in which a group of European visitors to a Club Med village in Ivory Coast take turns hooking up.
In the 1990s, Club Med tried to attract budget travelers, but was unable to compete with low-fare airlines and the Internet. It also branched into sports clubs. Over the last decade, it has moved upmarket, closing dozens of resorts, revamping others and repositioning its marketing to appeal to families.
So far, though, Club Med remains heavily dependent on Europe, which is a reason it has booked annual losses for five of the last seven years. Revenue has not regained the level of 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) reached in 2008.
Investors cheered the 17 euros a share French-Chinese buyout offer on Monday, sending Club Med's stock up 22 percent, to 16.95 euros, in Paris trading. The offer is a 23 percent premium over Club Med's closing price on Friday.
Central to Club Med's strategy to win more Chinese customers was a deal in 2010 that first brought in Fosun, which is based in Shanghai, as a strategic investor. Fosun has bought further shares since 2010, so that it now owns 9.96 percent of the share capital and 16.48 percent of the voting rights of Club Med.
France still accounts for 600,000 annual visitors, half of Club Med's total. But Mr. Giscard d'Estaing - son of the former French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing - said the company hoped to attract 200,000 Chinese guests in 2015, up from 90,000 last year. By the end of 2015, Club Med aims to have five villages in Asia, including one, at an unspecified beach location, that it plans to open this year.
"Fosun is a group that believes the upscale holiday is an area where growth will be well above the average economic growth for China," Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said.
Until recently, Chinese companies have tended to be cautious when it came to efforts to buy publicly traded companies, a wariness that stems in part from memories of a bid by the Chinese offshore oil company Cnooc for the United States oil producer Unocal in 2005.
That deal was effectively blocked by Congress. Instead, Chinese buyers have been aggressively pursuing privately held businesses, focusing mainly on European companies in machinery sectors like wind turbine component manufacturers.
The Fosun-backed offer for Club Med reflects the unusual relationship between the two companies. Many Western companies have expanded in China by setting up joint ventures with Chinese companies. Club Med chose a different route, allowing Fosun to buy a stake in the French parent company.
"It ensured full alignment of interests between the Chinese and foreign partners," André Loesekrug-Pietri, the chairman and managing partner of a Brussels-based private equity fund, the A Capital China Outbound Fund, said by telephone.
Mr. Loesekrug-Pietri said he had approached Fosun and Club Med in March 2010 with a proposal for Fosun and A Capital each to buy stakes in Club Med. Club Med was looking for a partner in China, and Fosun was seeking a way to use its extensive real estate in China.
Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said that while Fosun would be increasing its stake, the deal would keep a majority of Club Med in the hands of French shareholders. Analysts said, however, that they would not be surprised if AXA bowed out eventually, allowing Fosun to take over full control.
The inclusion of a pillar of the French corporate establishment may have been aimed at smoothing over any concerns in France about a loss of control over one of the country's best-known brands at a time when economic nationalism appears to be on the rise. For example, Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for industrial renewal, recently moved to block a possible takeover of a French online video site, Dailymotion, by Yahoo.
"The presence of AXA can have no other purpose than to reassure politicians like Montebourg that this will remain a French company," said Jean-Jacques Manceau, the author of a 2010 book on Club Med, "Réinventer la Machine à Rêves" ("Reinventing the Dream Machine").
Mr. Manceau said that to the increasingly wealthy customers that the company aims to attract, nationality might matter less. Karaoke aside, Chinese and French tourists are looking for a similar vacation experience.
"It's true that we have different ways of amusing ourselves," he said. "But the Club Med culture supersedes the individual cultures of any of the people who visit it."

HEADLINE: Really? The Claim: Fresh Produce Has More Nutrients Than Canned

BYLINE: ANAHAD O'CONNOR


HIGHLIGHT: Despite their reputation, canned fruits and vegetables retain many of their nutrients, in some cases better than fresh produce does. 

 BODY:
 THE FACTS 
One way to make healthful meals more economical is to incorporate canned fruits and vegetables, which are often cheaper and more convenient than fresh produce. But does that mean sacrificing nutrients? 
Thankfully, it does not. Studies show that like frozen produce, canned produce - provided it is free of added salt and sugars - has a nutrient value that is often as good as, if not better than, that of fresh produce.
Freshly picked fruits and vegetables typically do start with more vitamins and nutrients. But degradation occurs during shipping, and produce sold in many markets often sits on shelves or in storage for days before it reaches a shopper's basket.
Canned produce can lose some of its nutritional value as well, particularly water-soluble nutrients like vitamins B and C. But over all, the nutrients in canned fruits and vegetables tend to be relatively stable because they are protected from the deteriorating effects of oxygen, a fact emphasized in an extensive report on the subject published in The Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture by researchers at the University of California, Davis.
"Fresh fruits and vegetables usually lose nutrients more rapidly than canned or frozen products," the researchers wrote. "Losses of nutrients during fresh storage may be more substantial than consumers realize" and may not be reflected on nutrition labels.
At the end of the day, of course, either option is a healthy one.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Despite their reputation, canned fruits and vegetables retain many of their nutrients, in some cases better than fresh produce does.

HEADLINE: McCain Travels to Syria to Meet With Rebel Forces

BYLINE: MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and ERIC SCHMITT


HIGHLIGHT: Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has called for the Obama administration to intervene militarily in Syria, was the first United States senator to visit Syria to meet with the rebels since the conflict there began two years ago. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has called for the United States to intervene militarily in Syria, traveled to Syria on Monday to meet with rebel forces fighting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, according to a spokesman for Mr. McCain. It was the first time that a United States senator had gone to Syria to meet with the rebels since the conflict there began two years ago. 
Mr. McCain entered Syria from southern Turkey, according to his spokesman, Brian Rogers, who added that the senator had been in the region to attend the World Economic Forum meeting in Jordan over the weekend.
In 2011, Mr. McCain traveled to Libya to meet with rebel forces there while they were fighting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and made similar calls for the United States to provide military aid to the rebels. The United States did ultimately provide military support, along with several European countries, and Colonel Qaddafi's regime was toppled. 
Since the conflict in Syria began, Mr. McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, have harshly criticized President Obama for not doing more to help the rebels. They argue that the president, who has authorized the shipment of night-vision goggles and body armor, should establish a no-fly zone and provide weapons to the rebels.
While in Syria, Mr. McCain met with Gen. Salim Idris, the leader of the military wing of the Supreme Military Council, a Syrian opposition group. The Obama administration considers General Idris much more of a moderate than the leaders of the Nusra Front, which has ties to Al Qaeda and is better financed and organized. Mr. Obama has refused to provide the rebels with military support because he fears that would empower the more radical elements of the opposition. 
After the Israeli military struck a major Syrian military research center near Damascus this month, Mr. McCain said the strike had weakened the argument that Syria's air defense system would be difficult for the United States to penetrate. 
"The Israelis seem to be able to penetrate it fairly easily," he said on May 5 on "Fox News Sunday."
The United States, Mr. McCain said, could easily strike the Syrian defenses "with cruise missiles, cratering their runways, where all of these supplies, by the way, from Iran and Russia are coming in by air."

HEADLINE: James L. Tolbert, 86, an Early Lawyer to Black Hollywood

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
James L. Tolbert was in love. Marie Ross was too. But she had little interest in marrying a man who pieced together his income by hosting parties and concerts in empty buildings. One of his gimmicks: selling food and drink out of an old hearse.
''He was just hustling,'' said Mr. Tolbert's son, Tony. ''She said he needed to have some kind of career. She said, 'Doctor, lawyer or Indian chief.' '' 
Mr. Tolbert, a high school dropout, chose the second option. He went on to become one of the first black lawyers to represent black entertainers in Hollywood, and to play a central role in an early effort to improve the way blacks were portrayed on film and increase their numbers behind the scenes.
Mr. Tolbert, who was 86 when he died on April 22 in a hospital in the Los Angeles area, grew up surrounded by entertainers. His grandfather Willis Young was an anchor of the Los Angeles jazz scene in the 1930s, and the great saxophonist Lester Young was an uncle. After he graduated from Van Norman Law School in 1959, Mr. Tolbert began building a four-decade practice rooted in his family's connections.
His clients included the trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison, the actor and comedian Redd Foxx, and the singers Lou Rawls and Della Reese. Some of their success can be traced to the work Mr. Tolbert did as the young president of the Hollywood-Beverly Hills chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the early 1960s.
In June 1963, only weeks before the March on Washington, the N.A.A.C.P. mounted what some called the March on Hollywood: a political and economic campaign in which the organization promised to picket theaters, hold demonstrations and boycott major advertisers if film studios and unions did not portray blacks in more diverse roles and hire more of them to work in the industry.
At one news conference, Mr. Tolbert urged studios ''to have Negroes shown as they are, instead of as caricatures,'' and he challenged unions to hire at least one black worker for each production. Some unions later adopted an apprenticeship program but never carried it out, the N.A.A.C.P. said.
Some within the organization criticized Mr. Tolbert for not immediately insisting on advertising boycotts. But he portrayed himself as a moderate, preferring to press his case using practical arguments.
''We Negroes watch 'Bonanza' and buy Chevrolets,'' he told a group of broadcast and advertising executives in August 1963. ''We watch Disney on RCA sets. Jack Benny entertains us, and we buy General Foods products. Our babies eat Gerber baby foods, and we photograph them with Polaroid cameras.''
''We buy all the advertised products,'' he added, ''the same as you do.''
That September he noted that there had been some, if halting, progress in the kinds of roles black actors were receiving. But two years later, the N.A.A.C.P.'s national labor secretary, Herbert Hill, complained that what progress had been made had been fleeting.
James Lionel Tolbert was born on Oct. 26, 1926, in New Orleans. He and two of his sisters moved to Los Angeles when he was 10. He enlisted in the Army after he dropped out of high school.
Tony Tolbert confirmed his father's death, saying the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to his son, Mr. Tolbert is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Ms. Ross; their daughters, Anita and Alicia; two grandchildren; and two sisters, Martha Taylor and Esther Ford.
Tony Tolbert, who is a lawyer himself and an administrator at the School of Law at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that his father's law practice was hardly glamorous and that the entertainment work was just a facet of it. The home phone frequently rang late at night with calls from clients who had been arrested and hoped to be bailed out of jail. The Tolbert house nearly always had guests, some for a night, others for six months. Mr. Tolbert rarely said no.
It had an impact on his son. For the last two years, Tony Tolbert has made his own house in Los Angeles available to a struggling family for $1 a month in rent while he lives with his mother.
''He was a save-the-world kind of guy, for sure,'' he said of his father.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Justices Agree to Agree, at Least for the Moment

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- There has been a remarkable outbreak of harmony at the Supreme Court. Of the seven decisions issued in the last two weeks, six were unanimous.
There have been no dissents in more than 60 percent of the 46 cases decided so far this term. At this point last year, the justices were unanimous just 48 percent of the time, according to statistics compiled by Scotusblog. In the two terms before that, 52 percent of the cases decided by now were unanimous.
The harmony will dissipate in the final weeks of the term, which will probably conclude in late June. It is the divisive and hard-fought decisions that take the longest to produce, as the justices exchange draft opinions and respond to one other in evolving majority opinions, concurrences and dissents. 
The marquee decisions of the term -- on affirmative action, voting rights and same-sex marriage -- will almost certainly be closely divided on the core issues. But the overall percentage of unanimous decisions is unlikely to drop to 40 percent, the average rate for full terms in recent years.
For now, consensus reigns. That is partly because some of the recent decisions were decidedly minor. One, concerning a towed car, would not have been out of place in small claims court or before Judge Judy. Another, about the meaning of the word ''defalcation'' in the Bankruptcy Code, must have made Justice Stephen G. Breyer, its author, wonder what he had done to deserve the assignment.
But the justices were unanimous in significant cases, too. They let Monsanto protect its patented genetically modified soybeans and allowed American companies credits for some taxes paid abroad. Both times, the sums at stake were easily in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
The recent unanimous cases are noteworthy for a second reason: many truly speak with a single voice. The court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has set records for faux unanimity, where the justices agree on the result but barnacle the majority opinion with concurrences expressing caveats, interpretive glosses or wholly different rationales.
The recent unanimous cases are different. In five of the six, there was just one opinion.
Such authentically unanimous decisions are built to last. By contrast, when the justices agree on the result but disagree about the reasons for it, the majority opinion has less force. Pamela C. Corley, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University, wrote a 2010 book on Supreme Court concurrences and found that majority opinions undermined by such concurrences are less likely to be followed in lower-court decisions and in later ones from the Supreme Court.
How do the same justices who issue the bitterly contested decisions in headline-grabbing cases manage to agree so often? A new book with an apt title -- ''The Puzzle of Unanimity: Consensus on the United States Supreme Court'' -- surveys the territory and suggests some answers.
For starters, the justices know that unanimous rulings carry more weight. That is why Chief Justice Earl Warren worked so hard to unite the court in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education, the school desegregation case, and why President Richard M. Nixon found it hard to argue with the unanimous decision ordering him to turn over the Watergate tapes.
A divided decision, Judge Learned Hand wrote in 1958, ''cancels the impact of monolithic solidarity on which the authority of a bench of judges so largely depends.''
The three political scientists who wrote the new book -- Professor Corley, Amy Steigerwalt of Georgia State University and Artemus Ward of Northern Illinois University -- examined Supreme Court decisions between 1953 and 2004. They found that cases where the law was clear tended to produce unanimous rulings.
That sounds obvious. But it is hard to measure. The authors used sensible proxies for identifying straightforward cases: ones in which the lower courts were not divided, ones where there was no dissent in the ruling under review, ones addressing two or fewer legal issues, ones concerning statutes rather than the Constitution and ones that attracted no more than one supporting brief.
''Even the most ideologically polarized court finds agreement,'' the authors wrote, ''in cases where the available information points to a single legal answer.''
But they found that just 17 percent of decisions on civil liberties had no concurrences or dissents. In cases concerning government powers or economic matters, almost a third of the decisions were unanimous in that strict sense.
And of the 500 cases that appeared on the front page of this newspaper, they found, only 12 percent had no dissents or concurrences.
Justice Breyer, interviewed on NPR's ''Fresh Air'' in 2010, said such coverage could obscure the real work of the court.
''The press's job is to take those decisions that usually have very great visibility because they're political. So they're in the newspaper,'' he said. ''But you should remember, first of all, that probably 30 to 40 percent of our decisions are unanimous.''

HEADLINE: Bearing Down on Health Costs

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Say goodbye to that $500 deductible insurance plan and the $20 co-payment for a doctor's office visit. They are likely to become luxuries of the past.
Get ready to enroll in a program to manage your diabetes. Or prepare for a health screening to determine your odds of developing a costly health condition.
Expect to have your blood pressure checked or a prescription filled at a clinic at your office, rather than by your private doctor.
Then blame -- or credit -- the so-called Cadillac tax, which penalizes companies that offer high-end health care plans to their employees. 
While most of the attention on the Obama administration's health care law has been on providing coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans by 2014, workers with employer-paid health insurance are also beginning to feel the effects. Companies hoping to avoid the tax are beginning to scale back the more generous health benefits they have traditionally offered and to look harder for ways to bring down the overall cost of care.
In a way, the changes are right in line with the administration's plan: To encourage employers to move away from plans that insulate workers from the cost of care and often lead to excessive procedures and tests, and galvanize employers to try to control ever-increasing medical costs. But the tax remains one of the law's most controversial provisions.
Bradley Herring, a health economist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, suggested the result would be more widely felt than many people realize. ''The reality is it is going to hit more and more people over time, at least as currently written in law, '' he said. Mr. Herring estimated that as many as 75 percent of plans could be affected by the tax over the next decade -- unless employers manage to significantly rein in their costs.
The changes can be significant for employees. The hospital where Abbey Bruce, a nursing assistant in Olympia, Wash., worked, for example, stopped offering the traditional plan that she and her husband, Casey, who has cystic fibrosis, had chosen.
Starting this year, they have a combined deductible of $2,300, compared with just $500 before. And while she was eligible for a $1,400 hospital contribution to a savings account linked to the plan, the couple is now responsible for $6,600 a year in medical expenses, in contrast to a $3,000 limit on medical bills and $2,000 limit on pharmacy costs last year. She has had to drop out of school and take on additional jobs to pay for her husband's medicine.
''My husband didn't choose to be born this way,'' Ms. Bruce said. The union representing her, a chapter of the Service Employees International Union, has objected to the changes. Her employer, Providence Health & Services, says it designed the plans to avoid having employees shoulder too much in medical bills and has reduced how much workers pay in premiums.
Proponents of the law say the Cadillac tax is helping bring down costs by making employers pay attention to what their health care costs are likely to be in the long run. ''It's really one of the most significant provisions'' in the Affordable Care Act, said Jonathan Gruber, the M.I.T. economist who played an influential role in shaping the law. ''It's focusing employers on cost control, not slashing,'' he said.
Cynthia Weidner, an executive at the benefits consultant HighRoads, agreed that the tax appeared to be having the intended effect. ''The premise it's built upon is happening,'' she said, adding, ''the consumer should continue to expect that their plan is going to be more expensive, and they will have less benefits. ''
The trend is accelerating. The percentage of employers revising their plans as a result of the tax has increased to 17 percent this year from 11 percent in 2011, according to a survey of United States companies released this month by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans.
Although the tax does not start until 2018, employers say they have to start now to meet the deadline and they are doing whatever they can to bring down the cost of their plans. Under the law, an employer or health insurer offering a plan that costs more than $10,200 for an individual and $27,500 for a family would typically pay a 40 percent excise tax on the amount exceeding the threshold.
''I'm actually much more focused on the Cadillac tax in 2018 than on 2014,'' Steve First, a benefits executive at Pfizer, said at a recent meeting of employers. ''For us, 2018 is a challenge.''
Raising deductibles is one way to lower the cost.
Since 2009, the percentage of workers in plans with a deductible of at least $2,000 has doubled, to 14 percent, by 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. A little over a third of workers are in plans with a deductible of at least $1,000 a year.
Larger companies are also trying a variety of initiatives to improve the health of their workers -- experimenting with an array of disease management and wellness programs, for instance, or even setting up their own work-site clinics as a way to sidestep the tax.
''These changes will take time, and employers seem to recognize that,'' said Barry Schilmeister, a consultant for Mercer.
Cummins, the Columbus, Ind., engine manufacturer is one example of a company experimenting with both approaches. The tax ''is in our line of sight,'' acknowledged Dr. Dexter Shurney, the company's chief medical director.
Cummins has switched employees to plans with deductibles as high as $6,000 for a family and is working with health coaches to educate employees on the dangers of high sodium present in processed food, for example, as a way to start reducing the cost of treating chronic diseases like high blood pressure. ''There's a lot of savings there,'' said Dr. Shurney. ''It's not only good for us, but good for employees.''
Even employers who won't talk about details acknowledge the tax is bringing about change. ''You're getting taxed at 40 percent,'' explained Larry Boress, the chief executive of the Midwest Business Group on Health. ''That kind of hit is something that is viewed as untenable by employers in general.''
But one critic pointed out that employers have been raising deductibles and asking employees to contribute more for many years. Tom Leibfried, a legislative director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., one of the unions whose plans are vulnerable to the tax, says the demands that workers pay more for their care is a perennial aspect of labor negotiations. ''We're very concerned about the hollowing out of benefits in general,'' he said. ''What the excise tax will do is just fuel that.''
Others say some of the plans at risk of being taxed as overly generous simply reflect of the high costs of care in certain regions. ''These plans are costly, just by the nature of where they are,'' said Kinsey M. Robinson, the president of the Roofers' union, which has recently called for significant changes to the law or its repeal. ''The cost of good health care is expensive.'' The law does make adjustments, including for older workers or those in certain high-cost professions.
Many employers say they were already taking steps to address rising costs, even as the increases have abated somewhat in recent years. ''The 2018 date was looming out there,'' said Mary Cranstoun, the senior director of medical benefits for Providence Health, where Ms. Bruce works. But Ms. Cranstoun said Providence had already decided to move more of its employees into high-deductible health plans.
The goal was to have employees pay more attention to costs, which have been rising some 5 to 8 percent a year. ''As for any other company, when you take that out long term, those are big trend numbers,'' she said.
The hospital system says the move is less about cost-shifting than engaging employees about their health, including offering financial incentives to undergo a health screening or using a high deductible to make them think twice about an expensive test.
The ultimate goal is to make sure the cost of coverage does not eventually exceed the system's ability to pay for it, Ms. Cranstoun said. ''We really are committed to offering our employees benefits in the long term, so we really want to make sure that we can do so,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Buyout Offer Brings China Into the Orbit Of Club Med

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER, NEIL GOUGH and KEITH BRADSHER; Neil Gough and Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong.. 
Andrew Ross Sorkin, whose DealBook column normally appears on this page, is off

 BODY:

Fewer ''crazy signs.'' More karaoke.
That could be the future for Club Med, the French resort operator, which said Monday that it had received a $700 million buyout offer led by its two largest shareholders, an investment unit of the French insurer AXA and a Chinese conglomerate called Fosun International.
The proposed deal gives a Chinese company an unusually visible role in the acquisition and development of a prominent Western brand, which was founded in 1950 by a Belgian water polo player and for years defined the packaged exoticism of beach vacations for Europeans and North Americans. Now, though, the ascent of the Chinese tourist is helping reshape the world's idea of the ideal getaway.
Club Méditerranée has long been known for the blend of escapist fun and Frenchness in its vacation formula -- including the staff's frequent performance of synchronized, heavily gesticulated dance moves set to pop music. 
With Chinese co-ownership, Club Med cannot help becoming a bit less French. It has been hit hard by the euro crisis, during which its name has been borrowed by economists as an epithet for the debt-ridden and austerity-ravaged countries of Southern Europe.
Club Med is looking to emerging markets, especially China, for new customers and new resorts, which it calls villages.
''We have to accelerate our growth in emerging markets, the largest of which is China,'' Henri Giscard d'Estaing, chief executive of Club Med, said by telephone on Monday. ''That takes time, and you need shareholder and management stability. The goal of this agreement is to provide that stability.''
Club Med ventured into China in 2010, opening a village at a ski resort called Yabuli, in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. Since then Club Med has added a second Chinese village, in the southern city of Guilin, known for its unusual, tombstone-shaped peaks.
At Yabuli, which attracts mostly domestic visitors, Club Med has adapted its entertainment offerings to suit local tastes, adding karaoke evenings, for example. Mah-jongg tables have replaced the poker and bridge tables, or Scrabble boards, at other Club Med villages.
China overtook the United States two years ago as the world's biggest source of foreign tourists. Mainland Chinese made 70 million overseas trips in 2011. That outpaced the 58.5 million overseas trips by Americans the same year. And last year, China for the first time became the biggest spender in global tourism. Outlays by Chinese traveling overseas reached $102 billion, up 40 percent from 2011, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Germans and Americans ranked second and third, each spending about $84 billion on their foreign trips, the agency said.
Club Med, while sticking to the concept of all-inclusive packages, in which it was a pioneer, has gone through many changes, and owners, since it opened its first resort on the Spanish island of Mallorca in 1950. In the early years, the resorts were designed as prototypical New Age retreats, where the visitors mingled socially with the staff.
The offbeat atmosphere evolved with the times. The stereotypical Club Med customer of the 1960s and '70s was satirized in ''Les Bronzés,'' a racy 1978 French film directed by Patrice Leconte, in which a group of European visitors to a Club Med village in Ivory Coast take turns hooking up.
In the 1990s, Club Med tried to attract budget travelers, but was unable to compete with low-fare airlines and the Internet. It also branched into sports clubs. Over the last decade, it has moved upmarket, closing dozens of resorts, revamping others and repositioning its marketing to appeal to families.
So far, though, Club Med remains heavily dependent on Europe, which is a reason it has booked annual losses for five of the last seven years. Revenue has not regained the level of 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) reached in 2008.
Investors cheered the 17 euros a share French-Chinese buyout offer on Monday, sending Club Med's stock up 22 percent, to 16.95 euros, in Paris trading. The offer is a 23 percent premium over Club Med's closing price on Friday.
Central to Club Med's strategy to win more Chinese customers was a deal in 2010 that first brought in Fosun, which is based in Shanghai, as a strategic investor. Fosun has bought further shares since 2010, so that it now owns 9.96 percent of the share capital and 16.48 percent of the voting rights of Club Med.
France still accounts for 600,000 annual visitors, half of Club Med's total. But Mr. Giscard d'Estaing -- son of the former French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing -- said the company hoped to attract 200,000 Chinese guests in 2015, up from 90,000 last year. By the end of 2015, Club Med aims to have five villages in Asia, including one, at an unspecified beach location, that it plans to open this year.
''Fosun is a group that believes the upscale holiday is an area where growth will be well above the average economic growth for China,'' Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said.
Until recently, Chinese companies have tended to be cautious when it came to efforts to buy publicly traded companies, a wariness that stems in part from memories of a bid by the Chinese offshore oil company Cnooc for the United States oil producer Unocal in 2005.
That deal was effectively blocked by Congress. Instead, Chinese buyers have been aggressively pursuing privately held businesses, focusing mainly on European companies in machinery sectors like wind turbine component manufacturers.
The Fosun-backed offer for Club Med reflects the unusual relationship between the two companies. Many Western companies have expanded in China by setting up joint ventures with Chinese companies. Club Med chose a different route, allowing Fosun to buy a stake in the French parent company.
''It ensured full alignment of interests between the Chinese and foreign partners,'' André Loesekrug-Pietri, the chairman and managing partner of a Brussels-based private equity fund, the A Capital China Outbound Fund, said by telephone.
Mr. Loesekrug-Pietri said he had approached Fosun and Club Med in March 2010 with a proposal for Fosun and A Capital each to buy stakes in Club Med. Club Med was looking for a partner in China, and Fosun was seeking a way to use its extensive real estate in China.
Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said that while Fosun would be increasing its stake, the deal would keep a majority of Club Med in the hands of French shareholders. Analysts said, however, that they would not be surprised if AXA bowed out eventually, allowing Fosun to take over full control.
The inclusion of a pillar of the French corporate establishment may have been aimed at smoothing over any concerns in France about a loss of control over one of the country's best-known brands at a time when economic nationalism appears to be on the rise. For example, Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for industrial renewal, recently moved to block a possible takeover of a French online video site, Dailymotion, by Yahoo.
''The presence of AXA can have no other purpose than to reassure politicians like Montebourg that this will remain a French company,'' said Jean-Jacques Manceau, the author of a 2010 book on Club Med, ''Réinventer la Machine à Rêves'' (''Reinventing the Dream Machine'').
Mr. Manceau said that to the increasingly wealthy customers that the company aims to attract, nationality might matter less. Karaoke aside, Chinese and French tourists are looking for a similar vacation experience.
''It's true that we have different ways of amusing ourselves,'' he said. ''But the Club Med culture supersedes the individual cultures of any of the people who visit it.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe Becomes New Destination for M.B.A.s

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE

 BODY:
Junayd Mahmood is not your typical business school student. He did not spend years plotting out a graduate school career, going to M.B.A. fairs and compiling a list of dream schools. He decided quickly to apply to only one program.
As an American doing a full-time M.B.A. in Germany, however, he is part of a growing trend: An increasing number of non-European students are going to Europe for more international and more affordable M.B.A.'s.
''I don't really see geographical location as a huge determinant for what I'll do once I graduate,'' said Mr. Mahmood, who is from Middletown, New York. He chose the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin for its international network and hands-on curriculum.
Tuition is &#x20ac;29,000, or $37,000, which is relatively affordable compared with M.B.A.'s at some top U.S. schools, partly because the Berlin program is only one year and nearby rents are reasonably inexpensive. 
Historically seen as a quintessentially American degree, the Masters in Business Administration is coming of age in Germany, which is beginning to compete with other European M.B.A. destinations like Britain, France, the Netherlands and Spain.
''We are profiting from the fact that Germany made it through the crisis so well,'' said Jörg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology.
Located in the renovated East German State Council building, with a smaller campus in Cologne, the E.S.M.T. business school was founded in 2002 by some of Germany's best-known companies, like Bayerische Motoren Werke, Daimler, SAP, Siemens and Deutsche Bank.
Despite the distinctively German names of its corporate backers, the school prides itself on its international nature.
The 32 faculty members who teach its M.B.A. program come from 19 nations. Only 12 percent of students in the global M.B.A. program -- which, like most, are taught in English -- are German, while 23 percent come from other European countries. The largest contingent, 38 percent of the student body, are from Asia, while 23 percent come from North America.
European graduate management programs received more than 90,000 Graduate Management Admission Test score reports from applicants during the 2012 testing year, marking both an all-time high and a 45 percent increase compared with 2008, according to the Graduate Management Admission Council, which administers the standardized test.
More striking, the number of GMAT scores received by German institutions grew more than 330 percent to reach nearly 6,000 during that same time period.
While the admission council's numbers do not necessarily show how many students applied, gained admission or graduated from M.B.A. programs, they do show that more applicants took the first step to get into European schools.
Germany, which did not even rank in the top 10 choices for West Europeans seeking graduate business degrees in 2004, is now the fifth most popular destination among Europeans and the 10th most popular among global GMAT test takers.
While many business students still want to study for their M.B.A.'s in the United States -- once seen as the mecca for both business and business schooling -- trends are changing.
In 2004, 43 percent of West Europeans sent their GMAT test scores to U.S. programs; in 2012, that number dropped to 28 percent.
''I always knew I would go back to school, and I always hoped I would go abroad,'' said Leslie Koch of California, who is enrolled in a full-time M.B.A. program at the Mannheim Business School in Germany.
''So why don't I just kill two birds with one stone?'' said Ms. Koch, who is hoping to find work in the United States once she obtains her M.B.A. from Mannheim.
Mannheim is consistently ranked as one of the top business schools in Germany, and Ms. Koch believes that the reputation would give her an advantage with German businesses based in the United States.
''I thought it would be really interesting to have this international-savvy,'' she said.
The birthplace of European M.B.A.'s is Insead. With campuses in Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and France, the school's first program was introduced in 1959 in Fontainebleau, an hour's drive south of Paris.
''In order to grow Europe and to develop peace within Europe, it was important to grow business in Europe,'' said Pejay Belland, the school's director of marketing, admissions and financial aid.
Many of the aspects that made the institution successful in the past are still important factors in the growth of European M.B.A. programs today.
Just 15 years after the end of World War II, Insead accepted its first group of M.B.A. students, who were of 14 different nationalities. At the time, classes were offered in English, French and German, according to Ms. Belland.
Another important element of the program's early success was the fact that it was privately funded and not beholden to the state rules. ''It should be independent of any state; you can make your own choice in regards to curriculum,'' Ms. Belland said.
According to German experts, private post-secondary institutions -- a minority in a country where education has been traditionally state-funded -- are behind the growth of the degree. With the exception with the Mannheim Business School, which is associated with a state-funded university, many players on the German M.B.A. market do not rely on public funding.
And while Germany has long been seen as Europe's economic powerhouse, its M.B.A. programs have only recently taken a leading position in global rankings.
In their 2012 rankings for full-time M.B.A.'s, The Economist listed two German schools in its top 100 list, while there were none in 2005. Mannheim ranked No. 69 on The Financial Times's Global M.B.A. ranking, a first for a German business school.
Germany's programs have become more prominent as the country's university system recently switched from an old diploma system to one with bachelor's and master's degrees, to fit in better with the rest of Europe.
''The marketplace that wasn't visible because we were under the old system; it is now coming into focus,'' said Jens Wüstemann, president of the Mannheim Business School.
Mr. Mahmood, the American student at the European School of Management and Technology, said he looked forward to cutting his teeth as an entrepreneur in one of the many new businesses starting in Berlin, even if he wanted to end up eventually in North America.
''There are so many start-ups here,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Forgotten Amerasians

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER M. LAPINIG. 
Christopher M. Lapinig is a law student at Yale.

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN -- THE Senate Judiciary Committee approved an immigration reform bill last week that would gradually make citizenship possible for as many as 11 million undocumented immigrants. The bill is widely described as sweeping in scope. In fact, it is not quite sweeping enough, as it leaves the plight of another group of would-be Americans unaddressed.
Take Pinky. In 1974, her father, Jimmy Edwards, was a 22-year-old sailor aboard a United States Navy ship visiting the Philippines, 9,000 miles away from his hometown, Kinston, N.C. He fell in love with a Filipina named Merlie Daet, who gave birth to their daughter, Pinky. Mr. Edwards had hoped to marry Merlie, but as a sailor, he could not marry a foreigner without his captain's consent. The captain refused. Despite his best efforts over the years, Mr. Edwards was unable to find Pinky (or Merlie). 
Until 2005, that is. USA Bound, a now defunct nonprofit organization that reconnected Filipino children with their American fathers, told Mr. Edwards that it had found Pinky. He flew to the Philippines, only to find her living in poverty in a cinder-block hut in the mountains with her husband and five children. Determined to give her a better life, he sought United States citizenship for her.
To his surprise, it was too late. Although by birthright, children born out of wedlock to an American father and a foreign mother are entitled to United States citizenship, they must file paternity certifications no later than their 18th birthday to get it. But since the military bases in the Philippines have been closed for over 20 years, virtually all Filipino ''Amerasians'' -- a term coined by the author and activist Pearl S. Buck to describe children of American servicemen and Asian mothers -- have passed that age.
Stories like Pinky's are legion. Amerasians in the Philippines substantially outnumber those living in neighboring countries, with recent estimates as high as 250,000.
The large numbers are explained by our military's 94 years in the Philippines, from the Spanish-American War in 1898 to its withdrawal in 1992. During the cold war, the United States leased military installations throughout the archipelago, including Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, the United States' two largest overseas bases at the time.
Around them emerged bars and clubs, where servicemen were encouraged to find ''rest and relaxation.'' While some Amerasians were conceived through prostitution, many were born out of committed relationships. Soldiers' limited tours of duty -- and, later, the abrupt closures of the bases -- tore couples apart.
The closures dealt a serious economic blow to many Amerasians. A 1999 study commissioned by the nongovernmental organization Pearl S. Buck International showed that Amerasians had disproportionately suffered from underemployment, poverty, domestic violence and sexual abuse.
They also face relentless discrimination. In a Catholic society that stigmatizes illegitimate children, Filipinos deploy an arsenal of slurs against Amerasians: iniwan ng barko (''left by the ship'') and babay sa daddy (''goodbye to Daddy'') among them. Black Amerasians are often called ''charcoal,'' or worse.
For these reasons, most Filipino Amerasians dream of coming here for a better life. But despite their American blood, it is very difficult if not impossible for them to immigrate legally and eventually become naturalized citizens.
Other Amerasians, however, have no such problem. After the Vietnam War, Congress passed the Amerasian Act of 1982, which allowed Amerasian children in Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and South Korea to immigrate.
Some members of Congress have tried to rectify the omission of the Philippines. On several occasions between 1997 and 2001, Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, who died last year, introduced a bill to extend the Amerasian Act to the Philippines and Japan. But the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected it, claiming that Filipino Amerasians were not victims of discrimination, that they were conceived from illegal prostitution, and that, unlike Amerasians in South Korea and Vietnam, they were born during peacetime. But none of these are conscionable grounds for selectively preventing Filipino Amerasians from coming to this country.
At a time when the issue of immigration reform is before the nation, Amerasians need new leaders in Congress to speak on their behalf. What's more, the military has recently announced that it will restore a significant presence in the Philippines; last year, over 70 ships stopped at Subic Bay, and over 100 planes stop at Clark Air Base each month. The United States, then, has an opportunity for redemption -- to make sure Filipino Amerasians are not left behind by the ship again.

HEADLINE: European Index Rises, While Nikkei Slides Again

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
LONDON -- European stocks, bonds and the dollar traded more calmly on Monday after last week's turbulence, though a 3 percent dive in Japan's main share index kept investors on edge.
Holidays in the United States and Britain kept European equity and bond markets quieter than usual, but with last week's declines tempting buyers, the Euro Stoxx 50 rose 1.1 percent, and Italian and Spanish bonds managed their first gains in three sessions.
The dollar was also steadier, though it slid back to 101 against the yen as the latest lurch in Japanese equities encouraged investors who have been unwinding their dollar hedges on share portfolios and heading for bonds. 
The 3.2 percent drop on Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index brought its losses since Wednesday to nearly 10 percent, though the index is still up 36 percent this year.
Last week's shakeout of equity, bond and currency markets was set off by concerns that the Federal Reserve could wind down its monetary support sooner than had been expected. In addition, there was weak Chinese data, and doubts over how low Japan would allow the yen to go.
But despite the wobble, analysts largely foresee a period of moderation in risk assets, rather than a big correction.
Dan Morris, a global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said that a pullback by the Fed would be turbulent, but added, ''With fundamental drivers for equities still supportive, investors should tighten their seat belts instead of reaching for the parachute.''
Whereas the Fed appears to be weighing an exit from its crisis measures, the European Central Bank may still have some scope to counter a long-running euro zone recession caused largely by efforts to contain the bloc's sovereign debt crisis.
On Wednesday, the European Commission will release its review of countries' debt-cutting policies, which will confirm that France, Spain, Slovenia and others may be given more time to trim their budget deficits. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will publish a review of major economies on the same day.
Three Italian government bond auctions this week will also test demand after the talk of Fed stimulus withdrawal.
Italian and Spanish bonds were caught in the sell-off in risk assets last week, but yields on both have eased back as focus turns to the European Central Bank's next step.
Jörg Asmussen, who sits on the central bank's executive board, said that the bank would remain accommodative ''as long as needed,'' although he sounded cautious about charging banks to put money on deposit at the central bank, something that could help hold down borrowing costs.
''One should be very cautious regarding the discussion if the E.C.B. could introduce negative deposit rates,'' Mr. Asmussen said in a speech in Berlin. ''This can have advantages, but it can also have disadvantages.''
The mood was again tentative in the commodities markets. Brent crude slipped to $102.62 a barrel, extending last week's 2 percent drop, as the patchy economic outlook in a well-supplied market pressured prices.
Anxiety in the broader market also helped gold, considered a safe-haven investment, firm up at $1,394.39 an ounce as it built on last week's best run in a month. Copper, a metal more attuned to growth, fell 0.2 percent.
After disappointing data from China last week dimmed the outlook for global oil demand, the oil producer cartel OPEC was expected to keep policy unchanged at a meeting on Friday.
The shale revolution in the United States, still the biggest oil consumer, may even bring an end to the relentless rise in fuel prices seen over the past decade.
''OPEC is in a hard situation,'' said Chakib Khelil, who was Algeria's oil minister from 1999 to 2010. ''The demand for OPEC oil is going down, while increasing demand is being met by others.''

HEADLINE: McCain Takes Surprise Side Trip to Syria to Meet With Rebels

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has called for the United States to intervene militarily in Syria, traveled to Syria on Monday to meet with rebel forces fighting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, according to a spokesman for Mr. McCain. It was the first time that a United States senator had gone to Syria to meet with the rebels since the conflict there began two years ago. 
Mr. McCain entered Syria from southern Turkey, according to his spokesman, Brian Rogers, who added that the senator had been in the region to attend the World Economic Forum meeting in Jordan over the weekend.
In 2011, Mr. McCain traveled to Libya to meet with rebel forces there while they were fighting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and made similar calls for the United States to provide military aid to the rebels. The United States did ultimately provide military support, along with several European countries, and Colonel Qaddafi's regime was toppled.
Since the conflict in Syria began, Mr. McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, have harshly criticized President Obama for not doing more to help the rebels. They argue that the president, who has authorized the shipment of night-vision goggles and body armor, should establish a no-fly zone and provide weapons to the rebels.
While in Syria, Mr. McCain met with Gen. Salim Idris, the leader of the military wing of the Supreme Military Council, a Syrian opposition group. The Obama administration considers General Idris much more of a moderate than the leaders of the Nusra Front, which has ties to Al Qaeda and is better financed and organized. Mr. Obama has refused to provide the rebels with military support because he fears that would empower the more radical elements of the opposition.
After the Israeli military struck a major Syrian military research center near Damascus this month, Mr. McCain said the strike had weakened the argument that Syria's air defense system would be difficult for the United States to penetrate.
''The Israelis seem to be able to penetrate it fairly easily,'' he said on May 5 on ''Fox News Sunday.''
The United States, Mr. McCain said, could easily strike the Syrian defenses ''with cruise missiles, cratering their runways, where all of these supplies, by the way, from Iran and Russia are coming in by air.''

HEADLINE: Nikkei's Plunge and Bank of Japan's Mixed Signals Raise Fears of Volatility

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER and HIROKO TABUCHI; Bettina Wassener reported from Hong Kong and Hiroko Tabuchi from Tokyo.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Japanese central bank on Monday released minutes of a recent meeting that showed some board members skeptical of the bank's own strategy of lifting Japan from deflation, while another big fall in the country's stock market stoked fears of further volatility in the weeks and months ahead.
But European stocks shrugged off the slide on the Japanese stock market Monday and traded higher as a member of the European Central Bank repeated the bank's commitment to low interest rates. Stock markets in Britain and the United States were closed for public holidays. 
In Tokyo, the minutes of the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on April 26 revealed a degree of doubt about the bank's ability to inject a healthy dose of inflation into an economy that has suffered from crippling deflation for years.
According to the minutes, ''a few members'' pointed out that the goal of 2 percent inflation appeared ''difficult to achieve'' in the planned time frame of about two years, ''since it was highly uncertain whether changes in inflation expectations would lead to a rise in the actual rate of inflation.''
Some board members also noted that the bank's aggressive easing policies appeared to have been perceived by the markets as ''contradictory'' -- comments that highlighted the challenges that the bank and policy makers are wrestling with.
The bank, on one hand, has committed to ending deflationary expectations and starting an economic recovery by flooding the economy with money, which would cause long-term interest rates to rise. But the bank has also committed to keeping those interest rates in check, partly by buying large amounts of government bonds. That has sowed confusion among market players over whether they should welcome or worry about the recent rise in long-term rates.
On Monday, the Nikkei 225 share average in Tokyo fell 3.2 percent. The decline came after a 7.3 percent slump last Thursday, when a rally that started in mid-November of 2012, with stocks rising nearly 80 percent, came to an abrupt end.
''While it's still difficult to clearly pinpoint a reason, the big market falls themselves have started to stoke fear among investors,'' Koichi Fujishiro, an economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said in a report. He said that high-frequency trading by investors looking for short-term gains helped magnify those market swings.
''Japan's fundamentals have not changed,'' Mr. Fujishiro said. But, he added, ''turmoil in financial markets won't settle down overnight, and we are likely to see nervousness remain for some time.''
An article carried by the Nikkei business daily on Monday urged calm.
''Investors need a bird's-eye perspective of market movements, not a bug's-eye perspective,'' wrote Ryo Suzuki, a columnist who is a member of Nikkei's editorial board. ''Things look different from a larger perspective,'' he said. ''For people who sat out on the market surge, this might be a good time to get in on the action.''
Japanese stocks have been on a tear since last November, swept by a wave of optimism that bold plans outlined by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took over in December, would succeed in breathing life back into the Japanese economy.
Volatility in the Japanese bond markets, a renewed strengthening of the yen and concern about the dynamism of China's economy all have combined in recent days to underline the challenges facing Mr. Abe and the Japanese central bank as they seek to renew growth.
Analysts have struggled to explain the exact cause of the recent reversal, saying that a range of factors were probably at play and continue to fan nervousness in the market.
''There have been times when the market jumped over 1,000 points in a week. We were bound to see a correction,'' Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, told reporters in Tokyo. ''But Japan's economy is recovering steadily. So it is extremely important that we react in a calm manner.''
Investors are also concerned that the United States Federal Reserve might reduce its own stimulus measures before too long.
The realization that Mr. Abe's stimulus efforts -- in particular, the structural overhauls that are needed to bolster Japan's long-term competitiveness -- face a struggle also have played a part, analysts said, as did profit-taking after the long rally this year.
''Investors have realized that the Japanese market does not just rise and rise,'' said Jun Yunoki, an analyst at Nomura in Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Faces Struggle to Keep Its Lights On

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH and SALMAN MASOOD; Declan Walsh reported from London, and Salman Masood from Kharian, Pakistan. Zia ur-Rehman contributed reporting from Karachi.

 BODY:
LONDON -- A week before he is to be sworn in as Pakistan's prime minister for the third time, Nawaz Sharif has secured one form of power, yet now faces a fierce battle to find another.
Electricity shortages, bad for years, have reached crisis proportions. Lights go out for at least 10 hours a day in major cities, and up to 22 hours a day in rural areas. As the summer heat pressed in suddenly last week -- touching 118 degrees Fahrenheit in the eastern city of Lahore -- Pakistanis again took to the streets to protest the chaotic state of the country's power delivery system.
Doctors and nurses picketed outside hospitals, complaining about lacking clean water and having to cancel operations. Demonstrators burned tires, blocked traffic or pelted electricity company officials with stones.
Students cannot study for exams, morgues struggle with decomposing bodies, and even the rich complain that their expensive backup generators are straining badly -- or, in some cases, blowing up from overuse. 
In a bid to quell discontent, Pakistan's interim government, which is running the country until Mr. Sharif takes over, has ordered civil servants to switch off their air-conditioners and stop wearing socks -- reasoning that sandals were more appropriate in such hot conditions.
''Everyone is affected,'' said Iqbal Jamil, a heat-flustered resident of Landhi, a neighborhood in Karachi.
The crisis is the product of multiple factors, from decrepit power plants to crumbling transmission lines to decades-old policy mistakes. One reason, however, stands above the others: most Pakistanis will not pay their bills.
The system is paralyzed by $5 billion in ''circular debt'' -- basically, a long chain of unpaid bills that cuts across society, from government departments to wealthy politicians to slum dwellers. At its worst, this leaves power providers with no funds to pay for fuel, so their plants slow or shut down entirely.
As a political issue, electricity has galvanized the Pakistani public -- more so, even, than Islamist militancy. Mr. Sharif swept to victory in the May 11 election in part on the appeal of slogans promising to deliver a ''shining Pakistan'' and to ''end the darkness.''
Analysts say the question is whether Mr. Sharif has the political backbone to make the tough decisions needed to change the system, particularly as some of his own supporters, along with other rich and powerful Pakistanis, are among the bill defaulters who need to start paying their fair share.
''This is not like finding a cure for cancer -- people know what needs to be done,'' said Robert M. Hathaway, director of the Asia program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, D.C., who has written a book on Pakistan's electricity crisis. ''The problem is implementation, and finding the political will.''
The crisis has hit hardest in Mr. Sharif's home province, Punjab. In Kharian, a Punjabi town along the historic Grand Trunk Road, Malik Mazhar Iqbal Awan, a businessman, fanned himself with a newspaper as beads of sweat rolled down his forehead.
Mr. Awan owns a small marble factory. In the yard outside, a handful of workers sat quietly beside a cutting machine, waiting for the power to return. Just four years ago, Mr. Awan said, he employed 25 people. Now he has just six.
''I can't pay their salaries,'' he said, wiping away dust that had blown in through an open window. ''How can I if we can only work a few hours every day?''
Mr. Awan said he had voted for Mr. Sharif, a former steel baron, because he was ''110 percent sure'' the candidate could turn the electricity situation around. ''He's an industrialist,'' he said. ''He thinks differently than the others.''
Although easing the $5 billion ''circular debt'' is the principal problem, experts say money is only part of the solution. Deep-rooted structural issues, exacerbated by political interference and systemic graft, lie at the heart of Pakistan's power crisis.
Electricity theft, by rich and poor, is common. Slum dwellers steal power through illegal connections; powerful politicians and government departments simply refuse to pay their bills. Electricity officials and the police, fearing retribution, dare not cut them off.
Corruption is notorious in the private power sector, where political supporters win lucrative contracts, often at inflated costs or without even producing a megawatt of power. In 2011 the auditor general noted that the government had committed to $1.7 billion in such contracts, yet added just 62 megawatts to the national power grid.
One prominent candidate in this election -- Raja Pervez Ashraf, the country's last prime minister -- has been closely identified with the power crisis. After he lost his parliamentary seat in a crushing defeat, officials with the national anticorruption body stepped in, summoning Mr. Ashraf last week to answer accusations that he had taken kickbacks worth tens of millions of dollars from foreign companies on power projects.
Even those supposed to be enforcing the law are breaking it. At one police station in Sindh Province, officers erected an illegal power connection for their air-conditioners. In other areas, electricity company officials are afraid to disconnect defaulters for fear of attack.
About 20 percent of the electricity supply disappears across the country, and up to 33 percent in the worst-affected district, as a result of dilapidated transmission lines or outright theft, said Fariel Salahuddin, a power sector consultant.
''The fastest way to improve things is to start collecting bills and come down hard on theft,'' she said. ''That's easier said than done, though.''
The crisis is exacting an economic toll equivalent to at least 4 percent of the country's gross domestic product, according to economists -- greater than the estimated economic cost of the Taliban insurgency.
At the same time, government policy is a shambles. Decision-making is centered in the notoriously corrupt Energy Ministry; no major new power plant has been built for decades, and the existing ones are falling into disrepair. As a result, Pakistan relies heavily on expensive furnace oil imports.
''There is complete disarray between all entities involved,'' said a report on the power crisis that was commissioned by the National Planning Commission last March.
In the short term, Mr. Sharif will seek to salve his power woes by trying to find foreign cash or fuel to get dormant power stations back on line. His officials have suggested that Saudi Arabia, a country that Mr. Sharif enjoys close relations with, could offer up to $15 billion worth of emergency oil supplies on favorable terms.
But oil and money can provide only temporary relief, and Mr. Sharif may also seek other foreign assistance to tackle the structural problems -- some in the face of opposition from the United States.
Last week he asked the visiting Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, to provide Pakistan with help in building a civilian nuclear power plant. That was widely seen as an indirect rebuff to the United States, which offered similar help to Pakistan's rival, India, in 2006 -- a source of enduring resentment in Pakistan.
Similarly, President Asif Ali Zardari signed a deal with Iran last year to run a gas pipeline across the border to Pakistan. But the project would run afoul of United Nations sanctions on Iran -- penalties that were championed by Washington.
The United States, for its part, has spent $225 million since 2009 in refurbishing Pakistan's decrepit hydroelectric power plants, adding 900 megawatts to the national grid. American officials are also working with the government to improve revenue collection.
But large-scale infrastructure projects, like new hydroelectric dams, take years to come to fruition. And international donors are reluctant to commit further funds without signs of strong reform from Pakistan's political leadership.
Pakistan's leaders know they are running out of time. Other countries also face crippling electricity shortages, of course, in parts of the Middle East or sub-Saharan Africa. But none of those nations possess nuclear weapons, or such a rapidly growing population as Pakistan, estimated at 180 million people.
Population growth alone is adding 1,000 megawatts per year to the country's electricity needs, said Mr. Hathaway of the Wilson Center.
''We Americans also like to defer tough decisions,'' he said, referring to contentious and expensive reforms in education and social welfare. ''But Pakistanis are approaching a point where they no longer have that luxury.''

HEADLINE: The Peace Bridge (What Else?) Sets Off a Cuomo-Canada War

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
FORT ERIE, Ontario -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's administration is known for its combative stance toward lawmakers, bureaucrats and reporters alike.
Now, the administration has all but declared war on a new enemy: Canada.
Or, at least, an arm of the Canadian government.
At issue is the 3,580-foot bridge that crosses the Niagara River between Buffalo and this Canadian town. It is called the Peace Bridge, though its name does not seem especially apt now.
In recent months, Mr. Cuomo's chief representative to the binational agency that manages the bridge has described his Canadian counterparts, in e-mails he sent to them, as ''duplicitous,'' criticizing their ''deceitful, disrespectful and arrogant behavior.''
''The fact that you ask for 'mutual respect' is nothing short of laughable,'' the Cuomo representative, William B. Hoyt III, told the Canadians. 
The dispute began over efforts to expand the plaza on the New York side of the bridge, with Canadian members of the authority's board expressing concern about spending far more for land than its appraised value. Things quickly turned personal.
Mr. Hoyt, the authority's vice chairman, who is known as Sam, has tried to remove the general manager of the authority, who is a Canadian; boycotted some of the authority's board meetings; and alleged that Canadian officials were guilty of a raft of improprieties.
Cuomo allies in the New York Legislature have introduced bills to change the authority's structure.
The discord has put development projects at risk and led to a governance stalemate unlike anything in the bridge's more than eight decades of binational control.
Howard Glaser, one of Mr. Cuomo's top aides, even wrote a letter last month to the Canadian transport minister, who controls the Canadian half of the authority's board, complaining about ''years of foot-dragging.''
Last week, Mr. Cuomo, in an interview with The Buffalo News, said the bridge was a ''metaphor for dysfunction.'' The authority's chairman, Anthony M. Annunziata, a Canadian, responded that the comment was ''incredibly arrogant and insulting.''
Passions have run so high that senior officials in Washington and Ottawa have gotten involved to calm both sides. In a visit to Buffalo, Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, urged the administration and the Canadians to ''bury the hatchet.''
Since taking office in 2011, Mr. Cuomo has largely shied from the national -- not to mention international -- stage, even as his name is often mentioned as a Democratic presidential candidate in 2016.
But his administration's approach toward the Canadians is offering the wider world a glimpse of how Mr. Cuomo often wields power.
Governors who run for president tend to struggle to show off their foreign policy prowess. How the conflict over the Peace Bridge is resolved could thus become fodder for the next presidential campaign, should Mr. Cuomo run.
The Canadians said they were taken aback by what they termed the Cuomo administration's outbursts, and are refusing direct dealings with Mr. Hoyt, a former Democratic assemblyman from the Buffalo area.
''In the past, there has always been a respectful working relationship,'' Mr. Annunziata said.
''I've never had a relationship like this, which is, if you don't agree with me, we want you gone,'' he said. ''And not only do we want you gone, if we can't get rid of you, we want to destroy the board.''
Mr. Hoyt, who is also a senior official at New York's economic development agency, declined to comment.
Melissa DeRosa, Mr. Cuomo's communications director, said the administration was seeking to overhaul an authority that had long neglected New York's interests.
''After nearly 20 years of dysfunction and paralysis, the administration has put a plan together that, for the first time, commits New York State budget funds to jump-start improvements to the Peace Bridge plaza,'' Ms. DeRosa said.
State lawmakers of both parties said they supported Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, noting that more work had been carried out on the Canadian side.
''It's our turn to move forward, and they are putting up roadblocks,'' said State Senator George D. Maziarz, a local Republican.
The conflict began after the Cuomo administration negotiated to buy the blighted property near the bridge in a deal that would have used authority funds. The price was $4 million plus tax debt.
The Canadians had misgivings because the appraised value of the land was $1.7 million. The authority had already spent $1 million to clear a lien on the property.
Cuomo aides said the price was fair because of the property's complicated history and a threat of a lawsuit from its owner.
The administration has since moved forward with the deal using state funds.
Whatever the substance of the dispute, a review of documents and e-mails provided by both camps shows how tensions have spread.
Mr. Hoyt, in a letter to the board, assailed the authority's general manager, Ron Rienas, a Canadian. In particular, he accused Mr. Rienas of hiring his son's air charter business to ferry authority officials.
Mr. Rienas said his son did not operate an air charter business, but conceded that his son flew as a hobby and had flown some authority officials, getting reimbursed at a rate of $205 an hour, which included the cost of fuel.
Mr. Hoyt said his mail had been opened by Mr. Rienas without authorization. Mr. Rienas said the staff had long opened mail to the chairman or vice chairman that was not labeled confidential.
Mr. Hoyt has upbraided Mr. Annunziata, the board's chairman, for referring to an American woman who serves as a project manager at the bridge as ''the governor's concubine'' during a heated meeting -- apparently because he thought that she was doing Mr. Cuomo's bidding.
Mr. Annunziata said he had undergone sensitivity training after an internal review, but American officials said they were deeply disturbed by the matter, which they said had not been appropriately addressed.
The Canadians said Mr. Hoyt was in no position to criticize them. In 2008, the State Assembly barred Mr. Hoyt from having interns after he had an affair with a female intern in his office.
Last year, Mr. Hoyt sought to have the Peace Bridge Authority give one of his sons a summer job as a toll taker, according to e-mails.
Mr. Hoyt withdrew the request after the Canadians questioned whether it was proper. (A second son of Mr. Hoyt's had been hired by the State Thruway Authority as a toll taker in 2010, according to state records.)
Mr. Rienas said Mr. Hoyt's allegations were ''clearly designed to denigrate and intimidate me.''
Though both sides have sought occasionally to tone down their statements, for now, the impasse continues.
On Friday, the Americans decided to attend an authority board meeting. But when it came time to take the routine step of approving the minutes from an earlier meeting, they refused.

HEADLINE: Europe and China Trade Talks End Bitterly

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Trade negotiations between the European Union and China ended on Monday with mutual recriminations. China called on the European Union to refrain from imposing tariffs on solar panels, and the European trade commissioner complained that China was pressuring individual countries to prevent Europe from reaching a consensus. 
The European Union accuses Chinese firms of selling solar panels below cost in Europe, a practice known as dumping, and has already proposed antidumping tariffs of nearly 50 percent on Chinese solar panel shipments. That is one of the largest categories of Chinese exports to Europe and worth about $27 billion a year.
But Germany's economy minister said that his country had informed the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union, that it opposed proceeding with the solar panel tariffs. If a majority of the European Union's 27-member states oppose tariffs during the current consultation period, then the commission could be forced to abandon the tariffs. But that could risk undermining the commission's long-term ability to negotiate trade deals on behalf of the bloc.
Zhong Shao, China's vice minister of commerce and chief international trade representative, denounced the European Commission for not reaching a deal at the talks, which were held in Brussels.
The commission's plan to impose tariffs on Chinese solar panels starting on June 6, together with the commission's preparations to begin a similar trade case against Chinese exports of wireless communications gear, ''would seriously hurt the Chinese industries and workers concerned and seriously sour the climate on bilateral trade and economic engagement,'' he said in a statement.
He added, ''Such practices of trade protectionism are not acceptable to China,'' and asked that the European Union to delay the tariffs.
European officials have said repeatedly that they face statutory deadlines for actions in trade cases and have little or no discretion to delay action.
The commission has been discussing the tariffs with member governments; Germany, with large exports to China that could be vulnerable to retaliation by Beijing in any broader trade conflict, has been particularly vocal in calling for a negotiated deal.
Karel De Gucht, the European Union's trade commissioner, issued an unusually blunt complaint late Monday that China was bypassing the European Union's leaders by going to member governments. Mr. De Gucht, ''also made it very clear to the vice minister that he was aware of the pressure being exerted by China on a number of E.U. member states,'' said John Clancy, Mr. De Gucht's spokesman.
Mr. Clancy added, ''It is the role of the European Commission to remain independent, to resist any external pressure and to see the 'big picture' for the benefit of Europe, its companies and workers based upon the evidence alone.''
The United States has already imposed antidumping and antisubsidy tariffs totaling about 30 percent on Chinese solar panels. The Obama administration has recently decided to seek its own negotiated settlement with China to replace the tariffs. Such a settlement could take the form of setting high minimum prices for Chinese exports to the United States, a ceiling on the volume of exports, or both.
While Washington, Brussels and Beijing are all saying now they want a negotiated settlement, Chinese solar companies and their many local government patrons are divided on what a settlement should look like.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action Ruling Near, Blacks' Progress Remains Slow

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and MICHAEL COOPER; Nelson D. Schwartz reported from Houston, and Michael Cooper from New York.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- As a partner and chief diversity officer at Thompson & Knight, Pauline Higgins was not afraid to press the issue of hiring minorities at the 126-year-old Texas law firm. But when she left in 2008, she was replaced by an associate with less influence.
Now, current and former partners say, the diversity committee meets less often, and the firm has fewer black lawyers than before. It is a trajectory familiar in many elite realms of American professional life. Even as racial barriers continue to fall, progress for African-Americans over all has remained slow -- and in some cases appears to be stalling.
''You don't want to be a diversity officer who only buys tables at events and seats people,'' Ms. Higgins said recently. ''It's about recruiting and inclusion and training and development, with substantive work assignments.'' 
Nearly a half-century after a Texan, President Lyndon B. Johnson, helped usher in the era of affirmative action, the Supreme Court is poised to rule as early as this week on whether the University of Texas can continue to consider race as one of many factors in its admissions policy. It is a case that could have a profound impact on race-based affirmative action programs across the nation, and it has reignited a discussion of how much progress minorities, blacks in particular, have made in integrating into some of the most sought-after professions, especially since the recession.
Only a little more than 1 percent of the nation's Fortune 500 companies have black chief executives, although there are some prominent exceptions, like Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express and Ursula M. Burns of Xerox. At the nation's biggest companies, about 3.2 percent of senior executive positions are held by African-Americans, according to an estimate by the Executive Leadership Council, an organization of current and former black senior executives.
While about 12 percent of the nation's working-age population is black, about 5 percent of physicians and dentists in the United States are black -- a share that has not grown since 1990, according to an analysis of census data that was prepared for The New York Times by sociologists at Queens College of the City University of New York. The analysis found that 3 percent of American architects are black, another field where the share has not increased in more than two decades.
The share of the nation's lawyers who are minorities and women, which had been growing slowly but steadily for years, fell in 2010 for the first time since NALP, the National Association for Law Placement, began keeping statistics in 1993. The deep recession not only disproportionately hurt African-Americans in many fields, but it also led businesses to make diversity programs less of a priority. And a growing number of states -- including Arizona, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Oklahoma -- have moved to ban race-based affirmative action in recent years. California, Florida and Washington did so in the 1990s.
Such numbers raise the question of whether the private sector's commitment to affirmative action and diversity programs is eroding, even as the Supreme Court again considers a high-profile case involving a public university.
''We're at a precipice,'' said John Page, the president of the National Bar Association, an 88-year-old group representing black lawyers and judges. ''There is diversity fatigue. We could fall backwards very quickly.''
Even more worrisome to some people than the small number of African-Americans at the upper echelons of many organizations is a lack of progress at entry levels. In Texas legal circles, there have been some notable symbolic gains for black lawyers at the top of the profession; both the State Bar of Texas and the Houston Bar Association just elected their first black presidents. But many black lawyers said they worried that there were fewer young black lawyers in the pipeline for future leadership roles.
While blacks made up only 2.65 percent of the partners at Houston firms last year, that figure represents progress as the share of black partners more than doubled over the past decade, according to statistics kept by NALP, the law placement association. At the lower levels of firms, black lawyers have lost some ground, however. Houston firms reported that 4.74 percent of their associates last year were black, down from 4.96 percent in 2002, the association said.
Lisa Tatum, the black lawyer who will take over the presidency of the Texas bar next month, said there was concern that firms were not pursuing diversity as aggressively as they did before.
''There's no question there's been some pullback,'' said Ms. Tatum, who works in San Antonio. ''There are some firms that look at what they have done, they look at President Obama, and they say we're there.''
The recession set back diversity efforts in many fields. After the financial crisis hit in 2008, the Conference Board, a business membership and research organization, asked senior executives how the downturn was changing their priorities. Among the several challenges they deemed less pressing was ''achieving diversity and representation in the cross-cultural work force.''
Somewhat lost in the legal arguments over affirmative action are the less tangible, more subtle forces that can determine professional success, more than a dozen black lawyers here, in San Antonio and elsewhere in Texas said in interviews. Social rituals can play a big role in determining who makes it on to the partnership track in the exclusive world of white-shoe firms, and whether those partners can bring in business as rainmakers.
Gerald Roberts, a black lawyer who was a partner at Thompson & Knight before leaving in 2010, said that social relationships left some black lawyers at a distance from their white colleagues and potential clients. ''For the most part, they don't go to church together on Sunday enough, they don't have dinner together enough, and they don't play enough golf together to develop sufficiently strong relationships of trust and confidence,'' he said.
A black associate at one Houston firm, who requested anonymity so as not to jeopardize his chances of making partner, used a familiar legal term to describe his unease at work, saying he sometimes felt there was a ''rebuttable presumption'' that he was there to fill a quota and was not as qualified as white colleagues.
Many black lawyers leave big firms to strike out on their own or to join the public sector.
By the end of Catina Haynes's first year in 2006 at one big Houston law firm, she said, many of the minority lawyers who had started with her were gone, along with the lawyer who recruited her. Billable hours shrank as the economy weakened, and Ms. Haynes said black lawyers did not always have advocates. ''It took someone in power to pull other people in and say, 'I want them on cases,' '' Ms. Haynes said. She left the firm in 2010 and now works in the Harris County District Attorney's Office.
Thompson & Knight currently has eight black lawyers, down from 17 in 2008. The overall size of the firm declined during that period as well, but the portion of minority lawyers has fallen, too. In 2008, 15 percent of its lawyers were minorities, according to the Diversity Scorecard, an annual survey by The American Lawyer, but in 2011, the year covered by the most recent scorecard, 10 percent were minorities.
''The firm genuinely had a very strong diversity commitment when I joined,'' said one current partner, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. He added that Ms. Higgins's exit in 2008, the death of the firm's former managing partner and the recession hurt the momentum. When Ms. Higgins was at the firm, he recalled, the diversity committee sat down together regularly. ''You were scared not to attend,'' he said.
Emily Parker, the managing partner at Thompson & Knight, said the firm was proud of its black partners and worked hard to promote diversity, but she noted that many top law firms had struggled to retain minority lawyers in recent years. She pointed out that the Diversity Scorecard survey had reported a decrease in the number of minority lawyers at top firms since 2008, even as more firms responded to the survey.
''Even though the number of surveyed law firms increased by 10 percent, the overall number of minority attorneys decreased by approximately 3 percent, which is a convincing statistical illustration of the minority-retention problem faced by Thompson & Knight and practically every law firm in the country,'' Ms. Parker said in a statement. She said the firm remained focused on fostering diversity, providing law school scholarships for minority students and internships for students from historically black institutions.
Despite the challenges, some lawyers at Thompson & Knight said they saw signs of renewed progress. Ms. Parker, who was the first female lawyer hired by the firm in 1973, last year became the first woman to lead it. This spring, Marlen Whitley, who is black, was named hiring partner in the firm's office here in Houston, and a black associate is scheduled to join the Dallas office this fall.
The firm has five black partners, more than many others and an increase from three in 2008. Still, only two are equity partners, who share in the profits of the firm. ''Being an equity partner means you've arrived, that you have clout,'' the current partner said. ''It's the brass ring.''

HEADLINE: Powerhouse of the Uranium Enrichment Industry Seeks a Way Out

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
CAPENHURST, England -- The first thing you notice when entering Building E23 on a tightly guarded site here in northwest England is the loud tick-tock. The sound resonates throughout the long, low-slung building where, behind secured doors, sit row upon row of tall thin tubes.
That ticking means the building's radiation detection system is working -- crucial comfort. Inside each cylinder is a centrifuge, spinning a gaseous form of uranium to give it the atomic boost it needs to be used as nuclear reactor fuel.
The company that operates this uranium enrichment center, Urenco, is the world leader in the field. It is also plumply profitable. So why are its owners eager to sell it? 
The answer, as with many things involving nuclear power, is a combination of economics, geopolitics and the Promethean prospect of an energy source that is as potentially green and abundant as deadly dangerous.
Urenco was formed by treaty in 1971 when Britain, West Germany and the Netherlands decided for strategic and business reasons to combine their uranium enrichment programs. The company is still owned by the British and Dutch governments, with one-third each, and with the German third held jointly by two big utility companies, E.On and RWE.
Urenco now has four enrichment plants -- in Britain, the Netherlands and Germany -- selling fuel for civilian energy purposes around the world, capturing nearly a third of the global market. It is also heavily investing in an American centrifuge complex in Eunice, N.M., that will eventually be its largest plant.
''Over the years we have developed generations of these machines,'' said Helmut Engelbrecht, Urenco's chief executive in a telephone interview. ''If you do something continuously you always improve.''
Besides fuel, Urenco's centrifuges spin off fairly good money: revenue of 1.6 billion euros, or $2.1 billion last year, yielding earnings of 402 million euros, for a profit margin of 25 percent. And its order book stands at 18 billion euros, which mean at least 10 years of steady work.
Analysts estimate Urenco's market value at about 10 billion euros. For all that momentum, though, the company is at a crossroads. Growth may flatten in the next couple of years, executives say, mainly because Japan -- a major user of nuclear power until the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster -- has shut down its reactors, taking about 10 percent of the world's nuclear energy generating capacity offline. And the Japanese have stockpiled substantial amounts of fuel for the day, if ever, that those reactors go back into operation.
The British government, intent on cleaning up its budget by selling state-owned enterprises, said in March that it had hired Morgan Stanley to look into disposing of all or part of its Urenco stake. In some respects Urenco is an easier business to sell than, say, the Royal Mail, because it has an internationally marketable product and a relatively small work force -- about 1,400 employees.
The German utilities E.On and RWE have hired Bank of America as their adviser. With the German government's having decided to get out of the nuclear industry in 2011 after Fukushima, the sale of their Urenco stakes would help the power companies beef up their thin balance sheets.
A sale became more likely Thursday, when the Dutch government said it wanted to sell its shares, as long as ''the public interest in terms of nonproliferation, nuclear safety and supply security'' could be safeguarded.
A person close to planning, who insisted on anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter, said if things went smoothly a sale might occur either late this year or in the first half of 2014.
''Nuclear strategies have changed,'' said Michael Kruse, a consultant on nuclear issues for the management consultant Arthur D. Little in Frankfurt. ''Governments no longer think they need to be in this business,'' he said, ''and utilities in several countries want out after Fukushima.''
People in the industry say the most likely buyers would be companies already in the industry that might want to offer clients fuel along with nuclear power stations. Areva, a French giant, might fit that bill. So might Toshiba of Japan, which is studying building nuclear plants in Britain. Still, ''there are in my view not many companies that can buy Urenco,'' Mr. Kruse said.
Urenco's chief executive, Mr. Engelbrecht, in a presentation to analysts in March, declined to discuss a possible sale of the company, saying he would leave that to the shareholders. But he argued that fast-growing emerging economies would take up the slack left by Japan.
Already, he noted, China is in the midst of a nuclear plant building boom, and India is also seriously pursuing nuclear power. In the Middle East, Urenco has a contract to enrich uranium for the plants in Abu Dhabi being built by South Korean contractors. Countries that are seeing 10 percent to 15 percent increases in electricity demand and that have major air pollution problems ''are all betting on nuclear, and that is where we believe the future of our business will be,'' Mr. Engelbrecht said.
The company has 50 customers in 17 countries, which it denotes with little plaques on a wall in the enrichment center's entranceway. The honorees include the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan, N.Y.; Wolf Creek in Burlington, Kan., and the Olkiluoto plant on an island off western Finland.
Even if the potential buyers are a small pool, analysts say that buying into Urenco would present a rare opportunity. Urenco's centrifuge technology, honed over several generations of machines, is considered the most efficient way to enrich uranium.
Urenco plants receive shipments of uranium hexafluoride, a granular substance derived from uranium ore, which is turned into gas by heating it. The gas is then piped into the centrifuges which use their spinning power to separate out the lighter and more reactive uranium 235 isotopes. When the gas is cooled again, it settles out as a solid resembling grains of sugar.
Urenco's process increases the proportion of U235, raising it from a starting point of about 0.7 percent to end up about 4 percent -- a suitable level for reactor fuel, but only a small fraction of the concentration needed to make a nuclear weapon.
Urenco's enriched uranium is put in canisters that then go to a fuel fabricator, where it is converted into pellets and loaded into fuel rods which are then delivered to the power plants.
The centrifuges rarely stop at the Capenhurst plant, which sprawls over about 170 acres in what has long been a munitions testing site surrounded by cow pastures and farm ponds. The newest group of cascades -- as the array of centrifuges is known -- in the Capenhurst building was installed 15 years ago and ''has never been brought to rest,'' said Geoff Owens, a Urenco engineer.
Areva, of France, which has about 10 percent of the world market for nuclear fuel sales, began switching over to Urenco's technology in the mid-2000s for its uranium enrichment. Areva's and Urenco's owners each have a 50 percent stake in a company called Enrichment Technology, based in Almelo, the Netherlands, that develops and makes the centrifuges.
It is very difficult for competitors to gain a foothold in Urenco's business. The details of the technology are closely guarded, and the uranium trade is tightly controlled and regulated. ''There are massive barriers to entry,'' said Harold Hutchinson, an analyst at Investec in London.
Urenco produces the steady, long-run returns that might be valued by pension funds and private equity groups. But worries that the wrong people may gain access to Urenco's world-leading technology will probably mean that the shareholders -- and the British, Dutch and German governments -- will be highly selective about who can buy stakes.
While Asian or Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds are said to be among those interested, only companies from North America, western Europe, Japan, or possibly, South Korea, are likely to pass muster, people in the industry say.
''There are an awful lot of security concerns which arise around these types of businesses,'' said Fiona Reilly, who heads the nuclear industry practice at Norton Rose, a law firm in London.
Besides potential candidates like Areva and Toshiba, another shopper might be Cameco, a big Canadian uranium mining outfit. It has shown interest in working with Urenco in the past and already uses a plant in Preston, England, that turns refined uranium ore into the uranium hexafluoride that could serve as feedstock for Urenco's nearby Capenhurst complex.
''Enrichment is a potential growth area for us,'' Gord Struthers, a Cameco spokesman said in an e-mail, while declining to comment on whether an offer might be imminent. ''We are watching what happens with Urenco closely.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Plans 3 Nominations For Key Court

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Adam Liptak contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will soon accelerate his efforts to put a lasting imprint on the country's judiciary by simultaneously nominating three judges to an important federal court, a move that is certain to unleash fierce Republican opposition and could rekindle a broader partisan struggle over Senate rules.
In trying to fill the three vacancies on the 11-member United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit at once, Mr. Obama will be adopting a more aggressive nomination strategy. He will effectively be daring Republicans to find specific ground to filibuster all the nominees.
White House officials declined to say who Mr. Obama's choices will be ahead of an announcement that could come this week, but leading contenders for the spots appear to include Cornelia T. L. Pillard, a law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center; David C. Frederick, who often represents consumers and investors at the Supreme Court; and Patricia Ann Millett, a veteran appeals lawyer in Washington. All three are experienced lawyers who would be unlikely to generate controversy individually. 
Several legal advocates who have been in communication with the West Wing said officials had repeatedly discussed those names in recent months.
Often called the second most important court in the country, the Washington court has overturned major parts of the president's agenda in the last four years, on regulations covering Wall Street, the environment, tobacco, labor unions and workers' rights.
With the confirmation last week of Sri Srinivasan, Mr. Obama's first successful nominee to the court, it now has four Democratic appointees and four Republican appointees. But of the six additional ''senior'' judges, who previously served full time on the court and still regularly hear cases, five were appointed by a Republican president, giving the court a strongly conservative flavor.
''The court is critically important -- the majority has made decisions that have frustrated the president's agenda,'' said Nan Aron, a liberal activist who has called for Mr. Obama to be more aggressive in nominating judges. ''Our view is that balance must be restored on that court, and the empty seats must be filled.''
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said last week that the court's rulings were ''wreaking havoc'' on the country.
Republicans in Congress are already preparing to do battle. Having approved Judge Srinivasan this month, Republican senators are pushing a proposal to eliminate the three empty slots from the court by shifting them to circuits in other parts of the country.
If that strategy, which Democrats have compared to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's failed attempt to change the size of the Supreme Court, does not work, Republicans could filibuster Mr. Obama's nominees to prevent them from joining the court. Republicans currently hold 45 of the Senate's 100 seats, and 41 are needed for a filibuster.
''The whole purpose here is to stack the court,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said of Democratic efforts to fill the court's vacancies.
Mr. Obama's decision to make the nominations all at once is part of a broader strategy by Democrats to shine a spotlight on what they say is Republican obstruction in the Senate.
Democrats cite the case of Caitlin J. Halligan, a former New York State solicitor general, whom Mr. Obama twice nominated to fill one of the vacancies on the Washington circuit court. Republicans filibustered her nomination both times.
Republicans deny that they are obstructing the president's nominees and say Mr. Obama's picks are being confirmed more quickly than were President George W. Bush's nominees when Democrats controlled the Senate. Republicans recall the case of Miguel Estrada, a lawyer nominated to the Washington circuit court in 2001. Democrats blocked his nomination with a filibuster.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said the Democratic accusations are ''nonsense.''
''This is part of the majority's attempt to create the appearance of obstruction where none exists,'' Mr. Grassley said last week in a speech on the floor of the Senate. ''It is a transparent attempt to manufacture a crisis.''
Democrats say Republicans in the Senate have violated long-standing traditions by routinely requiring 60 votes to approve even the most uncontroversial legislation or nomination.
Democrats are preparing to escalate the dispute this summer by scheduling numerous confirmation votes in a short period of time. If, as Democrats expect, Republicans block those nominations, Mr. Obama and his allies hope the public will notice.
With enough public pressure, some Democrats hope that they could change the Senate rules to prohibit filibusters on judicial nominations and in some other areas.
''A single blocked nomination may not generate much publicity, but by blocking so many nominees at once, the Republicans are overplaying their hand,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, told reporters on Thursday. ''The other side must be careful. If they think they can win a debate over whether the Senate should change its rules, they might very well be mistaken.''
In the meantime, the Washington circuit court continues to churn out decisions, some of which are undermining the president's hard-fought legislative and executive agenda.
In one case in 2011, a three-judge panel of the court -- randomly chosen from among the full-time and senior judges, as is typical -- struck down an important Wall Street regulation. The regulation, part of the banking legislation that was championed by Mr. Obama after the economic collapse in 2008 and passed by Congress, would have made it easier for shareholders to propose their own nominees to corporate boards of directors.
A similar panel last year struck down efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate air pollution across state lines. A third panel ruled in January that Mr. Obama could not make recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board in the face of Republican efforts to block his picks.
Democrats say the confirmation of Mr. Obama's likely nominees would make it more conceivable that the president's agenda would get a fair hearing.
Ms. Pillard has worked at the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. She has argued nine cases before the Supreme Court, including Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs in 2003, in which, to the surprise of many, she persuaded a court that had been protective of states' rights to allow suits against states under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Mr. Frederick served as a law clerk to Justice Byron R. White and worked in the Justice Department, spending five years in the solicitor general's office. He has argued more than 40 cases before the Supreme Court.
Ms. Millett served in the solicitor general's office for a decade and has argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court, most on behalf of the federal government. She now leads the appellate practice for one of Washington's largest law firms.
Lawyers close to the administration said they did not know whether other candidates were also being considered.

HEADLINE: Checking In After Checkout

BYLINE: By JULIE WEED

 BODY:
Hotels want to hear your opinion of your stay.
But they no longer feel that it is enough to leave a questionnaire in your guest room and hope for a response, not when TripAdvisor and other public rating sites display customer satisfaction -- or dissatisfaction -- for all to see.
So they may send guests who have just checked out an e-mail survey asking about their stay, and sometimes an additional e-mail if they do not respond to the first one. And hotels monitor what is being said about them on social media and travel Web sites.
The data they collect affects both how they treat their guests over all and how they interact with individual travelers. 
Customer feedback used to be for internal use only, but as guests increasingly turn to the Web to air their reactions to their stays, hotels view customer satisfaction as even more important to their business. A study from the Center for Hospitality Research at Cornell University recently found that hotels with better customer reviews on travel rating sites like Travelocity and TripAdvisor could charge slightly higher rates. Thomas P. Botts, executive vice president and chief customer officer at Denihan Hospitality Group, said customer satisfaction was so important to his company that a portion of employee compensation was tied to it.
Still, hotels are trying to find the right balance between surveying customers and bothering them. As a result, some questionnaires are now shorter, allowing guests to complete them in a few clicks, and sent to mobile devices to be filled out by customers riding in taxis or waiting at the airport. The Denihan Hospitality Group uses a system created by Posmetrics that rotates five questions on an iPad at the front desk. In the latest Hyatt Hotels post-stay survey, only one question really needs to be answered.
At the same time, some hotel surveys are going beyond the basics of asking about noise, cleanliness and satisfaction. Symon Bridle, chief operating officer of the hotel management company New World Hospitality, said his company's surveys focused on a customer's ''emotional connection'' with the brand, which can come down to interactions with staff members. ''It really is the people you have that can make a stay into a great versus an average experience,'' he said, ''and creating that link with the customer is what's it's all about.''
Hotels work on their surveys with a variety of partners. The Dorchester Collection of hotels in the United States and Europe uses the Gallup organization to collect more than 10,000 surveys annually to determine customer loyalty and emotional attachment, according to Ana Brant, director of organizational performance at the Dorchester Collection.
Guests at the Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles at Beverly Hills and the Inn at Penn, a Hilton hotel in Philadelphia, can share opinions via in-room iPads using software created by Intelity, a technology provider that focuses on the hospitality industry and works with more than 500 hotel clients worldwide. Wyndham Hotels and Resorts guests receive their post-stay surveys directly from TripAdvisor and can see the consolidated results on Wyndham's Web site.
Hyatt Hotels found that customers like to give specific feedback, said Heather Briggs, the company's vice president for consumer insights and market research, so there are more text boxes for open-ended answers. Traditionally, market researchers have preferred numeric scales and check boxes to open-ended questions when working with large numbers of surveys because they are easier to tabulate and analyze.
Hyatt, though, uses a system of text recognition and analysis that groups comments from its surveys into subject areas. The system also rates how positive or negative the comments are by which words are used and the use of exclamation points, among other things. The amalgamated survey data is available to all Hyatt Hotel properties.
Hyatt's system also scans for and analyzes comments from Facebook, Twitter and other social media and feedback sites. Comments that are especially negative or positive set off alerts to the appropriate hotel general manager, who can directly communicate with the guest on that social network. ''We live and die by guest feedback,'' Ms. Briggs said.
Customers may think that their survey answers are just used for research, and that their responses are just grouped with a lot of others, but hotel can use their individual answers as well. Hyatt is working to integrate its survey system into its guest profiles and even to have some of that information available as the guest checks in. That way, for example, the front desk staff may notify guests if they are two stays from a rewards program upgrade or assign them a room far from an elevator because of comments on a previous questionnaire.
''We need to balance customer privacy in the information they share with letting them know we are listening to them and want to personalize their stay,'' Ms. Briggs said.
Hotels said they had made a variety of changes based on the feedback. A city hotel that heard noise complaints added earplugs to its guest amenity kits. A hotel restaurant that heard grumbling about waiting times increased the number of employees working that shift.
Hotels, of course, are not the only ones in the hospitality industry using these kinds of surveys and then making adjustments. Based on survey feedback from customers on overnight flights, the airline El Al combined the food and beverage service so passengers could finish meals more quickly and get to sleep sooner. The most common customer complaint at Crystal Cruises centered on expensive and confusing pricing for Internet access, so pricing was simplified.
While young professionals may carry multiple electronic devices, hotels that gather feedback in a variety of formats, including Web and paper, can reach a range of customers. Peter Finamore, senior vice president for operations of Regent Hotels and Resorts, said of his hotels in Taiwan, ''Our customers have culturally been more comfortable using pen and paper, and, in fact, we still do it that way in our restaurants and receive hundreds of responses every day.''
Now, though, he said, his hotels are also asking overnight guests to fill out a 30-second survey on a tablet on the way out, or the hotels send the guests an e-mail when they depart. Paper will still be used for some time, though, Mr. Finamore predicted, because of the tough consumer laws in Taiwan.
''In order to send a customer an e-mail, we need to have a physical signature from them saying it is O.K.,'' Mr. Finamore said.
Electronic surveys have a higher response rate than paper ones, according to Chris Anderson, a professor at Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, but for all of the new variations of hotel surveys and delivery systems, most guests still ignore them.
Jharna Jain, a marketing consultant in the technology industry, may typify those guests. ''If I have a really fantastic or really terrible experience, I'll put it on TripAdvisor so other people know about it,'' she said. ''But I don't want to take the time to fill out a hotel survey.''

HEADLINE: Leaving Tehran and Restraints Behind

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: Societal constraints compel some of Iran&#8217;s young women to leave the country. Kiana Hayeri, who has been through it all herself, followed four teenage immigrants. 

 BODY:
Kiana Hayeri has fond memories of her teenage years in Tehran - even if she had to dodge the morality police whenever she decided to wear a little more makeup or uncover her hair. 
But at 17, her family sent her to live in Toronto so that she could have better opportunities for college and a career. At an age when fitting in at school is important, Ms. Hayeri's mastery of English was limited to "I don't speak English."
Ms. Hayeri, now 24, has spent the last three years documenting people very much like herself. Her first major project, "Your Veil Is a Battleground," published last year on Lens, showed teenage girls in Tehran living dual lives - a proscribed one in public and another pushing limits and striving for personal freedoms in private. Her subjects were not necessarily typical of the country, but in Tehran she found many young people yearning for more. 
They were, she felt, exactly who she would have been if she had not emigrated.
Ms. Hayeri followed four of them as they, too, emigrated in search of those freedoms and better economic opportunities. She photographed her 17-year-old subjects in Tehran, as they moved and in the countries where they settled over the last year. 
"I think for all these girls, the families sent them away for exactly the same reason that my family did: for a better future, for more safety, more educational options," Ms. Hayeri said. "Hoping for a better future."
Their experiences have been quite different. 
Parmida moved with her family to California to study ballet, which was illegal in Iran. "Not only couldn't she perform, but ballet classes have to be run sort of underground," Ms. Hayeri said. In the United States, Parmida has continued her ballet lessons and has started ballroom dancing.
Melika moved to Montreal to finish high school and attend college. She lives alone, though her parents visit often. She is generally quiet and shy. "She studies all the time, so grade-wise, she's doing amazing," Ms. Hayeri said. "But I don't think that she's happy with where she is right now." 
Soheila moved to Toronto with her family, "very religious and restrictive" Sunni Muslims from southern Iran. She has changed a lot since arriving, especially in "the way she dresses and the way she interacts with friends," Ms. Hayeri said. "Now she lives her life and works at McDonald's."
Parastou was a member of the Iranian national junior canoeing team, but her prospects for continued athletic competition were dim because she was a woman, and women are discouraged from participating in public sporting events in Iran. She moved to Australia, hoping to compete there. Now, she works as a lifeguard and teaches swimming while continuing her training.
As new immigrants, each of these four women face similar challenges to those Ms. Hayeri faced when she moved to Canada in 2005. But since then, Ms. Hayeri has found her own path as a successful young photographer. She is glad that she emigrated - a move that allowed her to become "a different person." 
Now, though, she is back in Tehran, photographing during the run-up to Iran's June 14 presidential election.

HEADLINE: China Adds Sparkle to Champagne Sales

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: In the latest victory for France&#8217;s most jealously protected sparkling wine, Chinese authorities have agreed that only the real thing is allowed to be called Champagne. 

 BODY:
LONDON - France's Champagne producers will doubtless be raising a glass or two this week to toast a decision by authorities in China, one of their fastest growing overseas markets, to recognize the uniqueness of their product. 
"No more fake bubbly in China - at least in theory," wrote Le Figaro, reporting on the announcement that Beijing has agreed to restrict use of the name to wines produced in the Champagne region of France.
Up until now, the name Champagne had been misapplied to "mediocre sparkling wines and vulgar sodas," according to the French daily.
Henceforth, it can only be used to describe the two million bottles - and rising - of genuine Champagne that are annually exported to China.
The Chinese decision represents a victory for President François Hollande, who negotiated the deal during a recent visit to Beijing, and for Champagne producers who jealously guard France's most prestigious appellation d'origine contrôlée, or protected designation of origin.
Under French law, the only sparkling wine anywhere in the world that merits the name Champagne must be made from grapes grown on officially designated plots of land in France.
France's Champagne Committee - motto: "It's not Champagne if it's not Champagne" - has been fighting since 1935 against what it says amounts to hundreds of instances each year of the name being abused. 
Champagne joined Cognac, Scotch and Napa Valley wine as a protected tipples in China.
The announcement Monday followed a similar commitment by Brazil last year to recognize Champagne as a geographical indication of origin, thereby preventing its local producers from describing their wines as Champagne in the future.
Emerging economies have become an increasingly important market for producers in recent years as European sales declined in the midst of a financial crisis.
Sales dropped by more than 4 percent last year to 309 million bottles. In France, the largest single consumer of Champagne, sales were down by almost 9 percent, despite end-of-year price cuts by suppliers.
That contrasts with the period before the 2008 financial crisis when sales were rising so fast that French authorities considered expanding the geographical area of the Champagne region of northeastern France to meet increased demand. 
Champagne producers hope that buyers in countries that include Japan, China, Australia and Brazil will help to close the sales gap. Nigeria is currently the fastest growing foreign market, while China represents Champagne's fifth biggest buyer outside the European Union.
Reaction from France to the Chinese decision nevertheless stressed that sales in that country, despite a rise of more than 50 percent last year, were still relatively few.
Le Figaro suggested that Champagne - sparkling, acidic, and served cold - might not suit the palate of the Chinese who "prefer sweet things and even drink their water warm."

HEADLINE: Tangled Passages

BYLINE: PHILIP B. CORBETT


HIGHLIGHT: Beyond the bare facts, our best stories offer context, background, analysis and reaction. Unfortunately, sometimes we seem to try to put them all into one sentence. 

 BODY:
Beyond the bare facts, our best stories offer context, background, analysis and reaction. Unfortunately, sometimes we seem to try to put them all into one sentence. 
The result can be long, convoluted, hard to read, even ungrammatical. As my colleague Patrick LaForge noted in a previous After Deadline essay on this topic, there's no firm rule for how long is too long for a sentence in a news story. But when the word count approaches 50, we are asking a lot from readers crammed on the subway or glancing at their phones in the checkout line. This ain't Proust, folks.
A long introductory clause, a pileup of punctuation, or a back-and-forth of competing thoughts may signal that a sentence is too tangled. Sometimes a simple period works wonders, breaking a sentence in two and giving the reader a chance to pause. Consider whether a long throat-clearing prelude is truly necessary. Remove some secondary information and move it lower. Pare 'em down. Break 'em up. Straighten 'em out.
Here are a few recent passages that might have benefited from another look. 
 WASHINGTON - Three months after hackers working for a cyberunit of China's People's Liberation Army went silent amid evidence that they had stolen data from scores of American companies and government agencies, they appear to have resumed their attacks using different techniques, according to computer industry security experts and American officials. 
Be careful of loading too much background on the reader before getting to the main point. This 50-word lead sentence used more words for the backward-facing introductory clause than it did for the new stuff.
 The board of Yahoo, the faded Web pioneer, agreed on Sunday to buy the popular blogging service Tumblr for about $1.1 billion in cash, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, a signal of how the company plans to reposition itself as the technology industry makes a headlong rush into social media. 
In 53 words, we looked back, we looked ahead, we surveyed the landscape and reported the news - an awful lot for a reader to absorb before the first period.
 As the Brooklyn district attorney's office pledged a complete review of about 50 murder cases after questions arose regarding the conduct of the detective assigned to them, renewed scrutiny has also focused on the role prosecutors play in what turn out to be wrongful convictions, and whether they should be held responsible when justice goes awry. 
In this lead, too, we took a long look back - with two subordinate clauses - before getting to the new thought.
 The virus, which has struck farmed salmon populations in Chile, among other places, is not harmful to humans who eat the fish, but could potentially pose grave threats in a part of the world where salmon plays a huge role in local economies and ecosystems. If the virus, which is in the influenza family, mutates into a virulent Pacific strain in the crowded fish farms in British Columbia, where wild and farmed salmon are sometimes in proximity, fish populations on both sides of the farm/wild divide, Ms. Morton believes, could be devastated. 
These two sentences included 92 words and, perhaps more tellingly, nine commas. If you need four or five commas per sentence to keep the clauses straight, consider simplifying.
 The new details of what Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has told authorities emerged as the F.B.I. moved forward on Thursday with trying to determine how the brothers were radicalized and the role that Tamerlan's wife, Katherine Russell, may have played in the plot or in helping the brothers evade the authorities after the attacks. 
The whole first clause - technically the main clause - of this 52-word sentence was just a glance back at the preceding paragraphs. It's like one long "meanwhile." Why not just start with "The F.B.I. moved forward ..."?
 Pfizer has taken the unusual step of selling its erectile dysfunction drug, Viagra, to consumers on its Web site, in an effort to establish a presence in the huge online market for the popular blue pill, considered to be one of the most counterfeited drugs in the world. 
 Viagra is one of Pfizer's marquee drugs - the company said it brought in more than $2 billion in sales in 2012 - but some drug experts estimate Pfizer could be losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year to a prolific black market of online pharmacies that cater to men too embarrassed to buy the drug through traditional means. As of Monday, in an arrangement with CVS/pharmacy, patients in the United States with a valid prescription for Viagra are able to fill their order through the new Web site, where the sentence "Buy real Viagra" is featured prominently. 
The lead sentence included four different references to Viagra, a clue that it was overstuffed. And the two-sentence second paragraph included, by my quick count, 97 words, 11 verbs and 15 prepositional phrases.
 Yet about 80 percent of abuse victims who receive trauma-focused weekly therapy show significant improvement after three to four months, studies find - the authorities in Cleveland are arranging for the women to receive trauma therapy, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Some survivors of lengthy captivities can have continuing problems, especially if they were already experiencing emotional difficulties before their abduction, and so, are more vulnerable. Others - like Elizabeth Smart, who was abducted from her bedroom in 2002 at the age of 14, and Jaycee Lee Dugard, who spent 18 years as a prisoner after being kidnapped in 1991 and had two children by her abductor - have apparently done well, going on to write books about their experiences and work on behalf of other abuse victims. 
A proliferation of commas and dashes is often a bad sign. In the first sentence here, the dash is not enough to link the two clauses into a single sentence. In the next sentence, the commas around "and so" make the passage choppy and jarring. And in the third, too much information is wedged midsentence between the dashes, causing a reader to lose track of the main clause.
 The accounts from Mr. Hicks and two other officials, Mark I. Thompson, the former deputy coordinator for operations in the State Department's Counterterrorism Bureau, and Eric Nordstrom, an official in the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security who had testified previously, added some detail to accounts of the night of Sept. 11 in Benghazi. Armed Islamic militants penetrated the diplomatic compound, starting the fire that killed Mr. Stevens and an aide, and later killed two security officers in a mortar attack; in Tripoli, where frantic diplomats fearing a similar invasion used an ax to destroy classified hard drives; and in Washington, where officials struggled to keep up with events. 
I suspect this paragraph started out as one endless sentence. But in breaking it up with a period after Benghazi, we rendered the second half ungrammatical and incomprehensible.
 In interviews with the Indian news media in recent days, Mr. Sharif stressed his desire to normalize relations with New Delhi - a subject that the army, which has fought three major wars with India - views as its central concern. 
This sentence is not particularly long, but a problem with dashes makes it almost impossible to read. Use a comma in place of the second dash, or rephrase the sentence.
 
 In a Word 
This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
 But it is not clear exactly how much such groups can spend on elections, thanks to decades worth of vague and sometimes contradictory laws, regulations and court decisions. 
Make it either "decades' worth of ... laws" or "decades of ... laws."
 Mr. Nahmad helped not only to bankroll the operation, according to prosecutors, but was also personally involved in taking sports bets. 
This construction needs to be parallel. Make it "not only helped to bankroll ..."
 "The home crowd was electrifying," said left wing Matt Martin, one of 15 Islanders making his playoff debut. 
Another variation on the "one of" trap. To avoid using the singular pronoun "his" with the antecedent "15 Islanders," we might make it "making their playoff debuts" or "appearing in the playoffs for the first time."
 When she is not heading to track practice or doing her homework, she is combing Bergdorf Goodman for Louis Vuitton limited edition handbags and relishing in the $295 tasting menu at the celebrated Columbus Circle restaurant Per Se. 
Just "relishing"; no "in." Or perhaps we meant something like "reveling in," that is, taking delight in.
 The nurse and the soldier may never have met - and eventually married - had it not been for the American government's mistreatment of black women during World War II. ... 
 "My mother pitched a fit," Mr. Albert said, who still has a copy of the letter Elinor wrote to the school superintendent and a local branch of the N.A.A.C.P. 
In the first sentence, use "might," not "may," for the contrary-to-fact construction. In the second sentence, make it "said Mr. Albert, who ..." While we prefer to avoid the journalistic mannerism of inverting attribution phrases, it's necessary here so the relative clause will be adjacent to its antecedent.
 The heart association reaffirmed that position in an interview with its spokesman on Monday, even in light of the new report. 
The heart association didn't give the interview; its spokesman did. Rephrase.
 Representatives of Coca-Cola and Schneider Electric did not return requests for comment on Sunday. 
Awkward phrasing. Say "did not return calls seeking comment" or "did not respond to requests for comment," but not "did not return requests for comment."
 Since the accident, some state lawmakers began calling for increased workplace safety inspections to be paid for by businesses. 
"Since" means from then till now, so it should usually be used with the present perfect tense, not the simple past tense. Make it "Since the accident, some state lawmakers have begun ..." or "After the accident, some state lawmakers began ..."
 Worse, the frenzy over splitting chairman and chief executive at JPMorgan misses a crucial and fundamental point: the person that would most likely become the chairman, Lee Raymond, is already the board's "lead director" and already performs virtually the same duties that he would with the chairman title.

HEADLINE: A Hotel Company Is Hobbled by a Deal Struck in Bad Times

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: In 2009, the Morgans Hotel Group received financing under terms that favored Ronald W. Burkle&#8217;s investment firm. It is now finding it hard to unwind the relationship. 

 BODY:
If you are reading this column by the pool at the Delano South Beach in Miami Beach or while hanging out at the bar at St. Martins Lane Hotel in London or the Royalton in Manhattan, you may not be aware that behind the scenes of your comfortable surroundings, all is not well.
The Morgans Hotel Group, the owner and manager of these three boutique hotels and others like the Mondrian in SoHo, is being crushed by a deal it cut with Ronald W. Burkle's investment firm, the Yucaipa Companies.
It all started back in October 2009. Morgans, founded by Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell of Studio 54 fame, was struggling under the weight of the financial crisis. Revenue was declining precipitously as consumers panicked and shunned luxury. 
Worried about liquidity and searching for expansion, Morgans hit upon a deal with Yucaipa. The investment firm would make a $72 million infusion in what is known as a private investment in public equity, or PIPE.
Such deals are complicated and are usually done with distressed or struggling companies. An investment firm will take a large ownership position, rescuing the company. But the price for this rescue is high. A PIPE is usually done on quite advantageous terms and includes complicated options, preferred returns and redemption features all intended to give more value to the investor.
The reason for this trade-off is that typically the company has no choice. One study of PIPEs found that without the investment, the majority of target companies would be out of cash within a year.
Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of other shareholders. This samestudy, of over 2,500 such deals, found that after the investment, existing shareholders receive average returns of negative 22 percent, compared with average gains of 27 percent for the PIPE investor.
It is no surprise that a knowledgeable investor like Mr. Burkle, known for buying and selling supermarket chains, negotiated great terms for his PIPE. In exchange for $72 million, Yucaipa received preferred securities and warrants to acquire as many as 12.5 million shares of Morgans Hotel. The preferred even has a "death spiral" feature: It starts at a dividend rate of 8 percent, but this rises to 10 percent in 2014 and 20 percent in 2016 if the preferred is not repaid.
The kicker is that Yucaipa also received the right to nominate one director and extensive control rights over Morgans. This includes veto rights over a sale of the company, acquisitions worth more than $100 million and any sale of nearly all of the company's assets.
It is unclear if Morgans' management appreciated the consequences of handing this degree of control over the company to Mr. Burkle's Yucaipa. On an investor conference call in 2009, the president of the company at that time said that Mr. Burkle's investment was "shareholder friendly" and provided the company with a "great deal of flexibility to weather the remainder of the downturn." Shareholders may not have done so either, as they also approved part of the transaction.
Looking back at the deal, a company representative said on Tuesday: "Morgans Hotel Group was deeply indebted and needed an equity lifeline in 2009 and the Yucaipa deal was a good solution to provide necessary equity capital. The terms of the transaction were generally consistent with the credit market environment at that time. That deal was validated by stockholders, 87 percent of which voted in favor of allowing the transaction to proceed."
Nearly four years later, Mr. Burkle has continued to take control. Yucaipa owns 27.9 percent of Morgans, and with the company's consent he also bought $88 million of its debt, which comes due in October 2014. Yucaipa's first appointment to the board, Michael J. Gross, now runs Morgans.
But Morgans has a problem. It has mortgage debt of $180 million due in 2015 and $172 million in debt due in 2014, about half of which is held by Mr. Burkle's Yucaipa. Remember that the interest payments on the preferred rise to 20 percent in 2016.
Morgans, meanwhile, has changed its business strategy, so that it is selling hotels and focusing on managing luxury hotels under its brand. It has been a fitful transition, and the company has lost more than $200 million in the past three years.
In normal times this might create financing problems for Morgans. But we currently live in a near-zero interest rate environment, and luxury hotels are an increasingly hot commodity. If you have been to the Delano lately you can see that is the case as the 1 percent luxuriates en masse by the pool. So even though its performance is less than stellar, Morgans should be able to refinance its debt.
The problem is that Morgans' friendly deal with Mr. Burkle is looking not so welcoming to other investors.
According to people close to Morgans, the company has been told by its bankers that if it cannot eliminate the favorable terms and various forms of financing with Yucaipa, it will not be able to raise significantly new amounts of capital.
So Morgans has announced another complicated deal that it calls a deleveraging transaction. The hotel company has agreed to give Yucaipa the Delano South Beach and Morgans nightclub and food and beverage management business in exchange for cancellation of the warrants, preferred shares and debt.
As part of this transaction, Morgans announced a $100 million rights issuance amounting to more than 50 percent of its current equity, an extraordinary number of shares to issue. Yucaipa also agreed to backstop the rights offering, having the potential to raise its share ownership by a significant percentage if other shareholders did not participate.
OTK Associates, an investment vehicle run by the Olshan and Taubman real estate families that owns 13.9 percent of Morgans, has started a campaign to stop the transaction with Mr. Burkle's Yucaipa.
The investment group has sued in a Delaware court, claiming that the deleveraging transaction was unduly favorable to Yucaipa. At a hearing in April on the matter, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster halted completion of the transaction and appeared to find evidence to support OTK's allegations. The judge stated that "there is evidence in the record to call into question things" the directors did, implying that they may have been too close with Mr. Burkle and Yucaipa.
Now OTK, which voted for the 2009 transaction, is running a slate of seven directors to try to unseat the Morgans board at its June 14 annual meeting. The investment group's claim is that in today's environment the Burkle deal is too expensive, and the hotel company instead should be able to find a deal, something evidenced by Morgans' recently receiving a proposal to acquire the entire company.
This is a mess, and it has created a huge upheaval at the company with tens of millions being spent on lawyers and bankers.
I sympathize with the position Morgans is in. It is very difficult to find a better deal than the one with Yucaipa, given the rights that Mr. Burkle's fund already has. An analyst at MKM Partners echoed this in a note, rating the company neutral but stating that the deleveraging transaction "has the power to be transformative." Still, it also appears that Morgans may not have fought as hard in the past as it probably should have.
It is clear there is a lesson here for other companies.
In 2009, Morgans needed money but was not completely out of options. Still, it took a PIPE deal with hard terms. That deal is coming back to haunt the company.
You can't blame Yucaipa for acting in its self-interest, but you can blame Morgans' management then for failing to appreciate the consequences of the PIPE investment at the time. It locked them into the arms of Yucaipa in a way that is exceedingly difficult to escape.
It's a reminder for every corporate board the next time it contemplates an investment like this, and a sobering thought for those executives and beautiful people sitting today by that Delano pool - your investment choices years ago can linger, pushing you to even worse decisions.

HEADLINE: Health Care Is Spread Thin on Alaskan Frontier

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
BETHEL, Alaska -- Americans in some rural places fret at how far away big-city medical help might be in an emergency, or at the long drives they are forced to make for prenatal care, or stitches, or chemotherapy.
Dr. Ellen Hodges only wishes it could be so easy. 
She oversees health care for a population of 28,000, mostly Alaska Natives, here in the state's far west end, spread out over an area the size of Oregon that has almost no roads. People can travel by boat or snow machine at certain times of the year, but not right now: the Kuskokwim River, which wends through Bethel to the Bering Sea, is choked with unstable melting ice in late May, magnifying the isolation that defines everything in what may be America's emptiest corner.
''If you have a road, you're not remote,'' Dr. Hodges said.
The complex machinery of health care is being reimagined everywhere in the nation through the combined prism of new regulations and shifting economics, even here on the continent's frosted fringe.
The grandly named Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation, for example, where Dr. Hodges is chief of staff, is scrambling this spring to install a new electronic medical records system. That is a hallmark of the federal health care overhaul, compounded out here by the fact that computers run by generators in far-flung villages are subject to brownouts and fuel shortages.
Cost controls are also the way of the medical frontier no matter where you look. In other places, such constraints may be driven by insurance companies; here, by sequester-driven budget cuts to the federal Indian Health Service. The agency is the 50-bed hospital's main support in treating the tribes and villagers who have lived for thousands of years in the boggy crescent of lowlands where the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers carve their paths to the sea.
The 56 tribes in the region voted in the mid-1990s to bundle their health care money from the federal government to finance the hospital. Grants supplement the work.
But the one thing that shapes every care decision, from the routine to the catastrophic, is the map. Triage in medical decisions, logistics and money is all filtered through an equation of time and distance on a vast and mostly untracked land.
Is air transport justified for medical reasons? Too slow to make a difference? Too dangerous in bad weather to attempt? What should a health worker on the ground -- in most villages a local resident trained by the hospital -- be told to do, or not do?
''There are judgment calls that you never have to make in the lower 48,'' said Dr. David Bielak, 31, a family medicine practitioner who started coming here last fall in temporary stints from his home near San Jose, Calif.
And many of those decisions, often based on telephone descriptions from a villager, can be weighty. None of the more than four dozen communities served by the hospital have a doctor in residence.
''It's the middle of the night, and you get a call from a clinic way up in the middle of nowhere where something very, very strange has happened,'' Dr. Bielak said. ''A lot of it is dark: a lot of alcoholism, suicidal ideation, a lot of abuse.''
A lack of running water and sewer systems in many villages in turn compounds the struggle to make, or keep, people well in a place long marked by poverty and isolation.
Take a glimpse, for example, into Alexandria Tikiun's world: At age 25, with four children at home to care for, she is a community health aide, the closest thing to an M.D. in her village, Atmautluak, population about 400.
The aide system itself is uniquely Alaskan. It was developed in the 1950s, during an outbreak of tuberculosis, when the first health aides were trained to dispense medicine. Now, in sessions here at the hospital, Ms. Tikiun and 150 other aides, mostly women, learn medical skills that include trauma response, pregnancy testing and vaccination, all based on a book that they call their bible, which walks them through a kind of algorithm of step-by-step questions leading to treatment protocols.
On tougher cases, Ms. Tikiun consults by telephone with a doctor in Bethel. For medical checkups, she can use a telemedicine machine that allows, say, a child's ear-exam results to be sent electronically from the village clinic to a specialist in Anchorage or elsewhere. X-rays are read by radiologists in Ohio.
But life in the Alaskan bush, with all its attendant risks and mayhem, is never far away. Ms. Tikiun said she once spent two hours on the floor of a pickup truck, ministering to an accident victim with multiple fractures and lacerations as her driver raced down the frozen Kuskokwim River ice road, bound for Bethel's nine-bed emergency room.
The added stress of the work, said another village aide, Randall Gamball, is social. In a tiny village, every patient is without exception also an acquaintance or a relative.
''It's really tough to work on someone you know,'' Mr. Gamball said.
The hospital's flight paramedics, meanwhile, have to be ready with unpredictable medical emergencies and a sometimes radically ferocious climate at the same time. Whiteout conditions and temperatures 40 degrees below zero are not uncommon in winter.
Mark Stevens, a paramedic originally from eastern Washington, described one particularly memorable rescue: His team -- two paramedics and a pilot -- landed their propeller plane on a village airstrip, but then freezing fog closed in, coating everything with thick, heavy ice.
It took three hours of frantic scraping -- two crew members at the plane, the other with the patient -- before they could head back.
Every flight must be a consensus, Mr. Stevens said, and any member of the three-person team can veto the plan if conditions seem unsafe. ''It's three to go, one to say no,'' he said.
Doctors and nurses are also mostly from the lower 48, doing stints here of a week or a month. Sometimes, being thrown together in an isolated place has unexpected benefits. Dena Gray and Gary Holmes, both registered nurses -- he's from Alabama, she's from Oklahoma -- met at the hospital. Last month, they flew to Las Vegas and married.
Others fall in love with the patients, or the tundra, or some combination. Dr. Hodges, 38, came to Bethel on a two-year contract, vowing to leave at the first possible opportunity. That was 10 years ago.

HEADLINE: Central Banks Act With a New Boldness to Revitalize Economies

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM, JACK EWING, HIROKO TABUCHI and LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
When James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, arrived in Frankfurt last week, he issued an unusual public warning to the European Central Bank: Be bolder.
Central bankers, anywhere in the world, are a cautious lot. They prefer slow and steady over the dramatic gesture. And they rarely go public with criticisms of other central banks.
But the economic stagnation of the major developed nations has driven central banks in the United States, Japan, Britain and the European Union to take increasingly aggressive action. Because governments are not taking steps to revive economies, like increasing spending or cutting taxes, the traditional concern of central bankers that economic growth will cause too much inflation has been supplanted by the fear that growth is not fast enough to prevent deflation, or falling prices.
The Fed has announced plans to keep borrowing costs at historic lows until unemployment declines. The staid Bank of England has bought more than a half-trillion dollars' worth of bonds to ignite British business activity. 
Last month, Haruhiko Kuroda, the new chairman of the Bank of Japan, steered the central bank toward an audacious new policy of reinflating the Japanese economy by doubling the money supply. It is considered the boldest step so far by a central bank.
So far, the results of these activist central banks have fallen short of expectations.
''I'm not sure why we're not getting more response,'' said Donald L. Kohn, a former Federal Reserve vice chairman who is now at the Brookings Institution. ''Maybe we've made some progress in identifying some of the causes, but it's not fully satisfying why we have negative real interest rates everywhere in the industrial world and so little growth.''
Certainly investors around the world watch for any sign that the central bankers are backing away from their bold steps.
Stock markets wobbled in Japan and elsewhere last week on fears that the Federal Reserve might start pulling back on its stimulus sooner than expected and that Japan's effort might fall short of its goal of reviving the economy. A few central bankers' reassurances seemed to calm the markets.
The lackluster results have provided cover for the European Central Bank, which has remained the most cautious of the major central banks. It is sticking to the more traditional formula of cutting interest rates -- a string Japan ineffectually pushed for more than a decade -- in the hopes that it will encourage banks to lend more money to businesses.
The Federal Reserve in the United States has been significantly more aggressive since December 2008, when the Fed reduced its benchmark short-term interest rate nearly to zero. Ever since, it has pursued a pair of experiments aimed at dragging other interest rates closer to zero, too.
The Fed has tried to bolster confidence that rates will stay low by talking more about the future. In December, it said it intended to keep short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent, the first time it had tied policy to a specific target. That, and buying almost $3 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, has helped to cut borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
While the share of Americans with jobs has barely budged and other economic indicators remain weak at best, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has doubled since the Fed announced its first round of bond purchases in November 2008. Interest rates on mortgages and car loans are near the lowest levels on record. Average yields on junk bonds fell below 5 percent for the first time. Corporations with strong credit ratings, like Apple, also are borrowing vast sums at little cost.
Still, for all the daring, some critics argue that the Fed is not trying hard enough. ''It's as if we went to the biggest fire we've ever seen and we poured more water on it than we've ever poured, and the fire isn't completely out,'' said Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Fed economist now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''Well, we should try more water.''
Officials in Britain, too, are debating its central bank's ability to do more.
Last month, the departing governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, gave a speech at the International Monetary Fund in which he said -- a bit acidly -- that there was a limit to what monetary policy could do to spur recovery in a country like Britain, where a small number of stingy banks dominate the economy and the government is tightening its spending.
Like other central banks around the world, the Bank of England, by far the oldest of them all, has done its part to ward off a depression. It has bought, to date, the equivalent of $569 billion worth of government bonds -- a bold use of the printing press for an institution known for its hidebound ways.
This shock treatment, the professorial Mr. King pointed out, equaled 20 percent of the British economy, outpacing the central bank interventions of the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve.
And what does Mr. King have to show for his monetary exertions -- beyond record stock market highs and bottom-scraping yields for British corporate bonds? An anemic recovery. Growth this year is expected to be 0.5 percent, according to the monetary fund, while Japan's gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent in the first quarter and the United States' is expected to grow a little more than 2 percent.
''There is a limit to what the central bank can achieve,'' said Robert Wood, chief economist for Britain at Berenberg Bank in London, who worked previously at the Bank of England. ''Britain's problem is that it is still paying for its past sins -- simply wishing we could be where we were before the crisis is just not going to happen.''
Japan's willingness to use huge government spending -- despite racking up incredible debt to do so -- is unique among the developed economies.
Under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the country is coupling its central bank action with fiscal stimulus, which means that the new money created by the bank is put to use. Calls for austerity have largely fallen on deaf ears. In the land famous for building bridges to nowhere, Mr. Abe pushed through an emergency stimulus package of 10 trillion yen, or $98.7 billion, and Parliament passed a further 92.6 trillion yen budget for 2013, with heavy spending on public works.
But in a happy confluence of policies, because the central bank promises to buy up the bonds that the government issues, interest rates are for now unlikely to soar out of control, while the weakening yen has created a surge in exporter profits, putting Japan in a policy sweet spot.
All eyes are now on Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank. A creative and determined central banker, he must find some unconventional way to prevent Europe from becoming stuck in the economic rut that held back Japan for most of two decades.
An interest rate cut in early May is unlikely to do much to promote the flow of credit to countries like Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain. Even with the benchmark rate at 0.5 percent, down from 0.75 percent, cheap money is not persuading banks to lend and businesses to borrow.
There is fear that Germany and other countries like Austria and Finland are about to be swallowed by the recession that has afflicted Southern Europe for more than a year and has just reached France. Unemployment in the euro zone is 12.1 percent, and in Greece and Spain more than a quarter of the work force is jobless.
The European Central Bank faces legal and political restraints that make it harder for the bank to imitate the other major central banks. It cannot finance governments, which limits its ability to buy any country's bonds. Mr. Draghi has argued that doing so in any case would not accomplish much in the euro zone because most companies get their credit from banks rather than by issuing corporate bonds.
''It is different from the United States,'' Mr. Draghi told reporters after the bank's governing council met this month in Bratislava, Slovakia.
''In the United States, 80 percent of credit intermediation goes via the capital markets,'' he said. ''In the European situation it is the other way round. Eighty percent of financial intermediation goes through the banking system. So, you are left with buying what?''
The European Central Bank is sworn to guard price stability above all else, so it is extremely cautious about any effort to inflate the currency, even as inflation in the euro zone is 1.2 percent and falling. But other central banks, operating under similar mandates, have concluded that deflation is now a greater concern.
Falling prices can freeze economic activity as buyers wait for still-lower prices, a cycle that is hard to reverse. Japan, the only major economy to fall into such a pattern in modern times, has struggled to escape for almost two decades.
Marie Diron, a former European Central Bank economist who now advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said, ''The Japan scenario is a risk.''
On his trip to Frankfurt, Mr. Bullard told an audience at Goethe University that Europe needed to act. ''The lesson of Japan is that once you get stuck, it's very hard to get out.''
''One way to get stuck,'' he said, ''would be not to take aggressive action.''

CHARTS: Three Measures of Central Banks' Effectiveness: As the financial and economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 deepened, governments relied heavily on their central banks to lift their economies. Central banks, however, possess only a few limited, but powerful, tools. And it isn't always clear whether their actions -- or lack of actions -- are even responsible for the results. But increasingly central bankers are being bolder in their attempts to get the world's major economies moving again. (Sources: Eurostat

HEADLINE: China's Central Bank Has Its Own Worries

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- While developed economies have worried whether international investors will keep showing up at their bond auctions if their central banks keep printing money, China has had a different worry.
So many speculators want to move money into China that its biggest problem has been how to keep them out.
In the United States, the European Union and Japan, central banks have struggled with hangovers from past housing bubbles, anemic or no economic growth and even deflation, in the case of Japan. In China, a possible housing bubble is still going strong. 
The central bank is keeping interest rates low partly to discourage speculators from pushing even more money into China. But low mortgage interest rates -- as little as 5.2 percent, in an economy with consumer price inflation running at 2 to 4 percent a year -- have set off further surges in home prices.
After a sharp slowdown last summer, economic growth rebounded vigorously last winter in China. But an unexpected weakening of growth in recent weeks has created a problem that the People's Bank of China, the central bank, is just starting to acknowledge.
Further monetary stimulus -- which might seem to be the answer for a slowing economy -- could drive housing prices even higher. Rising home prices are a source of tremendous anxiety across China, because very few young people can afford to buy an apartment when even an 800-square-foot unit can cost 35 times a young college graduate's first-year salary.
China's banking system has been awash with credit for years, with one result being that financing has been provided for even seemingly uneconomical projects like skyscrapers in third-tier cities or high-speed train lines to economically depressed areas. But the government's response to economic weakness in recent weeks has been to encourage the state-controlled banking system to engage in another round of heavy lending at low rates.
''It's very disappointing; this splurge in credit creation has taken off again,'' said George Magnus, a senior economic adviser to UBS. ''What you need to put this genie back in the bottle is quite a stern application of oversight and supervision.''
In its recent quarterly report on monetary policy, the People's Bank of China warned against being ''blindly optimistic'' that inflation was under control, given continued brisk growth in lending and the money supply. The central bank has allowed lending to race ahead while pursuing an unexpected approach to trying to limit inflation: letting the renminbi appreciate gradually against the dollar, which makes imports less expensive and helps them compete on price with domestic goods.
The renminbi has climbed 1.3 percent against the dollar, mostly since the start of April.
Chinese central bankers face another puzzle that their Western and Japanese counterparts have not had to worry about: mysterious mass deaths of pigs and their effect on inflation.
Video of thousands of dead pigs floating in a river near Shanghai in March temporarily made pork much less appetizing for tens of millions of Chinese. The occurrence of a new form of bird flu in the same area several weeks later turned many people away from chicken.
Because meat makes up one of the largest slices of household spending, the abrupt national experiment in something approaching vegetarianism -- beef and lamb are much less popular in China -- has sharply slowed consumer price inflation, to 2.4 percent in April.
That has made it hard for the central bank to argue that inflation is a problem. But no one knows -- not veterinarians, not the World Health Organization and certainly not the central bank -- how long livestock will continue to be infected, much less how much longer Chinese families will be put off chicken or pork.

HEADLINE: Finding Democrats to Run Where Republicans Win

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- Many Democrats in this state and beyond saw in Stephanie Herseth Sandlin an ideal candidate to help the party retain the Senate seat that Tim Johnson is giving up next year.
She gained statewide popularity winning three full terms to the House of Representatives, where she voted against President Obama's health care law, for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and against cap and trade. That is the type of Democrat who is considered able to win elections in red states.
So when Ms. Herseth Sandlin recently announced that she would not run, it not only upended Democratic plans but spurred deeper reflection over exactly what kind of candidate should represent the party -- one who adheres to the party's core principles or someone moderate, even conservative, enough to appeal to more voters?
The debate in South Dakota could set a guidepost for Democrats nationwide weighing candidates' electability versus their ideological purity. 
South Dakota is among three states where the balancing act in choosing a candidate who reflects the party's values, yet can attract enough voters to win, could be particularly important in next year's Senate elections. There, and in West Virginia and Montana, the Democratic incumbent is retiring, but in all three states, voters went resoundingly Republican in last year's presidential contest, suggesting that keeping the seat in Democratic hands will be an uphill battle.
And at the same time, the Democratic incumbents who are vying for re-election in three reliably Republican states -- Arkansas, Alaska and Louisiana -- expect difficult challenges as well.
That makes a total of six seats -- precisely the number Republicans need to retake control of the Senate.
Democrats say the split in their party between ideological activists and moderates is not nearly as pronounced as it is in the Republican Party, where some are blaming right-wing purists for the party's disappointing showing in the 2012 elections. But as Congress and state legislatures tackle core liberal issues like gun control, health care and gay rights, Democrats are starting to engage in their own soul-searching.
Several liberal groups, for instance, have said they might find candidates to challenge the Democratic senators who voted against tightening gun background-check laws.
''There's a substantial population of the electorate coast to coast that wishes the Democrats would elect candidates who are stronger on certain issues,'' said James R. Fleischmann, who has advised several red-state Democrats including Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who is retiring. ''But there's not a powerful organized strain of purists trying to correct what they perceive to be the incorrect position of the party.''
Here in South Dakota, with Ms. Herseth Sandlin opting out of the Senate race, the only declared Democratic candidate so far is Rick Weiland, a small-business owner who has said he would fight corporate interests. Mr. Weiland also favors same-sex marriage and universal background checks for guns, and he is concerned about the weakening of Social Security and Medicare.
Mr. Weiland has the support of his onetime boss, Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader (also a South Dakota Democrat), and of the party's more liberal base. But his candidacy has upset some in the Democratic establishment.
Many South Dakota Democrats are hoping for a centrist to compete in a state where the number of registered independents has increased nearly 20 percent over the past five years, while Democratic registration has dipped 7 percent.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the current majority leader, had said he would prefer that someone other than Mr. Weiland run, according to Mr. Daschle. A spokesman for Mr. Reid declined to comment.
Mr. Daschle said he believed that Mr. Weiland would be able to earn the establishment's support. ''I've been through this hundreds of times -- a candidate has to prove himself or herself before they get support of the D.S.C.C.,'' he said, referring to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington. ''I believe Rick will be able to do that.''
But Jason Frerichs, a state senator who leads the Democrats' seven-member minority caucus, said, ''We are a state that comes to the center.''
''I don't see Rick coming across as being a moderate,'' Mr. Frerichs continued, later adding, ''There isn't currently that type of clear dialogue happening on progressive versus moderate for a Democratic Party candidate. I think that dialogue needs to happen based on what we want to see the direction of this party be in our state because we certainly need to be more relevant.''
While Democrats in conservative states like South Dakota have to appeal to large populations that favor oil and gas drilling, and oppose burdensome environmental regulations, strict gun control, abortion and same-sex marriage, South Dakota liberals say their state is not as conservative as some believe.
A Democrat, after all, has held at least one of the state's two Senate seats for most of the last half-century, and it was just about a decade ago that all three members of South Dakota's Congressional delegation were Democrats, if only for a few months.
It is a state in which residents have twice voted by wide margins to repeal bans on abortion passed by the State Legislature. Voters also recently increased the cigarette tax, passed an indoor smoking ban, and killed the Republican governor's education reform bill, which would have weakened tenure for teachers and tied their ratings to student performance. And Democrats note that although South Dakota's voters approved a same-sex marriage ban, they did so by a narrower margin (3.7 percent) than California's (4.6 percent).
''I think they can respect that you're a Democrat and you have a certain perspective, just as long as you don't go full-blown Nancy Pelosi on them,'' said Matt McLarty, a Democrat active in South Dakota politics, speaking of his state's voters and referring to the liberal House Democratic leader.
Still, Republicans currently hold all but one of the 13 statewide elected offices, and if they win the next year's Senate race they could have a clean sweep for the first time in half a century. They have supermajorities in both houses of the Legislature. And Mr. Obama lost the state last year by about 18 percentage points, more than double his margin of defeat four years earlier.
In a state with just over 530,000 voters, experts say that personality plays a big role in candidates' success, and Republicans in recent years have simply put up candidates who connected with voters better.
So far, Mike Rounds, a former two-term governor, is the only Republican in the Senate race. Nationally and locally, some in the party have said they are looking for a more conservative candidate, criticizing Mr. Rounds for tax increases enacted under his watch and for what they considered bloated budgets. Mr. Rounds defended his fiscal record, saying much of the spending in his budgets was from federal dollars needed to help the state through the recession.
''Who in their right mind would ever say: 'Don't take the stimulus on principle. Cut school funding, cut Medicaid and give the money away to another state'?'' Mr. Rounds said.
Questions still linger about how strong a candidate Mr. Weiland can be, especially given that he does not have the name recognition of Mr. Rounds. Mr. Weiland ran twice for Congress and lost.
''I also believe that the whole value of fairness is one that rings true to both Democrats and Republicans,'' he said. ''I think that there are a lot of moderate Republicans that are concerned about sort of the radicalization of what's happened in their own party.''
Some local and national Democrats have said they hoped that Senator Johnson's son Brendan, the United States attorney for South Dakota, would run, but that appears unlikely.
If Mr. Weiland emerges as the Democratic candidate, it could provide a test of whether liberalism has made any dent in South Dakota's conservatism.
''Maybe times are changing and there's enough young people that get out there and vote that like somebody a little more liberal,'' said Deb Knecht, the vice chairwoman of the state's Democratic Party. ''We'll find out when we have a progressive candidate.''

HEADLINE: A Hotel Company Is Hobbled by a Deal Struck in Tough Times

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF.

 BODY:
If you are reading this column by the pool at the Delano South Beach in Miami Beach or while hanging out at the bar at St. Martins Lane Hotel in London or the Royalton in Manhattan, you may not be aware that behind the scenes of your comfortable surroundings, all is not well.
Morgans Hotel Group, the owner and manager of these three boutique hotels and others like the Mondrian in SoHo, is being crushed by a deal it cut with Ronald W. Burkle's investment firm, the Yucaipa Companies.
It all started back in October 2009. Morgans, founded by Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell of Studio 54 fame, was struggling under the weight of the financial crisis. Revenue was declining precipitously as consumers panicked and shunned luxury. 
Worried about liquidity and searching for expansion, Morgans hit upon a deal with Yucaipa. The investment firm would make a $72 million infusion in what is known as a private investment in public equity, or PIPE.
Such deals are complicated and are usually done with distressed or struggling companies. An investment firm will take a large ownership position, rescuing the company. But the price for this rescue is high. A PIPE is usually done on quite advantageous terms and includes complicated options, preferred returns and redemption features all intended to give more value to the investor.
The reason for this trade-off is that typically the company has no choice. One study of PIPEs found that without the investment, the majority of target companies would be out of cash within a year.
Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of other shareholders. This same study, of over 2,500 such deals, found that after the investment, existing shareholders receive average returns of negative 22 percent, compared with average gains of 27 percent for the PIPE investor.
It is no surprise that a knowledgeable investor like Mr. Burkle, known for buying and selling supermarket chains, negotiated great terms for his PIPE. In exchange for $72 million, Yucaipa received preferred securities and warrants to acquire as many as 12.5 million shares of Morgans Hotel. The preferred even has a ''death spiral'' feature: It starts at a dividend rate of 8 percent, but this rises to 10 percent in 2014 and 20 percent in 2016 if the preferred is not repaid.
The kicker is that Yucaipa also received the right to nominate one director and extensive control rights over Morgans. This includes veto rights over a sale of the company, acquisitions worth more than $100 million and any sale of nearly all of the company's assets.
It is unclear if Morgans' management appreciated the consequences of handing this degree of control over the company to Mr. Burkle's Yucaipa. On an investor conference call in 2009, the president of the company at that time said that Mr. Burkle's investment was ''shareholder friendly'' and provided the company with a ''great deal of flexibility to weather the remainder of the downturn.'' Shareholders may not have done so either, as they also approved part of the transaction.
Looking back at the deal, a company representative said on Tuesday: ''Morgans Hotel Group was deeply indebted and needed an equity lifeline in 2009 and the Yucaipa deal was a good solution to provide necessary equity capital. The terms of the transaction were generally consistent with the credit market environment at that time. That deal was validated by stockholders, 87 percent of which voted in favor of allowing the transaction to proceed.''
Nearly four years later, Mr. Burkle has continued to take control. Yucaipa owns 27.9 percent of Morgans, and with the company's consent he also bought $88 million of its debt, which comes due in October 2014. Yucaipa's first appointment to the board, Michael J. Gross, now runs Morgans.
But Morgans has a problem. It has mortgage debt of $180 million due in 2015 and $172 million in debt due in 2014, about half of which is held by Mr. Burkle's Yucaipa. Remember that the interest payments on the preferred rise to 20 percent in 2016.
Morgans, meanwhile, has changed its business strategy, so that it is selling hotels and focusing on managing luxury hotels under its brand. It has been a fitful transition, and the company has lost more than $200 million in the past three years.
In normal times this might create financing problems for Morgans. But we currently live in a near-zero interest rate environment, and luxury hotels are an increasingly hot commodity. If you have been to the Delano lately you can see that is the case as the 1 percent luxuriates en masse by the pool. So even though its performance is less than stellar, Morgans should be able to refinance its debt.
The problem is that Morgans' friendly deal with Mr. Burkle is looking not so welcoming to other investors.
According to people close to Morgans, the company has been told by its bankers that if it cannot eliminate the favorable terms and various forms of financing with Yucaipa, it will not be able to raise significantly new amounts of capital.
So Morgans has announced another complicated deal that it calls a deleveraging transaction. The hotel company has agreed to give Yucaipa the Delano South Beach and Morgans nightclub and food and beverage management business in exchange for cancellation of the warrants, preferred shares and debt.
As part of this transaction, Morgans announced a $100 million rights issuance amounting to more than 50 percent of its current equity, an extraordinary number of shares to issue. Yucaipa also agreed to backstop the rights offering, having the potential to raise its share ownership by a significant percentage if other shareholders did not participate.
OTK Associates, an investment vehicle run by the Olshan and Taubman real estate families that owns 13.9 percent of Morgans, has started a campaign to stop the transaction with Mr. Burkle's Yucaipa.
The investment group has sued in a Delaware court, claiming that the deleveraging transaction was unduly favorable to Yucaipa. At a hearing in April on the matter, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster halted completion of the transaction and appeared to find evidence to support OTK's allegations. The judge stated that ''there is evidence in the record to call into question things'' the directors did, implying that they may have been too close with Mr. Burkle and Yucaipa.
Now OTK, which voted for the 2009 transaction, is running a slate of seven directors to try to unseat the Morgans board at its June 14 annual meeting. The investment group's claim is that in today's environment the Burkle deal is too expensive, and the hotel company instead should be able to find a deal, something evidenced by Morgans' recently receiving a proposal to acquire the entire company.
This is a mess, and it has created a huge upheaval at the company with tens of millions being spent on lawyers and bankers.
I sympathize with the position Morgans is in. It is very difficult to find a better deal than the one with Yucaipa, given the rights that Mr. Burkle's fund already has. An analyst at MKM Partners echoed this in a note, rating the company neutral but stating that the deleveraging transaction ''has the power to be transformative.'' Still, it also appears that Morgans may not have fought as hard in the past as it probably should have.
It is clear there is a lesson here for other companies.
In 2009, Morgans needed money but was not completely out of options. Still, it took a PIPE deal with hard terms. That deal is coming back to haunt the company.
You can't blame Yucaipa for acting in its self-interest, but you can blame Morgans' management then for failing to appreciate the consequences of the PIPE investment at the time. It locked them into the arms of Yucaipa in a way that is exceedingly difficult to escape.
It's a reminder for every corporate board the next time it contemplates an investment like this, and a sobering thought for those executives and beautiful people sitting today by that Delano pool -- your investment choices years ago can linger, pushing you to even worse decisions.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Rise, Putting Country In a Buying Mood

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Victoria Shannon contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Americans are in a buying mood, thanks largely to the housing recovery.
The latest sign emerged Tuesday as the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price index posted the biggest gains in seven years. Housing prices rose in every one of the 20 cities tracked, continuing a trend that began three months ago. Similar strength has appeared in new and existing home sales and in building permits, as rising home prices are encouraging construction firms to accelerate building and hiring.
The broad-based housing improvements appear to be buoying consumer confidence and spending, countering fears earlier this year that many consumers would pull back in response to government austerity measures.
In January, the two-year-old payroll tax holiday ended, stripping about $700 from the average household's annual income, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Federal government spending cuts that started in March are also serving as a drag on economic growth, economists say. And some recent data on other parts of the economy, like manufacturing and exports, have also disappointed. 
Yet consumer confidence reached a five-year high in May, according to a Conference Board report also released on Tuesday, with big improvements in Americans' views about both the current economy and future economic conditions. Consumer spending has also been strikingly resilient so far this year, given the tax hikes.
''Five years after the start of the financial crisis in earnest, and four years and a week's time from the beginning of the economic recovery, we're finally starting to get more of a pickup,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. ''It's been a very drawn-out process, but you have to remember what we've been digging our way out of.''
The recent decline in gas prices is probably helping, as are increases in the stock market even though only about half of Americans own any equities. Perhaps most important, economists say, the growth in the value of the existing housing stock means that homeowners around the country are finally feeling richer, and that so-called wealth effect is probably making consumers loosen their purse strings a bit.
The positive impact of rising home values and the appreciating stock market is expected to offset at least a third of the fiscal tightening, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors.
The Case-Shiller 20-city composite index rose 10.9 percent over the last year, the biggest increase since April 2006. Several cities -- Charlotte, N.C.; Los Angeles; Portland, Ore.; Seattle; and Tampa, Fla. -- had their largest month-over-month gains in more than seven years.
Stock markets rose on the news, with the S.& P. 500-stock index up 10.46, or 0.63 percent, at 1,660.06 and the Dow up 106.29, or 0.69 percent, at 15,409.39 at the close on Tuesday. The Nasdaq was up 29.74, or 0.86 percent, at 3,488.89. The 10-year Treasury yield surged to 2.17 percent, its highest level in over a year.
The double-digit housing price increase is being driven by a confluence of factors.
For one, employers have added jobs for 31 straight months, so families are willing to start buying again. At the same time, the inventory of homes available on the market remains unusually low, thanks to little new building in the last few years and the large number of homeowners who are still underwater on their mortgages, making them reluctant to sell at a cash loss.
Now there are signs that higher prices are beginning to encourage some would-be sellers to come off the sidelines and place their homes on the market. That could be healthy for the market, countering concerns that housing might become overvalued again.
''You've had this dynamic that has been favorable for price increases now, but it's also favorable for supply to come back on market, so that will mean some moderation in the pace of price increases,'' said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, who said that he expected home prices to continue growing but not necessarily at the double-digit rate seen in May.
Construction has been picking up, too, in response to the rise in home prices, but builders cannot bring homes to the market as quickly as buyers want them.
''You really need new construction to get rid of the shortages, but it takes seven months between the time when they take out a permit and when the builder actually completes the home,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist with IHS Global Insight.
Also pushing up home price measures are the declines in distressed sales -- that is, foreclosures and short sales. Homes in foreclosure typically sell at bargain-basement prices, which depresses the overall price levels reported.
Now the composition of homes sold includes fewer sales at the depressed prices that bring down the overall numbers, said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays Capital. The decline in distressed sales and so-called shadow inventory (homes that are behind on mortgage payments or in foreclosure, but not yet on the market) had been pushing up prices, Mr. Gapen said, but that upward pressure will fade over time.
Finally, home prices in many areas experienced severe, unsustainable plunges during the recession. The recent increases are coming off a very low base, so the growth looks strong even if the level of prices is still well below the peaks of the housing boom in the middle of the decade.
''Some of the areas with the largest declines in house prices during the crisis have shown the strongest increases in prices more recently,'' Mr. Silver said. In Phoenix, for example, home values have risen 22.5 percent from a year earlier; Las Vegas posted a 20.6 percent gain.
Economists generally expect home prices to continue rising, particularly as the economy improves and more young people move out of their parents' homes and into homes of their own. And many dismiss concerns of a potential bubble, not only because household formation is growing but also because housing prices remain well below their highs. Even after 10 straight months of year-over-year gains, the 20-city Case-Shiller composite price index is 28 percent below its previous peak in July 2006, which is probably a good thing.
''Talk of a house price bubble seems premature,'' said Ed Stansfield, an economist at Capital Economics. ''In relation to incomes, rents or their own past, U.S. home prices still look low.''
What's more, credit is still hard to come by. The Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates down about as far as they can go, but many people who want to buy are still finding it difficult to get a home loan.
''We usually think of bubbles as being driven by extremely easy credit, with people borrowing more than the outstanding value of the house and making little to no down payment,'' said Mr. Gapen. ''That's not the case with credit standards today.''

HEADLINE: Baseball Stadium Bolsters El Paso's Resurgence

BYLINE: By MATT HUDGINS

 BODY:
EL PASO -- Staccato explosions cracked across the cloudless desert sky, to be drowned out by a deeper rumble that shook the earth as this city's 10-story former City Hall came rolling down upon its foundation in a blinding cloud of dust and debris in mid-April.
In its place, crews are already racing to build a $50 million baseball stadium for El Paso's new Triple-A minor league baseball team, which is scheduled to begin playing games there next season.
The stadium project has become the focal point of an urban revitalization effort, centered on the central business district but extending to other parts of the city. In November, El Pasoans voted nearly three to one to authorize $473 million in bond issues that will finance more than 85 public improvement projects. 
Those range from parks, pools and recreation projects to a children's museum, Hispanic cultural center and multipurpose performing arts center. The baseball stadium isn't part of the bond program, but voters approved a 2 percent increase in the city's hotel occupancy tax to help pay for its construction.
''This is more than a redevelopment plan for downtown,'' said Joyce Wilson, El Paso's city manager. ''It's really an economic and community development plan for the entire city that includes a comprehensive focus on downtown.''
Proponents of revitalization hope the many public improvements will help attract employers and better-paying jobs to a city that has been a trade corridor for hundreds of years, but has lagged many of its Texas peers in economic growth during the last three decades.
''There was a period of about 25 years when other cities around the country were reforming themselves and rebuilding their downtowns, and this community never did that,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''We're way behind the curve, but we're catching up quickly.''
Local investors have been transforming disused downtown properties into rental apartments, restaurants, bars, retail shops and office space for several years. Paul Foster, a part-owner of the new baseball franchise, has renovated several properties including the historic 12-story Anson Mills Building and the seven-story Centre Building, which he linked together as an office and retail complex. Mr. Foster is executive chairman of Western Refining Inc., a Fortune 500 oil refining and marketing company based in El Paso.
Another of those entrepreneurs is Octavio Gomez, who began opening downtown bars and restaurants here in 2005, creating what is now the Garden Entertainment District. In addition to several mixed-use projects downtown, in March he developed a 14-unit rental apartment complex in downtown's Union Plaza and had the entire property leased in two days.
''Downtown was going to happen, whether it was backed by the bonds or organically; the bonds just sped up everything,'' he said. ''Now with the big boy coming into the neighborhood, the stadium, I couldn't ask for anything better than that.''
At the site, city departments were forced to move to leased office space and the demolition of City Hall, built less than 40 years ago, ignited vocal opposition, in part because the issue was not put before the voters.
Advocates of the stadium's site selection have held up the hotel tax increase, which voters approved with a 60 percent majority last November, as evidence of community support for demolition of the building to make way for the new stadium. But the redevelopment actions have rippled through the mayoral race.
In an eight-way mayoral election on May 11, a businessman, Oscar Leeser, who opposed the demolition, took nearly half of the votes cast and will now face City Representative Steve Ortega, who was criticized for voting for it, in a runoff election on June 15.
Ms. Wilson said the council's move avoided the expense of buying a site, which could have involved negotiating with potentially unwilling sellers, or required eminent domain powers to compel a sale. The quick decision enabled the city to commit to home games by the 2014 season, a crucial provision that allowed MountainStar Sports Group, a group of local investors, to buy the Triple-A Tucson Padres franchise late last year.
Revitalizing downtown as a dining and shopping district actually began during the recession, when many Ciudad Juárez residents began patronizing the city's restaurants and clubs because of mounting violence back home in Mexico. ''My businesses were packed,'' he said. ''El Paso in general benefited from that shift.''
With violence subsiding across the border, that surge of international capital has ebbed. Yet as a city of 800,000, El Paso continues to benefit from trade with its sister city, Ciudad Juárez, which is one of Mexico's largest manufacturing centers and home to roughly 1.5 million people.
Business leaders from the combined metropolis, together with representatives from Las Cruces, N.M., about 35 miles away, recently formed the Borderplex Alliance, an organization to promote economic development in the region.
To a Borderplex Alliance member, Woody Hunt, a thriving downtown El Paso is an important piece in the regional economic puzzle. Mr. Hunt is a co-owner of the new Triple-A team and is chairman and chief executive of the Hunt Companies, a group of real estate development, asset management and property management firms in El Paso.
Mr. Hunt points to the 1950 census, when El Paso's median family income was on par with the nation and 14 percent higher than the average in Texas. By the 2000 census, he said, the local median family income had declined to 70 percent of median in the state and 65 percent of the national level. ''Clearly in that period, we lost some of our ability to compete for income; we didn't find our niche in an increasingly global economy, where we could attract and retain people with skills to command high incomes.''
The El Paso region has several universities, including the University of Texas at El Paso, the El Paso campus of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juárez medical school just a few blocks south of the international border, and New Mexico State University's main campus in Las Cruces, N.M.
Although those institutions prepare thousands of students each year for high-end jobs, many graduates in recent decades have left the region to pursue their careers.
Proponents of El Paso's downtown revitalization contend that a 24-hour urban core -- one that offers places to live, work, eat, drink, shop and play -- will make the entire region more enjoyable, and therefore more appealing to the health care, technology, manufacturing and other employers and the skilled workers that community leaders want to bring here.
Drawing Fortune 500 companies downtown is a priority, according to William Sanders, chairman of Strategic Growth Bank. Mr. Sanders is a trustee of Borderplex Community Trust, a privately held real estate investment trust (REIT) that has acquired several downtown properties here. ''There is no successful American city that doesn't have a downtown that is the key focal point and driver of energy,'' he said.
An El Paso native, Mr. Sanders founded the real estate firm LaSalle Partners, which later merged into what is now the global real estate services provider Jones Lang LaSalle. He draws a parallel between El Paso's economic trajectory and the growth of central business districts as employment hubs in Chicago and other large metropolitan centers.
''We're in the very early stages of the same thing taking place in El Paso,'' he said, ''and what's going on downtown will play a key role in that happening.''

HEADLINE: Interleague? Fans Shrug In Down Year for Baseball

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Even during other down years, the Mets were guaranteed of at least one thing: selling out their home games against the Yankees. Since the advent of interleague play in 1997, these games determined temporary bragging rights within New York City and had an edge to them that put fans in every seat.
Not so anymore. On Monday, in the first Yankees-Mets game of the 2013 season, the Mets drew an announced crowd of 32,911, about 8,000 seats short of a sellout, and the smallest gathering ever for the more than 90 interleague contests between the two clubs. 
The Mets' slow start to 2013, in what is shaping up to be a fifth straight losing season, has not helped sell tickets. But neither has the realignment of the two leagues, which has led to interleague games every day of the season, reducing their novelty. The number of so-called rivalry games between geographical opponents like the Mets and the Yankees, the Chicago Cubs and the White Sox, and the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Angels, has also been reduced to four from six and moved to weekdays from weekends, when it is easier to fill the ballpark.
The result is that the types of interleague games that often sold out in the past are just not as hot a ticket at the moment, which is one reason baseball attendance over all is down about 2.6 percent this season. The White Sox drew only 30,000 fans to their game against the Cubs on Monday, while fewer than 35,000 fans saw the Royals-St. Louis Cardinals matchup in Kansas City.
And the ticket prices for the more significant interleague games are dropping, too. The price of a ticket to see the two Yankees-Mets games at Citi Field this season has plummeted 46 percent in comparison to last year, according to TiqIQ, which tracks online ticket resellers. Ticket prices to see the Mets play at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday and Thursday were down by 19 percent from a year ago, as of Tuesday.
''It definitely feels different this year given the everyday nature of interleague play,'' said Jesse Lawrence, the chief executive of TiqIQ.
Diluted interleague play is not the only reason that nearly 600,000 fewer fans had shown up at major league parks this season, through Monday's games. The weather from Denver to Boston has been particularly uninviting, leading to 23 games being postponed, or two more than all of last season.
''We've played a lot of games in weather that was really bad,'' Commissioner Bud Selig told reporters two weeks ago as he talked about the attendance drop. Thus, he added, he was not ''overly concerned'' by the negative figures.
Overall attendance was also hurt because teams like the Cubs, the Yankees, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Boston Red Sox, who regularly post strong ticket sales, entered the season with weakened rosters and, in the Yankees' case, injuries to stars like Derek Jeter. Indeed, all four teams have seen substantial declines in attendance, with Boston's major-league-record sellout streak of 794 games ending almost as soon as the season began.
Through Monday, the Cubs, the Phillies and the Red Sox had all had attendance drops of more than 100,000 fans, according to BaseballReference.com.
''If it were the Pirates and Kansas City, the impact wouldn't be as dramatic,'' said Vince Gennaro, the author of ''Diamond Dollars: The Economics of Winning in Baseball,'' and a consultant to several major league teams. ''But by coincidence, the biggest-drawing, biggest-market teams came into the year with relatively low expectations.''
Then there are the Miami Marlins, who are drawing nearly 40 percent fewer fans this season, a drop of nearly 275,000 that accounts for nearly half the decline in attendance over all. The team traded away nearly all of its top players a year after spending freely on free agents, thus eroding the novelty of its year-old ballpark.
Selig often notes that baseball's nine best years in attendance have occurred during the past nine seasons, although within that time frame attendance has dipped and risen. In 2012, it was up 1.8 percent; the last decrease was in 2010, a drop of 0.6 percent.
So far this season, 18 out of 30 teams have seen a decline in attendance. The Mets are among them, drawing 0.6 percent fewer fans per game. More surprising is that the Yankees are down nearly 8 percent, despite playing an overachieving brand of baseball with a patched-together lineup.
Still, the Yankees expect to draw near-sellout crowds Wednesday and Thursday, when the series with the Mets moves to the Bronx. And then the Red Sox arrive for the weekend, which will also bolster Yankee attendance, and baseball's overall figures.
''I don't think anyone has found the Kryptonite for baseball,'' said Andy Dolich, who ran the business operations of the Oakland A's for more than a decade. ''Whether it's women, booze, grass, H.G.H., fan stupidity, the game itself always seem to conquer those.''

HEADLINE: Make Peace With Meat

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN

 BODY:
I probably eat a third as much meat as I used to and, on the not-rare (three times a week?) occasions that I do indulge, I eat less of it.
I'm reminded of a really good plate of slow-roasted lamb shoulder I had in Seattle two weeks ago; there were about six ounces on the plate, and I ate half. It was delicious, and it was enough. This is no longer a conscious thing but a new habit.
The new habits, I suppose, come from new attitudes. The vast majority of Americans still eat meat at least some of the time. Statistically, most of us eat it in unwise, unsustainable and unhealthful quantities.
I'm betting that you eat meat more consciously (and less of it) than you once did. The health, environmental and ethical concerns affect the attitudes of almost everyone I encounter, and although our priorities differ, few people I know indiscriminately fill their supermarket carts with shrink-wrapped meat and leave. Not long ago, almost all of us did that. 
It was never easy to judge meat quality, and that remains the case. The Agriculture Department grades meat by fat content, ''select'' being the leanest and ''prime'' the fattiest. This is not an adequate system for those of us who consider other things when we buy meat, including at least some assurance that the animal was treated humanely. (There are also the issues of aging -- with beef at least -- and the animal's breed, but I'm not getting into that here.)
''Humanely'' means different things to different people. Veal consumption plummeted in the '80s when confinement turned people off, and as a result crates are set to be phased out by 2017, producers say. But veal can be as natural a part of legitimate agriculture as any other animal. If you consume dairy, you support veal production.
When it comes to beef, pork and lamb, some people insist that meat come from animals raised on small farms, individually tended; others are interested only that the animals are not raised in confinement or routinely fed antibiotics. Feed is also an issue, because cows evolved to eat grass, not grain.
Many of us consider all of those factors when shopping. Sadly, claims like these are not ironclad and difficult to vet. But they're still better than buying commodity or branded meat from the country's biggest producers, which is almost assuredly from animals that have been subjected to confinement, prophylactic drug therapy and assembly-line processing.
I feel best when buying from a farmer or farmer's representative I know, or think I know. But even assuming this is possible, it has what at first appears to be a decided drawback: cost. It's difficult to nail down averages, but if commodity meat -- I'm talking about red meat here, but most of what follows could be argued about almost any product -- costs something under $10 a pound in most cases, and national brands from humanely treated animals like that from Niman Ranch or Coleman Natural cost maybe twice as much, meat from local farmers costs considerably more. It's not uncommon to spend $25 or more a pound on beef from a trustworthy source.
The immediate response that we as consumers have to this is ''ouch.'' Counterintuitive as it may seem, this is good for everyone.
Relatively large-scale sustainable and ''natural'' or ''organic'' or ''humane'' farmers might raise 500 pigs in a year-- they are not getting rich. We want these farmers to earn a living; they are stewarding the land in a manner we appreciate and they are providing us with the kind of food we want to eat; they are not using antibiotics routinely or torturing animals. Nor are they likely to be receiving, directly or indirectly, federal subsidies. And they are providing us with meat that tastes better.
All of which may not make up for spending $30 instead of $15. But there are other reasons you can live with these higher prices. It's widely accepted that large quantities of red meat may be problematic, health-wise, and we know that many people have made it a goal to eat less meat because large-scale industrial production is damaging to the environment. This is to a great extent what flexitarianism is about, after all.
Here's a way to think about it: The price of food in general is what economists call ''inelastic'' -- you're going to eat something no matter the cost. But the price of any particular food like meat is elastic -- you will buy less as it becomes more expensive. Though it may at first seem paradoxical, this is a good thing from nearly every perspective.
I am saying this: Spend the same $30, or $50 or $100 or $300 on meat that you now spend each week or month, but buy less and buy better. You might compare this to an annual purchase of 20 $5 T-shirts made by child labor versus one of five $20 T-shirts made by better-paid and better-treated workers from organic cotton. Expensive meat from real farms is a more extreme example of this less-is-better policy.
Then cook meat differently. I could offer hundreds of recipes for dishes that take advantage of this kind of cooking. Here are three, which are among my current favorites, using different meats, cooking techniques and vegetables.
The first is a vague interpretation of fajitas that focuses on grilled vegetables and makes beef a supporting player. A pound or so of tender, fatty rib-eye or sirloin goes a long way here. And it makes a lovely impression if you present it whole before slicing or chopping. You can cook everything in a cast-iron skillet (you will most likely need more than one, or you will have to cook in batches) instead of on a grill.
The second is a new-age version of a veggie burger (as in half and half, not a burger made from vegetables and grain), which you might also think of as a stuffed mushroom. It's terrific, hearty, unusual and really cool: a portobello filled with sausage meat and grilled. In this instance, a broiler will work, as will a skillet.
Finally, there is an Asian-style veal stew. Despite the name, it's a fairly quick dish to prepare, combining simple technique with decidedly unexpected flavors and doing so with plenty of vegetables. Finding good veal is perhaps the most difficult challenge, although tender beef, like tenderloin or pork from the shoulder, also works well.
These are good recipes. With really good meat (and less of it), they're even better. That's a change in attitude.
Recipe: Grilled Steak and Vegetables with Flour Tortillas
2 ears of corn, shucked
1 avocado, halved and pitted
8 radishes, trimmed
1 fairly firm mango, peeled and halved
4 limes, halved
1 large zucchini, sliced lengthwise
2 large bell peppers or poblanos, cored and halved
1 bunch scallions, trimmed
1 head romaine lettuce, outer leaves removed, but left whole
Olive oil
Salt and ground black pepper
1 to 1 1/4 pounds rib-eye or strip steak (about an inch thick)
8 to 12 small flour tortillas
1. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct cooking; the heat should be high on one side and medium on the other, with the rack about 4 inches from the flame. Have 2 platters handy; one so you can remove the vegetables as they begin to char, and another smaller one for the steak. Get a towel or foil ready for wrapping the tortillas.
2. Once you have the vegetables prepped, toss or rub them all with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. (You will grill even the limes for squeezing on top of everything else.) Blot the steak dry with paper towels and set aside.
3. On the hottest part of the grill, put the corn, avocado, radishes, mango and limes and char lightly, turning as necessary, for no more than 5 minutes. Start the zucchini, peppers, scallions and lettuce on the cooler side; they should be cooked until just tender and browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to the platter as they finish cooking.
4. Season the steak with salt and pepper. Score the outer fat, if necessary. If using charcoal, consolidate the coals so that the heat is high again. Put the steak on the hot grill; cook, leaving it alone until the bottom is nicely charred and the steak releases easily, 2 to 4 minutes. Turn and cook for another 3 minutes, more or less, for medium-rare.
5. Remove steak from the grill and let it rest for at least 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the tortillas on the grill, turning once or twice until lightly charred and stack in a towel or foil, wrapping loosely. Prepare the vegetables for serving: Strip the corn kernels off the cob and scoop out and slice the avocado; the rest of the vegetables you can chop or slice however you like, keeping in mind that you'll be putting them in tortillas.
6. Slice the steak crosswise, sprinkle with more salt and pepper if you like and return to the platter. Serve the steak and vegetables with the tortillas.
Yield: 4 servings
Recipe: Pork and Portobello Burgers
1 pound ground pork
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary, fennel seed or parsley
Salt and ground black pepper
4 large portobello mushroom caps, stems removed
Olive oil
4 burger buns
Any burger fixings you like
1. Prepare a grill; the heat should be medium-high and the rack about 4 inches from the heat.
2. Combine the ground pork, garlic, rosemary and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Use a spoon to lightly scrape away the gills of the mushrooms and hollow them slightly. Drizzle the mushrooms (inside and out) with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Press 1/4 of the mixture into each of the hollow sides of the mushrooms; you want the meat to spread all the way across the width of the mushrooms. They should look like burgers.
3. Grill the burgers, meat side down, until the pork is well browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip and cook until the top side of the mushrooms are browned and the mushrooms are tender, another 6 to 8 minutes. If you like, use an instant-read thermometer to check the interior temperature of the pork, which should be a minimum of 145 degrees.
4. Serve the burgers on buns (toasted, if you like) with any fixings you like.
Yield: 4 servings
Recipe: Chinese-Style Vegetable and Veal Stew
2 tablespoons peanut oil
1 pound veal stew meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch chunks
Salt and ground black pepper
2 medium onions, chopped
4 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch chunks
12 radishes (about 8 ounces)
3 tablespoons minced garlic
3 tablespoons minced ginger
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 cups white wine, stock or water
1 pound bok choy or baby bok choy (leaves and stems)
12 ounces snow peas, trimmed
Dark sesame oil, for drizzling
Chopped fresh cilantro for garnish
1. Put oil in large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add veal and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, turning as necessary, until well browned on all sides. Transfer veal to plate and set aside.
2. Add onions, carrots and radishes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook for another minute. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Add soy sauce and wine, stock or water. Bring to a boil, return veal to pot and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring once or twice, until veal is tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
4. Stir in the bok choy, cover and cook until the leaves are wilted but stems still have some crunch, about 5 minutes.
5. Stir in snow peas and simmer until they turn bright green, about 3 minutes. Garnish with cilantro, drizzle with sesame oil and serve.
Yield: 4 servings

HEADLINE: How to Get A Job

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Underneath the huge drop in demand that drove unemployment up to 9 percent during the recession, there's been an important shift in the education-to-work model in America. Anyone who's been looking for a job knows what I mean. It is best summed up by the mantra from the Harvard education expert Tony Wagner that the world doesn't care anymore what you know; all it cares ''is what you can do with what you know.'' And since jobs are evolving so quickly, with so many new tools, a bachelor's degree is no longer considered an adequate proxy by employers for your ability to do a particular job -- and, therefore, be hired. So, more employers are designing their own tests to measure applicants' skills. And they increasingly don't care how those skills were acquired: home schooling, an online university, a massive open online course, or Yale. They just want to know one thing: Can you add value? 
One of the best ways to understand the changing labor market is to talk to the co-founders of HireArt (www.hireart.com): Eleonora Sharef, 27, a veteran of McKinsey; and Nick Sedlet, 28, a math whiz who left Goldman Sachs. Their start-up was designed to bridge the divide between job-seekers and job-creators.
''The market is broken on both sides,'' explained Sharef. ''Many applicants don't have the skills that employers are seeking, and don't know how to get them. But employers also ... have unrealistic expectations.'' They're all ''looking for purple unicorns: the perfect match. They don't want to train you, and they expect you to be overqualified.'' In the new economy, ''you have to prove yourself, and we're an avenue for candidates to do that,'' said Sharef. ''A degree document is no longer a proxy for the competency employers need.'' Too many of the ''skills you need in the workplace today are not being taught by colleges.''
The way HireArt works, explained Sharef (who was my daughter's college roommate), is that clients -- from big companies, like Cisco, Safeway and Airbnb, to small family firms -- come with a job description and then HireArt designs online written and video tests relevant for that job. Then HireArt culls through the results and offers up the most promising applicants to the company, which chooses among them.
With 50,000 registered job-seekers on HireArt's platform, the company receives about 500 applicants per job opening, said Sharef, adding: ''While it's great that the Internet allows people to apply to lots of jobs, it has led to some very unhealthy behavior. Job-seekers tell me that they apply to as many as 500 jobs in four to five months without doing almost any research. One candidate told me he had written a computer program that allowed him to auto-apply to every single job on Craigslist in a certain city. Given that candidates don't self-select, recruiters think of résumés as 'mostly spam,' and their approach is to 'wade through the mess' to find the treasures. Of these, only one person gets hired -- one out of 500 -- so the 'success rate' is very low for us and for our candidates.''
How are people tested? HireArt asks candidates to do tasks that mimic the work they would do on the job. If it is for a Web analytics job, HireArt might ask: ''You are hired as the marketing manager at an e-commerce company and asked to set up a Web site analytics system. What are the key performance indicators you would measure? How would you measure them?''
Or, if you want to be a social media manager, said Sharef, ''you will have to demonstrate familiarity with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Google+, HTML, On-Page SEO and Key Word Analysis.'' Sample question: ''Kanye West just released a new fashion collection. You can see it here. Imagine you had to write a tweet promoting this collection. What would your tweet be?'' Someone applying for a sales job would have to record a sales pitch over video.
Added Sharef: ''What surprises me most about people's skills is how poor their writing and grammar are, even for college graduates. If we can't get the basics right, there is a real problem.'' Still, she adds, HireArt sees many talented people who are just ''confused about what jobs they are qualified for, what jobs are out there and where they fit in.''
So what does she advise? Sharef pointed to one applicant, a Detroit woman who had worked as a cashier at Borders. She realized that that had no future, so she taught herself Excel. ''We gave her a very rigorous test, and she outscored people who had gone to Stanford and Harvard. She ended up as a top applicant for a job that, on paper, she was completely unqualified for.''
People get rejected for jobs for two main reasons, said Sharef. One, ''you're not showing the employer how you will help them add value,'' and, two, ''you don't know what you want, and it comes through because you have not learned the skills that are needed.'' The most successful job candidates, she added, are ''inventors and solution-finders,'' who are relentlessly ''entrepreneurial'' because they understand that many employers today don't care about your résumé, degree or how you got your knowledge, but only what you can do and what you can continuously reinvent yourself to do.

HEADLINE: Obama to Name New Leader Of Economic Advisers Council

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House is expected to name Jason Furman, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, as the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to comment on the record.
Mr. Furman is one of the last holdovers from the original Obama administration economic team that managed the financial crisis and deep recession. His nomination, which the Senate must confirm, might signal a more powerful role for a body that has in the last few years proven less central than the National Economic Council and the Treasury Department. 
Mr. Furman, who has a doctorate in economics from Harvard, has a long history in Washington. He served as an economist in the Clinton administration, spent time at the World Bank and has advised several Democrats, including current Secretary of State John Kerry during his presidential campaign. Before joining the Obama campaign, he worked at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Hamilton Project, a research group developed by former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin.
In the Obama White House, Mr. Furman was central in the construction of the stimulus bill, pushing for provisions to aid low-income families, former colleagues said. Since then, he has been instrumental in devising a range of the president's proposals, including budgets and the tax deal passed this winter.
Traditionally, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers has been an academic economist, tasked with giving unvarnished economic advice to the president. Currently, Alan B. Krueger, a lauded labor economist who also served in Mr. Obama's Treasury Department, holds the post, where he has focused in part on the issue of inequality.
Mr. Krueger will return later this year to Princeton University, where he is a tenured professor who has published influential works on topics including education and the minimum wage.
''Over the past two years, Alan has been one of my most trusted advisers on economic policy and a great friend,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement. ''Alan was the driving force behind many of the economic policies that I have proposed that will grow our economy and create middle-class jobs. He's devoted his entire career to making sure our economy works for everyone, not just those at the very top.''
Colleagues said that Mr. Furman has the analytical stature and credentials for the position. ''Jason has spent his career mostly working in economic policy, rather than academic settings,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary. ''It would be easy to conclude from that that he was not a rigorous academic economic thinker. That would be badly wrong. He's one of the smartest, clearest thinking, most data-oriented economists I know.''
N. Gregory Mankiw, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers during the George W. Bush administration, also showed enthusiasm for the appointment, writing on his blog that Mr. Furman is ''smart, knowledgeable and sensible.'' He added: ''He does not come to the job with as long an academic track record as other recent picks, but he has far more policy-relevant experience and expertise.''
When Mr. Furman first took a job with the Obama administration, he received some criticism from the left. Some liberals questioned his ties to Mr. Rubin, a centrist. Labor leaders denounced him for a 2005 paper calling Walmart a ''progressive success story.'' Mr. Furman argued that poorer families benefited disproportionately from the chain's low prices. ''Even if you grant that Walmart hurts workers in the retail sector -- and the evidence for this is far from clear -- the magnitude of any potential harm is small in comparison,'' he wrote.
The Obama economic team -- having come through a bruising two years of budget battles with Congress -- remains at work on issues like education, deficits and reforming the tax code, as well as policies designed to help support the sluggish if strengthening recovery.
Mr. Furman's appointment would continue the administration's habit of shuffling around well-known faces more often than bringing in new blood. Mr. Obama has recently named longtime aide Michael Froman as the United States Trade Representative, for instance, and his former chief of staff Jacob J. Lew as Treasury secretary.

HEADLINE: In Jaguar, Emblem of a Broader Revival in Britain

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
SOLIHULL, England -- It was a crucial day for Demos Hoursoglou. The manager of the aluminum body shop at Jaguar Land Rover's manufacturing complex in this suburb of Birmingham, England, was about to give the go-ahead to plug a brand new model -- the Range Rover Sport -- into the assembly line. It would be the latest type of top-of-the-line Range Rover to receive an aluminum body since this factory went into operation last September.
Striding on a catwalk above the shop floor, Mr. Hoursoglou pointed out the cutting-edge elements of his highly automated shop, which represents a big chunk of the company's recent investment of £370 million, or about $560 million, at the 300-acre, or 120-hectare, site. The line, on which robots do most of the routine work, is unusual in the automotive world in being able to switch from model to model, and to different specifications like right-hand or left-hand drive, without missing a beat or causing any increases in operating cost.
''This company invests,'' Mr. Hoursoglou said, explaining why he joined Jaguar Land Rover from Honda last year. Tata Motors ''saw something in JLR that no one else did,'' he said. ''The results justify the decision.'' 
It was Tata Motors, part of the giant Indian conglomerate Tata Group, that saved the iconic Jaguar and Land Rover brands from an uncertain future by buying them from Ford Motor for $2.3 billion in 2008. On Wednesday, when Tata Motors is set to announce its results for the financial year that ended in March, investors will be watching to see if the rejuvenated Jaguar Land Rover unit continues to prop up its parent, whose core Indian business has recently sustained declining earnings and revenue.
Since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, Jaguar Land Rover's output under Tata has nearly doubled, to about 357,000 vehicles last year. It is just one of several car companies, including Nissan and General Motors, whose output is growing in Britain, even as vehicle production is declining in European countries like Spain, France, and Italy and auto sales on the Continent have fallen to levels not seen since the mid-1990s.
The recipe for this British revival has been largely the same from company to company: foreign ownership, which brings new ideas and much-needed capital. And along with much of Britain's other automotive output, more than 80 percent of Jaguar Land Rover's vehicles are exported, with the United States and China the leading destinations.
Since emerging from the financial crisis, Jaguar Land Rover has been pouring money -- £2 billion to £3 billion a year -- into new models, new plants and new technology with the encouragement of Tata Group's former chairman, Ratan Tata, and his successor, Cyrus P. Mistry, who is also chairman of the Jaguar Land Rover board.
''For many years these brands were labeled as having a lot of potential; but for many years they failed to live up to that,'' said Peter Wells, co-director of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University. ''These brands really required significant investment to bring the product ranges and manufacturing up to speed,'' he said. ''Under Tata we have seen that kind of investment.''
It helps, of course, that Tata Motors has deep pockets, by virtue not only of its strong position in the Indian car market, but by dint of being owned by Tata Group, whose holdings include power, steel, beverages and hotels. The group generated about $100 billion in revenue last year.
And Britain, for its part, has been willing to streamline its auto industry in ways that other West European countries continue to resist, through steps like closing plants and cutting workers. ''We went through processes here a few years earlier than anywhere else,'' Mr. Wells said, noting the collapse of the British carmaker MG Rover in 2005. ''France, Spain, and Italy have not been through that yet.''
Companies like Tata that are willing to build on the rubble of the British industry gain access to Britain's design and engineering talents. Jaguar Land Rover is spreading investment across its operations, which are mostly in the central part of England, known as the Midlands.
About two years ago it brought out a mid-price sport utility vehicle called the Range Rover Evoque, the company's first model to top the sales threshold of 100,000 vehicles a year. To replace the Ford engines it currently puts under its hoods, Jaguar Land Rover is spending £500 million on a new engine plant in Wolverhampton that is scheduled to start operating in 2015.
Meanwhile, drawing on its heritage of classic cars like the Jaguar XKE, the company is rolling out a two-seater sports car -- the F-type -- for the first time in almost 40 years.
At the time of the Tata takeover, Jaguar Land Rover employed about 14,500. Since then it has hired about 9,000 people, half of them engineers and designers, and most of them in Britain. Of the company's overall work force now, only about 1,000 or so work outside the United Kingdom.
Working for the Tatas, with their long-term view, is ''very different'' from working at a Western auto company, said Mike Wright, a longtime Jaguar Land Rover executive, who is currently executive director. ''In the Western world there is a lot more focus on quarterly results.''
At Solihull, construction workers are putting up the shell of a big new building at the site, which was home to a former World War II aircraft and tank engine plant where the first Land Rover was made from surplus aluminum in 1948. Executives are cagey about the new building's purpose, but analysts guess that it might be intended for aluminum bodies for other models now built on conventional steel frames, like the Discovery.
Ralf Speth, a former BMW executive who became Jaguar Land Rover's chief in 2010, argues that a shift to aluminum, which can reduce a vehicle's weight about 40 percent, is necessary for raising fuel efficiency and cutting carbon dioxide emissions, while matching or beating competitors like Mercedes and BMW, which are making growing use of aluminum and some carbon-fiber parts to cut weight and improve fuel efficiency.
Jaguar Land Rover is betting that even as its customers want to be able to feel they are doing their part to reduce carbon emissions, they still want the acceleration that an internal combustion engine can deliver.
''At the moment I'm not a big fan of electric,'' Mr. Speth said in an interview at the Paris Motor Show last year. ''We will be focusing on internal combustion,'' he said. But he noted that the company was also working on ''alternative systems,'' like the hybrid-diesel Range Rover due this year.
So far, the investments are paying off. Tata got a nasty surprise in its first year as Jaguar Land Rover's owner when the financial crisis played a role in a sales collapse, particularly for Land Rovers. Tata's new unit posted a loss of £375 million for the 2008-9 financial year.
Since then, the company's performance has improved sharply. Profit after taxes reached £837 million on sales of £10.7 billion for the nine months ending in December 2012.
Jaguar Land Rover's sales and profits, though, still lag far behind those of its main European rivals. BMW had a net profit of &#x20ac;5.1 billion, or $6.4 billion, last year and sold 1.85 million cars, while Daimler's Mercedes-Benz unit reported a pretax profit of &#x20ac;4.4 billion on sales of 1.45 million passenger cars.
The question is whether Jaguar Land Rover can build further on its turnaround. One of the company's next big moves will be making cars in China, where it plans to invest £500 million in a plant, and starting production in India, where it is already assembling Jaguars and S.U.V.'s from kits. While those are big potential markets, there is a risk of muddying the company's made-in-Britain image.
And Jaguar Land Rover also is up against deep-pocketed competitors, especially the German carmakers, who have their own S.U.V. entries as well as formidable sedans to challenge Jaguar's. That means it will have to spend big money to compete. But analysts say the pressure is helping to motivate the company.
Jaguar Land Rover ''is pretty well at the cutting edge of technology in every area,'' said Lord Kumar Bhattacharyya, whose Warwick Manufacturing Group, an industrial research unit at the University of Warwick, works closely with the company. ''That is the only way they can survive in a niche market where they are competing with BMW and Mercedes.''
At the body shop, Mr. Hoursoglou is well aware of the need to gain an edge wherever the company can. His aluminum cars, he claims, grinning, are ''kilograms lighter'' than the S.U.V.'s made by his German rivals.

HEADLINE: Anti-West Hard-Liner Gains in Iranian Race

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- At his first presidential campaign rally, Saeed Jalili on Friday welcomed the cheers of thousands of young men as he hauled himself onto the stage. His movements were hampered by a prosthetic leg, a badge of honor from his days as a young Revolutionary Guards member in Iran's great trench war with Iraq.
''Welcome, living martyr, Jalili,'' the audience shouted in unison, most of them too young to have witnessed the bloody conflict themselves but deeply immersed in the national veneration of its veterans. Waving flags belonging to ''the resistance'' -- the military cooperation among Iran, Syria, the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah and some Palestinian groups -- the crowd roared the candidate's election slogan: ''No compromise. No submission. Only Jalili.''
Mr. Jalili, known as Iran's unyielding nuclear negotiator and a protégé of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is emerging as the presumed front-runner in Iran's presidential election on June 14, an unsettling prospect for future relations with the West. Mr. Jalili, 47, who many analysts say has long been groomed for a top position in Iran, is by far the most outspoken hard-liner among the eight candidates approved to participate in the election. 
Opposing ''détente a hundred percent'' and promising no compromise ''whatsoever'' with the West over matters like Iran's nuclear program and involvement in Syria, Mr. Jalili seems set to further escalate Iran's standoff with the United States and its allies if elected president.
''He seems to be Ahmadinejad Phase 2,'' said Rasool Nafisi, an Iran expert based in Virginia, referring to Iran's current president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ''He would probably not be a partner to negotiate for the nuclear issues, as we have seen before when he was heading the delegations.''
An analyst based in Iran, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, said Mr. Jalili was ''the perfect follower of Khamenei.''
''If he gets elected I foresee even more isolation and conflict, as he doesn't care about foreign relations, the economy or anything,'' the analyst said.
In recent weeks, Mr. Jalili has garnered the open support of Iran's governing establishment, a coalition of conservative clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders known as the traditionalists. High-ranking Shiite Muslim clerics have begun speaking out in his favor, and a nationwide network of paramilitary volunteers, the basij, is now helping to organize his election campaign.
He has been featured in flattering terms in recent weeks in the semiofficial Fars news agency, which is connected to the Revolutionary Guards, as well as in dozens of Web sites and other news outlets. By contrast, the other candidates now sometimes discover their campaign appearances canceled for unclear reasons and often find themselves under sharp attack in interviews on state TV, while Mr. Jalili gets softball questions.
''He'll easily get 30 percent of the vote,'' said Amir Mohebbian, an analyst close to Iran's leaders, pointing to the well-organized groups supporting Mr. Jalili. ''The remainder will be divided between the other candidates.''
That would lead to a runoff election that Mr. Jalili would be heavily favored to win, since under Iranian law the president must receive at least half of the vote.
Iran's presidential elections, lacking independent opinion polls and subject to manipulation, are notoriously unpredictable. In 2005, Mr. Ahmadinejad came out of nowhere to win. In 2009, millions of people took to the streets to protest what they said was widespread fraud in the voting that returned Mr. Ahmadinejad to office over the more popular opposition candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi.
But the major threats to Mr. Jalili's candidacy were apparently eliminated when the representatives of two influential political factions, one led by Mr. Ahmadinejad and the other by a former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, were disqualified from the election by the conservative-dominated Guardian Council. That decision underscored not just the determination of the traditionalists to consolidate power, but their ability to ensure the result.
In a recent opinion article, Mr. Mohebbian said that while Mr. Jalili's relative inexperience in domestic politics might make him appear as an outsider, the support of Iran's governing establishment made it likely that ''the conditions of the day will create an atmosphere which will put Mr. Jalili in a leadership position.''
While Ayatollah Khamenei is officially neutral, Mr. Jalili's speeches and viewpoints closely resemble the leader's worldview of an Iran engaged in a multifaceted battle with the West.
''The best president,'' Mr. Khamenei said on Monday, speaking to students at a military academy, ''is the one who powerfully resists the enemy and will turn the Islamic republic into an international example for the oppressed people of the world.''
Mr. Jalili, who sports a gray beard and prefers collarless shirts, headed Ayatollah Khamenei's office for four years, starting in 2001, before emerging in recent years as the chief nuclear negotiator. But little is known about his views on other issues.
''Mr. Jalili is like a watermelon,'' said Mohammad Khoshchehreh, an economist and professor at Tehran University. ''He looks ripe on the outside, but we don't know what color he is inside.''
Partly because of Western sanctions, Iran's economy is reeling from high inflation and a battered currency, but Mr. Jalili has addressed the problems only obliquely. During a televised interview on Sunday he said that Iran should cut its dependency on oil revenues and establish a ''resistance economy in order to foil the conspiracies against Iran.''
Such talk has left economists baffled. ''His theory of resistance economy doesn't mean anything,'' Mr. Khoshchehreh said. ''If it is based on looking at our weak points, that can be good, but we have no idea if he has a deep knowledge. We are worried about him.''
On Friday, during the campaign event in Tehran, Mr. Jalili chose to explain his policies by citing the first imam of the Shiites, the martyr Ali.
''All across the region we can hear our battle cry, 'Ya Ali,' '' said Mr. Jalili, who wrote a dissertation on the Prophet Muhammad's foreign policy. ''We heard it in Lebanon with the victory of Hezbollah. We hear it in our resistance against the Zionist regime. Time and time again we have proved our strength through this slogan.''
As songs played memorializing the battles in the border town of Shalamcheh during the Iran-Iraq war, men punched their fists in the air and shouted, ''The blood in our veins belongs to our leader.''
The goal of Iran and its allies, Mr. Jalili said, is to ''uproot capitalism, Zionism and Communism, and promote the discourse of pure Islam in the world.''
He did not directly mention the Western sanctions that were imposed over the country's nuclear program -- which Iran insists is for peaceful purposes but the West says is a cover for developing nuclear weapons -- or the possibility that they will be tightened in response to Tehran's intransigence. Nor did he speak about the potential for deeper involvement in the Syrian civil war, where Tehran's proxy, Hezbollah, has recently intervened in support of the Syrian government.
If his supporters harbored worries over what these policies might mean for the Iranian economy, they kept them to themselves. ''We are fighting an ideological war -- nobody cares about the economy,'' said Amir Qoroqchi, 25, a smiling electrical engineering student from the holy city of Qum. ''The only thing that matters is resistance.''
For decades, Iran's presidents have staked out an alternative power center, frequently in conflict with the supreme leader and the more conservative elements in the government. With the rise of Mr. Jalili and the apparent elimination of serious opposition candidates, those on the losing end of Iran's political spectrum fear a developing imbalance.
The republican and authoritarian religious parts of the government ''have been in conflict from Day 1,'' Mr. Nafisi, the Iran expert, said.

HEADLINE: Onstage Tasting Menu In a Feast of One-Acts

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
It's spring, which means it's time for the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual marathon of one-act plays, now in its 34th year. Series A (the first of three), which features five short works, starts out weak but finishes strong.
It opens with a new piece by the most famous playwright on the roster, John Patrick Shanley, author of ''Doubt'' and winner of the Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award for best play. In his ''Poison,'' a young woman (the appropriately maniacal Alicia Goranson) consults a fortuneteller about whether her former boyfriend will ever return to her; on hearing an answer she doesn't like, she demands a potion to achieve the result she wants. A few lines of dialogue bring laughs, but Mr. Shanley's concept ends up feeling gimmicky, with characters who are more caricatures than real. 
''Kandahar to Canada,'' by Dan O'Brien and based on a true story, also disappoints. It is 2012, and the Canadian photojournalist Paul Watson escorts a burqa-wearing Afghan teenager, Roya Shams, to Ottawa to study. This play pairs mirrored encounters with the law: one with an officer who stops them on their way out of Kandahar, and another with an official at the Toronto airport. Roya (Lily Balsen) is a relatively passive and opaque presence; we mostly hear from the officers (both played by Abraham Makany) and from Paul (Jay Patterson), who spends a lot of time stepping outside the scene and listing long strings of words detailing the peculiar things around him (''Screeching of taxiing American cargo jets ... Brats playing at the feet of pilgrims in black burqas'').
''Something Fine,'' by Eric Dufault, features the phenomenal Cathy Curtin as a desperate, sleep-deprived truck driver who is trying to make it home in time for her daughter's 4th birthday, but is waylaid by a violent run-in at a gas station. In counterpoint to her personal drama and frantic chugging of 5-Hour Energy drinks is a conversation between two life-size versions of her dashboard ornaments, a hula girl (Lucy DeVito) and the Virgin Mary (Diana Ruppe). In a bit that becomes too cute by half by the end, the two figurines carry on a surreal, sometimes metaphysical discussion about whether they have souls and might make it to Hawaii someday, while Ms. Curtin gradually falls apart before our eyes.
After intermission come the two strongest plays of the evening. First is ''You Belong to Me,'' Daniel Reitz's astute character study about an encounter on the subway between former college flames: Susan (Patricia Randell), who has achieved bourgeois success in a gig at an arts foundation, and the troubled genius Robby (the excellent Scott Parkinson, who evokes great poignancy with astonishing economy). Robby is now homeless, and Susan, who has remained fond of Robby since their parting many years before, tries to offer what help she can.
Finally, Joshua Conkel's ''Curmudgeons in Love'' is the comic crowd pleaser of the evening. David Margulies and Martin Shakar play the explosive, foul-mouthed, retirement-home-resident stars in this latest addition to the inexhaustible grumpy-old-men genre. While the play is not exactly a font of subtlety, it is pure heaven to see these superannuated rascals cuss (and kiss!) up a storm.
Series A of the 34th Marathon of One Act Plays continues through Monday at Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton; (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. Subsequent series continue through June 29.

HEADLINE: South Korea: North Korea's Invitation Is Rejected

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea invited South Korean factory owners to a shuttered industrial complex on Tuesday to discuss its reopening, a gesture the South Korean government swiftly rejected. 
The two Korean governments have been blaming each other for weeks for the closing of the Kaesong Industrial Zone. Their bickering is closely watched by analysts; whether they revive the factory park or decide to shut it down for good could set the tone for broader inter-Korean relations in coming years.
If the South Korean factory owners return to Kaesong, ''we are ready to hold any discussion on the normalization'' of the zone, a spokesman for the North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency.
If the South is worried about the safety of the business owners, he said, North Korea will allow them to be accompanied by officials from a semi-government agency that represents the South's interests in Kaesong.
The Unification Ministry, the South Korean government agency in charge of relations with North Korea, dismissed the North Korean overture as another trick of ''duplicity'' aimed at generating friction between the South Korean factory owners and their government in Seoul.
''North Korea should realize that its attempt to split the public opinion in our society no longer works, and must stop it immediately,'' the South Korean ministry's main spokesman, Kim Hyung-suk, said in a statement.
The eight-year-old Kaesong factory park had been the biggest and best known joint Korean economic project. More than 120 South Korean factories hired 53,000 North Korean workers there before the project fell victim to a recent escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula following the North's nuclear test in February.
North Korea pulled out all its workers from the complex in early April, as it was ratcheting up tensions in the region and issuing threats against the United States. South Korea later withdrew all its factory managers.
The North appears to be using more restraint in recent weeks, and South Korea has made several offers for official dialogue aimed at letting South Korean factory owners bring out finished products from Kaesong and to discuss the future of the complex.
But North Korea has rejected such offers, calling them a ''cunning trick'' meant to find a pretext to shut the place down for good. Instead, it has reached out to factory workers directly through fax messages, in which it blames the South Korean government for the closure of the industrial zone.
Factory owners, who wanted to resume operations at Kaesong, called on both governments not to let their politics interfere in the joint economic project.
The government of President Park Geun-hye of South Korea said it wanted to revive the factory complex. But it remained firm that it would not reopen it ''as if nothing had happened,'' and it has sought a guarantee from the North that it will never again use the economic complex as a political tool.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Solar Power's Dark Side

BYLINE: By TODD WOODY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The solar panels covering a vast warehouse roof in the sun-soaked Inland Empire region east of Los Angeles were only two years into their expected 25-year life span when they began to fail.
Coatings that protect the panels disintegrated while other defects caused two fires that took the system offline for two years, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenues.
It was not an isolated incident. Worldwide, testing labs, developers, financiers and insurers are reporting similar problems and say the $77 billion solar industry is facing a quality crisis just as solar panels are on the verge of widespread adoption.
No one is sure how pervasive the problem is. There are no industrywide figures about defective solar panels. And when defects are discovered, confidentiality agreements often keep the manufacturer's identity secret, making accountability in the industry all the more difficult. 
But at stake are billions of dollars that have financed solar installations, from desert power plants to suburban rooftops, on the premise that solar panels will more than pay for themselves over a quarter century.
The quality concerns have emerged just after a surge in solar construction. In the United States, the Solar Energy Industries Association said that solar panel generating capacity exploded from 83 megawatts in 2003 to 7,266 megawatts in 2012, enough to power more than 1.2 million homes. Nearly half that capacity was installed in 2012 alone, meaning any significant problems may not become apparent for years.
''We need to face up to the fact that corners are being cut,'' said Conrad Burke, general manager for DuPont's billion-dollar photovoltaic division, which supplies materials to solar manufacturers.
The solar developer Dissigno has had significant solar panel failures at several of its projects, according to Dave Williams, chief executive of the San Francisco-based company.
''I don't want to be alarmist, but I think quality poses a long-term threat,'' he said. ''The quality across the board is harder to put your finger on now as materials in modules are changing every day and manufacturers are reluctant to share that information.''
Most of the concerns over quality center on China, home to the majority of the world's solar panel manufacturing capacity.
After incurring billions of dollars in debt to accelerate production that has sent solar panel prices plunging since 2009, Chinese solar companies are under extreme pressure to cut costs.
Chinese banks in March, for instance, forced Suntech into bankruptcy. Until 2012, the company had been the world's biggest solar manufacturer.
Executives at companies that inspect Chinese factories on behalf of developers and financiers said that over the last 18 months they have found that even the most reputable companies are substituting cheaper, untested materials. Other brand-name manufacturers, they said, have shut down production lines and subcontracted the assembly of modules to smaller makers.
''We have inspectors in a lot of factories, and it's not rare to see some big brands being produced in those smaller workshops where they have no control over quality,'' said Thibaut Lemoine, general manager of STS Certified, a French-owned testing service. When STS evaluated 215,000 photovoltaic modules at its Shanghai laboratory in 2011 and 2012, it found the defect rate had jumped from 7.8 percent to 13 percent.
In one case, an entire batch of modules from one brand-name manufacturer listed on the New York Stock Exchange proved defective, Mr. Lemoine said. He declined to identify the manufacturer, citing confidentiality agreements.
''Based on our testing, some manufacturers are absolutely swapping in cheap Chinese materials to save money,'' Jenya Meydbray, chief executive of PV Evolution Labs, a Berkeley, Calif., testing service.
SolarBuyer, a company based in Marlborough, Mass., discovered defect rates of 5.5 percent to 22 percent during audits of 50 Chinese factories over the last 18 months, said Ian Gregory, the company's senior marketing director.
Some Chinese manufacturers acknowledge that quality has become a problem
''There are a lot of shortcuts being taken, and unfortunately it's by some of the more reputable companies and there's also been lot of new companies starting up in recent years without the same standards we've had at Suntech,'' said Stuart Wenham, the chief technology officer of Suntech, which is based in Jiangsu Province in eastern China.
When asked about quality standards, Trina Solar, one of the largest Chinese manufacturers, said in an e-mailed response, ''For Trina, quality will not be compromised in our cost-reduction efforts.''
The heart of a solar panel is a photovoltaic cell that generates electricity when struck by sunlight. Among the most critical components are a thin film that protects the cell from moisture, and the encapsulant that seals the cell between layers of glass.
Mr. Gregory said repeat inspections of factories found some manufacturers had been constantly switching to cheaper materials, including some whose use-by date had expired.
''If the materials aren't good or haven't been thoroughly tested, they won't stick together and the solar module will eventually fall apart in the field,'' he said.
That's what happened in 2011 at a year-old Australian solar plant, Mr. Meydbray of PV Evolution said. Testing confirmed that substandard materials were causing the Chinese-made modules' protective coating to degrade, he said. The power plant operator declined to be identified.
''I think quality is increasingly a concern, but it's not a major issue yet,'' said Rhone Resch, chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. ''As companies race to cut their costs, some who are on the edge may take short cuts.''
The Energy Department's National Renewable Energy Laboratory has studied the performance of solar panels up to 2010, according to Sarah Kurtz, a scientist who manages the laboratory's photovoltaic reliability group.
''The question is whether things are deteriorating rapidly or whether it's a few isolated companies not doing so well on their quality control,'' she said. ''I hear a lot of angst, but I haven't seen a lot of solid information.''
All solar panels degrade and gradually generate less electricity over time. But a review of 30,000 installations in Europe by the German solar monitoring firm Meteocontrol found 80 percent were underperforming. Testing of six manufacturers' solar panels at two Spanish power plants by Enertis Solar in 2010 found defect rates as high as 34.5 percent.
Enfinity operates solar installations in Europe and the United States. Bob Hopper, Enfinity's chief development officer, said his company had stopped buying Chinese modules because of quality concerns. ''Even a small amount of unforecasted degradation in electricity production can have significant economic impact on us,'' he said.
In the Netherlands, René Moerman, chief strategy officer of Solar Insurance and Finance, said claims had risen 15 percent recently. He said an inspection of a solar plant in Britain in March revealed that 12 percent of the newly installed Chinese-made modules had failed. He said confidentiality agreements prevented him from naming the manufacturer.
Other solar developers and installers said they had not experienced quality problems.
''The systems we installed in 2012 had the best performing year yet,'' said Lyndon Rive, chief executive of SolarCity, the largest residential solar installer in the United States and a buyer of panels from China's Yingli Solar and Trina.
Non-Chinese manufacturers have had quality problems as well. The defective panels installed on the Los Angeles area warehouse, for instance, were made by an American manufacturer. A reporter was granted access to the project on the condition that the parties' identities not be disclosed because of a confidential legal settlement.
First Solar, one of the United States' biggest manufacturers, has set aside $271.2 million to cover the costs of replacing defective modules it made in 2008 and 2009.
Nor are all solar developers shunning Chinese manufacturers. The United States subsidiary of Yingli, the world's largest solar panel maker since 2012, won a contract last year to supply solar panels for a California power plant.
''The one thing I can tell you is that Yingli does not cut corners,'' said Brian Grenko, vice president for operations at Yingli Americas, adding that only 15 defective modules had been returned to the company out of 2.8 million shipped to the United States since 2009.
Still, Yingli executives acknowledge that quality has become a competitive issue.
The company now offers a comprehensive insurance policy to customers and has established its own testing laboratory in the San Francisco area.
Mr. Wenham, the Suntech executive, said manufacturers needed to be held accountable and advocated creating testing labs not beholden to the industry that would assess quality.
''We need to start naming names,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Taxing Corporations

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Everybody does it.
It hardly qualifies as a defense. But that is perhaps the most accurate statement that Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, could have made to lawmakers inquiring last week about how its creative financial techniques contributed to its low business tax payments.
You may have heard of Google's ''Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich'' -- an increasingly popular route through Ireland and the Netherlands that cleanses corporate cash of most of its tax liability.
Amazon and Facebook like the sandwich, too.
Don't forget the fabled tax wizards in General Electric's accounting department. Or what about Starbucks, which paid a grand total of $13 million in British corporate taxes over 15 years on revenue of more than $5 billion? 
Starbucks is not a complex technology firm with a subsidiary in a low-tax Caribbean island charging its headquarters through the nose to license some cutting-edge software patent. It's a chain of coffee shops, part of the predigital economy.
Still, despite a 31 percent market share, the company's British subsidiary managed to report losses in 14 of its first 15 years.
The case of Starbucks is particularly troubling for every government concerned about how it is going to finance itself in the future.
As Edward Kleinbard of the University of Southern California noted: if Starbucks could generate so much ''stateless'' income -- beyond the reach of tax authorities both where it makes and sells the Frappuccinos and where it is incorporated as a company -- ''any multinational firm can.''
That means that as the government seeks new sources of revenue to pay for an expanding safety net and an aging population, it should probably look outside the corporate sector.
''We have a tax problem; we are not collecting enough tax revenue -- period,'' said Jim Hines of the University of Michigan. ''But we are never going to finance what we need with corporate taxes.''
Instead, governments seeking revenue might do best focusing their efforts on taxing people, who cannot flee as easily, or taxing what people consume.
Some of this may come at the expense of progressivity in the tax code.
The United States is the only advanced nation that does not have a value-added tax, which is similar to a sales tax and can raise lots of revenue. Peter Diamond from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has suggested increasing payroll taxes to pay for increased spending on Social Security.
There are more progressive taxes -- say taxing the ''carried interest'' charged by fund managers at the same rate as regular income, or raising taxes on dividends. That could raise money, though probably less.
But with countries around the globe in constant competition to lure investment by lowering tax rates and offering assorted breaks, taxing corporations will be an uphill battle. Multinational companies just have too many options to minimize their tax bill by routing profits through low-tax jurisdictions and losses through high-tax ones.
In the industrial era of the early 1950s, corporate income tax contributed almost a third of the total tax revenue raised by the federal government, equivalent to about 6 percent of the nation's income. By the 1970s it generated about 3 percent. And in the last decade it raised around 2 percent of national income -- only about $1 in $10 of all federal tax dollars collected.
Corporate tax revenues stopped shrinking as a share of the economy after the last major tax reform in the 1980s, moving up and down with the economic cycle. But they have failed to keep up with corporate profits' rising share of the economic pie.
Part of this decline was by design. Notably, starting in the 1980s many companies were allowed to shed their corporate status so that their profits flowed directly to their owners -- generating no corporate tax.
But globalization -- combined with financial legerdemain -- has opened wide new doors for companies to reduce their tax bill.
For all the complaints about the high corporate rate, from 1987 through 2008 federal income taxes paid by American corporations amounted to only 25.6 percent of their domestic income, according to the Congressional Budget Office. On their foreign income they paid much less.
A study based on 2006 tax records by Harry Grubert of the Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis and Rosanne Altshuler of Rutgers University found that 37 percent of the profits of foreign subsidiaries of American corporations are taxed at a rate of less than 5 percent. More than half of the profits pay less than 15 percent in foreign taxes.
And these profits are rarely taxed at home. The Internal Revenue Service collects corporate taxes only on foreign profits repatriated into the United States, a slim slice indeed. Last year, the largest American multinational corporations reportedly added $183 billion to their untaxed hoard of cash held overseas. In total, American companies have almost $2 trillion in profits ''permanently reinvested'' abroad.
The corporate strategy is of dubious value. According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, the federal government loses about $10 billion to $60 billion a year from multinationals shifting profits to low-tax countries.
Meanwhile, the ''foreign investment'' drawn by low-tax havens is often not the kind that generates jobs.
When George W. Bush offered a tax holiday in 2004, allowing multinational companies to repatriate some $300 billion at a tax rate of 5.25 percent -- the money didn't come from places like China, Canada or Mexico, where American companies have big productive investments with lots of workers. The top sources were the Netherlands, Switzerland, Bermuda and Ireland.
The practice is costly even for multinational firms themselves. Ms. Altshuler and Mr. Grubert noted that the companies that took advantage of the tax holiday paid an average of 3.6 percent on their repatriations, which means they thought the actual or implicit future costs of keeping the stash abroad would be at least this big.
Could something be done to limit this? With many countries struggling with budget deficits, anger at multinationals hopping across tax jurisdictions is intensifying across the industrial world.
The Obama administration proposed introducing a low global minimum tax rate of, say, 15 percent. Foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates would have to pay the difference to the I.R.S. but would face no further taxes on repatriation. And an ''excess returns'' rule could subject high profits in low-tax countries to higher American taxes, a disincentive to tax avoidance.
House Republicans, too, have proposed new rules to limit global tax-minimization strategies.
But successfully combating corporate country-hopping is likely to require international cooperation. And low-tax countries are likely to resist tighter rules. ''Of course Ireland won't like it,'' said Pascal Saint-Amans, who heads the Center for Tax Policy at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has been charged with drafting new standards to avoid multinational tax avoidance.
Perhaps an interim solution is simply transparency: require corporations to disclose the taxes they pay in every jurisdiction they operate. Once it got out that Starbucks' British tax bill was next to nothing, the public outcry was so great that the company ''volunteered'' to pay about $15 million a year, just to avoid a potential boycott.
Or maybe corporate taxes should just be kissed goodbye.

HEADLINE: Volcker's Aim: Responsive Government

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
As chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul A. Volcker tamed inflation. More recently, he took on the country's biggest banks in an effort to force them to give up lucrative but risky Wall Street-style trading.
Mr. Volcker will declare another war on Wednesday, this time on the public's eroding faith in government. He plans to begin a foundation called the Volcker Alliance, aimed at improving how government works at the local, state and federal levels.
As he did in those other battles, Mr. Volcker faces a struggle. Wall Street has been pushing hard lately for a looser interpretation of what is widely known as the Volcker Rule, giving banks more flexibility when it comes to trading. 
Mr. Volcker plans to deliver an address on Wednesday at the Economic Club of New York in which he will spotlight the challenges facing financial regulatory reform, including how slowly Washington has put the Dodd-Frank legislation, which was signed into law nearly three years ago, into effect.
''I've gotten concerned by the seeming impotence of federal regulatory agencies,'' Mr. Volcker said. ''Too many agencies overlapping, too many opportunities for delay.''
Mr. Volcker, whose goal is to start with a budget of about $5 million a year, plans to finance a substantial part of that personally, and will raise money from outside donors.
The group will work with universities as well as private entities like the RAND Corporation and the Partnership for Public Service, supporting research projects, awarding fellowships and holding conferences on how to make government work better.
Despite well-financed programs at Ivy League universities like Harvard and Princeton and elsewhere, in some academic quarters, ''public administration is almost a bad word,'' Mr. Volcker said in an interview on Tuesday at his office in Rockefeller Center. Too often, he said, the focus is on theory rather than the nuts and bolts of governance.
''We're not going to be a think tank,'' he said. Initially, ''We're going to be a catalyst, a coordinator, with a couple of senior people, a few junior people and some nonresident fellows.''
''I want it to be free-standing,'' said Mr. Volcker, who said he worried his project would not have the same impact if it were begun under the auspices of an academic institution.
The Volcker Alliance will operate out of Mr. Volcker's offices in New York.
One focus will be putting into effect the Dodd-Frank legislation, which was passed in 2010 and was aimed at strengthening financial market regulation. The instituting of specific regulations, however, has been mired in federal bureaucracy. Agencies have been slow to write the regulations, including the provision known as the Volcker Rule, which seeks to prevent financial institutions with government backing from placing bets with their own capital.
The final language for the execution of the Volcker Rule may be completed this year, but some experts fear the rule-writing process could easily slip into 2014. The banking industry, which has deep pockets and possesses great influence in Washington, has been mounting a huge lobbying effort to dilute the Volcker Rule's effects.
Among other things, the Volcker Alliance will also explore ways to promote the training of bank supervisors who might one day be charged with enforcing the Volcker Rule. In addition, it is looking at a partnership with a university that would focus on putting financial change into effect.
Mr. Volcker acknowledged that it would not be easy to alter public perceptions of government, noting how sharply attitudes had changed since he entered public service during the Kennedy administration at the Treasury Department. As Washington has become more polarized, fewer and fewer public officials have careers resembling that of the 85-year-old Mr. Volcker, who served in a variety of administrations, Republican and Democratic.
After a stint at what was then Chase Manhattan Bank, he returned to the Treasury Department, this time in the Nixon administration. He was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1975 to 1979, and then was Fed chairman in the Carter and Reagan administrations.
In the early years of Mr. Volcker's two terms, the Fed raised interest rates sharply, which helped set off a recession but also ended the high inflation rates that plagued the United States in the 1970s and early 1980s.
A well-connected veteran of Washington and academia, Shelley H. Metzenbaum, will serve as the group's president, and Mr. Volcker has recruited other public figures for its board, like former Senator Bill Bradley and Alice Rivlin, a former Fed vice chairwoman who was director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Clinton administration.
Other board members will include Sheila Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as well as William H. Donaldson, who co-founded the Wall Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and went on to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission during the George W. Bush administration.
''So much energy goes into getting a law passed,'' Ms. Metzenbaum said. ''There isn't the same impetus in terms of implementation.''
''It's about accountability,'' she added. ''How do we get government agencies to keep moving forward?''

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Is Fined $82 Million Over Mishandling of Hazardous Wastes

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores pleaded guilty Tuesday to improperly dumping hazardous waste in California and Missouri, agreeing to pay almost $82 million in fines.
The retailer was charged with six counts of violating the Clean Water Act in California and one count of violating a federal law related to pesticide disposal in Missouri.
The guilty plea on all counts brings to an end years of investigations and legal wrangling that pitted the nation's largest retailer against government authorities over charges that employees were throwing hazardous products in the trash and into sewage systems. 
While the legal issues have not made a significant dent in the retail giant's finances, they have prompted Wal-Mart to revamp its procedures. The company has added training on proper waste disposal for its store employees and created a compliance office consisting of former officials with the Environmental Protection Agency, among other people.
The problems stem from incidents beginning in 2003. At the time, Wal-Mart workers tossed products, like bleach and fertilizer, into the trash or the local sewer system, rather than dealing with them as hazardous waste, according to authorities.
''Retailers like Wal-Mart that generate hazardous waste have a duty to legally and safely dispose of that hazardous waste, and dumping it down the sink was neither legal nor safe,'' André Birotte Jr., the United States attorney for the Central District of California, said. In Missouri, the company was routing damaged items that its customers had returned, including pesticides, to a facility where the items were processed for resale without proper permits. ''Regulated pesticides were mixed together and offered for sale to customers without the required registration, ingredients, or use information,'' the Justice Department said in a statement.
Wal-Mart ''put the public and the environment at risk and gained an unfair economic advantage over other companies,'' Ignacia S. Moreno, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, said in a statement.
Wal-Mart noted in a statement that it had not been accused of any specific environmental damage as a result of the improper handling.
After the allegations of improper dumping came to light, the company in 2006 put into place a program telling employees how to handle the waste and created a compliance office. For instance, an employee must now put returned or damaged items that are classified as hazardous into a special chemical bag.
The employee must then label the bag's contents, put the bag in a bucket liner, seal the liner, and place the liner into a color-coded bucket -- red for nail polish, blue for aerosols. A hazardous-waste hauler takes the bucket from the store to a treatment center, along with documentation.
''Once we learned of these allegations, we looked into it, investigated it, and decided to put this program in place,'' said Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan, ''so they know if something is determined as hazardous waste.''
The guilty plea comes after settlements that Wal-Mart reached with California and Missouri in 2010 and 2012 on the same charges. Tuesday's fines include $60 million for violations of the Clean Water Act in California; $14 million for a violation of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act in Missouri; and a $7.6 million civil penalty to the E.P.A.
In total, Wal-Mart will have paid more than $110 million to resolve all these related cases. Wal-Mart, which had $128 billion in revenues last year, said the payments should not have a material effect on its business.

HEADLINE: The Wisdom of Bob Dole

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Bob Dole no longer recognizes the Republican Party that he helped lead for years. Speaking over the weekend on ''Fox News Sunday,'' he said his party should hang a ''closed for repairs'' sign on its doors until it comes up with a few positive ideas, because neither he nor Ronald Reagan would now feel comfortable in its membership.
''It seems to be almost unreal that we can't get together on a budget or legislation,'' said Mr. Dole, the former Senate majority leader and presidential candidate. ''I mean, we weren't perfect by a long shot, but at least we got our work done.'' 
The current Congress can't even do that, thanks to a furiously oppositional Republican Party, and that's what has left mainstream conservatives like Mr. Dole and Senator John McCain shaking their heads in disgust.
The difference between the current crop of Tea Party lawmakers and Mr. Dole's generation is not simply one of ideology. While the Tea Partiers are undoubtedly more extreme, Mr. Dole spent years pushing big tax cuts, railing at regulations and blocking international treaties. His party actively courted the religious right in the 1980s and relied on racial innuendo to win elections. But when the time came to actually govern, Republicans used to set aside their grandstanding, recognize that a two-party system requires compromise and make deals to keep the government working on the people's behalf.
The current generation refuses to do that. Its members want to dismantle government, using whatever crowbar happens to be handy, and they don't particularly care what traditions of mutual respect get smashed at the same time. ''I'm not all that interested in the way things have always been done around here,'' Senator Marco Rubio of Florida told The Times last week.
This corrosive mentality has been standard procedure in the House since 2011, but now it has seeped over to the Senate. Mr. Rubio is one of several senators who have blocked a basic function of government: a conference committee to work out budget differences between the House and Senate so that Congress can start passing appropriations bills. They say they are afraid the committee will agree to raise the debt ceiling without extorting the spending cuts they seek. One of them, Ted Cruz of Texas, admitted that he didn't even trust House Republicans to practice blackmail properly. They have been backed by Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, who wants extremist credentials for his re-election.
At long last, this is finally drawing the rancor of Mr. Dole's heirs in the responsible wing of the party. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said that negotiating on a budget was an ''issue of integrity.'' Roy Blunt, Lamar Alexander and many others have encouraged talks, and Mr. McCain (who was not above veering to the far right when he was running for president in 2008) now says the Tea Partiers are ''absolutely out of line'' and setting a bad precedent.
''We're here to vote, not here to block things,'' he said last week. ''We're here to articulate our positions on the issues and do what we can for the good of the country and the let the process move forward.''
Already, the mulish behavior of Congressional Republicans has led to the creation of the sequester, blocked action on economic growth and climate change, prevented reasonable checks on gun purchases and threatens to blow up a hard-fought compromise on immigration. Mr. Dole's words should remind his party that it is not only abandoning its past, but damaging the country's future.

HEADLINE: Shuttle Diplomacy, Kerry Style

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Secretary of State John Kerry has seemed perpetually in motion in the Middle East since he assumed office, shuttling from one meeting to another with top Israeli and Palestinian officials over the last four months in an effort to revive peace negotiations. He has divulged few details, and his overall strategy is unclear. But it would be foolish to write off his peacemaking diplomacy, as some have. So far, he seems to be moving in a determined and encouraging fashion on a series of interlocking steps. 
At a conference of the World Economic Forum in Jordan on Sunday, Mr. Kerry announced that a consortium of nations -- coordinated by Tony Blair, the former British prime minister -- would seek as much as $4 billion in new investment for the West Bank and Gaza as part of a broader effort to revive talks on a two-state solution that have languished for four years. He gave no details, except to say the investment would come from the private sector and focus on jobs and tourism.
Palestinian leaders were cool to the initiative, warning that they ''will not offer political concessions in exchange for economic benefits.'' They are right to be wary. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, whose commitment to a two-state solution is in question, has long advocated the idea of ''economic peace,'' apparently believing that improved living conditions would make Palestinians more disposed to compromise.
Yet encouraging economic growth and reducing Palestinian unemployment is hardly enough. Any durable peace lies in resolving core issues: the borders of a Palestinian state, the fate of Palestinian refugees, security for Israel and the future of Jerusalem. Mr. Kerry knows that and said as much in his speech: the $4 billion investment package is itself partly intended to give Palestinians an incentive to negotiate and a vision of a future viable state.
There are other positive signs. Last month, Mr. Kerry persuaded the Arab League to reaffirm its 2002 peace initiative and bring it more in line with American and Israeli positions by endorsing the idea of land swaps when fixing Israeli and Palestinian borders. The plan also offers hope that Israel's peace with the Palestinians would also mean peace with the wider Arab and Muslim world.
Mr. Kerry has also persuaded Israel to slow the approval of new settlements and Palestinians to hold off on pressing for greater recognition at the United Nations. On Sunday, at the conference in Jordan, 300 Israeli and Palestinian executives and investors announced an initiative called Breaking the Impasse that aims to put much needed indigenous economic and political clout behind reviving peace talks.
Along with Mr. Netanyahu, the biggest drag on serious progress seems to be the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who has shown no sign of dropping his demand that Israel halt settlements before negotiations resume.
Mr. Abbas squandered a chance at a peace deal in 2008. It would be foolish to do so again.

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: Our Regulatory System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In a recent and bewildering article, The Times reported that Texans remain wary of government regulation even after a fertilizer explosion killed 14, one of the worst industrial disaster in decades. Even though Texas has the nation's worst record on workplace fatalities, businesses can ''do pretty much what they want to,'' as one Texan observed. 
Our regulatory system is a flash point for many. Simply stated (and admittedly oversimplified), the anti-regulatory faction posits that the free market's ''invisible hand'' takes care of itself and ''bad actors'' are eventually eliminated from the marketplace. Regulations, it contends, stifle business and innovation.
On the other side, proponents of regulation contend that unbridled capitalism inevitably leads to excess, fraud and harm. They trace a line from the Triangle shirtwaist fire to thalidomide-related birth defects to the 2008 financial crisis to the Bangladesh factory collapse. Effective regulations might have prevented those unfortunate events.
Regulation -- like beauty -- is in the eyes of the beholder. There is no dispute that regulations carry increased costs and are sometimes excessive. Nonetheless, most believe that effective regulation is required and beneficial in a complex society.
I recently attended the annual shareholders' meeting for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company. Mr. Buffett said, ''It is in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a manner that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.'' He understands, presumably, that such scrutiny is a legitimate price to pay to live in a society where legal rights are respected and enforced. Moreover, he understands that compliance is profitable.
What is needed is more regulation and tighter enforcement. Moreover, businesses that do not comply should bear the economic consequences of their misdeeds. There should not be any caps on damages recoverable because only then will business do the right thing.
The laissez-faire doctrine developed in the 18th century is a relic not appropriate for the 21st century. Mr. Buffett understands that perfectly. Why don't others?

HEADLINE: Society's Attitudes Toward the Military

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Americans and Their Military, Drifting Apart'' (Op-Ed, May 27):
Karl W. Eikenberry and David M. Kennedy have again reminded us, as the fortunate citizens of a self-governing society, where concentrations of power are viewed with suspicion, of the antidemocratic and ultimately dangerous division that occurs when the vast majority of the people do not comprehend the military. An increasingly isolated military can easily become alienated from its civilian masters.
This lack of understanding (and sometimes deep distrust) has only become more pronounced over the 40 years since we ceased requiring that all qualified Americans share the experience and risks of military service. This is unhealthy for our country, and we must find a way to correct it. General Eikenberry's and Professor Kennedy's suggestions are a good start. 
MICHAEL J. LEVIN Plainfield, N.J., May 27, 2013
The writer is a retired lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps.
To the Editor:
Karl W. Eikenberry and David M. Kennedy propose a draft lottery as one way to reduce the gap between the civilian and military sectors of American society.
That system was tried in the Vietnam War and was flawed and inequitable. It was limited to men, and those from powerful and/or wealthy families could avoid the draft or, in extremis, join the National Guard.
Why not adopt a system to truly ''reintroduce the notion of service as a civic obligation'': mandatory, universal two-year national service for all Americans irrespective of gender, economic status, level of education or sexual orientation?
Service in the military would be only one option for fulfilling this civic responsibility. Other service options would include the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and working with the disabled, the elderly or those with debilitating illnesses. Such service could also become a requirement for earning American citizenship.
General Eikenberry and Professor Kennedy point to a salient problem, but an even more significant one is the growing sense of entitlement and lack of a sense of civic obligation among many Americans.
DAN CALDWELL Malibu, Calif., May 27, 2013
The writer is a professor of political science at Pepperdine University.
To the Editor:
Karl W. Eikenberry and David M. Kennedy argue that if we reinstitute the draft, then the American people will be more hesitant to go to war. But even before our current volunteer Army, when vast numbers of Americans were opposed to war, the political establishment waged war anyway -- in Vietnam, for example. More recently, without a draft, masses of Americans demonstrated against going to war in Iraq; the government took us into it anyway.
Draft or no draft, jingoistic political leaders take us into foreign wars. What needs to be changed are government policies for using military force.
ALLAN BRICK Kennett Square, Pa., May 27, 2013
To the Editor:
This essay speaks to the disturbing trend that finds more Americans today living in an atomized society that is increasingly separated from the military.
As a young American who came of age after 9/11, I am troubled by the degree to which my generation has become alienated from military service and the effect this has had on our body politic. However, we must also recognize that service in the nation's armed forces is not the only form of national service, nor should one's lack of service prevent someone from criticizing our military when it deserves it, as in the case of widespread sexual assault among service members.
As President Obama calls for a redefinition of the ''global war on terror,'' we as citizens should also call for a redefinition of national service in an age of shrinking military budgets and expanding social need.

HEADLINE: Chinese President to Seek New 'Power Relationship' in Talks With Obama

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's new president, Xi Jinping, took a hands-on approach on Monday while meeting with President Obama's national security adviser to prepare the agenda for the California summit meeting between the two leaders next week.
He dispensed with the big upholstered chairs that have for decades been the signature of the Great Hall of the People and, seated opposite the American adviser, Tom Donilon, at a long, polished wooden table, got immediately to the point. 
The relationship between the United States and China stands at a ''critical juncture,'' he said, adding that it is time to explore ''a new type of great power relationship.''
Mr. Xi and Mr. Obama will meet over two days at Sunnylands, an estate east of Los Angeles, in what is being billed as a get-to-know-you retreat for the two leaders as they define their countries' relationship.
Their wives, Michelle Obama and Peng Liyuan, will also be there, and a person familiar with the planning said the leaders would have plenty of time to talk informally, undistracted by the constant motion and public scrutiny of meetings in Washington.
Mr. Donilon wound up his two-day visit to Beijing on Tuesday night after meeting the vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission, Gen. Fan Changlong, an indication that the mounting distrust between the American and Chinese militaries will be discussed in California.
In a public statement before the closed-door session with General Fan, Mr. Donilon repeated the Obama administration's desire for stronger strategic communications between the two militaries and for joint, rather than competitive, efforts to deal with regional problems in Asia.
Mr. Xi's blunt focus on a new relationship with the United States puts that notion at the center of the summit meeting, Chinese and American analysts said, although few were sure what specifically Mr. Xi, who is regarded as a man of big ambitions and a friend of the military, had in mind.
Even before assuming the presidency in March, Mr. Xi mentioned the desire for a new relationship, alluding to it on his visit to Washington as vice president in February 2012.
Earlier this year, officials from the Foreign Ministry met with professors of international relations in Beijing to discuss how best to define the ''great power relationship,'' but no one knew how to flesh it out, several professors said.
Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said both sides were ''struggling to conceptualize what a new type of great power relationship might be.''
It is a given, Chinese and American analysts say, that Mr. Xi and his advisers are referring to the historical problem of what happens when an established power and a rising power confront each other. The analysts said the Chinese were well aware of the example of the Peloponnesian War, which was caused, according to the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, by the fear that a powerful Athens instilled in Sparta.
Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University and an occasional adviser to the Chinese government, offered some ideas of what Mr. Xi has in mind.
''He wants the American president to recognize that China is dramatically rising in military and economic ways, and he wants the president to know that he is active in world diplomacy,'' Mr. Shi said. ''If the American president recognizes all of these things, then Xi can be nicer, nicer in his definition, in a very tense situation.''
Mr. Xi has already been more strategic, confident and successful in foreign policy than his immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, Mr. Shi said.
''Under Xi, we can have some big gives and big takes,'' some of which could be unveiled by the Chinese leader in California, Mr. Shi said.
Mr. Xi has offered a ''big gift'' to the United States, Mr. Shi said, by pressuring the new leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, to resume talks over his country's growing nuclear weapons program.
The Global Times, a newspaper that often defends the Chinese Communist Party, reported Tuesday on the changes in China's policy toward North Korea that it said were in the United States' interest.
''The former administration always put ensuring the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula in first place, while the current administration sets the denuclearization of the peninsula first,'' the paper quoted Zhang Liangui, of the Communist Party School of the Central Committee, as saying.
China will no longer ''indulge'' North Korea's weapons program at the cost of instability in North Asia, Mr. Zhang said. This brought China and the United States closer together, Mr. Zhang said.
Mr. Shi said Mr. Xi would show his toughness to Mr. Obama over Japan. The Chinese president is likely to tell Mr. Obama that Beijing ''cannot tolerate the behavior'' of Japan over the Diaoyu Islands -- known as the Senkaku in Japan -- in the East China Sea. China has pressed Japan militarily and diplomatically over ownership of the islands since September.
The hard-line policy toward Japan has a larger goal, Mr. Shi said. Mr. Xi ''is looking for more strategic space in the western part of the Pacific, so that American strategic weapons will not be able to pass through the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea,'' Mr. Shi said. ''He won't say this specifically at the meeting with the American president. He will say it in broader, more ambiguous language.''
Aside from the overarching relationship between China and the United States, a range of specific issues will be discussed at Sunnylands, American and Chinese analysts said.
The United States is most concerned about Chinese cyberattacks and the theft of industrial secrets, and China is likely to seek to play down those issues, the analysts said. Discussions about North Korea, the global economy, the East China Sea and the South China Sea are likely be on the agenda, they said.
But the analysts expect less detail in the talks and fewer specific outcomes than are usual at formal, fast-paced summit meetings.
There has already been modest progress in communication between the two militaries, American officials said.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, spoke by telephone last Wednesday with General Fan, the result of a pledge last month that they would talk on a more regular basis.

HEADLINE: A Mogul Comes to Lunch, and Doesn't Hold His Tongue

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Sheldon G. Adelson is perhaps best known as a conservative casino mogul who spent tens of millions of dollars last year trying to defeat President Obama. But he is a larger-than-life lightning rod in Israel, too.
He owns the largest-circulation newspaper here, a right-leaning tabloid which he calls ''fair and balanced'' but which some competitors denounce as speeding the decline of good journalism. He has sprinkled $200 million across the state's hospitals, museums and universities. He is married to an Israeli, and close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
At a luncheon here Tuesday, Mr. Adelson brought his two worlds together. He was crowned an honorary citizen of Jerusalem by the city's mayor. And he flew in entertainers from his $2.4 billion Venetian resort in Macau: three male crooners in long brocade jackets and three-cornered hats, serenading the V.I.P. crowd with ''That's Amore'' and ''O Sole Mio.'' 
The luncheon, of chicken thighs and Middle Eastern salads washed down with fresh lemonade or orange juice, was upstairs at the Jerusalem International Convention Center, where Mr. Adelson gave a ''fireside chat,'' largely about his latest megaproject in Madrid, and received a lifetime achievement award to highlight a tourism conference. Perhaps 100 invited guests, from as far away as New Orleans and Korea, offered a warm ovation as Mayor Nir Barkat of Jerusalem read a laudatory resolution conferring citizenship from a parchment scroll held by the singers.
While dessert was served, Mr. Adelson, 80 -- ''80 is the new 60,'' he said -- shook hands and held court, offering his characteristically unvarnished views. He trashed the prospects for peace with the Palestinians. He tried to school American reporters on the history of the Middle East. And he denounced as ''stupid'' people who criticize Birthright Israel, a program that has brought 400,000 young Jews here over 13 years, much of it on his dime.
''It's the cement that connects one generation of Jews to the next,'' he said of the program, to which he has donated $180 million since 2007. ''Without Birthright, in two or three more generations, there won't be any more Jews in the United States.''
Asked about Secretary of State John Kerry's plan to infuse as much as $4 billion into the economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, much of it to build tourism, Mr. Adelson responded, ''Why would I want to invest money with people who want to kill my people?''
''How can you move a ball forward when the Israelis legitimately want peace and the Palestinians want Israel piece by piece?'' he said of Mr. Kerry's broader effort to revive the stalemated peace process. ''Have you ever heard any Palestinian say, 'We have to give up our hope of destroying Israel in favor of living in peace.' ?''
Mr. Adelson, of course, is not guiding Israel's foreign policy, but supporting its institutions with generous financial contributions. Though he is close to Mr. Netanyahu, he declined to say whether he would see the prime minister during this visit. He said he did not get ink-stained hands shaping the pro-Netanyahu coverage of Israel Hayom, the free newspaper he started in 2007.
''I'm not,'' he said when asked how involved he was in the paper. ''I hesitated because I'd rather not talk about my involvement, but the fact of the matter is I'm not involved. The newspaper goes by itself.
''It's Bibi's newspaper, I know,'' he said, using the prime minister's nickname and acknowledging the common critique here. ''It wasn't started for Bibi, and it's not running for Bibi. Of course everybody thinks it is because they drink the Kool-Aid.''
Mr. Adelson -- who has homes in Las Vegas; Malibu; Newton, Mass.; and Tel Aviv, among other places -- said he visited Israel six to eight times a year. He and his wife, Miriam, a doctor, were married in Jerusalem, and their children bar mitzvahed here, she said at the luncheon.
They have given $50 million to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial and museum. They recently created a $20 million entrepreneurial school at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, and have also supported the Hebrew University and Hadassah Hospital here.
During the 2006 war with Lebanon, the couple upgraded hospitals in northern Israel, and they have for 20 years maintained a methadone clinic in Tel Aviv. In 2007, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, they noticed a stained carpet during a visit to the Museum of Independence in Tel Aviv and immediately financed a renovation.
''During the gulf war, I was the only person who opened up a tour operation in the states to bring people to Israel,'' he said. ''And I put Israel on the high-tech map by promoting it at the Comdex show.''
As for the Palestinians, Mr. Adelson said, ''They teach their children that Jews are descended from swine and apes, pigs and monkeys.'' Then he questioned their existence as a distinct ethnic group, saying they were ''southern Syrians'' or Egyptians until Yasir Arafat, who was leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, ''came along with a pitcher of Kool-Aid and gave it to everybody to drink and sold them the idea of Palestinians.''
These ideas, staples of the far right, are deeply offensive to the Palestinians -- perhaps partly the point.
So how would Mr. Adelson resolve the long-running conflict? ''Put up a big fence around our territory and say to the guys over there, your trucks can't go over our land if you carry weapons, your planes can't go over our airspace if they carry weapons,'' he said. ''How do you recognize a partner for peace when all they want to do is kill you and your people?''
None of this tough political talk was aired at the podium, where Mayor Barkat called the Adelsons ''Zionist heroes of the city.'' (Mrs. Adelson did refer to Jerusalem as ''my eternal, undivided capital of Israel.'')
Mr. Adelson spoke emotionally about his father, a Lithuanian-born Boston cabdriver who could never afford to visit Israel -- and was too old to do so once his son could pay -- saying that was the inspiration for Birthright. After his father's death, Mr. Adelson said, ''I brought him here spiritually'' by wearing an old pair of his shoes to walk across Israeli soil.
The Adelsons announced at the lunch that they would like to buy a place in Jerusalem, ideally overlooking the Old City. Before an hour had passed, Mrs. Adelson said, her phone was filled with messages from real estate agents.

HEADLINE: A Drab Office Complex in New Jersey Gets the Cinderella Treatment

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
PLAINSBORO, N.J. -- Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical company, moved into its North American headquarters here this month, after a $225 million gut renovation transformed an aging structure into a glassy corporate campus updated for a modern work force.
Stripping the building to its studs, developers took a drab, bunkerlike edifice and made it a shiny example of how New Jersey's aging suburban office stock could be reimagined for a new era. 
Owners of suburban office space in the state face a difficult environment. Eighty percent of the office buildings were built in the 1980s and 1990s during the reign of the suburban, self-contained corporate campus, according to a report by Rutgers University. But over the last decade, businesses and workers fled the isolation of the suburbs in favor of accessible city centers. Added to that, businesses have been reluctant to sign leases or expand operations in a lackluster economy.
As a result, the New Jersey office availability rate remains punishingly high, at 24.7 percent in the first quarter of 2013, only slightly lower than its record high of 25 percent in the second quarter of 2010, according to data provided by Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, a real estate advisory firm. With so much available inventory, rents remain low. The average asking rent for office space in New Jersey was $23.91 per square foot in the first quarter of 2013, a 10-year low.
The result: Companies considering leases can choose from an enormous pool of available properties and demand historically low rent.
''You have to do something dramatic to attract tenants. You have to surprise them,'' said Steve Tolkach, an executive managing director at Newmark Grubb Knight Frank and the broker who represented Novo Nordisk. ''You can't go halfway and just do a couple of renovations.''
Some properties have been revamped recently. Last year, Hampshire Real Estate Companies transformed a data center in Madison, N.J., into a modern headquarters for Realogy Holdings Corporation. And this month, Spectra Laboratories signed a 15-year lease with Marcus Partners to expand and retrofit an aging property in Rockleigh, N.J. However, the most ambitious renovation in the state in recent years is the development in Plainsboro.
Novo Nordisk initially dismissed the building at 800 Scudders Mill Road. Although the property is on a serene, 99-acre nature preserve with a five-acre lake, the building was dark and dated. Built in 1984, it had a hulking brown concrete facade and small darkened windows. At 731,000 square feet, it was too large for its needs. At the time, Novo Nordisk was spread out over four locations in Plainsboro, near Princeton. Eager to build a tailor-made facility from the ground up, the company zeroed in on a developable lot elsewhere in Plainsboro.
The Scudders Mill Road property ''didn't offer the efficiencies that a new building would offer,'' said Ted Bielicky, senior director of facilities for Novo Nordisk. ''While it had the opportunity for more glass, it left some vacant spaces, which was inefficient.''
The building has an unusual configuration. At only three stories high, it has a herringbone-like design with a central, quarter-mile-long corridor. Individual pods break off from the spine, creating a building with five separate employee entrances that can be so confusing to navigate that maps hang from the walls offering direction.
The developers, however, saw the perceived limitations as potential benefits. Because of its unusual shape, the building had the potential for enormous amounts of natural light and spectacular views of the nature preserve. The property also has ample parking and is well located. Situated off Route 1, it is near the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro's new 171-acre medical campus, a hotel and a Bristol-Myers Squibb campus.
''You couldn't afford to build a property like this today,'' said Kurt M. Eichler, a principal at LCOR Inc., which developed the property with Ivy Equities. Intercontinental Real Estate Corporation provided $70 million in equity drawn from New Jersey labor union pension funds. The development created more than 500 union construction jobs.
Ivy Equities bought the campus at the height of the real estate boom in 2006, when Merrill Lynch occupied it. The asset management firm BlackRock became the tenant after its merger with Merrill Lynch, but occupied only part of the building. By 2009, it was clear BlackRock would not renew the lease, leaving a hole in a vital commercial corridor.
''Finding a tenant to take up a big building that could have been a dinosaur is pretty important,'' said Milton H. Charbonneau, a principal at the real estate firm Cassidy Turley who specializes in the Princeton market. ''This particular corridor is arguably one of the most important corridors in the Princeton area.''
Developers convinced Novo that a renovation would be faster and cheaper than new construction. Renovating the property took 21 months, whereas new construction could have taken two or three years and would have involved a complicated approval process from the municipality.
Rent was ultimately cheaper, too. Novo Nordisk is paying less than $30 a square foot in rent, about 8 to 10 percent less than it would have paid for new construction, according to Mr. Eichler. Novo Nordisk signed a 15-year lease and now occupies about 500,000 square feet of the building. It plans to expand into the remaining space over time. It still leases 167,000 square feet of office space elsewhere in Plainsboro.
The renovated building bears little resemblance to its dated predecessor. The new skin added 40 percent more glass, transforming dark hallways into interior balconies overlooking the preserve, which has a mile-long walking path. The lobby now has dramatic 30-foot high ceilings with evergreens growing inside. And a 4,100-square-foot roof deck made of Brazilian ipe wood has a barbecue, kitchen and patio seating.
Anthony P. DiTommaso Jr., co-chief executive of Ivy Equities, said: ''The building always had great bones, it was the facade that was the problem.''

HEADLINE: Housing Data Helps Propel Markets

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wall Street closed higher on Tuesday, fueled by new data showing a strengthening housing market in the United States and supportive comments from central banks around the world.
By the end of trading, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 0.6 percent higher, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite was 0.9 percent higher. 
Markets were bolstered by a report that American home prices rose 1.1 percent in March, according to the Standard & Poor's Case Schiller index. Analysts were looking for a rise of 1 percent. It was the biggest annual gain in nearly seven years, and a further sign that the strengthening housing recovery is providing a source of support for the economy.
Prices in the 20 cities jumped 10.9 percent year over year, beating expectations for 10.2 percent. It was the biggest increase since April 2006, just before prices peaked in the summer of that year.
Further encouraging the market, data showed consumer confidence was the strongest in over five years in May.
Both the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank reaffirmed that their policies would remain in place. On Monday, when United States markets were closed for the Memorial Day holiday, an executive board member of the European Central Bank, Joerg Asmussen, said the policy would stay as long as necessary. On Tuesday, a Bank of Japan board member, Ryuzo Miyao, said it was vital to keep long- and short-term interest rates stable.
Monetary stimulus from central banks has been a major contributor to Wall Street's gains this year, lifting the S.&P. 500 more than 15 percent. Analysts have also cited earnings growth and relatively cheap valuations as reasons investors have used any market decline as a buying opportunity, helping lift both the S.&P. and Dow to a series of new highs. Last week, major American indexes posted their first negative week since mid-April on lingering concerns that the Federal Reserve may scale back its stimulus measures sooner than expected.
''Whenever the Fed starts slowing its stimulus, that will have an impact on markets, but there's enough strength out of retail and housing that we can sustain our gains, especially with Japan making it very clear what its policy will be,'' said Tad Hill, chief executive of Freedom Financial Group in Birmingham, Ala.
Cyclical sectors, which are closely tied to the pace of economic growth, are likely to advance on any sign of continued supportive policies. Bank of America rose 0.8 percent while Citigroup was 2.5 percent higher.
Luxury retailer Tiffany & Company on Tuesday reported adjusted earnings and sales that beat expectations, sending shares up 4 percent.
Abercrombie & Fitch late Friday reported a drop in first-quarter same-store sales that was steeper than expected and cut its full-year profit view. Its shares fell 1.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Unlike Liberty Reserve, Bitcoin Is Not Anonymous - Yet

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH


HIGHLIGHT: Contrary to conventional wisdom, Bitcoin is not anonymous. Though some cryptographers believe with some additional code, it could be. 

 BODY:
After Liberty Reserve, an online payment system, was shut down by law enforcement authorities Tuesday, many wondered whether Bitcoin, the digital currency, would be next.
Just a couple of years ago, a large pepperoni pizza would have cost you 10,000 Bitcoins. Now, a single Bitcoin is worth roughly $129. Bitcoin's meteoric rise has been driven up largely by speculators who believe, like gold, it could be a haven from the fluctuations of other currencies. But in small part, that hyper-inflation also has been driven by those who believe the digital currency provides anonymous cover for illicit transactions.
Silk Road, a black market for illegal drugs, relies on Bitcoin. Assassins are also apparently big fans. (On the far, other end of the spectrum, it turns out the Winklevoss twins are also believers). 
But contrary to conventional wisdom, Bitcoin is not anonymous. In fact, security experts say that if prosecutions like Liberty Reserve continue, the most likely targets are major payment systems like WebMoney and eForexGold, payment systems that security experts contend allow their users to move capital anywhere in the world without verifying their identities.
"There are a multitude of anonymous payments systems out there, similar to Liberty Reserve, of which there are over 100," said Tom Kellermann, a vice president of the security company Trend Micro. "Many pretend to 'know thy customer' but do not actually do due diligence."
Bitcoin operates with greater transparency than those systems. It may be fully decentralized and requires no central bank or government authority, but Bitcoin transactions are as public - if not more so - than any other payment network. Each transaction is recorded in a public ledger, called a "block chain," to keep people from writing the digital equivalent of a bad check. That public block chain makes it possible to trace transactions, even years after they have transpired. In one case, researchers were able to trace the spending of 25,000 stolen Bitcoins in 2011.
Laundry services like Bitlaundry and Bitcoinlaundry make transactions harder to trace. But it's unclear how long those services can operate with impunity after the Liberty Reserve shutdown. It also requires a fair amount of blind trust to assume that such services won't themselves track - or steal - a users' Bitcoins.
With some additional code, however, cryptographers believe Bitcoin could finally live up to its covert reputation. At an annual security and privacy symposium in San Francisco last week, a group of cryptographers from Johns Hopkins University debuted Zerocoin, a Bitcoin add-on that if widely adopted could make Bitcoin transactions impossible to trace.
The cryptographers, Ian Miers, Christina Garman, Matthew Green and Aviel D. Rubin, believe Zerocoin could eventually "break the link between individual Bitcoin transactions without adding trusted parties."
The cryptography will make your head spin - a full technical explanation is available here - but Mr. Miers likened Zerocoin to an in-house laundry service. Essentially, the Zerocoin add-on allows users to leave their Bitcoins floating in a wash, for someone else to grab, so long as they can redeem the same amount of Bitcoin in the future.
There are some significant caveats. For Zerocoin to work, it will eventually require full-scale adoption. "People have to have faith in the currency system to actually use it," Mr. Miers said.
Zerocoins also require more computing power, which can lead to glitches and lag times. A complete transaction takes about two seconds to verify, which can be unpalatable to impatient users. Another challenge, Mr. Miers said, is explaining the "heavyweight crypto" to users.
"As complicated as Bitcoin is, you can explain the crypto even to nonexperts," Mr. Green wrote in a blog post last month. "Unfortunately Zerocoin is a different animal. It will take time to convince people that these new techniques are safe."
But the biggest challenge, in light of Tuesday's indictment of Liberty Reserve, could be government interference.
Law enforcement officials have largely left Bitcoin alone. One exception was earlier this month when the federal authorities seized accounts associated with Mutum Sigillum, an intermediary of Mt. Gox, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange. But according to the warrant, the accounts were seized because Mutum Sigillum had not properly registered as a money transmitter with the Treasury Department.
If Bitcoin became a truly anonymous payment system, security experts say it would spur far greater scrutiny if it hasn't already.

HEADLINE: Recessions Save Lives

BYLINE: CASEY MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Deaths from most causes decline along with the business cycle, an oddity that calls for further study not just of what causes recessions but also of what determines mortality, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
More people die in economic expansions, and fewer die in recessions. Whether and how policy makers should heed this pattern depends on the hitherto unknown links between mortality and economic activity.
Recessions can be stressful and depressing, especially for the people who lose their jobs. Suicide rates spike during recessions, and for that reason alone recessions have been called deadly. Two researchers, David Stuckler and Sanjay Basu, noted that suicides and binge drinking are positively correlated with unemployment and concluded that "Austerity kills" by adding to unemployment.
Even if we could be sure that austerity and related fiscal policies create recessions, it would be premature to conclude that they literally kill people. Industrial and construction accidents are more common in economic expansions, and less common in recessions because those industries' activities follow the business cycle. Overtime hours may be more dangerous than average, and overtime is more common at the peak of the business cycle. Moreover, the share of people working in construction - one of the most hazardous industries - increases during expansions and falls during recessions. 
Highway accidents also follow the business cycle because more vehicles are on the road during economic expansions, and fewer on the road during recessions. (Mr. Stuckley and Mr. Basu noted that the United States' Great Depression of the 1930s also had abnormally low rates of fatalities due to traffic accidents.) 
With more accidents at work and on the road during expansions, expansions have more deaths by such accidents, and recessions have fewer.
It turns out that the business cycle for suicides is more than offset by the business cycle for other deaths. Mortality and the unemployment rate are negatively correlated. Christopher J. Ruhm, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Virginia, has looked at all causes of death and found that most of them - suicide was the exception - occur less frequently at the depths of the business cycle.
Perhaps most surprising is that the business cycle for overall deaths is dominated by the business cycle for deaths among elderly people, perhaps especially elderly women. Because so many elderly people are retired, they are especially unlikely to have recently been laid off from their job (which can lead to suicide), to drive their car to work hurriedly, or to take part in a dangerous construction project.
We don't really know how the business cycle for economic activity is connected to the cycle for elderly deaths. One hypothesis is that economic expansions create air pollution, and air pollution kills elderly people. Another hypothesis is that nursing homes have more trouble retaining their staffs during expansions because they have to compete with other businesses. Perhaps family members who are busy at work during expansions spend less time helping their elderly relatives.
Life is valuable, so it may be at least as important to understand what determines mortality and its cycles as it is to understand what causes recessions.

HEADLINE: Dymaxion Car Plans Resurface

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Plans for Buckminster Fuller&#8217;s 1930s-futuristic teardrop-shaped car have resurfaced, offering a peak into the creative process of an unorthodox thinker. 

 BODY:
Every once in a while, a car so brilliant and forward thinking comes along, it just can't be ignored. Only it can. Some have a few moments of glory - the Tucker Torpedo, the General Motors EV1, and perhaps even the Fisker Karma, for example - and others don't. The three-wheel Dymaxion car is one of those; the teardrop-shaped, 1930s-vintage car of the future that never made it into production.
But there was a lot to like about the Buckminster Fuller-designed Dymaxion. Part of his Dymaxion brand - Dymaxion being an amalgamation of dynamic, maximum and tension - the 1933 car filled out a design lineup that included a house, a world map and Mr. Fuller's own, oddly constructed sleep schedule (which consisted of 30-minute naps throughout the day). 
Although it was unlikely that the Dymaxion car would ever find its way onto an automotive assembly line, such a thing was not even a possibility until recently. The plans had been lost. But they have resurfaced in a Dudley, Mass., house that was once a boarding house where Fuller stayed during his days working with the automobile coachbuilder, Waterhouse Company, in nearby Webster, Mass.
In its day, and even now, the Dymaxion was pretty far afield of other automotive designs. It could seat 11 people, had a recorded top speed of 90 miles per hour, and with its rear-mounted, 85-horsepower Ford flathead V-8 engine, which sat near a single rear wheel and powered the car's two front wheels, the car could get up to 30 miles per gallon.
Think about how rare that has been until fairly recently. Except for that brief flash of gutless, albeit lightweight, late-'80s and early-'90s econoboxes, not many cars capable of carrying more than four people could boast fuel economy numbers that high. Even the truly advanced vehicles that have made it into production recently haven't really done much to blow conventional modes of personal transport out of the water.
Recently, though, Volkswagen announced that it would build only 250 of its XL1 models, a super efficient, aerodynamic little car whose '90s-vintage futuristic looks and 261-mile-per-gallon fuel economy ought to have thrifty buyers clamoring for more. But it is unlikely to be sold in America. Despite that it's a hybrid diesel - people can't still be afraid of hybrids or diesels, right? - hybrids have been around long enough that it should be normal by now, and we're far enough removed from the horrors of that G.M. catastrophe known as the Oldsmobile diesel V-8 to have gotten over that phobia.
But I digress. Despite their wind-cheating weirdness, Dymaxion cars relied upon conventional powertrains. It was the wheel layout and steering that defied established normality. And people, somewhat predictably, did not bite.
Fuller built only three Dymaxion cars. After car No. 1 crashed in an accident at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, no one with enough money to make it a production reality would touch the car. Steered by its rear wheel, directional control wasn't as straightforward as cars steered by their front wheels, and the difference factored into speculation about the crash. Right or wrong, the rumors jelled mistrust of the car's design.
According to Noel Murphy, the author of a not-yet-finished documentary about the Dymaxion car - "The Last Dymaxion" - car No. 1, which had been damaged in the World's Fair crash, finally met its end in 1941, when it caught fire in North Carolina. He said that No. 3 ended up being unceremoniously scrapped in a Wichita, Kan., junkyard at some point. Car No. 2 is the last surviving original, having made its way through the hands of several less-than-illustrious owners before being acquired by William Harrah, the Las Vegas casino executive.
When Harrah died in 1978, most of his cars were sent to the auction block. But a handful, including the Dymaxion, ended up in the then new National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nev., where it remains today.
The owner of the house where the plans were found in the living room is keeping his identity and address quiet. But that did not stop the lucky finder from researching what the plans were for, which eventually led to a connection with Mr. Murphy. Now, the two are in agreement that the plans should be sold at auction to raise money for Mr. Murphy to complete his documentary.
Maybe the plans' new owners will take the design and create something new with it. Even though Crossthwaite & Gardiner spent two and a half years building a more or less perfect reproduction, blueprints can tell so much more about the hows and whys of a car's build. With modern guts, a three-wheel modern day Dymaxion car - one with a stronger, lighter body (that won't lead to the death of its occupants, preferably) could someday become a reality. Think about it; a real space age Dymaxion ...
Or not, but one can always hope that something weird like that will actually be produced, curing us, at least temporarily, of our fear of the different.
The auction will be held on June 6, at the Wright Auction House in Chicago.

HEADLINE: What Indian Firms Should Know About U.S. and U.K. Corruption Laws

BYLINE: ROBERT AMAEE and CASEY COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: Robert Amaee and Casey Cooper, partners in international law firm Covington &#038; Burling, offer advice to Indian companies. 

 BODY:
The increasing number of high-profile corruption investigations of multinational companies, initiated in the United States and Britain, highlights the significant risks faced by foreign businesses that may be tempted to pay bribes in India. But could the enhanced American and British enforcement efforts ensnare Indian companies as well? 
Quite possibly, according to Robert Amaee and Casey Cooper, who are London-based partners in the global anticorruption practice at Covington & Burling, a leading international law firm. If a local company has any dealings with the United States or Britain, they say, it could fall under the jurisdiction of these countries' antibribery laws, like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States and the Bribery Act of 2010 in Britain. 
Here at India Ink, Mr. Amaee and Mr. Cooper offer several hypothetical examples to help businesses avoid running afoul of laws they may not be aware of. 
 Q. 
You are an executive with a midsized auto parts company based in Chennai. The company has grown quickly and now has sales offices in several international locations, including in Britain. You have just learned that one of your top sales agents in Asia has been achieving his great numbers by paying kickbacks to commercial customers in Thailand. Should you be concerned about the British bribery law?
 A. 
Absolutely. Any Indian company that "carries on a business" - or even "part of" a business - in Britain should be concerned about the Bribery Act of 2010. The U.K. Bribery Act makes it a crime for a company to fail to prevent bribes being paid on its behalf anywhere in the world. So the fact that you have a British sales office could expose your company to criminal liability under British law, even for bribes paid in Thailand. That's the bad news.
The good news is that companies can defend themselves against a "failure to prevent" charge by developing and putting in place a tailored antibribery compliance program. We suggest that any Indian company conducting business in Britain that has not yet adopted such a compliance program should start doing so immediately.
 Q. 
You are general manager of a Mumbai-based construction company. The company is privately held and has no operations outside of India. The company is part of an international consortium, including a United States-based company that recently bid on a large contract to renovate a port administered by one of the coastal states. You've just attended a meeting in which the consortium's management committee proposed the making of a large contribution to a charity that is run by the wife of the general manager of the port. Should you worry about this contribution under the American anti-corruption law?
 A. 
Yes. The fact that the port is operated by a state government probably would make the port manager a "government official" under the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If the purpose of the contribution was to influence the port manager to support the consortium's bid - a reasonable inference given the timing of the contribution - then United States prosecutors would likely view the contribution as an official bribe, even if there was no direct evidence that part of the contribution wound up in the pocket of the port official.
Although the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ordinarily would not reach a purely domestic Indian company that authorized the payment of bribes to an Indian official, the presence of the American consortium member could expose both you and your company to United States jurisdiction, depending on the specific facts.
In 2011, the Justice Department was able to prosecute a Japanese construction company with no connection whatsoever to the United States because it was a member of a joint venture, which included an American company, that paid bribes to Nigerian officials in order to win a contract. So you should talk to your company's lawyer about that contribution before it is made.
 Q. 
Your company doesn't sell to government customers so you would never need to bribe a public official to get a contract. Why should you care about foreign bribery laws?
 A. 
Here are two reasons. First, while your company may not have government customers, it almost certainly will interact with government officials on a regular basis. Bribes to permitting officials, customs officers, tax authorities, policemen, and a variety of other government representative are prohibited under American and British bribery laws. If you pay or your company pays bribes to those officials, and is otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of American or British laws, you and the company may be exposed to foreign criminal liability.
Second, the British bribery law applies not only to bribery of public officials, but commercial bribery as well. So, for example, bribing a purchasing agent of one of your Indian customers to induce him to select your products could violate British law if your company has business operations, such as a sales office, in Britain.
 Q. 
You understand all that, but your company uses agents to deal with things like customs clearance and permits. You pay the agent a lump sum and what they do with the money is none of your business, right?
 A. 
Wrong. It is your business. Companies subject to the jurisdiction of the American or British bribery laws can be held liable if agents acting on their behalf pay bribes. We suggest that any company intending to use an agent to deal with customs clearance or permits should satisfy itself that the agent will act in a lawful and ethical manner. You could look to satisfy yourself, for example, by conducting appropriate checks on the proposed agent before agreeing to take them on and requiring the agent to sign a contract with you and provide receipts that accurately account for the money that you will be paying to the agent. The agent could also be required to submit to a financial audit in the event that your company develops reasonable concerns about the agent's use of company funds.
 Q. 
The World Bank is financing a health systems project in Karnataka, focused on improving public-private collaboration. You are an executive of a company that provides mobile healthcare facilities. Your company is pitching for a contract with the Department of Health and Family Welfare. You have just learned that a key decision-maker's son has been offered a job with your company. Should you worry about that offer under the World Bank sanctions regime?
 A. 
Yes. The World Bank requires borrowers, bidders, suppliers, contractors and their agents to observe the highest standard of ethics during the procurement and execution of World Bank financed contracts. If the purpose of the job offer was to improve your company's chances of being selected as a partner on the project - a likely inference based on the circumstances - the World Bank could view the job offer as a bribe and may seek to debar your company from being awarded World Bank financed contracts, and from being nominated as a sub-contractor, consultant, supplier or service provider in connection with such contracts.

HEADLINE: Needing Pork, China Is to Buy a U.S. Supplier

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and DAVID BARBOZA


HIGHLIGHT: The $4.7 billion offer by Shuanghui International for Smithfield Foods is one of the biggest moves yet by a Chinese company into the United States. 

 BODY:
 8:49 p.m. | Updated 
Demand for pork in China reflects its booming economy and rising middle class. But that rapidly growing appetite has strained its food production systems, leading to breakdowns and a number of food safety scandals.
Now China's biggest pork producer, seeking plentiful supplies and technical expertise, has agreed to buy Smithfield Foods, the 87-year-old Virginia-based meat giant with brands like Armour and Farmland, for $4.7 billion in cash.
If completed, the deal that was announced on Wednesday would be the biggest takeover of an American company by a Chinese concern. But it must first overcome skepticism in Washington - and a potentially close examination process by United States regulators. Both Smithfield and its suitor, Shuanghui International, said that they will submit the deal for review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, a panel of government agencies tasked with clearing deals for national security.
Typically, the committee is concerned with acquisitions that involve technology or vital natural resources. The nation's food supply chain is not specifically mentioned in its mandate, but the panel's jurisdiction is considered broad. Among the deals it has reviewed and approved in recent months are the proposed takeover of Nexen Energy by a Chinese oil company and the proposed sale of control of Sprint Nextelto a Japanese telecommunications firm. 
The committee may consider whether Shuanghui has ties to organizations like the Chinese army, as well as whether Smithfield's customer rolls include sensitive information like the locations of secure military installations.
"There's a difference between a foreign company buying Boeing and one buying a hot dog stand," said Jonathan Gafni, president of Compass Point Analytics, who was involved with the foreign investment committee when he was a deputy national intelligence officer. "But it depends on which corner the stand is on."
Still, he expects the deal to pass muster.
Other hurdles lie in wait. A takeover by a Chinese company - because of well-publicized food safety scandals in that country - could prompt concerns among American consumers and consumer groups, who may worry that Shuanghui will ultimately export the pork it produces in China to the United States.
Smithfield and Shuanghui said that the deal was meant to do the opposite: increase exports of American products to China, already the nation's third-largest export market for pork. Meat consumption in China has exploded over the past decade because of a growing middle class and a shift in diet from rice and vegetables to more protein.
"This transaction will allow us to access Asia in a big way," C. Larry Pope, Smithfield's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. "This is an export deal, and they are very interested in exporting products out of the U.S."
Even so, many critics of Wednesday's deal fear that the Chinese company may eventually seek to sell meat to the United States.
"They're already trying to send their chicken products over here," said Stanley Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Local Unions, which represents federal inspectors. "So I'm of the opinion this is going to get their foot in the door, letting them claim, We're an American-based company now, and so why would you try to block us?"
China is no stranger to complaints about food quality. In recent years, the Chinese government has announced a crackdown on food makers while it also deals with an outbreak of bird flu and images of thousands of dead pigs floating in the Huangpu River in Shanghai.
The advantage of acquiring Smithfield is that it would give Chinese consumers greater access to imported meat that meets stricter food safety standards.
And China is struggling to produce its own supply. The nation's production is considered inefficient and costly. Farms are smaller, and production and processing facilities are less sophisticated.
Although China, the world's biggest market for pork, has begun introducing bigger farms and processing facilities, the country is still dominated by family-style farms and logistical bottlenecks that raise the cost of producing pork and other meat products.
"They're not very efficient at producing it, which is why they're importing it from us," said David Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, a trade group based in Washington.
By comparison, the United States has ample grain and space for enormous hog farms. Last year, American producers exported about $866 million in pork products to China, 14 percent of all United States pork exports.
Some food experts said that Chinese ownership should not affect food safety at Smithfield. The company has had a good record on controlling pathogens, said Bill Marler, a Seattle-based lawyers who represents the victims of food-borne illnesses.
"They have had few recalls, and none that I know of that were ever linked to illnesses," he said.
On the other hand, Shuanghui, which also goes by the English name Shineway Group, has struggled with food quality issues.
Two years ago, China's biggest state-run television company, China Central Television, broadcast an investigation that found that Shuanghui was selling pork produced with clenbuterol, which is banned as a food additive in the United States, the European Union and China because of health risks.
That year, the country arrested scores of people for producing, selling and using clenbuterol, which is believed to produce leaner meat.
Shuanghui apologized and promised to improve its food safety program.
Founded nearly 20 years ago, the company was a state-run enterprise until a division of Goldman Sachs and CDH Investments, one of China's leading private equity firms, paid more than $100 million several years ago to buy out the government's interest.
Shuanghui now has a publicly listed company and other food divisions with assets of more than $5 billion.
Wednesday's deal fulfills a major ambition of the Chinese government, to encourage companies to venture abroad by acquiring assets, resources and technical expertise. In North America, Africa and Australia, Chinese companies, flush with cash, are buying up land and resources to help a country that is plagued by water shortages and short of arable land, a situation exacerbated by a long running property and infrastructure boom.
In the meat industry, few companies loom larger than Smithfield, an empire whose operations extend from raising pigs to processing them into ham and pork for an array of customers. Founded as a packing plant in the Virginia town that shares the company's name, it has since grown into a behemoth that reaped $13 billion in revenue last year.
Under the terms of the deal, Shuanghui will pay $34 a share for Smithfield, which is 31 percent above the company's closing share price on Tuesday.
Smithfield and Shuanghui have long had ties, and over the past four years the companies discussed ways to cement an alliance. Shuanghui has been especially keen to find ways to increase the amount of pork it could import from the United States.
Late last year, Mr. Pope, Smithfield's chief executive, said the two discussed buying stakes in each other. Around March, an adviser to Shuanghui called Smithfield and offered a different approach: an outright takeover of the American company.
"They said, 'Larry, let's make this thing happen. We think you're going to like it,' " Mr. Pope said.
But Smithfield had received takeover proposals from two other foreign suitors before signing its deal with Shuanghui, according to people briefed on the matter.
Smithfield was advised by Barclays and the law firms Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and McGuireWoods. Shuanghui was advised by Morgan Stanley and the law firms Paul Hastings and Troutman Sanders.
 Michael Moss and Mark Scott contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: China's Big Food Deal

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: SoftBank and Sprint Nextel clear a hurdle. | Switzerland to allow its banks to sidestep secrecy laws. | A hotel company is hobbled by a deal struck with Burkle&#8217;s investment firm in bad times. 

 BODY:
The Shuanghui Group of China agreed on Wednesday to buy the American meat processor Smithfield Foods for about $4.7 billion, the two companies announced on Wednesday.
Shuanghui, which is the largest pork processor in China, will pay $34 a share to acquire Smithfield, 31 percent above the company's closing share price on Tuesday.
The deal is subject to regulatory approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and is expected to close in the second half of the year.
"This is a great transaction for all Smithfield stakeholders, as well as for American farmers and U.S. agriculture," C. Larry Pope, Smithfield's chief executive, said in a statement. "It will be business as usual - only better - at Smithfield. We do not anticipate any changes in how we do business operationally in the United States and throughout the world." 
SOFTBANK AND SPRINT CLEAR A HURDLE | SoftBank of Japan has reached an agreement to win national security clearance for its $20.1 billion bid for Sprint Nextel, surmounting one of the biggest hurdles to the deal, Michael J. de la Merced writes in DealBook.
To pass the review by a government panel, both SoftBank and Sprint agreed to a number of concessions. For example, the companies will give the United States veto power over a director on the new board of Sprint, the member who would be responsible for overseeing compliance with national security.
The government panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, had until midnight Tuesday to render its verdict.
Now SoftBank and Sprint must win over the Federal Communications Commission, which is expected to finish its review in a week or so, and Sprint shareholders, who are scheduled to vote on June 12.
SWISS TAX-EVASION CASE | The Swiss government said on Wednesday that it would let its banks sidestep the country's secrecy laws to disclose names of clients in a move intended to help resolve a long-running dispute with the United States over tax evasion, Julia Werdigier and Lynnley Browning report in DealBook.
The decision is a turning point in what has been an escalating conflict between the two countries. Switzerland's finance minister said the move would probably enable Swiss banks to accept an offer by the United States government to hand over client details in exchange for a promise against future legal repercussions.
"It is important for us to be able to let the past be the past," Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the finance minister, said at a news briefing in Bern, Switzerland. She declined to give any details about the program but said banks would have one year to decide whether to accept the American offer. 
ON THE AGENDA | The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is scheduled to release its latest batch of bank results, including troubled institutions. Paul Volcker will speak at the Economic Club of New York.
FIGHT OVER BURKLE AND HOTELS | The Delano South Beach and the Royalton hotels may swathe their guests in comfort. But their parent company is locked in a bruising battle between some of its investors and Ronald W. Burkle, the billionaire investor.
The Morgans Hotel Group, owner and manager of the boutique hotels, struck a rescue investment deal with Mr. Burkle's Yucaipa Companies in late 2009 on onerous terms, Steven M. Davidoff writes in his Deal Professor column. Mr. Burkle has since taken more control, including amassing 27.9 percent of Morgans and $88 million of its debt.
Now the hotelier has agreed to give Mr. Burkle's investment firm several properties to cancel some of its debt, in exchange for the billionaire's backing a $100 million rights issuance. That has angered OTK Associates, the vehicle of other big investors in Morgans, which has taken the matter to court.
"You can't blame Yucaipa for acting in its self-interest, but you can blame Morgans' management then for failing to appreciate the consequences" of its rescue deal, Mr. Davidoff writes.

HEADLINE: China's Big Food Deal

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: SoftBank and Sprint Nextel clear a hurdle. | Switzerland to allow its banks to sidestep secrecy laws. | A hotel company is hobbled by a deal struck with Burkle&#8217;s investment firm in bad times. 

 BODY:
The Shuanghui Group of China agreed on Wednesday to buy the American meat processor Smithfield Foods for about $4.7 billion, the two companies announced on Wednesday.
Shuanghui, which is the largest pork processor in China, will pay $34 a share to acquire Smithfield, 31 percent above the company's closing share price on Tuesday.
The deal is subject to regulatory approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and is expected to close in the second half of the year.
"This is a great transaction for all Smithfield stakeholders, as well as for American farmers and U.S. agriculture," C. Larry Pope, Smithfield's chief executive, said in a statement. "It will be business as usual - only better - at Smithfield. We do not anticipate any changes in how we do business operationally in the United States and throughout the world." 
SOFTBANK AND SPRINT CLEAR A HURDLE | SoftBank of Japan has reached an agreement to win national security clearance for its $20.1 billion bid for Sprint Nextel, surmounting one of the biggest hurdles to the deal, Michael J. de la Merced writes in DealBook.
To pass the review by a government panel, both SoftBank and Sprint agreed to a number of concessions. For example, the companies will give the United States veto power over a director on the new board of Sprint, the member who would be responsible for overseeing compliance with national security.
The government panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, had until midnight Tuesday to render its verdict.
Now SoftBank and Sprint must win over the Federal Communications Commission, which is expected to finish its review in a week or so, and Sprint shareholders, who are scheduled to vote on June 12.
SWISS TAX-EVASION CASE | The Swiss government said on Wednesday that it would let its banks sidestep the country's secrecy laws to disclose names of clients in a move intended to help resolve a long-running dispute with the United States over tax evasion, Julia Werdigier and Lynnley Browning report in DealBook.
The decision is a turning point in what has been an escalating conflict between the two countries. Switzerland's finance minister said the move would probably enable Swiss banks to accept an offer by the United States government to hand over client details in exchange for a promise against future legal repercussions.
"It is important for us to be able to let the past be the past," Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the finance minister, said at a news briefing in Bern, Switzerland. She declined to give any details about the program but said banks would have one year to decide whether to accept the American offer. 
ON THE AGENDA | The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is scheduled to release its latest batch of bank results, including troubled institutions. Paul Volcker will speak at the Economic Club of New York.
FIGHT OVER BURKLE AND HOTELS | The Delano South Beach and the Royalton hotels may swathe their guests in comfort. But their parent company is locked in a bruising battle between some of its investors and Ronald W. Burkle, the billionaire investor.
The Morgans Hotel Group, owner and manager of the boutique hotels, struck a rescue investment deal with Mr. Burkle's Yucaipa Companies in late 2009 on onerous terms, Steven M. Davidoff writes in his Deal Professor column. Mr. Burkle has since taken more control, including amassing 27.9 percent of Morgans and $88 million of its debt.
Now the hotelier has agreed to give Mr. Burkle's investment firm several properties to cancel some of its debt, in exchange for the billionaire's backing a $100 million rights issuance. That has angered OTK Associates, the vehicle of other big investors in Morgans, which has taken the matter to court.
"You can't blame Yucaipa for acting in its self-interest, but you can blame Morgans' management then for failing to appreciate the consequences" of its rescue deal, Mr. Davidoff writes.

HEADLINE: Lobbying for the Greater Good

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Most citizens don&#8217;t believe they can influence public opinion or policy. But groups like the Citizens Climate Lobby and Results are showing that they can. 

 BODY:
Earlier this month, scientists reported that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had reached 400 parts per million. It's an alarming milestone, to be sure, but, alas, there is no shortage of dire warnings about global warming. What is lacking is the political will to address the problem. The big question is, what useful steps can citizens take to build that will?
If you pose that question to the leading climate scientist James E. Hansen, he'll tell you to connect with the Citizens Climate Lobby (C.C.L.). "They have the potential to be extremely effective," he said. "That's why I recommend them in my speeches. They're doubling in size each year. And they're pursuing the right policy." 
The C.C.L. is a relatively unknown organization that punches above its weight. Founded in 2007, the organization prepares citizens to be effective lobbyists, helping them build relationships with members of Congress and editorial page editors, showing them how to make persuasive arguments about policies to win bipartisan support. Currently, the group's main focus is to build political will for a revenue-neutral carbon tax, a policy that has been supported by economists across the political spectrum and has demonstrated environmental and economic benefits, most recently, in the province of British Columbia and in Ireland. But a carbon tax faces serious political hurdles in the United States.
With a staff of 9 and about 700 active volunteers, the C.C.L. reports that last year it conducted 534 meetings with members of Congress or the Canadian Parliament or their staffs; met with 24 newspaper editorial boards; published 537 letters to the editor; and directly prompted or placed 174 editorials, op-eds or articles, all focusing on this policy. This year, the group is on track to double or triple its outreach.
"The Citizens Climate Lobby is taking very sophisticated ideas and putting them into letters and op-eds and face-to-face meetings with members of Congress," explained Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who served 12 years in the House of Representatives and now directs the Energy and Enterprise Initiative at George Mason University. "I think they've moved the needle on this issue."
The C.C.L. was founded by Marshall Saunders, a retired businessman living in San Diego who had previously spent 12 years volunteering for a grass-roots lobby called Results, which has had major success building support in Congress for initiatives aimed at basic needs for the poor. One morning, Saunders read that Congress had just approved $18 billion in new subsidies for oil and coal companies and he decided that Results' approach needed to be deployed to the climate crisis.
To understand C.C.L., it's necessary to understand Results, which remains one of the best-kept secrets in development. Since the 1980s, Results has played a unique role in helping to direct billions of dollars of government funding toward child survival, microfinance, education and health. It has done it with an army of volunteers and almost no fanfare. "Results has such a lean and efficient model that nobody knows about them," explained Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. "They're incredibly dedicated and very knowledgeable about the issues. It's remarkable how much they've done and how few people have any idea about it."
Results was founded in 1980 by Sam Daley-Harris, a former music teacher and percussionist for the Miami Philharmonic. In the late 1970s, Daley-Harris read the report from Jimmy Carter's Presidential Commission on Hunger and decided to help build political will to address hunger. Speaking with groups of high school students, he was dismayed that only 3 percent could name their member of Congress. "They didn't know it because they didn't use it," he recalled. "And they didn't use it because they didn't see a reason to."
He saw two big problems to overcome:
First, citizens didn't believe they could directly influence public opinion or policies. It never occurred to most people that they could initiate a meeting with a member of Congress or a newspaper's editorial board and shape the outcome.
Second, citizens needed a structure to be effective. Results developed a platform to embolden volunteers, providing them with information, coaching, role-playing, action plans and practical feedback. "It's not about staff in Washington or celebrities," explained Joanne Carter, the group's executive director. "It's about individuals in their communities who are supported and have educated themselves to a point where they can be triggers to make policy happen."
Today, the group has about 1,000 active volunteers spread across 100 communities in 37 states and six countries. Consider some of the impact they have had:
In the 1980s, Results volunteers worked with Jim Grant, the director of Unicef, who was leading a "child survival revolution" focused on extending lifesaving efforts like vaccinations and oral rehydration globally. To build bipartisan support, volunteers reached out to elected officials and newspaper editors across the United States, generating 90 editorials. Subsequently, government funding for child survival increased from $25 million to $75 million. "To a great extent, it was because of the receptivity created by Results that the United States funding for child survival increased so dramatically. And that led many other countries to come on board," recalled Kul Chandra Gautam, formerly Unicef's deputy executive director, who has recently joined Results' board. Annual funding for child survival and maternal health from the government is now about $600 million; Unicef estimates that the child survival campaign saved the lives of 25 million children.
In the mid-1980s, when Muhammad Yunus, then largely unknown, was working to gain traction for microcredit, Results volunteers reached out to editors and members of Congress, generating 100 editorials that built bipartisan support for the first microfinance legislation. When Yunus recently received the Congressional Gold Medal (which requires approval from two-thirds of the House and Senate), he singled out Results as having been the most critical partner for microcredit. "They are one of the most effective organizations I encounter in Washington," said Representative Rush Holt (D-N.J.), who has worked to increase U.S.A.I.D. funding for microfinance for the very poor. "They're not in it for self-enrichment. They do their homework; they know the facts. They are relentless, but in a very polite way. And they show gratitude."
Results was also the first organization to get members of Congress to focus on tuberculosis, a leading killer especially in poor countries. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who has been a champion in Congress in this fight, recalled: "I got involved in tuberculosis work because a bunch of Results volunteers came to me in Oberlin and Medina, Ohio. They were convincing, well informed and they were persistent."
Jim Yong Kim of the World Bank commented: "Sherrod Brown's efforts with Results have resulted in huge increases in funding for tuberculosis - from $1 million a year to a cumulative $1.8 billion. The scale of it is just extraordinary."
We don't often hear stories like this - stories about ordinary citizens working powerfully side by side with elected officials - particularly citizens who don't come bearing campaign checks. That's why it's important to understand how these changes were achieved, and how much more may be possible than most citizens imagine.
"It's always easier to take the cynical view of politics," said Mark Reynolds, C.C.L.'s executive director. "But if you actually say, 'I'm a citizen. This is a citizen problem,' it gives you an entirely different world to deal with. We adamantly believe that politicians don't create political will, they respond to it."
Daley-Harris was more than pleased to share Results' methodology and advise C.C.L. (He outlines the approach in his book "Reclaiming Our Democracy.") Over the past five years, C.C.L. has become skilled at its techniques. Like Results, the organization holds regular conference calls, shares success stories, and continuously works to help volunteers hone their techniques.
This means getting into the details. How do you summon the courage to call up an important person? How do you approach an editorial writer to get a meeting? How do you develop, refine and deliver a killer "lasertalk" - a brief, compelling, information-packed talk that suggests clear action steps? And how do you build solid relationships with people whose beliefs may be diametrically opposed to yours - a key consideration for the climate issue?
Results and C.C.L. are clear about the benefits of a positive approach. They bet on long-term relationships. As Inglis remarked, "They have a belief that if you don't have something that you can affirm or celebrate in the person you're going to visit, don't go to the visit."
Elli Sparks is a C.C.L. volunteer who started the organization's group in Richmond, Va. One of her early challenges was reaching out to the editors of The Richmond Times Dispatch, a conservative paper that had once criticized her mother, who ran a women's health clinic. She looked for things to appreciate in the editors and she found them, and the meetings have led to valuable outcomes, including an op-ed by Sparks and an influential column by Barton Hinkle supporting a carbon tax.
Sparks and her colleagues have also engaged with their member of Congress, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). In their initial meeting with Cantor's legislative director, Michael Lowry, Sparks announced: "I want Congressman Cantor to be our unlikely climate hero." Since then, her group has met with Lowry four more times. "Each meeting, we present more information and listen to his questions and come back with additional information," she said. On one visit, Lowry raised questions about the sense of alarm around climate change. Sparks returned with another volunteer, Richard Taranto, a retired Navy oceanographer and meteorologist, who shared this presentation.
In June, Sparks is scheduled to meet with Cantor face to face. "My job as I see it is to ask him to do this leadership work, and to build the political will to help other constituents express their desire for his leadership, too. Those are things I can do."
Interviewing Results and C.C.L. volunteers, I'm struck by how many have had the same experience: a kind of revelation at the power they wield as citizens. Madeleine Para, a C.C.L. group leader in Madison, Wis., commented: "I'm not a person who grew up thinking I was going to be talking to my member of Congress or editors of newspapers or any prominent people in society. And the fact that I have figured out that I can do that, and they will listen to me has been exciting. It's pushed me to try other things I didn't think I could do."
Sparks says it's necessary to get out of your "comfort zone." "If it feels comfortable, 'I'm going to sign this petition; I'm going to post it on Facebook,'" she said, "then you're not doing enough to move things forward. You've got to have butterflies in your belly, your heart has to be racing, your palm has to be sweating."
Another surprising message is that citizen lobbyists are appreciated by officeholders, perhaps more than professionals. "The people I always rolled my eyes at were the hired guns," Inglis recalled. "Last week, they were passionate about this; this week they're passionate about something else." While acknowledging the fund-raising pressures faced by elected officials, particularly those in leadership roles, he added, "The hired guns fade into the wallpaper, but the people who are in it with their heart and souls volunteering, they're memorable."
Three years ago, Daley-Harris and Saunders were told that a carbon tax "would be laughed off the table." Now it's not only on the table, it appears to be moving toward the center, with proposed legislation in the Senate, the American Enterprise Institute having co-sponsored an event to discuss the idea, and increasing academic support. The more citizens push for it through direct channels, the more the chance it will come to pass.
Meanwhile, Daley-Harris has launched a new initiative, the Center for Citizen Empowerment and Transformation, to help other organizations put their citizen lobbying into overdrive. "It's about finding and training that portion of your members who want to go way beyond mouse-click advocacy to creating champions in Congress and the media for your cause," he said.

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Look at other markets. 

 BODY:
I've been getting some questions about the recent rise in long-term interest rates. Those rates are still at levels that would have seemed absurdly low not long ago - but they are up significantly from a few months ago. What should we make of this move? 
Well, rather than offering a commentary on the market, I thought I might be most helpful by talking about how to figure things like this out on a more general basis. And the way you do this is by trying to tell several alternative stories that might explain what's happening in one market, and then ask what those stories imply for other markets.
So when long-term interest rates rise, there are three main stories you hear. One is that the bond vigilantes have arrived, and are selling US debt because they now believe in the horror stories. Another is that the Fed has changed, that it may be ready to snatch away the punch bowl sooner than previously believed. And the third is that the economy is looking stronger than expected, which means that the Fed, although just as soft-hearted as before, will nonetheless start raising rates sooner than previously believed.
All three of these stories would imply falling bond prices, that is, rising interest rates. But they have different implications for other markets, in particular for stocks and the dollar. Debt fears - basically, a run on America - should send stocks and the dollar down along with bonds. A perceived tougher Fed should send stocks down but the dollar up. And a better recovery should send both stocks up (because of higher expected profits) and drive the dollar higher.
OK, there are possible complications; you can manage, just, to tell stories that don't quite work as I've described. But these are surely what you should have in mind in your first pass at the issue. Here it is in a table:
And while day by day there are variations, basically what you see over the last month or so is line 3: falling bond prices accompanied by rising stocks and a rising dollar. So this looks like a story about macroeconomic optimism.

HEADLINE: Tech Career Advice From Google's Women

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: Senior women at Google give career advice from the trenches, as the technology industry seeks to right its gender imbalance. 

 BODY:
The women at Google are outnumbered by the men, as is the case at almost all technology companies. Even so, talented women are playing major roles in building new technology, and they have some advice for others in the field.
"Do something important, think big, have an ambitious goal about how you can change the world," Susan Wojcicki, Google's senior vice president in charge of advertising, said in a session at the company's I/O developers conference this month. 
The advice may sound trite, but it is grounded in real-world experience. Ms. Wojcicki was Google's 16th employee, joining the company after renting the garage of her yellow ranch house to its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. She described them as two guys just out of college who audaciously said they planned to organize the world's information.
Anna Patterson is a vice president of engineering and artificial intelligence at Google. Her advice, which she said she learned from "hacker stories from the trenches," is to persevere. Her case in point: "After having my fourth child, I did what everybody does when they have four kids and they're on maternity leave," she said. "I started a company."
Johanna Wright, a longtime Google search engineer who is now vice president of search and assist at Android, told of how she moved into her father-in-law's house after her start-up went out of business, a situation that people who work in technology should be prepared for, she said.
"It's a disruptive industry," Ms. Wright said. "You, too, might someday be unemployed on your father-in-law's couch. What matters is the energy and tenacity with which you pick up your next job."
Another piece of advice Ms. Wright gave, which helps explain her rise at Google, is that employees should seize opportunities, and managers should ask employees about their desires and believe they can achieve them.
When Ms. Wright was eight months pregnant, she said, she found out that she would need to schedule a Caesarean section. At the same time, her boss suggested that she lead a team of engineers to come up with Google's search strategy for the next year and present it at a meeting when the baby was due.
"On Wednesday I made the strategy presentation, on Thursday I had my baby," Ms. Wright said. "That might be horrifying to some of you, but to me it was invigorating. And it set me up to have a leadership role when I returned."
While there's an image of young women turning away from computer science because they envision it as a boring and lonely occupation, Diane Greene, one of Silicon Valley's biggest successes as the founder of VMware and now a board member at Google, had a different tale to tell.
She grew up sailing, she said, which led her to train as a mechanical engineer. She moved to the Bay Area for the windsurfing, she said, then to Hawaii to live on a commune. That turned into a job running engineering for a windsurfing company, followed by graduate school in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley and jobs at big tech companies.
But first, she said, "I've always really loved adventure, so I took a brief interlude and went to use my computer skills to be the computer expert on a marine archeology expedition, where we excavated a Spanish galleon and found gold."
Still, despite these women's prominent roles at Google, the company has struggled to hire as many women as engineers as men, and has a shrinking number of women in its top ranks. But at the I/O conference, there were several women onstage - a rarity at tech developers' conferences - and Mr. Page, Google's chief executive, said recruiting women was` a priority.
"We've been super focused on that forever," Mr. Page said. "The only answer is we have to start early and make sure we're getting young women and girls really interested in technology. And if we do that, there's no question we'll more than double the rate of technology output in the world."
Google, for instance, gave a grant to the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, to use technology to measure gender bias in entertainment. It turns out that there is only one woman in the whole ocean in "Finding Nemo."
"You manage what you measure," said Megan Smith, a vice president at Google X, the company's laboratory for big new projects.
"Women are largely invisible in technology," she said. "That's part of our failing. So our goal is to increase visibility."
Google's founders, along with their wives, have also given private grants to a project by Kathy Kleiman to document the stories of some of the country's first female programmers. They were crucial to programming the Eniavc, the first all-electronic computer, used by the Army's ballistic research lab.
Ms. Kleiman said her work had already had an effect. One day, her 4-year-old son asked her, "Can men be programmers, too?"

HEADLINE: Berkshire Unit in $5.6 Billion Deal for Nevada's Largest Electric Utility

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: MidAmerican Energy Holdings, part of the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett, agreed to buy Nevada&#8217;s largest electric utility, NV Energy. 

 BODY:
The billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett dived back into the acquisition pool on Wednesday with a large bet in the energy sector. MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a unit of Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, agreed to buy Nevada's largest electric utility, NV Energy, for about $5.6 billion. 
MidAmerican is paying $23.75 a share for NV Energy, a 23 percent premium to the company's closing price on Wednesday. The deal includes the assumption of about $4.5 billion in debt.
The purchase of NV Energy, a utility with about 1.3 million electric and natural gas customers in Nevada, is the largest-ever acquisition made by MidAmerican, which Mr. Buffett bought in 2000. Based in Des Moines, Iowa, MidAmerican serves 7.1 million residents across 10 states. In a statement, Mr. Buffett suggested that the purchase was in part a play on the economic recovery in Nevada, one of the states hit hardest by the housing crisis.
"This is a great fit for Berkshire Hathaway, and we are pleased to make a long-term investment in Nevada's economy," Mr. Buffett said. "Through MidAmerican, we have found in NV Energy a great company with similar values, outstanding assets, and a superb management team."
MidAmerican's acquisition is Mr. Buffett's second big deal this year. In February, Berkshire teamed up with a Brazilian investment group on a $23.6 billion takeover of the ketchup maker H.J. Heinz. In his annual letter to shareholders published in March, Mr. Buffett lamented about his inability to buy a big company in 2012, even with a cash hoard that at the beginning of the year stood at about $42 billion.
"I pursued a couple of elephants, but came up empty-handed," Mr. Buffett wrote. He added: "Charlie and I have again donned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants."
Mr. Buffett has long said that he planned to use MidAmerican as a vehicle to make acquisitions in the power sector. The deal for NV Energy exceeds the company's $5.1 billion acquisiton of PacifiCorp from Britain's Scottish Power in 2005.
In his annual letter, Mr. Buffett lauded the performance of MidAmerican, which he said was one of Berkshire's five most profitable non-insurance companies that together had aggregate pretax earnings of more than $10 billion last year. He called its chief executive, Gregory E. Abel, an "outstanding" leader.
MidAmerican's previous chief executive, David L. Sokol, was a top lieutenant of Mr. Buffett whom was once considered the front-runner to become the next head of Berkshire. He resigned in 2011 after he was accused of violating the company's insider trading policies.
For NV Energy, Lazard served as financial advisor and Sidley Austin and Hogan Lovells provided legal advice. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher served as legal advisor to MidAmerican Energy.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island's Chafee to Join Democratic Party

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, the only Independent governor in the nation and a former Republican senator, plans to switch to the Democratic Party as he faces a tough re-election fight next year. 

 BODY:
BOSTON - Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, the only Independent governor in the nation, plans to switch to the Democratic Party as he faces a tough re-election fight next year. 
Mr. Chafee, who served in the United States Senate as a Republican, had discussed the possibility of becoming a Democrat for months and spoke last year at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.
He was unavailable for comment on Wednesday, but a spokesman, Christian Vareika, confirmed the news after it was first reported by Politico. Mr. Vareika said Mr. Chafee would announce his decision Thursday morning in his hometown, Warwick.
He said the governor had concluded that "the priorities and principles that have guided him throughout his career align with the Democratic Party's," particularly with regard to public education, job creation and equal rights. 
With three-fourths of voters disapproving of his job performance and the state's economy limping along, analysts say that becoming a Democrat may be Mr. Chafee's best shot at winning re-election. His apparent hope is that as a Democrat, President Obama will step in on his behalf and help him through a difficult primary.
Mr. Chafee and Mr. Obama, who overlapped in their short Senate careers, have developed a supportive relationship. Mr. Chafee backed Mr. Obama in his battle against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary in 2008 and supported him again in 2012. 
In turn, Mr. Obama stayed out of the Rhode Island governor's race in 2010 and did not endorse the Democratic candidate "out of respect for his friend Lincoln Chafee," an Obama spokesman said at the time.
In a statement issued Wednesday through the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Obama said, "I'm delighted to hear that Governor Chafee is joining the Democratic Party." But he gave no hint as to whether he would endorse anyone in a Democratic primary.
By contrast, Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, indicated in a statement that the association would stay neutral in any intramural battle. "We are excited to welcome Governor Chafee to the ranks of Democratic governors and look forward to enthusiastically supporting whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee in Rhode Island," he said.
At the moment, Mr. Chafee's prospects for re-election seem fairly low. Various Democrats are lining up to run against him, including two potentially strong contenders: Gina Raimondo, the state treasurer, and Angel Taveras, the mayor of Providence.
"His move comes from thinking, 'If I don't switch parties, I'm going to lose anyway,' " said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University. "And maybe as a Democrat, the president can come out for him wholeheartedly or at least help dry up the funding for the other candidates."
But this will be tricky, she said, in part because Ms. Raimondo is a woman and Mr. Taveras a Latino, both representing important Democratic constituencies. Mr. Chafee is "a white patrician Yankee who was a Republican," Dr. Schiller said.

HEADLINE: The Lock Gets an Update

BYLINE: JENNA WORTHAM


HIGHLIGHT: The August Smart Lock can be installed over a regular door lock, but is controlled by a smartphone application that lets owners decide which keys work with the lock and for how long. 

 BODY:
RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. - Yves Béhar, an industrial designer, has helped shape the look of Jawbone headsets, the OUYA gaming console and worked with companies such as Samsung and Puma, and the One Laptop Per Child project. 
Now, he's teaming up with an entrepreneur, Jason Johnson, to work on a new hardware start-up called August.
On Wednesday, during the All Things D conference in Southern California, the two unveiled their first product, a high-tech smart lock system. The August Smart Lock is a smooth, polished cylinder that can be installed over a regular door lock, but is controlled by a smartphone application that lets owners decide which keys work with the lock and for how long.
Mr. Béhar and Mr. Johnson said that they settled on designing a lock because it is a technology that has not changed in hundreds of years.
"We wanted to come up with a new solution that would aesthetically fit into home decor," Mr. Béhar said in an interview.
He also said that the duo got the idea for the lock when they were thinking about the sharing economy that has given rise to services like Airbnb, where people rent out their rooms and homes to others over the Internet. The key hand-off is often the trickiest and most inconvenient part of the entire exchange. The August Smart Lock works in a number of ways. It connects to a smartphone app that lets people remotely unlock and lock their front door for people at their leisure. The app also lets people assign keys that can expire after a single use or stay active for years, if they choose. The locks and apps run on the latest version of Bluetooth, which does not require the lengthy pairing process that can often stymie Bluetooth products. If their phones die, people can still unlock doors by using a friend's phone or through a traditional key.
In addition, the lock software keeps a log of visitors and a guestbook where they can leave comments, instructions and photos for one another.
The smart lock, which can be ordered online, costs $199 and will begin shipping later this year. Eventually, Mr. Béhar and Mr. Johnson said, it will appear in big-box retail stores. The company also said that its platform will eventually work with other smart objects and sensors that smart lock owners have in their homes, although they declined to elaborate on what that means. The company raised $2 million in seed financing from several Silicon Valley angel investors.

HEADLINE: Documents Show Obama Officials in Tension Over British Banks

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: HSBC and Standard Chartered were fined for funneling illicit money, rather than indicted. 

 BODY:
Government documents have recently emerged that offer a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse into the Obama administration's decision-making as it prepared to take actions against two big British banks.
In the case of the banks suspected of funneling billions of dollars in tainted money through the American financial system - HSBC and Standard Chartered - authorities decided last year to level hefty fines rather than seek criminal charges. Those decisions raised concerns in Washington that some banks, having grown so large and interconnected, are too big to indict.
 The internal government documents, which revealed some tension among authorities about how aggressively to pursue the cases, suggest that at least one agency, the Treasury Department, was alert to such concerns. When authorities were being blamed for letting HSBC off the hook, Treasury officials assured top aides to Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, that monetary penalties were coming as "quickly as possible," according to the documents reviewed by The New York Times. 
The agency also contacted and persuaded a news organization to withdraw a report that wrongly blamed Treasury for not indicting HSBC, the documents indicate. (It's the job of the Justice Department to decide criminal charges, Treasury explained.)
Ultimately, Treasury assessed a record $875 million fine against HSBC, accusing it of allowing Mexican drug cartels to direct money through accounts in the United States. But some critics wanted more, noting that Treasury's own internal documents cite the bank's "egregious violations" of money laundering laws as "qualitatively worse" than other banks.
"I would like to see Treasury support zealous prosecution, and instead I see them managing their image," said Bart Naylor, a policy advocate at Public Citizen, a nonprofit group critical of the government for not taking a harder line with HSBC.
Treasury released the internal documents to Public Citizen through a Freedom of Information Act request. The group then shared the information with The Times. A spokesman for Treasury declined to comment.
In a sign that the British cases pitted authorities against one another, the Treasury Department raised concerns last year that New York's banking regulator acted against Standard Chartered without sufficiently notifying federal authorities, the documents show. Treasury officials explained the concerns in an internal memo to Mr. Geithner.
The memo, internal e-mails show, was prepared for Mr. Geithner as "talking points" ahead of an October meeting with George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer. In a September letter to Mr. Geithner, Mr. Osborne had expressed significant "concerns" about New York's action, given that the United States and Britain typically collaborate closely on such cases.
While the talking points highlighted "Treasury's coordination" with British regulators, it also distanced Mr. Geithner from the New York regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky.
"Unfortunately," the memo said, Mr. Lawsky's office notified federal authorities "only hours before its public announcement."
But people close to the case argue that federal authorities were aware that Mr. Lawsky was poised to act. Three months before filing the case, Mr. Lawsky's office informed Treasury and other federal officials that it planned to soon take action against Standard Chartered for illegally funneling money for Iranian banks and corporations, the people close to the case said.
The tension reflected a culture clash between Mr. Lawsky's aggressive approach and the more staid philosophy common at the Treasury Department. A former terrorism prosecutor, Mr. Lawsky adopted a broader view of Standard Chartered's wrongdoing than federal authorities, and even threatened to revoke its state banking license. At the time, Treasury and the Justice Department were not ready to act.
Matt Anderson, a spokesman for Mr. Lawsky, declined to comment. In a speech this April, however, Mr. Lawsky played down the tensions, saying "a dose of healthy competition among regulators is helpful and necessary to safeguarding the stability of our nation's financial system."
But in Washington, some discussions have taken a more hostile tone as the Justice Department faces scrutiny for not indicting HSBC.
The Justice Department has explained that it follows guidelines requiring prosecutors to weigh indictments of businesses with "collateral consequences" like job losses and, in the case of big banks, a threat to the economy. And in a recent letter to Congress, the department explained that it has "contacted relevant government agencies to discuss such issues," including federal regulators.
But in Congressional testimony in March, David S. Cohen, Treasury's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said "The decision whether to bring criminal charges is the exclusive prerogative of criminal prosecutors." He added that "we were not in a position to offer any meaningful guidance" in the HSBC criminal case.
But inside the Treasury Department in late 2012, shortly after Congress scolded authorities for not yet punishing HSBC, officials appeared to make the civil case a significant priority.
Over several weeks, Treasury officials consulted two of Mr. Geithner's top lawyers, Christopher Meade and Christian Weideman. The involvement of the lawyers, who were known at Treasury as Mr. Geithner's top problem solvers, reflected the seriousness of the approach.
Treasury officials sent the lawyers "new developments" in the HSBC case. At one point, an official assured them that Treasury was moving "as quickly as possible to put together administrative penalty actions."
When Treasury joined the Justice Department in announcing the case in December, a media outlet ran an overnight article in which a professor speculated that Mr. Geithner had not criminally prosecuted HSBC to avoid putting it out of business.
By dawn that day, Treasury officials e-mailed one another about the article. Shortly after, National Public Radio retracted the quote and issued a statement saying that Treasury had not been involved in the decision not to indict HSBC.

HEADLINE: Gitmo's Other Prisoner

BYLINE: LINDA GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama has become imprisoned not at Guantanamo but by it. 

 BODY:
On the front page of its Memorial Day weekend edition last Friday, USA Today ran an arresting article under the headline: From Boyhood to the Battlefield. The photo of a young boy with a baseball bat over his shoulder, staring forthrightly into the camera, promised a feel-good holiday story, a promise quickly dashed by the headline's smaller type: "These children of 9/11 died fighting its war." 
The article profiled three young men, too young at the time to have grasped the import of the events of Sept. 11, 2001, who eventually felt the call to military service. Each died this spring in Afghanistan.
The article made no mention of President Barack Obama's speech the previous day, in which the president declared that "this war, like all wars, must end." Clearly, the editors planned and scheduled the story some time ago, not in response to the president's speech at the National Defense University. But if anything could underscore the urgent necessity of the recalibration the president called for, this was it. 
President Obama's articulation and defense of his policy on targeted killing by drones got the most attention. I was equally interested in what he had to say about the Guantánamo Bay prison in Cuba, where most of the 166 detainees are on a hunger strike. What the president said was not particularly new: Guantánamo is terrible advertising for the United States; he wants to close it and bring the detainees into the United States for trial and maximum-security imprisonment; and Congress won't let him. 
"There is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should never have been opened," the president said in obvious frustration, speaking an obvious truth. What occurred to me is that he, too, has become a prisoner: imprisoned not at Guantánamo but by it.
To test the validity of this observation, it's worth looking back at the speechPresident Obama gave almost exactly four years earlier, at the National Archives on May 21, 2009. That speech was in many ways the more challenging assignment, a more audacious staking of ground.
 The president, in office only four months, was untested on national security. Osama bin Laden was still at large. The war in Iraq was grinding on. There was no exit strategy in Afghanistan. In contrast to the decimated terrorist leadership the president depicted last week, he referred back then to the "nimble enemy" the country faced.
Yet despite those daunting circumstances, the new president's tone four years ago was not only forceful but hopeful. There were 240 prisoners at Guantánamo then. He had earlier ordered the prison camp closed within one year, and that goal appeared well within his grasp. In the speech, the president outlined a multipart strategy: transferring detainees to domestic prisons; bringing as many as possible to trial in federal court; releasing those whom courts had already ordered freed; sending others to custody and eventual release in other countries; reserving military commission trials for those charged with violating the laws of war.
 It all sounded, on that long-ago spring morning, not exactly simple, but straightforward and achievable. "As president, I refuse to allow this problem to fester," Mr. Obama said, adding: "Our courts won't allow it."
Except, of course, that the courts did. 
There are many reasons Guantánamo is still with us: cynical Republicans who conveniently forgot that closing Guantánamo was once a bipartisan goal (President Obama saw around that corner, warning in his speech about "the fear-mongering that emerges whenever we discuss this issue"); timorous Democrats who failed to provide him with cover when things got hot; disputes within the administration that resulted in squandered momentum; understandable concern about releasing detainees from Yemen, the biggest group among 23 nationalities represented at Guantánamo, into the chaos there. (In last week's speech, the president announced that he was lifting the moratorium on transfers to Yemen.) The military commission system bogged down hopelessly; while President Obama expressed wonderment in 2009 that the system had produced only three convictions, four years later it has yielded only four more, and several of those remain tied up in appeals.
 And then there were the courts. There are two courts that have mattered in this saga: the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Supreme Court. I don't mean to suggest that judges and justices have been the main barriers to clearing out Guantánamo. But their role - more precisely, with respect to the Supreme Court, absence of a role - has played and continues to play a part that shouldn't be overlooked as discussion resumes about the future of the island prison.
It will be five years next month since the Supreme Court has had anything to say about Guantánamo. In June 2008, the court decided Boumediene v. Bush, declaring that Guantánamo detainees had a constitutional right to challenge their confinement by means of habeas corpus petition in federal court. The court was divided 5 to 4, and the dissenting opinions were vigorous, but Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's strongly worded majority opinion appeared to have some teeth. 
In the first two years following Boumediene, the majority's message seemed to resonate as federal district judges within the D.C. Circuit took seriously Justice Kennedy's injunction to "conduct a meaningful review" of the basis for each detainee's continued imprisonment. In those years, the trial judges granted habeas corpus petitions more often than not - 20 of the first 34 petitions. In ruling for the detainees, the judges typically found that the government's evidence didn't even meet the low standard of proof required - "preponderance of the evidence," meaning only "more likely than not," a far cry from the criminal-trial standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt." 
This pattern changed in mid-2010 when the appeals court, in Al-Adahi v. Obama overturned a grant of habeas corpus and instructed the district judges to take a more forgiving approach to the government's evidence. A case against a detainee typically involves numerous elements such as the individual's travel history, connections with others, motivation and circumstances of capture. In the Al-Adahi case, the appeals court instructed the district judges not to require the government to prove every allegation - not to require every piece of the puzzle to fit - but rather to look at the evidence as an integrated whole. The Supreme Court denied review in early 2011. 
The Al-Adahi ruling figured to be a game-changer, and it was. The rate of habeas corpus grants plummeted as the district judges absorbed the message. Of the next 12 petitions, only one was granted, and the D.C. Circuit reversed that decision. In its ruling in that case, Latif v. Obama, the appeals court established a still more deferential standard for reviewing the government's evidence. Judges should presume that the government's evidence was reliable, the appeals court ruled, in effect shifting to the detainee the burden of refuting that presumption.
Last June, the Supreme Court refused to review the Latif decision. Several months later, the detainee, Adnan Farhan Abdul Latif, a Yemeni who had been held at Guantánamo for 10 years, was found dead in his cell of an overdose of psychiatric medication, a possible suicide. When Mr. Latif had been captured by Pakistani police near the Afghan border in 2001, he claimed to have left Yemen in search of medical care for a head wound suffered in a car accident. He had his medical records with him, and no weapon. In granting his petition for habeas corpus in the ruling that the appeals court overturned, Federal District Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. had found Mr. Latif's account plausible and the government's evidence to the contrary "not sufficiently reliable."
It bears noting that the Obama administration has not been a passive observer of these developments. Most of the time, when habeas corpus has been granted, the Department of Justice has not only appealed to the increasingly friendly D.C. Circuit but has also opposed the detainees' efforts to obtain Supreme Court review. (One major appeal in a military commission case will be argued before the D.C. Circuit in September. ) In the one case since 2008 that the justices did agree to hear, the Obama administration changed the facts in a way that led the Supreme Court to dismiss the case.
 That case, Kiyemba v. Obama, was an appeal brought by a group of Uighurs, Chinese Muslims who had taken refuge in Afghanistan from Chinese persecution before 9/11 and who were sold for a bounty to the United States military in the chaos that followed. The Bush administration had eventually conceded that the Uighurs had never been enemy combatants, but it appealed a federal district judge's decision ordering them released into the United States.
 The D.C. Circuit overturned that ruling and the Supreme Court agreed in mid-2009 to hear the Uighurs' appeal, over the opposition of what was now the Obama Justice Department. In February 2010, two days before its brief was due at the court in advance of the scheduled argument, the administration managed to persuade the Swiss government to admit the two remaining Uighurs for whom no other home had been found. The justices then dismissed the case, thus avoiding - and permitting the Obama administration to avoid - a potentially consequential clash of executive and judicial authority. 
And still Guantánamo festers. And yet, although the president's speech last week drew the usual negative responses from the usual suspects it could well be that time, at last, is on his side. Polls in recent weeks indicate that public opinion is shifting, for the first time since 9/11, on the appropriate balance between individual liberty and national security. A Fox News poll last month found more people unwilling than willing to sacrifice personal freedom in order to reduce the threat of terrorism. A Washington Post poll, also last month, found more people worried that the government would go "too far in compromising constitutional rights in order to investigate terrorism" than worried that the government wouldn't go far enough. A Rasmussen Reports poll, conducted, as were the others, after the Boston Marathon bombing, found a majority of the respondents more worried about the economy than about terrorism. 
What this suggests is there are, finally, diminishing returns for political demagoguery on Guantánamo and other terrorism-related issues. In his speech last week, President Obama invited the American public to reclaim its pre-9/11 equilibrium - not by assuming that the country faces no threat at all, but by recognizing that the threats it faces have been and can be managed smartly. If the public accepts that invitation, we will see not only Guantánamo closed, but the president himself freed from Guantánamo's chains.

HEADLINE: Why Can't America Be Sweden?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Economists disagree about what would happen to global economic innovation if the United States adopted the social welfare policies of Scandinavian countries. 

 BODY:
Daron Acemoglu, an eminent economist at M.I.T., has ignited a firestorm by arguing that contemporary forces of globalization bar the United States from adopting the liberal social welfare policies of Scandinavian countries.
"We cannot all be like the Nordics," Acemoglu declares, in a 2012 paper, "Choosing Your Own Capitalism in a Globalized World," written with his colleagues James A. Robinson, a professor of government at Harvard, and Thierry Verdier, scientific director of the Paris School of Economics.

If the "cutthroat leader" - the United States - were to switch to "cuddly capitalism, this would reduce the growth rate of the entire world economy," the authors argue, by slowing the pace of innovation.
Acemoglu, Robinson and Verdier put their argument technically, but there is no mistaking the implications: 
We consider a canonical dynamic model of endogenous technological change at the world level with three basic features. First, there is technological interdependence across countries, with technological innovations by the most technologically advanced countries contributing to the world technology frontier, on which in turn other countries can build to innovate and grow. Second, we consider that effort in innovative activities requires incentives which come as a result of differential rewards to this effort. As a consequence, a greater gap in income between successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs increases entrepreneurial effort and thus a country's contribution to the world technology frontier. Finally, we assume that in each country the reward structure and the extent of social protection shaping work and innovation incentives are determined by (forward-looking) national social planners.
In a series of e-mail exchanges with the Times, Acemoglu said he believes that safety net programs in the United States are inadequate. But, if the thesis that he has put forth is correct, there is room for only modest expansion:
The fact that the United States is the world technology leader puts constraints and limits on redistribution at the top. The global asymmetric equilibrium is at the root of the United States being the world technology leader, but the mechanism through which this matters for innovation and redistribution is the very fact that the United States is such a leader.
Acemoglu elaborated:
In our model (which is just that, a model), U.S. citizens would actually be worse off if they switched to a cuddly capitalism. Why? Because this would reduce the world's growth rate, given the U.S.'s oversized contribution to the world technology frontier. In contrast, when Sweden switches from cutthroat to cuddly capitalism (or vice versa), this does not have an impact on the long-run growth rate of the world economy, because the important work is being done by U.S. innovation.
These findings, if substantiated, will disappoint those who long for a Swedish-style mixed economy with universal health care, paid maternal leave, child allowances, guaranteed pensions and other desirable social benefits.
In a more detailed paper, "Can't We All Be More Like Scandinavians?" Acemoglu, Robinson and Verdier expand on their argument that the world is dependent on American leadership in technology and innovation to sustain global growth. In order to maintain its position at the forefront of global innovation, the authors contend, the United States must maintain an economic system that provides great rewards to successful innovators, which "implies greater inequality and greater poverty (and a weaker safety net) for a society encouraging innovation."
Asked for examples of America's leading role in innovative enterprise, Acemoglu listed: "Software (Google and Amazon), hardware and design (Apple), social networking (Facebook and Twitter), biotech, pharmaceuticals, robotics, nanotechnology, entertainment and retail (Wal-Mart)."
Unless the United States is prepared to initiate a world-wide slowdown, according to this line of thinking, it will have to come to terms with making relatively minor and marginal changes in its social welfare system:
The United States does not have the kind of welfare state that many European countries, including Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have developed, and despite recent health care reforms many Americans do not enjoy the type of high-quality health care that their counterparts in these other countries do. They also receive much shorter vacations and more limited maternity leave, and do not have access to a variety of other public services that are more broadly provided in many continental European countries. Perhaps more importantly, poverty and inequality are much higher in the United States and have been increasing over the last three decades, while they have been broadly stable in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Inequality at the top of the distribution has also been exploding in the United States, with the top percent of earners capturing almost 25 percent of total national income, while the same number is around 5 percent in Finland and Sweden.
Acemoglu and his colleagues are not right-wing conservatives, but their analysis poses one more challenge to an American left that has struggled to preserve basic progressive institutions - the labor movement, employee pension plans, a safety net for the poor - in the face of a corporate consensus that these programs weaken America's ability to compete in an international marketplace. The three authors make the case that the interconnected world economy has reached what they call an "asymmetric equilibrium" in which the United States "adopts a 'cutthroat' reward structure, with high-powered incentives for success, while other countries free-ride on this frontier economy and choose a more egalitarian, 'cuddly,' reward structure."
Directly challenging what they describe as the consensus view - that a country can substantially expand the welfare state without sacrificing its pioneering role in technological innovation - Acemoglu and his colleagues write that it is "the more 'cutthroat' American society that makes possible the more 'cuddly' Scandinavian societies based on a comprehensive social safety net, the welfare state and more limited inequality."
In an e-mail, Acemoglu provided the following analogy: 
The U.S. is also the military leader of the world, and it cannot imitate Finland and reduce its military to a trivial size without taking into account the global repercussions of this (and I'm saying this as somebody who is strongly opposed to U.S. military interventions around the world).
There are economists - primarily on the left - who take issue with Acemoglu and his colleagues.
David Soskice, a professor of political science and economics at the London School of Economics, wrote in an e-mail to the Times that the conclusions of Acemoglu, Robinson and Verdier are "very clever, but off-the-wall as a description of Sweden, Germany, etc. Moreover, my work with Peter Hall on "Varieties of Capitalism" said the opposite of what Daron and Jim suggest - we agree with them that the world needs Swedens and USAs but not for the reasons they put forward."
In an e-mail response to a Times inquiry, Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard, suggested that
This is an interesting thought exercise, but I would guess that even the authors themselves would caution against taking the ideas in it too far. Surely, global interdependence plays somehow into different nations' choices of institutional arrangements. But I find it implausible that Scandinavians stick with their "cuddly" form of capitalism because they have the luxury of free riding on America's technological leadership. For one thing, Scandinavians and others with extensive welfare states have in fact been moving in the American direction as globalization has advanced; global interdependence has had the effect of undermining cuddly forms of capitalism instead of reinforcing them. Second, the Scandinavian and other models of capitalism have deep roots in the historical evolution of their societies that predate the contemporary era of globalization. Finally, the idea that Scandinavian societies are somehow less innovative than the U.S. one is itself contentious.
Lane Kenworthy of the University of Arizona argues in his blog that the Nordic countries are as innovative as the United States, despite their stronger welfare state. If cutthroat economies prompt more innovation, why, Kenworthy asks, is innovation relatively modest "in other nations with relatively high income inequality and low-to-moderate government spending, such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom?"
For self-evident reasons, it is difficult for a political columnist to adjudicate these warring claims. Why? Here is Acemoglu, Robinson and Verdier's first assumption:
and here is their subsequent thought:
Whatever the merits of competing economic models, there is no question that in the United States, cutthroat capitalism holds sway. The conventional right-of-center argument that supports this form of capitalism is that social spending, taxes, fringe benefits and unions create market inefficiencies. Conservative economic theory has traditionally been in favor of shifting the rewards of production from labor to capital, and these arguments have had a substantial impact on American economic policy.
Figure 1 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics illustrates the decline in labor income from 1947 to 2012.
American cutthroat capitalism now faces a major challenge. A growing share of the United States work force is shouldering the costs of a shrinking safety net, of lower wages, and of vanishing middle-class jobs. This cost-shifting is taking place just at the moment when demographic trends are pushing the balance of political power to those who are losing "market share." The men and women most likely to be trapped at the lower end of a low-wage economy - regardless of innovative successes at the high end - are becoming a powerful force at the ballot box.
This puts America's regime of cutthroat capitalism on a collision course with the relatively disadvantaged bottom half of the United States population that currently makes up a majority of the Democratic coalition. Restive voters in this large demographic will become increasingly unwilling to suffer on the altar of global innovation while the lion's share of income and other benefits flow to others.
In our e-mail exchange, Acemoglu raised the possibility of addressing these tensions through the development of a two-track set of economic and welfare policies: "An interesting question is whether you can have a safety net at the bottom, while at the same time providing strong incentives for innovation at the top. I don't see any reason why not, but it's an open question."
This approach would amount to formal government recognition of a two-class society, the innovators living under one set of policies that allows them to practice by cutthroat rules, the rest of America consigned to the relatively meager support of a safety net.
Looked at in this light, the 2012 presidential campaign was a louder version of the same argument. Mitt Romney's total contempt for the 47 percent - "who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them" - reflected the conservative vision of this two-tier society.
Conversely, Barack Obama described an America where
the basic bargain that made this country great has eroded. Long before the recession hit, hard work stopped paying off for too many people. Fewer and fewer of the folks who contributed to the success of our economy actually benefited from that success. Those at the very top grew wealthier from their incomes and their investments - wealthier than ever before. But everybody else struggled with costs that were growing and paychecks that weren't - and too many families found themselves racking up more and more debt just to keep up.
Despite its egalitarian tradition, America may have already become a two-class society, with an elite benefiting from advantages in background, wealth, access to higher education and skill sets passed from generation to generation (whether through inheritance or cultural transmission). If that is the case, and there is some evidence that it is, the question is whether our rhetorical obeisance to egalitarian tradition will prevent us from openly recognizing what we have become - thus sapping our ability to do something about it.

HEADLINE: More Seek A Slice Of the Pie

BYLINE: By ALEXANDRIA SYMONDS

 BODY:
Who says pizza delivery is just for dorm rooms and children's birthday parties?
Multiple large, greasy boxes arrived at two downtown film premiere after-parties in New York on a recent Tuesday night. Their contents were devoured by both the young, relaxed crowd in denim jackets and beanies celebrating Antonio Campos's ''Simon Killer'' at the Jane Hotel, and by the guests in suits and cocktail dresses feting Danny Boyle's ''Trance'' at a private triplex penthouse on Greenwich Street.
In the case of the ''Trance'' party, pizza was an unplanned addition to the evening's offerings, which also included passed hors d'oeuvres and dim sum. A star of the film, Rosario Dawson, and her manager, Evan Hainey, picked it up to share, according to Andrew Saffir, whose Cinema Society gave the party. (Ms. Dawson had considered stopping for pizza before the screening, he said, but was worried about getting grease stains on her pink Bottega Veneta dress.) The pies were the hit of the night. 
''I may need to rethink the food we have on offer,'' Mr. Saffir wrote in an e-mail. ''Pizza is way more fun.''
Credit the recession, or weariness with an increasingly exacting foodie culture, but it's also increasingly common at upscale events in the city, from premieres and fashion parties to dressed-up galas like last spring's Museum of Arts and Design L.E.D. Ball.
Some are also dialing Domino's, Ray's and their ilk for private dinner parties. In March, Rachel Heller, an actress and writer, joined a group of what she called ''tastemakers from California and New York'' to eat pizza and watch the season premiere of ''The Rachel Zoe Project'' at the Upper East Side home of a friend.
''It was pizza and Champagne,'' Ms. Heller said. ''Because it's something that everybody eats, unless you're allergic to cheese or something.''
Ms. Heller's friends may be blissfully oblivious to the gluten-free movement, but for the perennially dieting New York social set, an impromptu pizza party also perhaps presents an opportunity to blame peer pressure for indulgence.
''I sort of got the whole, like, 'Ooh, I feel naughty eating this' vibe, but no one really objected,'' said the writer and socialite Stephanie Newhouse, who ordered Famous Ben's pizza for a dinner party at her SoHo loft. ''I think they were happy to have that decision made for them, truthfully.''
One of Ms. Newhouse's guests, Peter Davis, the editor of the social magazine Scene, agreed.
''No one wants to -- actually, any chic type -- go to a pizza parlor and sit and eat greasy pizza,'' he said. But not everything about the pizza-party atmosphere translates to Upper East Side and SoHo dining rooms.
''The one thing that's awkward is that they had cloth napkins,'' Mr. Davis said. ''You can't blot your pizza, which I like to do to get the grease off, with someone's cloth napkin with an embroidered flower on it.''
Pizza's messiness may, in fact, account for part of its appeal among the social set: a welcome divergence from the tidy miniature crab cakes and bites of tuna tartare that are ubiquitous at high-end events.
''The little finger foods, they get tired, because they're always the same ones at every party,'' Ms. Newhouse said.
Canapé fatigue notwithstanding, in some buttoned-up circles, like those represented by Jonathan Marder, a publicist whose firm handles several of the highest-profile events on the philanthropic calendar, the haute pizza party remains unthinkable.
''Pizza parties?'' Mr. Marder wrote in an e-mail. ''Fabulous for people smoking pot, but that's not our crowd.''

HEADLINE: Making His Life the Party

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The Paramount Hotel in Times Square may not have hosted a spectacle like this since the '40s, when Billy Rose, the hallowed New York showman, trotted out 6-foot-tall showgirls for Broadway divas and Hollywood stars.
On a recent Thursday night, go-go girls in silky white capes swung from on high, as art heavyweights like Larry Gagosian and Simon de Pury mixed with fashion celebrities like Vera Wang and Tory Burch, and waiters in crisp white shirts and skinny black ties passed through the room with trays of Dom Pérignon.
Socialites from the old order (Gigi Mortimer and Ghislaine Maxwell) blended seamlessly with those of the new (Nicky Hilton and Hannah Bronfman). Bono talked Knicks with Vito Schnabel. Tony Shafrazi, another art dealer, showed up late with Owen Wilson.
Yet none of the luminaries commanded more attention than Aby Rosen, the developer and bon vivant, who was celebrating his 53rd birthday. Pointedly underdressed in a black T-shirt, Mr. Rosen was gyrating on the dance floor to Kool and the Gang, silver hair flowing, fist in the air. At midnight, a shower of gold confetti rained from overheard. An attempt to raise a celebratory glass devolved into a shirt-drenching Champagne fight, with Mr. Rosen, happily the loser, dripping in the middle of it. 
''If you give a party,'' Mr. Rosen said in his Kissingerian growl, ''you better give it right.''
Consider that a mantra.
Propelled by a bearish charm and a provocateur's sensibility, Mr. Rosen, the son of a small-scale developer from Frankfurt, has thrust himself into roles typically reserved for scions of New York's leading families. He is a real estate titan whose company controls the crown jewels of modernism, the Seagram Building and Lever House, and an art collector with 800 postwar gems, including 100-plus Warhols. He is a regular on the charity circuit, particularly since being named chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts, a post formerly held by Kitty Carlisle Hart.
He is married to a pillar of New York society, Samantha Boardman. Dinner invitations to the couple's 14-room home on Fifth Avenue -- opulently furnished with Warhols, Basquiats and Calders -- are highly coveted, with the guest list ranging from Barbara Walters to Alex Rodriguez to the Harvard professor Steven Pinker. Attendees say that the star wattage radiates equally from the guests and hosts. ''They're the ones with active minds,'' said the artist Rachel Feinstein, who, with her husband, the painter John Currin, is a frequent guest. ''They seek him out, he seeks them out.''
But what Aby Rosen really wants to be is a party boy, to judge by his latest endeavor. He already owns a celebrity-packed clubhouse restaurant in Midtown, a fashionable hotel in Gramercy Park and a glassy resort in South Beach that rages during Art Basel Miami Beach. Unknown to most of his birthday guests, his most ambitious foray into night life was under their feet -- the $20 million revival of the Diamond Horseshoe, a legendary nightclub in the basement of the Paramount Hotel that was immortalized in the 1945 musical film of the same name starring Betty Grable as the headlining showgirl.
Set to open this fall, the Diamond Horseshoe, as envisioned by Mr. Rosen, will be a new night-life concept: a Dalí-like mix of high art and camp, theater and circus, audacity and calculation. In other words, Aby Rosen at his essence.
''I wake up every morning and I think, 'You know what, I'm a lucky bastard,' '' Mr. Rosen said, creeping through traffic in the back seat of a black Mercedes S-class on a recent afternoon.
Dressed in a charcoal gray Hermès suit, slumped in the back seat, his prominent stomach unapologetically thrusting forward, Mr. Rosen had just finished giving a tour of his extensive art collection at Lever House and was headed over to the Paramount to show off the work being done on the Diamond Horseshoe. He seemed equally proud of both.
He talked offhandedly about his social schedule (he and Ms. Boardman are often out two or three nights a week) and made the point that it reflected the full range of what New York had to offer. ''I enjoy the burger joint the same way I enjoy fancy meals,'' he said. ''I spend time with people who are movers and shakers, and others who are just friends I really care for. Some of them are rich, some of them are poor. I couldn't care less. I'm not a snob.''
Born in Frankfurt to Holocaust survivors, Mr. Rosen grew up an outsider, a Jew in postwar Germany. His father, Isak, survived Auschwitz and went on to develop small office buildings, allowing Aby to grow up in relative affluence in a home filled with art and classical music.
Friends say he did not find his true place until he moved to New York in 1987, with plans to carry on in his father's business. ''There is a saying, 'When you come to New York, you become a New Yorker within two weeks,' '' said Michael Fuchs, a childhood friend and his longtime business partner. ''Aby immediately embraced New York as home.''
By day, Mr. Rosen learned the ropes of New York real estate, brokering properties to German investors as an apprentice for an investment firm. At night, he hit the clubs. Even then, night life was in his blood; he and Mr. Fuchs bought a stake in M. K., the late-'80s club run by Eric Goode and Serge Becker that was frequented by artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Julian Schnabel. ''They didn't have any real social connections whatsoever,'' Mr. Goode recalled. ''For them, it was an adventure.''
By 1991, Mr. Rosen had established enough of a foothold to start a real estate business, RFR Holding, with Mr. Fuchs. It was the depths of a recession, but the duo, backed by German investors, snapped up nondescript office towers in good locations, spruced them up with works by hungry young artists, and rented them at a premium. It was a profitable model. They graduated into the big leagues in 1998, when they bought and restored Lever House, Gordon Bunshaft's midcentury modern masterpiece on Park Avenue.
Their portfolio swelled to more than nine million square feet of commercial space, including a majority interest in another Park Avenue trophy: the Seagram Building, the Mies landmark across the street.
But not everyone has appreciated Mr. Rosen's taste for bold statements. In 2006, for example, his plan to build a 30-story glass tower designed by Norman Foster at 980 Madison Avenue across from the Carlyle hotel enraged some members of the silk stocking set. Tom Wolfe lampooned him as a megalomaniacal vulgarian in a New York Times Op-Ed column. ''It would be hard to dream up anything short of a Mobil station more out of place there than a Mondo Condo glass box by Aby Rosen,'' Mr. Wolfe wrote.
It became nastier. Mr. Rosen hurled allegations of anti-Semitism, which brought protests from Mr. Wolfe, whose wife, Sheila, is Jewish. The project stalled, and Mr. Rosen, never one for what-ifs, moved on.
''He will go on wearing more white suits,'' Mr. Rosen said, when reminded about the tiff with Mr. Wolfe. ''I will go on having a good time.''
As Mr. Rosen's real estate and art portfolio grew, so did his party-boy proclivities. He had the vast network of friends to prove it.
As the artist Damien Hirst put it: ''You have lots of people who buy art because they don't have a personality, but they want to be able to hang out and be part of a scene and have friends. Aby's not like that, because he's already got all that.''
But by some measures, Mr. Rosen didn't fully arrive on the social scene until 2005, when he married Ms. Boardman. He divorced his previous wife, Elizabeth Wechsler, a former banker, in 2003.
A practicing clinical psychiatrist, Ms. Boardman, now 41, was a starlet of the '90s social scene, the daughter of Pauline Baker Boardman Pitt, sometimes called the ''Queen of Palm Beach'' and a descendant of George F. Baker, a founder of what is now Citibank.
''They're sort of like the Bill and Babe Paley of this rather different kind of social age,'' said the Vanity Fair writer Bob Colacello, a friend. ''You've got the dynamic, self-made tycoon and the high-society princess.''
It was a contrast in styles, to be sure, but Ms. Boardman was swept up by Mr. Rosen's joie de vivre. ''He's more alive than anyone I've ever met,'' she said, adding, ''The love of life was palpable within the first few minutes.''
He is also not someone who seems to take himself too seriously. Twelve years ago, when Anh Duong was painting his portrait, they both thought he was coming off as a little stiff. So Mr. Rosen suggested he strip down to his striped boxer shorts, and that's how she painted him. (The painting, which has hung in both his town house and at the Paramount before the renovation, is now in storage.)
In 2007, Mr. Rosen, if he hadn't done so before, placed his stamp on the New York social scene when he hosted a lavish party for Mr. Hirst's vast installation of animal carcasses in the lobby of Lever House, including 30 sheep suspended in tanks of formaldehyde. That night, Mr. Rosen seemed to own Park Avenue, patrolling the scene in a velvet Nehru jacket among the likes of Heather Graham, Ron Perelman and Salman Rushdie, while a band cranked out Sex Pistols covers.
The party received reams of news coverage and helped make Mr. Rosen into a Page Six staple. He shrugs off the suggestion that such spectacles are a Trumpian display of self-promotion. ''You invite people not to be the center of attention,'' he said. ''You invite them because you want them to share in a great night.''
Nevertheless, Mr. Rosen won't deny that high-wattage parties can be good for business. Boldfaced parties lend cachet to his real estate holdings, he acknowledges, just as the Lichtensteins do in his office buildings. It is a formula he has adopted for other night-life ventures.
In 2003, Mr. Rosen shook up the Midtown power-lunch scene by backing the Lever House restaurant (now called Casa Lever), which lured models and moguls. That year, he joined with the hotelier Ian Schrager in reinventing the dowager Gramercy Park Hotel; its Rose Bar lounge, with its giant Schnabels and Warhols, became a frenzied velvet-rope scene among leggy fashion types and scruffy young actors.
His hotel portfolio extends to Miami Beach, where RFR owns, with the developer David Edelstein, the W South Beach. For the last four years, he has hosted one of the hottest parties during Art Basel Miami Beach, a private dinner at the hotel where celebrities like Kanye West and Michael Douglas mix with the art world elite like Eli Broad and Peter Brant.
On a recent Wednesday, Mr. Rosen stood at the top of the grand staircase of the Diamond Horseshoe, the same steps that the cream of the Times Square theater world and movie stars like Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Jeanette MacDonald used to pad down in the 1940s.
The club was shuttered in 1951, and for a half-century, the two-story jewel box had nearly been forgotten -- with some exceptions. (Andy Warhol's memorial luncheon took place there in 1987, as did Tina Brown's fifth-anniversary party for Vanity Fair in 1988.)
Now in the midst of a gut renovation, the subterranean space was a maze of plumbing pipes and scaffolding. But as Mr. Rosen descended the staircase with a heavy, portentous gait, he saw only opportunity, not dust and debris.
''If a club was shut for two years and you come up with something new, people say, 'Great, good nightclub,' '' Mr. Rosen said. ''But 60 years later, you have to come up with something better. That's the challenge.''
Various impresarios tried to revive the space over the years, as a disco, concert site or supper club, but costs and headaches proved too great, Mr. Rosen said, pausing at the center of the room, where a giant sunburst-like light fixture will descend from the ceiling. ''When you see that people who are doers haven't done it,'' he said, ''that gives me an added excitement.''
That led him to hire Randy Weiner, a producer who helped bring to New York the cult hit ''Sleep No More,'' the avant-garde blend of Shakespeare, Hitchcock and, seemingly, Disney's Haunted Mansion.
Tracing the room with a sweep of his hand, Mr. Rosen described the show -- or whatever you might call it. Guests will be met by a butler and led through a haze of fog and drumbeats into a mysterious chamber. Servers will pass with hunks of meat on spears, and acrobats from the Montreal circus troupe, 7 Fingers, will gyrate throughout the room.
But ultimately, he said, the point is to encourage mingling.
''I understand entertaining,'' Mr. Rosen said, adding, ''You want people to walk out saying, 'I spent a night with interesting people.' ''

HEADLINE: Before Classes End, Retailers Prepare Back-to-School Shopping Campaigns

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH tens of millions of children have not finished the school year, Madison Avenue is already feverishly getting ready for the next one.
Such front-running of seasonal milestones should no longer be surprising, given how marketers, retailers and media companies have been time-shifting the calendar to stimulate business related to holidays both official (Christmas) and unofficial (Super Bowl Sunday). Still, it may startle students when they see advertising asking them to buy clothing, school supplies and other merchandise for 2013-14 while they await final grades for 2012-13.
The tenuous state of the economy is a major reason for the earlier arrival of back-to-school campaigns. The goal is to encourage purchases now because of uncertainty over what the future may bring. 
''Customers in this environment are looking for value, quality at a great price,'' said Bob Moore, executive vice president for marketing and merchandising at Office Depot in Boca Raton, Fla.
Because there is also ''a fashion element'' to back-to-school shopping, he added, likening the first day of school to walking the runway, shoppers look additionally for ''a little bit of extra flair.''
To that end, Office Depot is uniting with the boy band One Direction for a back-to-school campaign that will include an antibullying initiative carrying the theme ''Live. Love. Move'' -- as in ''Live kind. Love everyone. Move together against bullying.'' This is the second consecutive year that Office Depot will devote its back-to-school promotion to fighting bullying among children. Last summer, the retailer teamed with the Born This Way Foundation, founded by Lady Gaga and her mother, Cynthia Germanotta.
''This year, we want to take it to the next level,'' Mr. Moore said. For instance, the 50 to 60 products like notebooks, binders and decals to be sold as part of the campaign will feature images of the five members of One Direction, separately and together, with messages that include ''Live nice'' and ''Being true is being brave.'' The merchandise sold last year was emblazoned with slogans without Gaga imagery.
The coming campaign, called ''1D + OD Together Against Bullying,'' has a budget estimated at $10 million and includes videos, digital ads, content on the Office Depot Web site, displays in stores and an Office Depot sponsorship of the One Direction North American summer tour.
Office Depot and One Direction, through the band's representative, Modest Management, were brought together by Scott Woodward, chief executive and chief creative officer at SEW Branded in New York, a marketing consultancy.
''What we loved about the Office Depot partnership is that it's a direct cause-marketing partnership instead of a commercial brand push,'' said Jane Kennedy, head of licensing and partnership at Modest Management in London. ''And the cause struck a chord because the boys are ages 19 to 21.''
''We have back-to-school here in the U.K. as well, but it's mainly advertising for school uniforms and backpacks,'' she added. ''I would say it's bigger in the States.''
Teen Vogue magazine, published by the Condé Nast division of Advance Publications, sought last year to make back-to-school even bigger with an elaborate promotion to turn the second Saturday in August into a national shopping day. The event on Aug. 11, 2012, called Back-to-School Saturday, was deemed popular enough to bring back this year, on Saturday, Aug. 10, with additional elements that include a special Web site, backtoschoolsaturday.com.
''Absolutely, it was a success, bigger and better than what we'd expected for Year One,'' said Jason Wagenheim, vice president and publisher of Teen Vogue in New York. ''We intend to carry this on for a long time.''
''We expect to have more than 50 brands taking part,'' he added, compared with 43 in 2012. Some of last year's participants are increasing their presence; for instance, Procter & Gamble will have seven brands involved compared with four. Among the newcomers are Garnier, Keds, Macy's, Revlon, Simon Malls and Toyota.
''The notion of galvanizing everyone for a social event around shopping is awesome,'' said Rick Blackshaw, president for Keds in Lexington, Mass., part of Wolverine Worldwide.
''The back-to-school period, like Black Friday, is super important to us,'' he added. ''Back-to-school is the biggest time of year that a girl shops for casual athletic footwear.'' During Back-to-School Saturday, Keds will promote new shoes like the Rookie Loop De Loop and a Keds apparel line, introduced last month, available in 150 Macy's stores.
In a bit of marketing synchronicity, not only has Macy's recently started selling the Keds-branded clothing, in March the retailer introduced a line of apparel bearing the Teen Vogue brand.
''The millennial target is so important to us,'' said Martine Reardon, chief marketing officer at Macy's in New York, part of Macy's Inc., referring to shoppers in their teens through about age 30. ''We want to make sure we're creating events they feel are for them, not necessarily for their mothers and grandmothers.''
Although the retail calendar is already crowded with events and holiday-themed promotions, ''what the customer has been telling is that she likes the defined times'' to shop, Ms. Reardon added. So a Back-to-School Saturday is a welcome addition -- particularly if, as Teen Vogue is promising, ''it will be very social and mobile driven'' with content on Twitter, where the magazine will revive a hashtag, #BTSS, and offer a Teen Vogue Insider app for mobile devices.

HEADLINE: Records Show Tension Among Obama Officials Over British Banks

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Government documents have recently emerged that offer a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse into the Obama administration's decision-making as it prepared to take actions against two big British banks over money laundering.
In the case of the banks suspected of laundering billions of dollars through the American financial system -- HSBC and Standard Chartered -- authorities decided last year to level hefty fines rather than seek criminal charges. Those decisions raised concerns in Washington that some banks, having grown so large and interconnected, are too big to indict.
The internal government documents, which revealed some tension among authorities about how aggressively to pursue the cases, suggest that at least one agency, the Treasury Department, was alert to such concerns. When authorities were being blamed for letting HSBC off the hook, Treasury officials assured top aides to Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, that monetary penalties were coming as ''quickly as possible,'' according to the documents reviewed by The New York Times. 
The agency also contacted and persuaded a news organization to withdraw a report that wrongly blamed Treasury for not indicting HSBC, the documents indicate. (It's the job of the Justice Department to decide criminal charges, Treasury explained.)
Ultimately, Treasury assessed a record $875 million fine against HSBC. But some critics wanted more, noting that Treasury's own internal documents cite the bank's ''egregious violations'' of money laundering laws as ''qualitatively worse'' than other banks.
''I would like to see Treasury support zealous prosecution, and instead I see them managing their image,'' said Bart Naylor, a policy advocate at Public Citizen, a nonprofit group critical of the government for not taking a harder line with HSBC.
Treasury released the internal documents to Public Citizen through a Freedom of Information Act request. The group then shared the information with The Times. A spokesman for Treasury declined to comment.
In a sign that the money laundering cases pitted authorities against one another, the Treasury Department raised concerns last year that New York's banking regulator acted against Standard Chartered without sufficiently notifying federal authorities, the documents show. Treasury officials explained the concerns in an internal memo to Mr. Geithner.
The memo, internal e-mails show, was prepared for Mr. Geithner as ''talking points'' ahead of an October meeting with George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer. In a September letter to Mr. Geithner, Mr. Osborne had expressed significant ''concerns'' about New York's action, given that the United States and Britain typically collaborate closely on such cases.
While the talking points highlighted ''Treasury's coordination'' with British regulators, it also distanced Mr. Geithner from the New York regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky.
''Unfortunately,'' the memo said, Mr. Lawsky's office notified federal authorities ''only hours before its public announcement.''
But people close to the case argue that federal authorities were aware that Mr. Lawsky was poised to act. Three months before filing the case, Mr. Lawsky's office informed Treasury and other federal officials that it planned to soon take action against Standard Chartered, the people close to the case said.
The tension reflected a culture clash between Mr. Lawsky's aggressive approach and the more staid philosophy common at the Treasury Department. A former terrorism prosecutor, Mr. Lawsky adopted a broader view of Standard Chartered's wrongdoing than federal authorities, and even threatened to revoke its state banking license. At the time, Treasury and the Justice Department were not ready to act.
Matt Anderson, a spokesman for Mr. Lawsky, declined to comment. In a speech this April, however, Mr. Lawsky played down the tensions, saying ''a dose of healthy competition among regulators is helpful and necessary to safeguarding the stability of our nation's financial system.''
But in Washington, some discussions have taken a more hostile tone as the Justice Department faces scrutiny for not indicting HSBC.
The Justice Department has explained that it follows guidelines requiring prosecutors to weigh indictments of businesses with ''collateral consequences'' like job losses and, in the case of big banks, a threat to the economy. And in a recent letter to Congress, the department explained that it has ''contacted relevant government agencies to discuss such issues,'' including federal regulators.
But in Congressional testimony in March, David S. Cohen, Treasury's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said ''The decision whether to bring criminal charges is the exclusive prerogative of criminal prosecutors.'' He added that ''we were not in a position to offer any meaningful guidance'' in the HSBC criminal case.
But inside the Treasury Department in late 2012, shortly after Congress scolded authorities for not yet punishing HSBC, officials appeared to make the civil case a significant priority.
Over several weeks, Treasury officials consulted two of Mr. Geithner's top lawyers, Christopher Meade and Christian Weideman. The involvement of the lawyers, who were known at Treasury as Mr. Geithner's top problem solvers, reflected the seriousness of the approach.
Treasury officials sent the lawyers ''new developments'' in the HSBC case. At one point, an official assured them that Treasury was moving ''as quickly as possible to put together administrative penalty actions.''
When Treasury joined the Justice Department in announcing the case in December, a media outlet ran an overnight article in which a professor speculated that Mr. Geithner had not criminally prosecuted HSBC to avoid putting it out of business.
By dawn that day, Treasury officials e-mailed one another about the article. Shortly after, National Public Radio retracted the quote and issued a statement saying that Treasury had not been involved in the decision not to indict HSBC.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Detroit's Davos

BYLINE: By MARK BINELLI. 
Mark Binelli is a contributing editor at Rolling Stone and the author of ''Detroit City Is the Place to Be.''

 BODY:
ONCE a year, business and political leaders from metropolitan Detroit travel to an island resort that bans all motorized vehicles and talk about the regional economy.
For me, memories of childhood vacations at that resort, Mackinac Island -- the ferry ride, the fudge shops, the horse-drawn carriages -- are primarily olfactory. In the unlikely event I'm ever again hit with the dueling scents of confectioner's exhaust and horse manure, it would probably trigger some kind of Proustian flashback.
For years, Michigan's business community seemed bent on flashbacks of its own, to the days when the Big Three automakers towered arrogantly from the safe confines of an insular culture. But now its buzzwords are ''innovation,'' ''entrepreneurship'' and a ''21st-century global market.'' This week's Mackinac Policy Conference has positioned itself as a sort of Midwestern Davos, with a roster of marquee speakers, including Michelle Rhee, Jeb Bush and the hosts of ''Morning Joe.'' 
The topic on everyone's mind will be the fate of Detroit, which was placed under state control in March by Gov. Rick Snyder. The governor, a Republican, is attending the conference, and four of the candidates running for mayor in November are scheduled to speak there today -- among them, the front-runners: the excellently named former police chief Benny Napoleon, and Mike Duggan, who has a serious shot at becoming the first white mayor of Detroit in 40 years.
That would be a compelling story in normal circumstances. But this year, racial dynamics pale beside the surreal spectacle of candidates campaigning for a job that basically no longer exists.
Detroit, with at least $15 billion in long-term debt, is teetering on the brink of municipal bankruptcy, and is slated to remain under state control for at least 18 months. During this period, the mayor and City Council retain their titles, but little else. (This might explain Mayor Dave Bing's announcement that he would not seek re-election; neither will four of the nine City Council incumbents.) Instead, the emergency manager appointed by Governor Snyder, the bankruptcy lawyer Kevyn D. Orr, will continue to rule Detroit with sweeping powers that include the ability to privatize city services, sell off municipal assets and alter union contracts.
To critics, emergency managers are unelected dictators, most often installed in poor, majority black cities. Last fall, Michigan voters repealed the emergency manager law in a ballot referendum. But Governor Snyder rammed through a new version during the lame-duck session of the G.O.P.-controlled State Legislature -- a flagrantly undemocratic move, seemingly driven less by ideology than fear of what a Detroit bankruptcy might do to the credit ratings of the surrounding suburbs and the state.
The hope is that Mr. Orr, who worked as a lead attorney on Chrysler's managed bankruptcy, will be able to prevent Detroit from entering Chapter 9. Yet in one of his first acts, he signed off on the hiring of his own former law firm, Jones Day, to help restructure Detroit's long-term debt -- despite the fact that Jones Day already represents some of the very banks holding said debt, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
Indeed, the least surprising development to anyone following Detroit's woes has been Wall Street's continued ability to squeeze money out of a city that can't afford to keep its streetlights on or police its neighborhoods (there were almost as many murders in Detroit last year as there were in New York, a city with 11 times the population; Detroit officers are working 12-hour shifts with 10 percent pay cuts; and private businesses recently kicked in $8 million to buy the department new squad cars and ambulances).
In recent years, Detroit's water department has paid Wall Street banks hundreds of millions in termination fees alone in order to get out of bad municipal bond deals. (The city utility is so broke, it issued new bonds in order to pay the fees to get out of the old bonds!)
According to a recent Reuters article, since corporate bankruptcies have declined, investors specializing in ''distressed'' hedge funds have begun circling troubled municipalities, with no city ''attracting more attention than Detroit.'' One financial adviser quoted in the story sounded a note of caution to the would-be vultures, noting that unlike a corporation, ''you can't liquidate a city.''
But apparently no one informed Mr. Orr, whose spokesman, Bill Nowling, told The Detroit Free Press that the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts, including works by van Gogh and Matisse, was being listed as an asset in the event of bankruptcy. ''Creditors can really force the issue,'' Mr. Nowling said. ''If you go into court, they can object and say, 'Hey, I'm taking a huge haircut, and you've got a billion dollars' worth of art sitting over there.' ''
Why stop there? Perhaps as part of a settlement, Mr. Orr can negotiate with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra to play at creditors' annual shareholder luncheons, or work out a deal wherein laid-off autoworkers perform free annual tuneups on the limousines of bank executives. Better yet, he could tear a page from the Chrysler turnaround -- which, of course, ended with the company's being purchased by Fiat. See where I'm going with this? Italians love art, they love cars, and they know how to monetize old ruins!
In a different world, Mr. Orr might instead consider more aggressively challenging the city's creditors, or lobbying for the sort of federal cash infusion received by the faltering banks and auto companies. Unfortunately, such scenarios aren't likely to come up during today's Mackinac panel on Detroit's turnaround -- moderated by the vice chairman of a bank.

HEADLINE: Unattached, Rhode Island Governor Joining Democrats

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, the only Independent governor in the nation, plans to switch to the Democratic Party as he faces a tough re-election fight next year. 
Mr. Chafee, who served in the United States Senate as a Republican, had discussed the possibility of becoming a Democrat for months and spoke last year at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.
He was unavailable for comment on Wednesday, but a spokesman, Christian Vareika, confirmed the news after it was first reported by Politico. Mr. Vareika said Mr. Chafee would announce his decision Thursday morning in his hometown, Warwick.
He said the governor had concluded that ''the priorities and principles that have guided him throughout his career align with the Democratic Party's,'' particularly with regard to public education, job creation and equal rights.
With three-fourths of voters disapproving of his job performance and the state's economy limping along, analysts say that becoming a Democrat may be Mr. Chafee's best shot at winning re-election. His apparent hope is that as a Democrat, President Obama will step in on his behalf and help him through a difficult primary.
Mr. Chafee and Mr. Obama, who overlapped in their short Senate careers, have developed a supportive relationship. Mr. Chafee backed Mr. Obama in his battle against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary in 2008 and supported him again in 2012.
In turn, Mr. Obama stayed out of the Rhode Island governor's race in 2010 and did not endorse the Democratic candidate ''out of respect for his friend Lincoln Chafee,'' an Obama spokesman said at the time.
In a statement issued Wednesday through the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Obama said, ''I'm delighted to hear that Governor Chafee is joining the Democratic Party.'' But he gave no hint as to whether he would endorse anyone in a Democratic primary.
By contrast, Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, indicated in a statement that the association would stay neutral in any intramural battle. ''We are excited to welcome Governor Chafee to the ranks of Democratic governors and look forward to enthusiastically supporting whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee in Rhode Island,'' he said.
At the moment, Mr. Chafee's prospects for re-election seem fairly low. Various Democrats are lining up to run against him, including two potentially strong contenders: Gina Raimondo, the state treasurer, and Angel Taveras, the mayor of Providence.
''His move comes from thinking, 'If I don't switch parties, I'm going to lose anyway,' '' said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University. ''And maybe as a Democrat, the president can come out for him wholeheartedly or at least help dry up the funding for the other candidates.''
But this will be tricky, she said, in part because Ms. Raimondo is a woman and Mr. Taveras a Latino, both representing important Democratic constituencies. Mr. Chafee is ''a white patrician Yankee who was a Republican,'' Dr. Schiller said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cup in Logo Is at Heart Of a Trademark Dispute

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
First came the tattoo, etched across the knuckles of Sam Penix's right fist in 2009. It said ''I [coffee cup] N Y,'' the bold red cup leaping out from the black letters.
Then came the logo -- a cartoon of Mr. Penix's tattooed fist grasping a coffee-filled portafilter, punching through the name of the East Village coffee shop Mr. Penix co-owned, Everyman Espresso. It said everything Mr. Penix meant for the shop to stand for: an in-your-face passion for New York City and for fine coffee.
Then, last month, came the letter from agents for the state's Department of Economic Development. 
It said, ''Everyman Espresso's unauthorized and confusingly similar use of the I love NY® logo'' violated federal trademark law and implied ''a misleading designation of source, origin, endorsement, sponsorship or approval by the New York State Department of Economic Development of your merchandise.''
Stop the French presses.
Down came the logo from Everyman's Web site. Down to the basement went the mugs and T-shirts and onesies emblazoned with it. Out went the letter from Everyman's lawyer, promising, ''My client shall cease all use of its mark.''
Mr. Penix and his partner Jay Terrana hoped that would be enough. It was not.
Back came the reply from a lawyer for CMG Worldwide, the agency that is kept very busy protecting the trademark of the state's iconic, oft-ripped-off ''I love NY'' mark.
''We expect that any entity that infringes on the rights of our client compensate it for unauthorized use,'' the lawyer, Clare Neumann, wrote on May 20, requesting ''an accounting of all gross revenues generated during the period when the I love NY® Trademark was used'' to help her set the appropriate penalty.
That, in coffee parlance, has left a bitter taste in Mr. Penix's mouth.
''Basically, it's extortion,'' he said. ''It's also ironic because we are being threatened by the entity that has vowed to grow our New York business.''
The mission of Empire State Development, the department's parent agency, is indeed ''to promote a vigorous and growing economy, encourage the creation of new job and economic opportunities, increase revenues to the State and its municipalities, and achieve stable and diversified local economies.'' Empire State Development is also home to the state tourism department, which started an effort last year to revive and reinvent its ''I love NY'' campaign.
On Monday, Everyman slapped a ''Censored'' sign over the logo on the door of its second shop, on West Broadway in SoHo, which opened last summer. Everyman's principals are complying with Ms. Neumann's request, albeit under protest. ''We just think there's no likelihood of confusion,'' Mr. Terrana said.
Ms. Neumann's response is, essentially, that the law -- specifically, section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 USC 1125(a) -- is the law. Nor does the fact that the red coffee cup does not much resemble the red heart of the I love NY logo make much difference. Federal regulations, she said, ''prohibit companies from using any part of a trademark.''
In the 36 years since the designer Milton Glaser came up with the logo to help boost New York's sagging mid-'70s image, the state has filed thousands of trademark objections and cease-and-desist letters. Last year alone, a state official said, more than 100 letters were sent.
Many go to vendors who use the whole logo without permission. But the state has also gone after the makers of ''I love Yoga'' T-shirts and ''I love Paris'' bumper stickers. After Sept. 11, when Mr. Glaser designed an ''I love NY More Than Ever'' logo with a smudge on the heart, the state even threatened to (but did not) sue him, Mr. Glaser said.
But Everyman has another option, Ms. Neumann wrote. It can submit a proposal to buy licensing rights, an arrangement that state officials said brought in more than $2.5 million last year.
No thanks, said Mr. Terrana. ''It would just make more sense for us to change our mark than pay on an ongoing basis to use theirs,'' he said. ''That's setting aside the fact that we don't think we're infringing on it anyway.''
Mr. Penix's tattoo itself is safe -- as long as he doesn't misuse it.
''I just have to keep it separate from the promotion of the business and put it away for photos,'' he wrote. ''No more fan photos of the fist.''

HEADLINE: E.U. States Win Leeway on Deficits

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS and JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Retreating slowly from tough austerity policies that have been widely blamed for leaving 27 million Europeans out of work, the European Union's executive arm said Wednesday it would allow France, Spain and five other nations more time to meet mandatory budget deficit targets.
But the Brussels-based European Commission also cautioned against the temptations of debt-fueled economic stimulus, stressing in its annual review of economic policy recommendations that Europe instead needs to dismantle rigid labor regulations and remove other ''structural'' obstacles to growth. 
The mixed message marked Europe's latest response to an economic crisis that has led to six consecutive quarters of negative growth, left even previously robust northern economies battling recession and pushed overall unemployment to around 11 percent and to more than twice that in Spain and Greece.
''The fact that more than 120 million people are at risk of poverty or social exclusion is a real worry,'' said José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, at a news conference. ''There is no room for complacency,'' he said, describing the situation in some countries as a ''social emergency.''
Addressing concerns that Europe has pushed too hard for spending cuts, Mr. Barroso -- using an economists' euphemism for austerity -- said ''we now have the space to slow down the pace of consolidation.'' But he also warned that ''growth fueled by public and private debt is not sustainable.'' This, he added, is ''artificial growth.''
He complained that a bitter policy debate that has often cast austerity as the enemy of growth ''has been to a large extent futile and even counterproductive.''
Five year after the global financial crisis swept in from the United States, most European countries, with the notable exception of Germany, are still stuck in economic doldrums and show scant sign of even the modest recovery achieved by the United States and Japan, which have both opted for more government-funded stimulus than Europe.
This dismal record has put champions of fiscal rigor at the European Commission under intense pressure to back off unpopular budget cuts and instead follow the prescriptions of John Maynard Keynes, the late British economist who urged that government spending be ramped up in times of crisis.
The policy recommendations announced Wednesday in Brussels don't suggest any U-turn in policy but they do confirm a slow but steady shift away from swiftly limiting deficit spending. Olli Rehn, the commission's senior economic policy maker, announced that seven countries would be given more time to reach a deficit target of 3 percent of gross domestic product.
France, Poland, Slovenia and Spain, he said, will be given an extra two years, while Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal will each get an extra year.
Mr. Rehn said that Europe still needs ''fiscal consolidation'' in the long-run but added that its pace this year would be ''half what it was last year and to some extent it will be slowed further.'' The decision to give France more time, he said, was based on expectations that its socialist president, François Hollande, would push through long-stalled reforms to cut the cost of hiring workers and boost the country's flagging competitiveness. A key part of this, Mr. Rehn said, is pension reform.
Mr. Hollande responded angrily to the commission's proposals, particularly those concerning the pension system. ''The European Commission cannot dictate to us what we have to do,'' French media quoted the president as saying. Mr. Hollande insisted that the shape of any pension reform, a highly contentious issue in France, ''is up to us, and to us alone.''
France's legislature earlier this month enacted a modest trim of labor regulations but Mr. Hollande, under fire from within his own party and deeply unpopular with the public at large, faces an uphill struggle to implement reforms that, when attempted by his predecessors, led to large street protests and labor unrest.
The extension granted to France and others immediately raised eyebrows among some analysts, who said these countries might use them as an excuse to relax their reform efforts. ''Countries are going to interpret these recommendations in self-serving ways,'' said Mujtaba Rahman, the director for Europe for the Eurasia Group, a research group. ''The commission argues its rules are being applied intelligently, but countries such as France will use this to argue they have prevailed on Europe to end austerity.''
Wrangling over how to best address Europe's crisis has created deep splits, dividing richer countries from poorer ones and triggering a widespread public backlash against the European Union and established political elites in individual countries. It has also divided policymakers in Brussels.
In a remarks published Wednesday by German media, the energy commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, scoffed at assurances that France is working to get its economic house in order and said ''too many in Europe still believe that everything will be fine.'' France, he said, ''is completely unprepared to do what's necessary,'' while Italy, Bulgaria and Romania ''are essentially ungovernable.'' The European Union, he added, ''is ripe for an overhaul.''
Mr. Barroso, the commission president, declined to comment on Mr. Oettinger's remarks.

HEADLINE: China's Food Play Extends Its Reach, Already Mighty

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
If you dined on tilapia recently, chances are it came from China. And that artificial vanilla you just used to make cookies? It, too, may have made the same long journey to your kitchen in the United States.
A growing amount of food commonly consumed by Americans -- ranging from canned tuna and mandarin oranges to fresh mushrooms and apple juice -- is now being imported from China. By the end of last year, the United States imported 4.1 billion pounds of food products from China, according to the Agriculture Department.
American imports of Chinese food products gained more attention on Wednesday, when Smithfield Foods, one of the biggest and oldest pork producers in the United States, agreed to sell itself to Shuanghui International, one of China's largest meat processors. 
The $4.7 billion deal amounts to the largest takeover to date of an American company by a Chinese one. Although Smithfield emphasized that the deal was intended to deliver more pork to China, not the reverse, it nonetheless prompted concern about China's expanding role in the American food supply and the implications that might have for food safety in the United States.
''We are importing more and more food from China at the same time we are hearing more and more about food scandals involving Chinese companies,'' said Patty Lovera, assistant director of Food and Water Watch who testified in Congress at a hearing on Chinese food imports. Food safety problems, like melamine deliberately put into pet foods and baby formula as well as unsafe levels of cadmium in rice, have plagued China. The latest episode involved fox, rat and mink meat that was doctored with gelatin, pigment and nitrates and sold as mutton.
''We should definitely give the Chinese an award for creativity in adulterating foods,'' said Jeff Nelken, a food safety expert. ''They are a great resource for counterfeited foods, like honey products that don't seem to have any pollen in them.''
A 2009 study by the Agriculture Department concluded that while Chinese officials were working to improve food safety and the regulation of food production -- requiring the small number of food exporters there to gain certification -- imports from China were still problematic. ''Monitoring the wide range of products and hazards that can arise at various points in the export chain is a challenge for Chinese and U.S. officials,'' the report stated.
The United States government has continued to have concerns about Chinese food exports, with a Congressional hearing this month that was billed as ''The Threat of China's Unsafe Consumables'' as the latest example. ''The health and safety, not only of the United States and Europe but that of people around the world, has come to be dependent on the quality of goods imported from China,'' Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican who heads the House Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats, said in opening the hearing. ''Yet the task of inspecting and testing Chinese goods is beyond the ability of governments, considering the magnitude of that challenge.''
Imported foods sold in groceries and other food stores must be labeled with their country of origin, but a substantial portion of imports end up in restaurant and food service meals, where consumers have no idea of their source.
Additionally, once imported foods are processed in any way, such labeling is no longer required under government regulations.
Thus, frozen imported peas and carrots would require a label if packaged separately, but mixed together and sold in a single package, they do not need labeling, Ms. Lovera said. Fish fillets must carry labeling, but imported fish sticks or crab patties do not.
Many of the scandals over Chinese food stuffs imported to the United States have involved products that fall under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for monitoring seafoods and fruits and vegetables coming into the country.
Americans have long been eating foods imported from China, the world's largest agricultural economy and one of the biggest exporters of agricultural products. China shipped 4.1 billion pounds of food to the United States last year, according to the Agriculture Department, including almost half of the apple juice, 80 percent of the tilapia and more than 10 percent of the frozen spinach eaten.
China is also a big source of ingredients used in food, like xylitol, a candy sweetener; artificial vanilla, soy sauce and folic acid.
China is not, however, allowed to export fresh pork or beef to the United States because it still has outbreaks of hoof and mouth disease.
The Smithfield announcement reminded many people of video footage this spring that showed thousands of pig carcasses floating down a river that supplies drinking water to Shanghai. The source of the floating pigs remains a mystery, but they were hailed as a sign that a Chinese government crackdown on people selling dead and diseased pigs for pork was working.
In 2011, Shuanghui itself got caught up in that enforcement effort, after Chinese officials found it selling pork laced with clenbuterol, a veterinary medicine banned for use in animals intended for human consumption.
Smithfield and Shuanghui on Wednesday emphasized that the deal aimed to increase the supply of high quality, safe pork to China.
James Roth, director of the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University, said he had no concerns about food safety arising out of the deal because any pork processed in the United States would have to go through the Agriculture Department's inspection systems. ''They're doing this to enhance exports to China because they need safe meat for their population, not to bring Chinese pork to the United States,'' Professor Roth said.
Processed pork products like smoked hams, sausages and bacon could conceivably be imported from China, but only if they met standards set by the World Organization for Animal Health, which require cooking at high heats for a specific amount of time, he said.
China has been pressing for permission to export poultry, which does not contract hoof and mouth disease, to the United States for some time,
Neal Keppy, a farmer in Iowa who raises hogs from about three weeks of age until they are slaughtered, said he was confident that Smithfield under Chinese ownership would continue to produce high quality, safe pork products.
''What I think is more concerning is if China owns Smithfield, who knows if that pork will stay in this country if the food supply gets tight?'' Mr. Keppy said. ''In that case, a lot of pork will head for China instead of feeding U.S. mouths.''
He said he hoped regulators would keep that in mind as they reviewed the deal.

HEADLINE: Ecology Lessons From the Cold War

BYLINE: By JACOB DARWIN HAMBLIN. 
Jacob Darwin Hamblin is an associate professor of history at Oregon State University and the author of ''Arming Mother Nature: The Birth of Catastrophic Environmentalism.''

 BODY:
CORVALLIS, Ore. -- TODAY the effort to preserve the planet's biodiversity is often seen as a campaign to save the whales for their own sake, or to give polar bears a few more winters on the Arctic ice. But in the 1950s, when the concept was first discussed, it was understood that far more was at stake. The ''conservation of variety,'' as it was called during the early years of the cold war, was no less than a strategy of human survival.
At that time, American military leaders and scientists were contemplating the possibility of total war with the Soviet Union, with not only civilians, but plants, animals and entire ecosystems as fair game. The war planners imagined a brave new world in which biological and radiological weapons would be considered side by side with crop destruction, huge fires, artificial earthquakes, tsunamis, ocean current manipulation, sea-level tinkering and even weather control. 
Numerous approaches seemed feasible then: melting polar ice by blackening it with soot, seeding clouds with chemicals to harass an enemy with rain and mud, killing life-sustaining crops with deadly cereal rust spores or radioactive contamination. Entire forests might be set ablaze by the thermal radiation of a high-altitude nuclear blast. Well-placed detonations might unleash the energy of the earth's crust, oceans or weather systems. During the Korean War, Representative Albert Gore Sr. went so far as to urge President Harry S. Truman to contaminate an enormous strip of territory across the Korean Peninsula with radioactive waste from plutonium processing, hoping the poisonous landscape would deter Communist troops from moving south.
By the early 1960s, NATO was calling these approaches ''environmental warfare.'' One of the important considerations in the calculus, not surprisingly, was self-preservation. War planning would include figuring out how to keep people alive beyond the initial devastation. The best approach, scientists concluded, was coming up with ways to protect ecosystems.
Today we call it biodiversity. One of its principal advocates was the Oxford ecologist Charles Elton, whose book ''The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants,'' argued that simplifying landscapes with weedkillers, or planting single crop species over large areas made a recipe for disaster. The best defense from diseases, other species or natural catastrophes, he said, was to conserve as much biological variety as possible in the fields and hedges of the countryside to counterbalance any threat. In his book he called it the conservation of variety.
Elton's approach not only inspired Rachel Carson to write ''Silent Spring,'' about the harm done by insecticides, it also resonated among scientists in the defense establishment. Fantasizing about environmental warfare in the early 1960s, NATO scientists tried to imagine which links in ecosystems were vulnerable to manipulation. Studies had recently shown radioactive fallout infiltrating reindeer meat, a crucial part of Eskimos' diets. It was a revelation to think that such a connection in the food chain was now targetable. But the reverse was also true, and underscored Elton's point: the complexity of an ecosystem made any particular ''link'' less important, making the system less vulnerable.
This was the lesson defense planners took to heart. They decided that a robust peacetime market economy provided variety, and thus security in peace and war. If nuclear war ever came, a decentralized, diversified society would be in better shape than a centrally planned one like the Soviet Union's. The same logic applied to biological variety. That is why strategic stockpiles of Western nations during the cold war did not collect enormous stores of favorite foods but samples of the widest range of species imaginable.
In the face of natural disasters, such diversity seemed to be the West's ace in the hole. The variety of agricultural products in the United States far outpaced those of the Soviet Union, and is a reason that C.I.A. analysts predicted in the 1980s that global climate change would cause more harm to Russia than to the United States.
We managed to survive the cold war, but the challenges to our environmental security remain. We need to stop treating the idea of biodiversity as a philosophical preference and embrace it as a strategy of survival, just as it was for those who, more than a half-century ago, planned for a calamitous total war.

HEADLINE: Britain's Self-Defeating Referendum

BYLINE: By MICHAEL C. WILLIAMS

 BODY:
LONDON -- It is often forgotten that the very first meeting of the United Nations Security Council took place in London on Jan. 17, 1946, at Church House, Westminster, the headquarters of the Church of England. The General Assembly met in the nearby Methodist Central Hall. Both buildings lay just a stone's throw from the two houses of Parliament.
Then, as now, nearly 70 years later, the Security Council had five permanent members: the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France. These countries were the major political, economic and military powers in the world at the time, with the British economy being second only to that of the United States. Today both the World Bank and the United Nations rank Britain as the seventh largest, with three countries with larger economies -- Japan, Germany and Brazil -- all pushing hard for Security Council membership. 
The convulsions that afflict Britain's Conservative Party over European Union membership make a 2017 referendum a near certainty and a pullout a distinct possibility. Exit from the E.U. would self-evidently diminish the U.K.'s influence in Europe, leaving Britain alongside two other important outsiders, Norway and Switzerland, but without the former's oil or the latter's better-managed banking sector.
With more British exports going to the Republic of Ireland than to China by a ratio of two to one, the economic wisdom of such a move could be challenged by a schoolboy. With the certainty of a British referendum, France's idea of a euro zone secretariat would almost surely succeed, and likely persuade euro zone holdouts like Sweden that there is no alternative but accepting the euro.
In less than a month, negotiations begin for a trade pact between the United States and the European Union that would encompass half the world's economic output and a third of all trade, and be the most ambitious trade accord since the formation of the World Trade Organization in 1995. Ireland, which presently holds the rotating six-month E.U. presidency, aims to secure Union-wide agreement on the start of negotiations at a meeting set for June 14, with a final goal of 2015 for completion.
Would Britain seriously want to be outside such a trade arrangement? It could of course negotiate its own agreements with the pact following a possible exit from the European Union, but this would be on almost certainly less advantageous terms.
Equally, advocates of a British exit imperil the U.K.'s standing in the wider world. Britain has quite rightly been proud of its permanent Security Council membership since the Council's creation in 1945. Being one of the five permanent members has given the country a diplomatic reach and influence far outside our current economic strength and perhaps even our military strength. Withdrawal from the E.U. would undoubtedly bring this into question. Why should a country of 62 million have a seat when another democracy of 1.25 billion people -- India -- does not have one?
Moreover, the likelihood of France's permanent Security Council seat becoming de facto that of the European Union would leave Britain increasingly and dangerously isolated. The E.U. already contributes 38 percent of the U.N.'s budget, the United States a further 22 percent and Japan 11 percent. Britain provides just over 5 percent, or about a half of Japan's contribution. Since 2011, the European Union has been recognized as an entity in its own right, with full speaking rights in the General Assembly, and many aspire to its eventual assumption of a seat in the Security Council.
Increasingly, this goal is likely to win support from many, if not most, E.U. member states, and France too might find the establishment of a permanent E.U. seat to its eventual advantage. It is easy to imagine the attraction of an E.U. seat, under Franco-German leadership, for a community whose population exceeds that of the United States and Russia and comes second only to China.
Moreover, were Scotland to leave the U.K. as a result of its own 2014 referendum on independence, the subsequent dismantling of Britain's nuclear weapons facility at Faslane would further diminish our standing and increase pressure for the U.K. to vacate the Security Council seat. It would be hard to imagine the United States being content with the bizarre arrangement of those nuclear weapons remaining under a Scottish government opposed to nuclear weaponry.
Withdrawal from the European Union would leave Britain looking irrelevant in Europe, and the rest of the world would likely soon draw its own, similar, conclusion. British conservative critics of the E.U. often point to its democratic deficits, but this is a charge that could equally be applied to the United Nations, and one that points up the vulnerability of Britain's own position on the Security Council.

HEADLINE: Some in Europe Are Rethinking Opposition to Fracking

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Texas -- In oil-rich parts of Texas, hydraulic fracturing has almost become a way of life. Drilling rigs and pumping equipment pepper the landscape, and enormous trucks carrying oil field supplies rumble down narrow, dusty roads.
In Europe, things could hardly be more different. Opposition to hydraulic fracturing -- the process of injecting water, sand and chemicals into the earth to blast apart rock and retrieve oil or natural gas -- is widespread and entrenched. Some countries, including France, ban the practice, which is also known as fracking. 
''There is a head of steam up against fracking,'' said Jonathan Stern, chairman of the natural gas research program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in England.
In Germany, beer brewers recently urged a ban on fracking, citing concerns about groundwater contamination, according to the newspaper Bild.
Europe's opposition is being put to the test, however, as pro-fracking forces lobby for exploring underground shale gas reserves. They argue that locally drilled natural gas can create jobs and increase energy security -- a potent argument for a continent uncomfortably reliant on natural gas from Russia. Last week, a group of British business leaders, the Institute of Directors, put out a report saying that developing shale gas reserves could lead to tens of thousands of jobs.
''Shale gas could be a new North Sea for Britain,'' Corin Taylor, the report's author, said in a statement accompanying its release.
Mr. Stern noted that fracking is a long way from happening on a major scale in Europe, and some early results have not been promising. Several major international companies have scaled back their work in Poland after operations proved disappointing.
Even so, some countries are lifting their moratoriums on fracking in the hope of good results. Britain did so in December, though the prospect of exploratory drilling has brought protests. Romania also recently lifted its moratorium, and the gas-rich Netherlands will decide soon about whether to do the same.
Dutch politicians are awaiting the results of an independent study on shale gas that is due to be released this summer. Then the country will re-evaluate its moratorium, according to Bart Visser, a spokesman for the minister of economic affairs.
The study is about whether or not to allow test drilling in shale rock, Coby van der Linde, director of the Clingendael International Energy Program in the Hague, said in an e-mail. It will also determine the conditions under which the shale gas could be produced, she said.
At least one key political group is on the fence, according to Ms. Van der Linde. And the Dutch pro-environment party GroenLinks is firmly opposed to fracking.
''Whether or not it is an independent inquiry remains to be seen,'' said Liesbeth van Tongeren, a member of Parliament and spokeswoman for GroenLinks on energy issues. She expressed concerns about water, truck traffic and fracking's effect on the climate.
Groups with ''dollar signs in their eyes'' are promoting fracking, she said.
Some guidance on fracking may also be forthcoming on the European Union level. By the end of the year, the European Commission will craft a shale gas initiative that could lead to a risk-management strategy for fracking. A meeting in Brussels is being held on this issue next week.
As Europe makes its decisions on fracking, some are looking to the United States for ideas about the regulation of fracking. Each state in the United States generally has its own approach, slightly different from the others, and national regulations, applying to federally owned lands, are still being formulated.
John Tintera, former executive director of the Railroad Commission of Texas, the curiously named agency that regulates drilling in the leading oil-producing state, said he had been to Romania twice already to discuss fracking, and would soon go to Ukraine and perhaps Turkey.
When talking to Europeans, ''the first thing they want to know is, can hydro-fracturing be done safely?'' said Mr. Tintera, who is now a partner at Sebree & Tintera, an energy consulting firm based in Texas. ''The second thing they want to know is, how do you ensure that?''
The answers, Mr. Tintera said, are that fracking can be done safely and that a comprehensive regulatory framework is necessary. Such regulation includes ''boots in the field,'' or trained inspectors, he said.
Mr. Stern, of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said that Europe had ''massively overhyped'' both the downsides and the upsides of fracking and shale gas exploration. Europeans hold a bifurcated view of what has happened in the United States, he said: Some Europeans admire the U.S. fracking successes and believe that Europe should follow its example, perhaps with additional caution. In others' minds, fracking in the United States has ''all been a big disaster.''
Asked to predict the future of fracking in Europe, Mr. Stern forecast that in five years' time, a few countries would be producing ''very modest amounts of shale gas.'' Those countries might be Poland, Britain and perhaps Romania or Bulgaria.
But ''if there are any environmental problems, the whole thing will stop and not restart,'' he said.

HEADLINE: I.M.F., Predicting Slower Growth for China, Urges Overhauls

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The International Monetary Fund trimmed its growth forecast for China on Wednesday, flagged concerns about the rapid expansion in lending in the country's vast economy and urged a ''decisive'' push for overhauls that it argues would put the economy on the path toward sustainable growth.
The lowered forecast -- the I.M.F. shaved a quarter of a percentage point off its previous projection for 8 percent growth in China, to 7.75 percent -- was the latest in a string of similar reductions by analysts in recent weeks. And although the new projection remains higher than the Chinese government's target of 7.5 percent growth, the I.M.F.'s revision and comments underlined the challenges facing policy makers as they try to revamp the Chinese economy, the world's second-largest, after that of the United States. 
Chinese government data for the first quarter of the year showed that the pace of economic growth had slowed to 7.7 percent -- markedly below what most analysts had expected. Economic indicators for April and May also have been lackluster.
In the short term, recent credit expansion, combined with a mild pickup in the global economy, is expected to lift China's growth rate in the second half of this year, the I.M.F. said, after concluding an annual review of the Chinese economy.
But in the longer term, major efforts are needed to rebalance the economy and address problems like soaring income inequality and environmental degradation, which built up in the headlong expansion of the past few decades.
The rapid growth in credit in recent years also has emerged as a major source of concern among analysts, who worry that the accumulation of debt brings substantial risks, including asset price bubbles and potentially destabilizing defaults.
The I.M.F. added its voice to the chorus of warnings about the so-called shadow-banking system -- lending outside the regulated banking system, which has been growing rapidly in the past few years.
The growth in credit, the I.M.F. said, ''raises concerns about the quality of investment and its impact on repayment capacity, especially since a fast-growing share of credit is flowing through less-well supervised parts of the financial system.'' Growth, it added, has become ''too dependent on the continued expansion of investment, much of it by the property sector and local governments whose financial position is being affected as a result.''
Policy makers in Beijing are well aware of these issues and are aiming to bring about more balanced, higher-quality growth that will improve living standards and household incomes.
The I.M.F. said it was ''reassured'' by the authorities' focus on the financial sector and fiscal overhauls, adding that ''reining in total social financing growth is a priority and will require further tightening of prudential oversight.'' Such policies may slow activity in the short term, the I.M.F. said, but they would do so ''in a way that supports the transition to a more sustainable growth path.''
While China still has ''significant policy space and financial capacity to maintain stability'' the I.M.F. said, ''the margins of safety are narrowing'' and a ''decisive impetus to reforms is needed to contain vulnerabilities and move the economy to a more sustainable growth path.''

HEADLINE: High-Dividend Shares Lead Markets Lower

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street's recent passion for high-dividend stocks seems to be fading.
The stock market closed lower on Wednesday, led by the same industry groups that had the biggest gains early in the year: rich dividend payers like power utilities and makers of consumer staples. 
Rising bond yields have been an important factor behind that shift.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is near the highest it has been in 13 months after a sharp increase on Tuesday. That is giving investors who want steady income an alternative to dividend-rich stocks. Investors piled into those stocks at the beginning of the year, when bond yields were close to historic lows.
More broadly, after this year's powerful bull run -- the Dow Jones industrial average is up 16.8 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.6 percent -- investors may be running out of reasons to keep plowing money into the stock market.
''There's a vacuum of catalysts to continue to push,'' said Sam Stovall, chief United States equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. Now, Mr. Stovall said, investors are wondering: ''Well, should I take some profits and sit on the sidelines and then get back in?''
Mr. Stovall noted that S.& P. 500 has had a temporary pullback of at least 5 percent every year since the end of the World War II, which has not happened yet in 2013.
The Dow closed down 106.59 points at 15,302.80, a loss of 0.7 percent. That decline matched its advance the day before, when it closed at a high, the ninth time it has done so this month. The Dow was down as much as 179 points in late morning trading, then rose moderately in the afternoon.
The S.& P. 500 index was down 11.70 points to 1,648.36, also 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite lost 21.37 points to 3,467.52, or 0.6 percent.
''At some point, interest rates will go up, and that's obviously having some impact on stocks,'' said Erik Davidson, deputy chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. ''And you're seeing it in the sectors that you would expect. The hardest sectors hit recently have been the more dividend-driven stock sectors.''
In commodities trading, the price of crude oil fell $1.88, or 2 percent, to $93.13. Gold rose $12.20, or 0.9 percent, to $1,391.30 an ounce. The dollar fell against the euro and the Japanese yen.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 14/32, to 96 23/32, and the yield fell to 2.12 percent from 2.17 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: For Medicare, Immigrants Offer Surplus, Study Finds

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
Immigrants have contributed billions of dollars more to Medicare in recent years than the program has paid out on their behalf, according to a new study, a pattern that goes against the notion that immigrants are a drain on federal health care spending.
The study, led by researchers at Harvard Medical School, measured immigrants' contributions to the part of Medicare that pays for hospital care, a trust fund that accounts for nearly half of the federal program's revenue. It found that immigrants generated surpluses totaling $115 billion from 2002 to 2009. In comparison, the American-born population incurred a deficit of $28 billion over the same period.
The findings shed light on what demographers have long known: Immigrants are crucial in balancing the age structure of American society, providing an infusion of young, working-age adults who support the country's aging population and help cover the costs of Medicare and Social Security. And with the largest generation in the United States, the baby boomers, now starting to retire, the financial help from immigrants has never been more needed, experts said. 
Individual immigrant contributions were roughly the same as those of American citizens, the study found, but immigrants as a group received less than they paid in, largely because they were younger on average than the American-born population and fewer of them were old enough to be eligible for benefits. The median age of Hispanics, whose foreign-born contingent is by far the largest immigrant group, is 27, according to the Brookings Institution. The median age of non-Hispanic whites in the United States is 42.
The study drew on two nationally representative federal surveys, from the Census Bureau and the Department of Health and Human Services. Researchers included the contributions of legal residents who were not citizens, a group that is eligible for Medicare if certain requirements are met; unauthorized immigrants; and citizens who were born abroad.
It was not clear how much of the surplus was made up of earnings by immigrants in the country illegally, who are ineligible for most government programs.
The Census Bureau, whose data was used for the contributions portion of the study, says it attempts to count all immigrants, including those in the country illegally.
The finding ''pokes a hole in the widespread assumption that immigrants drain U.S. health care spending dollars,'' said Leah Zallman, an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the lead author of the study.
The study, which was published on the Web site of the journal Health Affairs on Wednesday, comes as Congress considers legislation that would eventually give legal status to the country's 11 million unauthorized immigrants. The legislation has sparked a vigorous debate about whether immigrants ultimately contribute more than they receive from the federal budget. One of the sticking points has been whether immigrants should be eligible for government programs, including health benefits, before they qualify for citizenship, but while they are on the path to getting it.
The study was concerned only with Medicare, the federal program that accounts for about a fifth of all American health care expenditures. Experts said that the study's findings served as a useful reminder that immigrants, at least for now, are extending the life of the beleaguered program, not hastening its demise.
''There's this strong belief that immigrants are takers,'' said Leighton Ku, the director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University. ''This shows they are contributing hugely. Without immigrants, the Medicare trust fund would be in trouble sooner.'' The belief prevails, for example, among some opponents of immigration reform.
The study did not grapple with the health care costs of immigrants over their full lifetimes, a calculation that economists say is critical to understanding their long-term impact on the federal budget.
''It's just a snapshot of a point in time,'' said Paul Van de Water, a visiting fellow at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Similar calculations have been made for Social Security. The chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, Stephen C. Goss, estimated that immigrants in the country illegally, some of whom assume fake Social Security numbers to provide cover for employers and themselves, among other reasons, generated a surplus of about $12 billion for the Social Security Trust Fund in 2010.
But that equation would change if unauthorized immigrants were to gain legal status under a new law and eventually began collecting Social Security once they were of retirement age. One major policy question is how much that might cost, experts said.
The Heritage Foundation, a conservative institute, estimated that the legislation's changes, if implemented, could cost taxpayers more than $6 trillion. Critics of that calculation said it did not take into account the economic benefits that would arise from taking millions of people out of the shadow economy.
Mr. Goss, in a letter this month to Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said that the legislation's effect on the health of Social Security would be positive in the long term.
Gordon Hanson, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, who has worked on migration issues for 20 years, said there was still no comprehensive nonpartisan analysis of the fiscal consequences of putting illegal immigrants on the books.
Federal coffers tend to benefit from immigrants in the country illegally, he said, with contributions to programs like Social Security and Medicare that those immigrants cannot draw on later. State and local governments, on the other hand, have to absorb more of the costs, like education for their children and emergency room visits.
Immigrants tend to be healthier than American-born citizens, and have lower mortality rates, research has found. Dr. Ku said there was evidence that individual immigrants also use less health care than native-born Americans. He has calculated, for example, that immigrants' medical costs were 14 percent to 20 percent less than those of native-born Americans, even after controlling for other factors like emergency room visits and insurance coverage, which fewer immigrants have.
The study found that average costs to Medicare for immigrant enrollees in 2009 were $3,923, lower than the average $5,388 expenditure for the American-born. The difference, however, was just shy of statistical significance, because of wide variations in medical expenditures and the small numbers of immigrant enrollees, which made the study's margin of error wide.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who was an author of the institute's report this month, said that looking at Medicare alone was not very useful, as it was just one slice of the entire entitlement pie. And the large immigrant youth population, which the study spends most of its time on, is familiar, he said.
''It's a yawner of a study,'' he said. ''Young people don't get Medicare. We don't need several Ph.D.'s to tell us that.''
Others defended the findings, saying that they showed immigrants were helping prop up the country's retirement funds at the critical point when baby boomers were starting to retire.
''They'll be paying into the system at the very time it is most strained,'' said Patrick Oakford, a researcher on economic and immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning institute. He estimated that the average undocumented immigrant was 34 and therefore would not retire until 2046.

HEADLINE: Joblessness Shortens Lifespan of Least Educated White Women, Research Says

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
Researchers have known for some time that life expectancy is declining for the country's least educated white women, but they have not been able to explain why. A new study has found that the two factors most strongly associated with higher death rates were smoking and not having a job. 
The aim of the study, which is being published Thursday in The Journal of Health and Social Behavior, was to explain the growing gap in mortality between white women without a high school diploma and those with a high school diploma or more.
The study found that the odds of dying for the least educated women were 37 percent greater than for their more educated peers in any given year in the period of 1997 to 2001. The odds had risen to 66 percent by the period of 2002 to 2006. The authors controlled for age.
The researchers used a health survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, drawing on data from about 47,000 women ages 45 to 84. The study weighed more than a dozen factors to see which were causing the divergence in mortality rates. Poverty, obesity, homeownership, marital status and alcohol consumption were among the factors investigated.
But they mattered little. As it turned out, smoking was important, as had long been established, but researchers were surprised that joblessness had a dramatic effect, even after controlling for factors that employment would have generated, like income and health insurance.
''What is it about employment that has this huge impact on mortality, beyond the material resources it brings?'' said Jennifer Karas Montez, the study's lead author, a researcher at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies.
The study was an attempt to explain the reasons behind the troubling trend of declining life expectancy for the least educated Americans, particularly women. A study last year found that white women without a high school diploma lost five years of life expectancy between 1990 and 2008, a measure of decline last seen among Russians in the economic chaos that came after the fall of the Soviet Union. This year, researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that mortality for women had gone up in more than 40 percent of the counties in the United States since the early 1990s.
But the study raised more questions than it answered, in particular about why employment status affects physical health. Ms. Montez said there was some evidence that having a job offered intangible benefits that could improve health, including a sense of purpose and control in life, as well as providing networks that help to reduce social isolation.
One concern was that people who were not working were jobless because they were sick, but Ms. Montez said they did not find evidence for that.
Sarah Damaske, an assistant professor of labor studies and employment relations and sociology at Pennsylvania State University, said women who were not in the labor force, a minority now compared to the 1950s, were more likely to have been disadvantaged from the outset, coming from family backgrounds and economic circumstances that tended to produce poorer health outcomes.

HEADLINE: U.S. Women On the Rise As Family Breadwinner

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Women are not only more likely to be the primary caregivers in a family. Increasingly, they are primary breadwinners, too.
Four in 10 American households with children under age 18 now include a mother who is either the sole or primary earner for her family, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census and polling data released Wednesday. This share, the highest on record, has quadrupled since 1960.
The shift reflects evolving family dynamics. 
For one, it has become more acceptable and expected for married women to join the work force. It is also more common for single women to raise children on their own. Most of the mothers who are chief breadwinners for their families -- nearly two-thirds -- are single parents.
The recession may have played a role in pushing women into primary earning roles, as men are disproportionately employed in industries like construction and manufacturing that bore the brunt of the layoffs during the downturn. Women, though, have benefited from a smaller share of the job gains during the recovery; the public sector, which employs a large number of women, is still laying off workers.
Women's attitudes toward working have also changed. In 2007, before the recession officially began, 20 percent of mothers told Pew that their ideal situation would be to work full time rather than part time or not at all. The share had risen to 32 percent by the end of 2012.
The public is still divided about whether it is a good thing for mothers to work. About half of Americans say that children are better off if their mother is at home and doesn't have a job. Just 8 percent say the same about a father. Even so, most Americans acknowledge that the increasing number of working women makes it easier for families ''to earn enough to live comfortably.''
Demographically and socioeconomically, single mothers and married mothers differ, according to the Census Bureau's 2011 American Community Survey. The median family income for single mothers -- who are more likely to be younger, black or Hispanic, and less educated -- is $23,000. The median household income for married women who earn more than their husbands -- more often white, slightly older and college educated -- is $80,000. When the wife is the primary breadwinner, the total family income is generally higher.
Such marriages are still relatively rare, even if their share is growing. Of all married couples, 24 percent include a wife who earns more, versus 6 percent in 1960. (The percentages are similar for married couples who have children.)
The implications for the stability of marriages is unclear. In surveys, Americans usually indicate that they accept marriages where the wife is the greater earner. Just 28 percent of Americans surveyed by Pew agreed that it is ''generally better for a marriage if the husband earns more than his wife.''
But the data on actual marriage and divorce rates suggests slightly different attitudes.
A recent working paper by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and the National University of Singapore found that, in looking at the distribution of married couples by income of husband versus wife, there is a sharp drop-off in the number of couples in which the wife earns more than half of the household income. This suggests that the random woman and random man are much less likely to pair off if her income exceeds his, the paper says.
The economists also found that wives with a better education and stronger earning potential than their husbands are less likely to work. In other words, women are more likely to stay out of the work force if there is a big risk that they will make more than their husbands.
Perhaps even more tellingly, couples in which the wife earns more report less satisfaction with their marriage and higher rates of divorce. When the wife brings in more money, couples often revert to more stereotypical sex roles; in such cases, wives typically take on a larger share of household work and child care.
''Our analysis of the time use data suggests that gender identity considerations may lead a woman who seems threatening to her husband because she earns more than he does to engage in a larger share of home production activities, particularly household chores,'' the authors write.
Of course, these patterns may change as the job market evolves. College degrees, for example, are becoming increasingly important to both finding and keeping a job. And women are more likely than men to get college degrees.
As of 2011, there were more married-couple families with children in which the wife was more educated than the husband, according to Pew. In roughly 23 percent of married couples with children, the women had more education; in 17 percent of the couples, the men had higher education. The remaining 61 percent of two-parent families involve spouses with about equal levels of education.
Norms are also changing: Newlyweds seem to show more openness to having the wife earn more than her husband than do longer-married couples. In about 30 percent of newly married couples in 2011, the wife earned more, versus just 24 percent of all married couples.
Americans are becoming more accepting of single mothers as well. In a survey conducted April 25-28, Pew found that 64 percent of Americans said the growing number of children born to unmarried mothers is a ''big problem,'' down from 71 percent in 2007. Republicans are more likely than Democrats or independents to be concerned about the trend.
Today's single mothers are much more likely to have never been married than in the past, Pew found. In 1960, the share of never-married single mothers was just 4 percent; as of 2011, it had risen to 44 percent. Never-married mothers tend to make less money than their divorced or widowed counterparts, and are more likely to be a member of a racial or ethnic minority.

HEADLINE: Travels of the President Under a Microscope in an Era of Belt Tightening

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and PETER BAKER

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Perhaps it is nothing more than an accident of timing that as federal workers brace for a summer filled with unpaid furlough days, their leaders are traveling the nation and globe on trips that exude luxury.
On Wednesday, President Obama left the White House for two Chicago fund-raisers in the hope of helping Democrats retake the House in next year's elections. The cost of flying aboard Air Force One to his hometown: $180,000 per hour.
The same day, Michelle Obama traveled to Massachusetts to lunch with rich donors who had paid up to $37,600 per ticket at the Taj Boston Hotel. The meal included roasted Chilean sea bass with a fricassee of asparagus. Meanwhile, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, were in Rio de Janeiro, part of a six-day swing through Latin America to discuss trade and investment, including a stop in Trinidad and Tobago. 
''We've got kind of an Obama cabal in this room,'' the president joked Wednesday night during a $32,400-per-couple fund-raiser with about 70 of his friends at the home of Bettylu and Paul Saltzman, longtime supporters. He said returning to Chicago for the day was like ''Old Home Week.''
For a leader presiding over automatic budget cuts and a slow-moving economic recovery, there are growing political costs to presidential travel. Every move a president makes costs money, and in an era when money is in short supply, that means heightened scrutiny. Vacations are especially touchy.
''The president is asking the people to sacrifice but never himself,'' Representative Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah, said when he introduced a resolution this year asking Mr. Obama to forgo vacations to pay for resuming White House tours cut because of the automatic budget cuts, known as the sequester. ''We don't have a problem with him taking vacations, but it seems petty to close the White House to tours when forgoing one or two out-of-town vacations would easily pay for the cost of keeping it open.''
Bob Dole, the former Republican senator from Kansas, was more blunt when asked generally about Mr. Obama's travels in a rare interview on ''Fox News Sunday'' this week. ''He's on the road too much,'' Mr. Dole said.
Almost by definition, Mr. Obama lives a life foreign to most Americans, with the big white house and the ushers and chefs and the airplane fueled and ready to go. When he wants a weekend away, he can fly to Florida to golf with Tiger Woods. When his daughters take spring break, they head to Aspen to ski. He winters in Hawaii and summers on Martha's Vineyard.
But this summer's trips come as federal employees are tightening their belts. Last Friday, four federal agencies closed down -- the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and even the Office of Management and Budget -- as employees were ordered to take the first of several unpaid days off.
Many workers are canceling summer vacations of their own. Across the government, cutbacks are everywhere. The Blue Angels did not fly at the Naval Academy commencement, Head Start programs are turning away children, and there are no summer jobs for college students to cut the grass at Antietam.
In a nod to the pain that federal employees are feeling, Mr. Obama announced in April that he would cut his salary by $20,000.
Despite that gesture of solidarity, the president's official and political trips still generate second-guessing. This summer he plans a diplomatic foray to Africa that will cost millions of dollars and involve hundreds of security, communications, military and technical personnel, just as it did when George W. Bush and Bill Clinton went. White House officials said they were not deterred by fear of criticism, although some said the president would probably avoid safari time.
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a group that opposes tax increases, said Mr. Obama brought such criticism on himself.
''The cost of every vacation and 'work trip' is now compared to things he cancels 'due to sequester,' '' he said. ''And he cannot complain as he started this 'blame-the-sequester, there-is-nothing-to-cut' narrative.''
White House officials react to such criticism with weariness. Mr. Obama arrived in office during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and has been criticized for taxpayer expenses almost from the start. Aides said the public understands that being president costs money and that Mr. Obama has official obligations and deserves time off. They dismiss complaints as predictable carping from a party whose leaders enjoy perks of their own, including Congressional trips overseas. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio spends time playing golf and traveling the fund-raising circuit.
''Many Republicans in Washington criticize the president because the sun comes up in the morning,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. ''So if that was our litmus test, we couldn't get out of bed in the morning.''
Officials said the White House had pared back because of the sequester. Staff travel, equipment purchases and hiring have been curtailed. Among those furloughed was the assistant White House chef. And in general, some political and personal expenses are reimbursed to the government according to formulas.
But officials said the vast bulk of Mr. Obama's expenses, including the $179,750-per-hour cost of Air Force One, are simply the price of the presidency and the communications and security required for a 24-hour-a-day commander in chief.
Other presidents have come under fire for vacation habits. Ronald Reagan retreated to his ranch at Santa Barbara, Calif., and Mr. Bush to his outside Crawford, Tex. Mr. Clinton had no home and, like Mr. Obama, favored rental estates on Martha's Vineyard.
''It's just a routine part of the Washington gotcha game,'' said Joe Hagin, who spent 14 years in the White House working for three Republican presidents, most recently as Mr. Bush's deputy chief of staff. ''Democrats played it against President Bush, and Republicans are returning the favor. It's been going on for a long time.''

HEADLINE: Global Economy Is Rebounding, O.E.C.D. Says

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The global economy is slowly regaining its strength, driven largely by the rebound of the United States and Japan, but record-high unemployment in Europe continues to drag on efforts to recover in that region, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday. 
The organization, based in Paris, predicted that gross domestic product in its 34 member countries, all of which have developed economies, would grow 1.2 percent this year, slightly below the 1.4 percent it forecast six months ago.
Unemployment, especially in Europe, remains a persistent problem contributing to the uneven pace of growth globally, the organization said. It warned European countries that failing to address the issue would undermine the progress made from the fiscal and structural adjustments that many countries have pushed through in recent years.
''Protracted weakness could evolve into stagnation with negative implications for the global economy,'' said Pier Carlo Padoan, the deputy secretary general of the O.E.C.D. ''Reform fatigue is mounting as visible results in growth and jobs fail to materialize.''
Nevertheless, he pointed to ''important progress in the euro zone,'' where the economic policy changes pushed through in the past three years have begun to take hold. But countries need to maintain those policies and find new ways to persuade the public of the need to see through the changes, the organization said.
Eckhard Wurzel, an economist within the organization who is responsible for Europe and the euro zone, predicted that a real turnaround in Europe could be seen by 2015. For that to happen, he said, the 17 countries using the common currency need to maintain their pace at overhauling the weaker economies, and European Union-level policies, including implementing a banking union, needed to be strengthened.
''We are on the edge of stabilizing the sovereign debt,'' Mr. Wurzel said.
Reflecting this, the organization forecast that the euro-area economy would shrink 0.6 percent this year before expanding 1.1 percent in 2014.
U.S. gross domestic product should rise 1.9 percent this year and 2.8 percent next year, while Japan's will increase 1.6 percent this year and 1.4 percent next year, the O.E.C.D. said. It predicted that the economy in China, a nonmember country for which it nevertheless provides figures, would grow 7.8 percent this year, lower than a previous estimate of 8.5 percent.
The biggest challenge facing the United States will be to begin unwinding its stimulus programs, the O.E.C.D. said. It warned that if the United States Federal Reserve were to withdraw from its bond-buying program too early, it could jeopardize the fragile recovery. On the other hand, waiting too long could result in a ''disorderly exit from the program,'' which could trigger excessive risk taking, it said.
''Exit from unconventional monetary policy, when needed, may be difficult to manage and less smooth than desirable, possibly leading to sharp rises in bond yields and serious negative consequences for growth,'' Mr. Padoan said.
The organization said the European Central Bank could do more to get credits flowing to the euro-area economy, and called on it to buy financial assets from credit-starved small and medium-sized companies, emphasizing the need for monetary policy to remain loose to assist recovery.

HEADLINE: Needing Pork, China Is to Buy A U.S. Supplier

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
8:49 p.m. | Updated
Demand for pork in China reflects its booming economy and rising middle class. But that rapidly growing appetite has strained its food production systems, leading to breakdowns and a number of food safety scandals.
Now China's biggest pork producer, seeking plentiful supplies and technical expertise, has agreed to buy Smithfield Foods, the 87-year-old Virginia-based meat giant with brands like Armour and Farmland, for $4.7 billion in cash.
If completed, the deal that was announced on Wednesday would be the biggest takeover of an American company by a Chinese concern. But it must first overcome skepticism in Washington -- and a potentially close examination process by United States regulators. Both Smithfield and its suitor, Shuanghui International, said that they will submit the deal for review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, a panel of government agencies tasked with clearing deals for national security.
Typically, the committee is concerned with acquisitions that involve technology or vital natural resources. The nation's food supply chain is not specifically mentioned in its mandate, but the panel's jurisdiction is considered broad. Among the deals it has reviewed and approved in recent months are the proposed takeover of Nexen Energy by a Chinese oil company and the proposed sale of control of Sprint Nextel to a Japanese telecommunications firm. 
The committee may consider whether Shuanghui has ties to organizations like the Chinese army, as well as whether Smithfield's customer rolls include sensitive information like the locations of secure military installations.
''There's a difference between a foreign company buying Boeing and one buying a hot dog stand,'' said Jonathan Gafni, president of Compass Point Analytics, who was involved with the foreign investment committee when he was a deputy national intelligence officer. ''But it depends on which corner the stand is on.''
Still, he expects the deal to pass muster.
Other hurdles lie in wait. A takeover by a Chinese company -- because of well-publicized food safety scandals in that country -- could prompt concerns among American consumers and consumer groups, who may worry that Shuanghui will ultimately export the pork it produces in China to the United States.
Smithfield and Shuanghui said that the deal was meant to do the opposite: increase exports of American products to China, already the nation's third-largest export market for pork. Meat consumption in China has exploded over the past decade because of a growing middle class and a shift in diet from rice and vegetables to more protein.
''This transaction will allow us to access Asia in a big way,'' C. Larry Pope, Smithfield's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. ''This is an export deal, and they are very interested in exporting products out of the U.S.''
Even so, many critics of Wednesday's deal fear that the Chinese company may eventually seek to sell meat to the United States.
''They're already trying to send their chicken products over here,'' said Stanley Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Local Unions, which represents federal inspectors. ''So I'm of the opinion this is going to get their foot in the door, letting them claim, We're an American-based company now, and so why would you try to block us?''
China is no stranger to complaints about food quality. In recent years, the Chinese government has announced a crackdown on food makers while it also deals with an outbreak of bird flu and images of thousands of dead pigs floating in the Huangpu River in Shanghai.
The advantage of acquiring Smithfield is that it would give Chinese consumers greater access to imported meat that meets stricter food safety standards.
And China is struggling to produce its own supply. The nation's production is considered inefficient and costly. Farms are smaller, and production and processing facilities are less sophisticated.
Although China, the world's biggest market for pork, has begun introducing bigger farms and processing facilities, the country is still dominated by family-style farms and logistical bottlenecks that raise the cost of producing pork and other meat products.
''They're not very efficient at producing it, which is why they're importing it from us,'' said David Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, a trade group based in Washington.
By comparison, the United States has ample grain and space for enormous hog farms. Last year, American producers exported about $866 million in pork products to China, 14 percent of all United States pork exports.
Some food experts said that Chinese ownership should not affect food safety at Smithfield. The company has had a good record on controlling pathogens, said Bill Marler, a Seattle-based lawyers who represents the victims of food-borne illnesses.
''They have had few recalls, and none that I know of that were ever linked to illnesses,'' he said.
On the other hand, Shuanghai, which also goes by the English name Shineway Group, has struggled with food quality issues.
Two years ago, China's biggest state-run television company, China Central Television, broadcast an investigation that found that Shuanghui was selling pork produced with clenbuterol, which is banned as a food additive in the United States, the European Union and China because of health risks.
That year, the country arrested scores of people for producing, selling and using clenbuterol, which is believed to produce leaner meat.
Shuanghui apologized and promised to improve its food safety program.
Founded nearly 20 years ago, the company was a state-run enterprise until a division of Goldman Sachs and CDH Investments, one of China's leading private equity firms, paid more than $100 million several years ago to buy out the government's interest.
Shuanghui now has a publicly listed company and other food divisions with assets of more than $5 billion.
Wednesday's deal fulfills a major ambition of the Chinese government, to encourage companies to venture abroad by acquiring assets, resources and technical expertise. In North America, Africa and Australia, Chinese companies, flush with cash, are buying up land and resources to help a country that is plagued by water shortages and short of arable land, a situation exacerbated by a long running property and infrastructure boom.
In the meat industry, few companies loom larger than Smithfield, an empire whose operations extend from raising pigs to processing them into ham and pork for an array of customers. Founded as a packing plant in the Virginia town that shares the company's name, it has since grown into a behemoth that reaped $13 billion in revenue last year.
Under the terms of the deal, Shuanghui will pay $34 a share for Smithfield, which is 31 percent above the company's closing share price on Tuesday.
Smithfield and Shuanghui have long had ties, and over the past four years the companies discussed ways to cement an alliance. Shuanghui has been especially keen to find ways to increase the amount of pork it could import from the United States.
Late last year, Mr. Pope, Smithfield's chief executive, said the two discussed buying stakes in each other. Around March, an adviser to Shuanghui called Smithfield and offered a different approach: an outright takeover of the American company.
''They said, 'Larry, let's make this thing happen. We think you're going to like it,' '' Mr. Pope said.
But Smithfield had received takeover proposals from two other foreign suitors before signing its deal with Shuanghui, according to people briefed on the matter.
Smithfield was advised by Barclays and the law firms Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and McGuireWoods. Shuanghui was advised by Morgan Stanley and the law firms Paul Hastings and Troutman Sanders.
Michael Moss and Mark Scott contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Sent Checks To Prisoners, Report Shows

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
Reining in welfare, unemployment benefits and state pension costs have become standard rallying cries for Republican politicians -- particularly those with an eye on the White House. But Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has often talked about his own cost-cutting credentials, was told on Wednesday that the state had been a bit too generous under his watch. 
Over a 22-month period, New Jersey paid nearly $24 million in unemployment, welfare, pension and other benefits to 20,000 people who did not qualify for them because they were in prison, according to a report from the state comptroller released on Wednesday.
In one case, a former state employee collected more than $37,000 in pension benefits while in prison for the sexual assault of a minor. In another, a man began receiving unemployment benefits three months after he was imprisoned for illegal gun possession -- despite a state law that requires people who receive benefits to be ''available for work.''
The report blames ''a lack of adequate internal controls'' at state agencies. In most cases, the agencies that administer the benefits did not check the list of beneficiaries against available databases of county or state prisoners. Instead, the division of pensions and benefits said it relied on tipsters and newspapers to determine whether people receiving benefits had been sentenced to prison.
''Suffice it to say that when thousands of inmates are collecting unemployment checks from behind bars, there is a serious gap in program oversight,'' said Comptroller A. Matthew Boxer.
Mr. Christie's office referred requests for comment to the New Jersey Department of Labor, which noted in a letter responding to the audit that the administration had begun ''an unprecedented antifraud campaign'' the first year the governor came into office. The department also noted that the period the audit examined, from July 2009 through April 2011, began a half-year before the Christie administration took over.
Nearly half of the payments -- $10.6 million -- were unemployment benefits paid out to about 7,600 people behind bars. More than $7 million was in Medicaid payments that went to managed care organizations, pharmacies, or hospitals and clinics on behalf of people who were not eligible -- and not available -- to receive the benefits. The Department of Human Services paid $4.2 million in food stamp benefits and $1.2 million in temporary cash benefits to people who were imprisoned. About $354,000 in pension benefits was paid out to people imprisoned for crimes including robbery, official misconduct and kidnapping.
Some of the people in prison -- those whose Medicaid benefits were paid out to managed care organizations, for instance -- may not have been aware they were defrauding the state. In other cases, the fraud seemed deliberate; in addition to the $24 million in benefits improperly paid out, the audit found that 13 state employees had used sick leave to cover their time in prison. (The report said this resulted in ''relatively immaterial amounts of improper payments.'')

HEADLINE: Roam the World and Keep the Cellphone on a Budget

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB

 BODY:
Getting ready for a summer vacation abroad? Then you have a lot to anticipate: fine food, great wine, historical museums -- and thousand-dollar cellphone bills.
Actually, overseas cellphone bills do not have to be huge anymore, as long as you do some planning.
After facing years of stinging criticism that they charged exorbitant fees to subscribers traveling to other countries, several major American mobile carriers have come up with overseas calling packages that cut costs to a small fraction of what they once were.
As a result, the additional cost of using a cellphone in many other countries may end up being a minor inconvenience, rather than motivation to take out a second mortgage.
Unfortunately, no one solution will work for everyone. Which approach you take depends on your current carrier, the countries you are visiting and your tolerance for changing calling habits while away from home. 
THE FIRST STEP You can keep your existing cellphone number and buy a data package, a voice roaming package or both from most American carriers.
Alternatively, if your phone is unlocked (meaning it will work on any other network) and you are going to a place that uses the GSM phone standard, which includes Europe and the United States (the AT&T and T-Mobile networks), you can buy a local SIM card. This gives you your own phone number based in the country you are visiting.
ROAMING PACKAGE VS. SIM CARD If you buy a reduced-rate roaming package from your carrier, you will still use the regular mobile number that your friends and relatives know. If they are calling from the United States, they will pay only for a local call in the United States, which for many cellphone and landline users means they actually do not pay anything extra, whether you are in Turkey or the Shetland Islands.
If you would rather buy a local SIM card, it may prove a challenge if you are going to a country in which the local mobile phone store employees are unlikely to speak English (although many cellphone stores have airport outlets with English-speaking employees).
SIM cards for various countries can also be bought from American suppliers, including Telestial, but expect to pay more for the card and its use than you would if you were to buy it in your destination country.
For example, one Telestial SIM card option charges users 84 cents for the first minute of outgoing voice calls, while outgoing texts cost 69 cents. Data costs 49 cents per megabyte from Britain (double the AT&T package price) and a whopping $15 per megabyte from Israel and Russia.
Still, depending on the country and your American mobile carrier's rates, buying a local SIM card may prove cheaper than the roaming rates you will pay your carrier.
Trying to find out the cost of a local SIM card and phone charges can be a challenge, though, even if you speak the language. I called two cellular carriers in Britain, Orange and Vodafone, to ask about rates. After waiting 10 minutes on hold at Vodafone, I was cut off in midsentence.
The man I spoke to in Orange customer service had no idea how much data I would use for particular applications. ''I cannot say,'' he said. ''It depends on how long it takes to open the e-mail and the quality of the connection.'' He advised that I ask about costs when I arrived in London.
One SIM card caveat: if you love the romantic idea of having your own Turkish or Swedish or Italian phone number and decide to go the SIM card route, make sure that your friends and family back in the States have an international calling plan of their own.
When my wife and I traveled to New Zealand, a family member in the United States spent $25 for a five-minute call to our local Auckland number because she had never signed up for reduced overseas calling with AT&T.
MY PHONE IS LOCKED Ask your carrier to unlock your phone. AT&T will unlock your phone when your contract is up. T-Mobile will do so after 40 days of service, or 18 months if you are under a two-year contract. Verizon, which uses the CDMA standard, sells 20 models of ''world phones'' that have SIM cards for use overseas; typically, those phones are unlocked out of the box.
If your carrier will not unlock your phone, you can do it yourself, with one exception: according to a ruling last year by the United States Copyright Office, phones bought after Jan. 26, 2013, may legally be unlocked only by your mobile company.
Unlocking costs vary depending on the carrier. Chronicunlocks.com, for example, charges $20 to unlock an AT&T iPhone, but $120 to unlock an iPhone tethered to the Orange network in France. Other unlocking companies include jmunlocks.com and easyunlock.ca.
Before choosing an unlocking company, read independent reviews of its services. Many companies promote unlocking services with spiffy Web sites but are, in fact, bogus.
WHO OFFERS WHAT? AT&T and Verizon offer the most economical voice and data international roaming packages. AT&T has three levels of data, priced by the month: 120 megabytes for $30, 300 megabytes for $60 and 800 megabytes for $120. Verizon has only one package, 100 megabytes for $25. Both companies will add an increment of the same size when you use up the first.
For voice, AT&T charges start at $30 for 30 minutes of calls. Text packages start at $10 for 50 texts.
With Verizon, a call costs at best 99 cents per minute from Britain to the United States, $1.99 per minute from Israel and $3.99 per minute from Russia. Overseas texts cost 50 cents to send and 5 cents to receive.
Sprint's overseas data packages begin at $40 for 40 megabytes of data. Voice calls range from $1.49 a minute from Britain, to $2.99 a minute from Israel and $4.99 a minute from Russia.
T-Mobile has no consumer data package, charging $15 per megabyte, 60 times AT&T's lowest-cost rate. For T-Mobile subscribers, a local SIM card is probably the best choice.
WHAT A PACKAGE GETS YOU AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon have calculators to help you figure out how much data you will probably need when traveling abroad.
Roughly speaking, Verizon claims that 110 megabytes of data is enough to allow you to send and receive 50 e-mails, read five Web sites and use your maps app for 15 minutes every day for a month. On a recent week in Canada, I used my AT&T iPhone by roaming on the local Rogers cellular network to check e-mails several times a day and to read a few Web sites. I used 24 megabytes of data, less than 25 percent of my minimum $30 monthly allotment.
KEEPING COSTS DOWN Use Wi-Fi whenever possible to check e-mail, so you do not use up data plan minutes. Wi-Fi is available in most hotels and many coffeehouses. Make calls in a Wi-Fi hot spot by using Skype, Apple's FaceTime or similar apps. And turn off the ''push'' data option on your smartphone so that your device is not continually checking for new e-mails.
With T-Mobile, you can make voice calls in a Wi-Fi area by using the company's Wi-Fi Calling feature. There is no roaming charge, but calls made back to the United States count against your monthly allotment. In addition, Wi-Fi Calling is available only on several Android smartphones, not on the iPhone.
THE FINE PRINT Data and voice packages are sold for a minimum of one month. But you usually need to cut off the package when you are back in the United States by calling customer service or going to your carrier's Web site. If you do not, you will be charged each month until you do.
If your vacation crosses two billing periods, your carrier will probably prorate the costs. And if you forget to get a data or voice package and you start racking up huge bills, don't panic. Call your carrier while abroad. Many will put you on a package plan retroactively, saving you hundreds if not thousands of dollars.

HEADLINE: In Raising Scores, 1 2 3 Is Easier Than A B C

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
TROY, N.Y. -- David Javsicas, a popular seventh-grade reading teacher known for urging students to act out dialogue in the books they read in class, sometimes feels wistful for the days when he taught math.
A quiz, he recalls, could quickly determine which concepts students had not yet learned. Then, ''you teach the kids how to do it, and within a week or two you can usually fix it,'' he said.
Helping students to puzzle through different narrative perspectives or subtext or character motivation, though, can be much more challenging. ''It could take months to see if what I'm teaching is effective,'' he said.
Educators, policy makers and business leaders often fret about the state of math education, particularly in comparison with other countries. But reading comprehension may be a larger stumbling block. 
Here at Troy Prep Middle School, a charter school near Albany that caters mostly to low-income students, teachers are finding it easier to help students hit academic targets in math than in reading, an experience repeated in schools across the country.
Students entering the fifth grade here are often several years behind in both subjects, but last year, 100 percent of seventh graders scored at a level of proficient or advanced on state standardized math tests. In reading, by contrast, just over half of the seventh graders met comparable standards.
The results are similar across the 31 other schools in the Uncommon Schools network, which enrolls low-income students in Boston, New York City, Rochester and Newark. After attending an Uncommon school for two years, said Brett Peiser, the network's chief executive, 86 percent of students score at a proficient or advanced level in math, while only about two thirds reach those levels in reading over the same period.
''Math is very close-ended,'' Mr. Peiser said. Reading difficulties, he said, tend to be more complicated to resolve.
''Is it a vocabulary issue? A background knowledge issue? A sentence length issue? How dense is the text?'' Mr. Peiser said, rattling off a string of potential reading roadblocks. ''It's a three-dimensional problem that you have to attack. And it just takes time.''
Uncommon's experience is not so uncommon. Other charter networks and school districts similarly wrestle to bring struggling readers up to speed while having more success in math.
In a Mathematica Policy Research study of schools run by KIPP, one of the country's best-known charter operators, researchers found that on average, students who had been enrolled in KIPP middle schools for three years had test scores that indicated they were about 11 months -- or the equivalent of more than a full grade level -- ahead of the national average in math. In reading, KIPP's advantage over the national average was smaller, about eight months.
Among large public urban districts, which typically have large concentrations of poor students, six raised eighth-grade math scores on the federal tests known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress from 2009 to 2011. Only one -- in Charlotte, N.C. -- was able to do so in reading.
Studies have repeatedly found that ''teachers have bigger impacts on math test scores than on English test scores,'' said Jonah Rockoff, an economist at Columbia Business School. He was a co-author of a study that showed that teachers who helped students raise standardized test scores had a lasting effect on those students' future incomes, as well as other lifelong outcomes.
Teachers and administrators who work with children from low-income families say one reason teachers struggle to help these students improve reading comprehension is that deficits start at such a young age: in the 1980s, the psychologists Betty Hart and Todd R. Risley found that by the time they are 4 years old, children from poor families have heard 32 million fewer words than children with professional parents.
By contrast, children learn math predominantly in school.
''Your mother or father doesn't come up and tuck you in at night and read you equations,'' said Geoffrey Borman, a professor at the Wisconsin Center for Education Research at the University of Wisconsin. ''But parents do read kids bedtime stories, and kids do engage in discussions around literacy, and kids are exposed to literacy in all walks of life outside of school.''
Reading also requires background knowledge of cultural, historical and social references. Math is a more universal language of equations and rules.
''Math is really culturally neutral in so many ways,'' said Scott Shirey, executive director of KIPP Delta Public Schools in Arkansas. ''For a child who's had a vast array of experiences around the world, the Pythagorean theorem is just as difficult or daunting as it would be to a child who has led a relatively insular life.''
Education experts also say reading development simply requires that students spend so much more time practicing.
And while reading has been the subject of fierce pedagogical battles, ''the ideological divisions are not as great on the math side as they are on the literacy side,'' said Linda Chen, deputy chief academic officer in the Boston Public Schools. In 2011, 29 percent of eighth graders eligible for free lunch in Boston scored at proficient or advanced levels on federal math exams, compared with just 17 percent in reading.
At Troy Prep, which is housed in a renovated warehouse, teachers work closely with students to help them overcome difficulties in both math and reading, breaking classes into small groups. But the relative challenges of teaching both subjects were evident on a recent morning.
During a fifth-grade reading class, students read aloud from ''Bridge to Terabithia,'' by Katherine Paterson. Naomi Frame, the teacher, guided the students in a close reading of a few paragraphs. But when she asked them to select which of two descriptions fit Terabithia, the magic kingdom created by the two main characters, the class stumbled to draw inferences from the text.
Later, in math class, the same students had less difficulty following Bridget McElduff as she taught a lesson on adding fractions with different denominators. At the beginning of the class, Ms. McElduff rapidly called out equations involving two fractions, and the students eagerly called back the answers.
Because the students were familiar with the basic principles --finding the least common multiple of the denominators, rewriting each number as an equivalent fraction, adding the numerators, finding the greatest common factor, then reducing the final answer -- they quickly caught on when she asked them to add three fractions.
New curriculum standards known as the Common Core that have been adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia could raise the bar in math. ''As math has become more about talking, arguing and writing, it's beginning to require these kinds of cultural resources that depend on something besides school,'' said Deborah L. Ball, dean of the school of education at the University of Michigan.
Teachers and administrators within the Uncommon network are confident that they will eventually crack the nut in reading. One solution: get the students earlier. Paul Powell, principal of Troy Prep, said the school, which added kindergarten two years ago and first grade last fall, would add second-, third- and fourth-grade classes over the next three years.
Over time, teachers hope to develop the same results in reading that they have produced in math. Already, students at high school campuses in the Uncommon network in Brooklyn and Newark post average scores on SAT reading tests that exceed some national averages.
''I don't think there is very much research out there to say that when you can take a student who is impoverished and dramatically behind, that you can fix it in three years,'' said Mr. Javsicas, the seventh-grade reading teacher, who also coordinates special education at Troy Prep. ''But I do think the signs seem fairly positive that if we can take kids from kindergarten and take them through 12th grade, I think we can get there.''

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times 

        
President Obamaplans to nominate James B. Comey, a former Justice Department aide to President George W. Bush, to become his next director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Michael S. Schmidt reports. He adds that the pick makes a strong statement about bipartisanship as the president faces criticism from Republicans, but it is also palatable for Democrats because Mr. Comey is known for putting the law above politics.
 

        
As Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. meets with the news media on Thursday to address concerns about how the Justice Department investigates leaks of classified information, he facesaccusations from Republicans that he misled them about whether his agency has considered prosecuting journalists as spies for publishing government secrets, Charlie Savage and Jonathan Weisman write.

        
Mark Landler names politics as one of the factors influencing the disparate impact that the furor over last September's deadly attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, has had on the State Department careers of Susan E. Rice and Victoria Nuland.

        
The president's trips - official, political and personal - are drawing heightened scrutiny as automatic budget cuts force federal workers to take furloughs and shutter popular programs like White House tours, Michael D. Shear and Peter Baker write.

        
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, the Tea Party Republican firebrand, has decided not to seek re-election next year, cutting off her tough bid for a fifth term as she faces a widening federal inquiry of her campaign spending, Jeremy W. Peters reports.
 Happenings in Washington 

        
Economic reports expected Thursday include first-quarter gross domestic product and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 a.m. by the pending home sales index for April and weekly mortgage rates.

        
Mr. Obama will return from Chicago in the afternoon.

        
At noon, Quinnipiac University's polling institute will release the results of a national survey involving the Benghazi attacks, the Internal Revenue Service and The Associated Press.

        
The winner of the National Spelling Bee will be crowned Thursday night as the competition comes to a c-l-o-s-e. The finals begin at 8 p.m.

HEADLINE: Petraeus Back in Spotlight, via Wall St.

BYLINE: MARK MAZZETTI


HIGHLIGHT: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has hired David H. Petraeus, a retired general and former director of the C.I.A., to serve as chairman of the newly created KKR Global Institute. 

 BODY:
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts announced on Thursday that it had hired David H. Petraeus, a retired four-star general and former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, as chairman of the new KKR Global Institute. 
The institute will focus on economic forecasts, communications, public policy and emerging markets. It will also help the firm's portfolio companies expand globally, K.K.R. said. Mr. Petraeus's team at the institute will include Ken Mehlman, the onetime chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Henry McVey, K.K.R.'s global head of macro and asset allocation.
 "With the addition of General Petraeus, we are building on the work we have done to understand the investment implications of public policy, macroeconomic, regulatory and technology trends globally," Henry R. Kravis, co-chief and co-founder of the firm, said in a statement.
The announcement comes as Mr. Petraeus gradually re-enters the public sphere after an extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, led to his resignation as C.I.A. director.
It was an ignominious end to a government career that had a meteoric rise after the attacks of Sept. 11.
When he retired from the Army to lead the C.I.A. in 2011, Mr. Petraeus was possibly the most famous general of his generation. He commanded the American-led coalition during the troop "surge" in Iraq and later was the top military commander in Afghanistan. He also ran United States Central Command, responsible for all military operations in the Middle East, and helped lead the effort to draft the military's field manual on counterinsurgency.
During a speech in California in April, Mr. Petraeus gave his first public remarks about the affair that forced him to leave government, expressing regret for the pain that the revelation had caused his friends, family and supporters.
Since then, the contours of Mr. Petraeus's plan for post-C.I.A. life have emerged. In April, the City University of New York said he would serve as a visiting professor for one year.
More recently, however, Mr. Petraeus drew criticism for his role in developing the notorious "talking points" in the days after the September 2012 attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.
When the Obama administration this month disclosed a trove of e-mails sent among officials discussing the talking points, some expressed the belief that Mr. Petraeus had appeared overly concerned with protecting the C.I.A.'s image at the expense of the State Department.

HEADLINE: The Swiss Offer Some Economic Advice to Europe

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Switzerland, outside the European Union and the euro zone, has fared better than most during the Continent&#8217;s economic downturn. That has given it an opportunity to offer advice to its neighbors on the balance between austerity and growth. 

 BODY:
LONDON - With much of Europe still struggling with how to dig itself out of a chronic economic crisis, at least the Swiss appear to be doing something right.
The release of figures on Thursday that showed Switzerland achieved better-than-forecast growth in the first quarter of the year coincided with an annual survey that promoted the small Alpine state into second place in a world index of competitiveness, right behind the recovering economy of the United States.
Switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation European Union and it has its own currency, pegged to the euro. It has escaped the worst of a crisis that has affected countries of the euro zone and charted its own course during the Continent's economic downturn. 
Despite some public resistance to budget cuts, it has also avoided the sort of harsh austerity measures that the European Union authorities have imposed on member states fighting to reduce their mountains of debt.
The positive economic news from Switzerland comes at a time when Brussels has signaled it might be rethinking those measures in the absence of a recovery in European growth.
So, what is the secret of Switzerland's success and can it be exported to the rest of the Continent?
According to the Institute for Management Development, the Lausanne-based business school that published Thursday's index, Switzerland has followed the golden rules of competitiveness.
The institute's Stéphane Garelli spelled them out: "Manufacture, diversify, export, invest in infrastructure, educate, support small and medium enterprises, enforce fiscal discipline, and above all maintain social cohesion."
In comments clearly directed at Switzerland's European Union neighbors, Professor Garelli said, "Structural reforms are unavoidable, but growth remains a prerequisite for competitiveness."
"The harshness of austerity measures too often antagonizes the population," he told Agence France-Presse. "In the end, countries need to preserve social cohesion to deliver prosperity."
It is a message Europe has been hearing in recent months from other quarters, including the Obama administration, which in April dispatched Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, to urge the Europeans to ease off on austerity and do more to stimulate growth.
The growth versus austerity debate has generated tensions within the European Union, with leaders such as François Hollande of France pressing for stimulus measures in the face of resistance from fiscal hardliners such as Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel.
There was an indication this week that Brussels is prepared to ease off the fiscal brake in the case of the economies worst hit by the economic crisis.
José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, the Union's executive body, announced on Wednesday that a number of countries, including Spain and France, would be given extra time to meet their budget deficit targets. 
"The fact that more than 120 million people are at risk of poverty or social exclusion is a real worry," said Mr. Barroso, outlining a retreat from tough austerity policies that have been widely blamed for leaving 27 million Europeans out of work.
As my colleagues Andrew Higgins and James Kanter report from Brussels, he nevertheless cautioned against the temptations of debt-fueled economic stimulus, stressing that Europe instead needed to dismantle rigid labor regulations and remove other "structural" obstacles to growth.
"The policy recommendations announced Wednesday in Brussels don't suggest any U-turn in policy but they do confirm a slow but steady shift away from swiftly limiting deficit spending," Andrew and James write.
Mr. Barroso's recent emphasis on structural reforms amounted to an appeal for Europe to emulate the competitive striving of the virtuous Swiss.
Some economies have further to go than others. Thursday's I.M.D. index showed Sweden, Germany and non-E.U. Norway among the global top 10. But Britain was lagging in 18th place and France in 28th.
Europe had lost its competitive edge and accounted for more than half the losers since the index was established in 1997, the I.M.D. said, adding, "the UK and France in particular are losing their dominant position and competitive clout."

HEADLINE: Tension Over Bank Cases

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Obama administration&#8217;s decisions to fine two big British banks draws criticism. | Warren E. Buffett dives back into the acquisition pool. | Dish Network to raise its tender offer for Clearwire. | James Gorman, music promoter. 

 BODY:
The Obama administration's decisions to fine two big British banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, over money laundering instead of pursuing criminal charges drew strong rebuke.
Internal government documents show both tension among authorities about how to pursue the cases and suggest that at least the Treasury Department was sensitive to pressure to let big interconnected banks survive instead of face criminal charges, Ben Protess writes in DealBook.
When authorities were being blamed for letting HSBC off the hook, Treasury officials assured top aides to Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, that monetary penalties were coming as "quickly as possible."
Ultimately, Treasury assessed a record $875 million fine against HSBC. But some critics wanted more, noting that Treasury's own internal documents cite the bank's "egregious violations" of money laundering laws as "qualitatively worse" than other banks. 
"I would like to see Treasury support zealous prosecution, and instead I see them managing their image," said Bart Naylor, a policy advocate at Public Citizen, a nonprofit group critical of the government for not taking a harder line with HSBC.
BUFFETT BUYS INTO ENERGY | Warren E. Buffett dived back into the acquisition pool on Wednesday with a big bet on energy. MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, agreed to buy Nevada's largest electric utility, NV Energy, for about $5.6 billion.
MidAmerican is paying $23.75 a share for NV Energy, 23 percent above the company's closing price on Wednesday. The deal will also include the assumption of about $4.5 billion in debt.
The purchase of NV Energy, a utility with about 1.3 million electric and natural gas customers in Nevada, is the largest-ever acquisition made by MidAmerican, which Mr. Buffett bought in 2000, Peter Lattman writes on DealBook. In a statement, Mr. Buffett suggested that the purchase was in part a play on the economic recovery in Nevada, one of the states hit hardest by the housing crisis.
MidAmerican's acquisition is Mr. Buffett's second big deal this year. In February, Berkshire teamed up with a Brazilian investment group on a $23.6 billion takeover of the ketchup maker H.J. Heinz. 
DISH RAISES BID FOR CLEARWIRE | What is Dish Network's chairman, Charles W. Ergen, up to? That question took on new significance on Wednesday evening, as Dish announced a plan to raise its tender offer for shares in Clearwire to $4.40 a share in cash. The bid trumps the most recent takeover offer by the company's majority owner, Sprint Nextel, of $3.40 a share, less than two days before shareholders are set to vote on the latter offer.
In a letter to Clearwire's board, Dish reiterated the superiority of its offer for the company and stressed its desire to harness the wireless network operator's spectrum to its own holdings.
Dish is seizing upon continued investor dissatisfaction with Sprint's revised bid, which came after shareholders roundly criticized previous proposals as insufficient. Sprint - with the backing of its Japanese bidder, SoftBank - increased its offer to head off defeat.
Many outside Dish are wondering whether the revised Clearwire bid means that Mr. Ergen has shifted his focus away from his $25.5 billion bid for Sprint itself, or is simply seeking to make life difficult for his acquisition target and SoftBank.
ON THE AGENDA | First-quarter G.D.P. figures are released at 8:30 a.m.
JAMES GORMAN, MUSIC AGENT | On Wall Street, it is not uncommon for children to follow their parents into finance. But Caroline Gorman, the daughter of Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James P. Gorman, appears headed down a much different path.

HEADLINE: What's Wrong With the Breadwinner Moms Study

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: Lumping mothers who make more money than their spouses in with single mothers who are breadwinners through necessity as much as choice makes public opinion research on working mothers less useful. 

 BODY:
In 40 percent of all households as of 2011, according to a new releasefrom Pew Social Trends, the mother was either the sole or primary source of family income - the breadwinner. That's up from 11 percent in 1960. A total of 5.1 million of those breadwinners (37 percent) are married mothers who have a higher income than their husbands, and 8.6 million (63 percent) are single mothers. Is there a social consensus to be found by lumping together those disparate groups? 
Only if you equate single parents' work and career choices (presumably necessary for all but the independently wealthy) with the perpetual middle- and upper-middle-class opt-in/opt-out "should mothers work" debate. Pew does: 
A new Pew Research Center survey finds that the public remains of two minds about the gains mothers have made in the workplace - most recognize the clear economic benefits to families, but many voice concerns about the toll that having a working mother may take on children or even marriage. About three-quarters of adults (74 percent) say the increasing number of women working for pay has made it harder for parents to raise children, and half say that it has made marriages harder to succeed. At the same time, two-thirds say it has made it easier for families to live comfortably.
While the vast majority of Americans (79 percent) reject the idea that women should return to their traditional roles, the new Pew Research survey finds that the public still sees mothers and fathers in a different light when it comes to evaluating the best work-family balance for children. About half (51 percent) of survey respondents say that children are better off if a mother is home and doesn't hold a job, while just 8 percent say the same about a father.
I'd be interested to see a survey of the nearly half (49 percent) of never-married single mothers with a high school education or less and a median family income of $17,400 in 2011 (the lowest among all families with children) asking about the "gains" they have made in the workforce. Certainly more jobs are open to women than in 1960, and more single mothers hold some of those jobs, but to be a single parent is to be, of necessity, the breadwinner. To equate the forces that push the low-income single mother in and out of the workforce with the survey-imposed suggestion that children could be "better off" with their mothers at home - assuming, presumably, that food and shelter are still available to those children - requires a somewhat bewildering conjugation of two distinct trends. 
The baffling insistence that we lump working mothers into a single category upon which survey respondents are expected to opine renders the resulting numbers of little more than academic interest. To their credit, some 13 percent of people responding to the question of whether young children are better off with their mothers at home or just as well off if their mothers work apparently volunteered the caveat that it depends on the circumstances. Might it depend on whether there is a father picking up the caregiver role, or whether a mother's leaving work would leave the family wholly dependent on entitlement programs? 
Americans may remain ambivalent about working mothers when who that mother is, and what her alternative to working might be, is left to our "Leave It to Beaver"-fueled imaginations, but national and state policy choices make it clear that we're not at all ambivalent about what low-income single mothers should do after the birth of a child. For the single mother for whom unpaid family leave would mean 12 weeks without making the rent, it's back to work as soon as possible unless her employer policy (or her state) goes beyond the federal mandate. For those breadwinners, opting out is not an option.
That's consistent with our particularly American "every man for himself" system of raising children. We like to proffer the socially acceptable-sounding belief that adults should wait until they are financially able to support children to have them, and yet we persist in maintaining a system that makes it extraordinarily difficult for many people to reach that state, particularly those born into the kind of poverty that makes complete economic independence difficult to achieve and precarious to maintain. Meanwhile, we often punish the children born to such feckless adults with the kind of inadequate schooling and catch-as-catch-can support systems that leave them struggling to imagine an alternative to what the singer Kacey Musgraves has so aptly dubbed the "broken merry-go-round."
Survey respondents may claim to believe that young children are "better off" if a mother stays home, but all the available external evidence suggest that we are eager to qualify that. All breadwinner mothers - all working parents - would benefit from ending our societal assumption that children have a parent available at home, but to have a single conversation about whether "women working for pay makes it harder for parents to raise children" assumes choices that many women don't have. What do Americans really think about the breadwinner mother? The best answer is the one outside the survey box: it depends.

HEADLINE: Ann Romney's Two Cents

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: She said there was a &#8220;breach of trust&#8221; between government and the people. 

 BODY:
Ann Romney, best known for standing by her husband in his unsuccessful bid for the presidency, decided to unburden herself this morning on the sad state of politics. She said there is a "breach of trust" between government and the people, which is of course a very bad thing. 
Was she talking about the failure of Congress to pass a budget for 2014 (in no small part because Republicans in the Senate are refusing to even talk about it); or its failure to pass simple and sensible gun regulation measures after the most recent gun-fueled horror, in Newtown, Conn.; or a leaky tax system that allows corporations to stash hundreds of billions in tax havens overseas; or Washington's failure to provide meaningful help to struggling homeowners and to effectively regulate the financial system that almost wrecked the economy in 2008?
Nope. In an interview on "This Morning" this morning, Mrs. Romney was focused on three "scandals." She said: "If we look at the three scandals that are going on right now, and in particular, I saw the polling numbers with how people are upset with the IRS scandal. We have to have trust in our government. We have to believe that they're doing right for us. When we feel like they're breaking our trust, it's deeply troubling."

She's right that it was pretty scandalous that some I.R.S. employees in Cincinnati clumsily and improperly targeted conservative political groups. But she conveniently forgot to mention that there is no evidence of a White House conspiracy to use the I.R.S. against its political enemies. She also forgot to mention the original, more important and ongoing breach of trust, which is that political organizations masquerading as "social welfare groups" lie about their activities to get tax exemptions and have the right to hide their donor lists from the public.
The second scandal she presumably had in mind was the ginned-up controversy over the post-Benghazi talking points, one of the ultimate non-scandals and not worth another rehashing.
The third must be the administration's use of its subpoena powers to secretly obtain phone records of journalists, ferret out their past sources and scare off future ones.
That actually is scandalous, but it's hard to see where Mrs. Romney suddenly found her dedication to the people's right to know. After all, this is the same person who said during the campaign that voters did not need to know how much money her husband made, how he made it and how much he paid in taxes.

HEADLINE: Reducing the Corporate Tax Rate Could Stabilize Banks

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: If Congress reduces the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, as many have suggested, it could help reduce systemic risk in the banking industry. 

 BODY:
Republicans and Democrats have both expressed a desire to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to something in the neighborhood of 25 percent, which would be more in line with our major trading partners. The recent attention to the legal loopholes employed by Apple, Google, Starbucks and other multinational corporations to reduce their taxes could threaten the prospects of reducing the corporate rate. 
While lowering the corporate rate remains good public policy, the optics have changed. It feels a bit like putting up a yield sign because cars keep running the stop sign. 
But the importance of the corporate tax rate goes beyond offshore tax games. A draft paper by Thomas Hemmelgarn and Daniel Teichmann highlights the relationship between corporate tax rates and bank stability. Our tax code, like that of many countries, has a bias for debt over equity: interest payments to bondholders are deductible to the corporation, but dividend payments to shareholders are not. 
Corporations thus have an incentive to raise capital by selling bonds rather than equity. Debt payments reduce the amount of corporate tax that a company has to pay, leaving more left over for the shareholders. 
Economists refer to this effect as the "debt tax shield." Because the value of the tax shield is a function of the corporate tax rate, the value of the tax shield goes up as corporate tax rates go up. 
The bias for debt over equity is especially troubling in the context of banks. Banks are distinctive because a bank failure, unlike an ordinary corporate bankruptcy, can cause other financial institutions to fail, creating social costs that go far beyond the banks' shareholders, bondholders and employees. The less equity a bank has, the less stable it is, as it has less of a cushion to absorb losses. 
Of course, bank executives also have nontax incentives to prefer debt to equity, as debt magnifies the upside for executives if the bank does well (and other parties, including the public, bear much of the downside risk if a bank fails). 
In the paper, the authors look at statutory tax rate changes over a 12-year period in 87 countries to see how those rate changes affected banks' capital structure. They find that a 10 percentage point increase (or decrease) in tax rates is associated with a 0.98 percentage point increase (or decrease) in the amount of debt in the capital structure. The authors control for a number of variables that would tend to affect capital structure, like bank size, regulatory requirements, overall economic environment, availability of deposit insurance, and so on. The authors also find that dividend payouts increase after a rate change, further reducing the equity on the balance sheet. Their findings are consistent with prior research, although the magnitude of the effect is a bit smaller.
But we should not scoff at the magnitude of the result. The implication is that reducing the United States corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent would lead to an average increase in bank equity of about 1 percentage point - to about 12 percent equity, from 11 percent. 
One caveat is that the effect might be smaller for our largest and most systemically important banks, which tend to have other gimmicks available to reduce taxes. But considering the questionable track record of requiring responsible equity cushions through the multilateral Basel accords, reducing the corporate tax rate is a self-help technique Congress should consider, particularly if the revenue can be partly made up by reducing other corporate tax expenses.
If a corporate tax rate change is indeed on the horizon, analysts should watch banks' balance sheets carefully. The paper confirms findings from previous research suggesting that banks will accelerate the recognition of tax losses before the rate change by increasing loan loss reserves before the change, effectively shifting corporate income forward to the lower-taxed period. 
The aggressive gamesmanship by multinational corporations like Apple is disappointing, but it is not enough to simply say that we should close loopholes and keep the corporate rate high. The goal of bank stability should inform our decision-making about the design of the corporate tax, including the rate structure. 
 For further reading, see Thomas Hemmelgarn & Daniel Teichmann, Tax Reforms and the Capital Structure of Banks (draft). On the social costs of excessive bank leverage, see Anat R. Admati et.al, Fallacies Irrelevant Facts, and Myths in the Discussion of Capital Regulation: Why Bank Equity Is Not Expensive (2011).

HEADLINE: Generation X Hit Hardest By Recession

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Members of Generation X have some catching up to do to prepare for retirement. 

 BODY:
Members of Generation X, now in their late 30s to late 40s, were especially hard-hit by the recent recession, and are at risk for downward mobility in their retirement years, a new reportfinds. 
Generation Xers, the group of Americans following the Baby Boomers, lost nearly half of their overall net worth between 2007 and 2010, according to a report from the Pew Charitable Trusts.
Generation Xers lost an average of about $33,000, reducing their "already low" relative levels of wealth, the report found.
While Gen-Xers saw greater increases in wealth from home equity during the housing boom, they have lower overall rates of home ownership compared to earlier generations, which mutes the impact on the wealth of their group over all, the report found. 
The report defined Generation X as those born between 1966 and 1975, so they now range in age from 38 to 47.
By comparison, both early and late baby boomers also were hurt by the recession, but to a lesser extent, losing 28 percent and 25 percent of their median net worth, respectively.
Gen-Xers also have higher levels of debt than other age groups, the report found.
The upshot is that based on the analysis, Gen-Xers will only have enough at retirement to replace about half of their pre-retirement income, if they retire at age 65. Financial planners typically suggest that retirees should be able to replace at least 70 percent of their annual income, through savings and accumulated wealth.
Early baby boomers - those born between 1946 and 1955, who are currently 58 to 67 years old - appear on track to replace between 70 to 80 percent of their income, in contrast to the age groups that follow them.
Late boomers, born between 1956 and 1965, are also less well-prepared for retirement than earlier generations, the report found.
The report is based on data from 1989 through 2010 collected by the Federal Reserve Board and the University of Michigan.
"As policymakers focus on Americans' retirement security, particular consideration should be paid to how younger generations of workers can make up for these losses and prepare for the future," said Erin Currier, director of Pew's Economic Mobility Project, in a prepared statement.

HEADLINE: Succession Carousel at General Electric

BYLINE: AGNES T. CRANE


HIGHLIGHT: The potential exit of GE Capital&#8217;s chief shifts the spotlight onto succession for his boss, Jeffrey Immelt. 

 BODY:
The potential exit of GE Capital's chief shifts the spotlight onto his boss, Jeffrey Immelt. Michael Neal, who has led General Electric's erstwhile high-flying lending unit for eight years, may be soon handing the helm to someone else, according to The Wall Street Journal. His departure raises the question of who will eventually succeed the conglomerate's top dog. 
Mr. Neal's retirement would not be out of the ordinary by G.E. standards. At 60, he's at a typical age when many of its executives decide to call it quits. And while Mr. Immelt has been in the corner office for nearly 12 years, eight years is a good run for a chief executive. It's about the average for a chief executive in the United States, according to a 2012 Conference Board study.
Moreover, Mr. Neal has cleaned up most of the mess he had a hand in creating. Under his early stewardship, GE Capital invested heavily in commercial real estate with borrowed money, much of it short term. When the financial crisis erupted in 2008, the lending unit nearly sank the parent. Since then, Mr. Neal has shrunk GE Capital's balance sheet by about one-fifth and kicked its dependency on short-term corporate debt. Mr. Immelt plans to shrink it further and has even considered spinning off parts of it.
Mr. Immelt, too, has found some post-crisis redemption by nursing G.E. back to health and reorienting the company back to its industrial roots. And he's overseen the stock's quadrupling since the dark days of 2009 - though at $23.70 a share it's still roughly half what it fetched before the crisis.
That recovery might make it easier for Mr. Immelt to step away. At 57, he's under no imminent age constraints; his predecessor Jack Welch, didn't retire until 65. But succession planning is as much about the person waiting in the wings as it is the boss. John Rice, for example, who heads the company's operations in growth markets like China and India, is already 56 years old.
Mr. Neal may have never been in the running for the top spot. But his retirement is likely to kick off speculation about when Mr. Immelt might follow him out the door.

HEADLINE: Bank-Friendly Financial Reform

BYLINE: TERESA TRITCH


HIGHLIGHT: The treasury secretary sometimes seems more interested in shielding the administration from criticism than in pushing for strong rules. 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has defended financial reform recently, but on closer inspection, his defenses are oddly ambiguous.
Earlier this month, shortly before the House Financial Services committee voted on several bills to gut the derivatives' reforms in the Dodd-Frank law, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew sent a letter opposing the measures to the committee's chairman, Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas.
There was zero chance that the letter would change any Republican minds. It didn't even change many Democratic minds, as the bills passed the committee with bipartisan support. As such, the letter was widely understood as a way for the Obama administration to communicate its displeasure with congressional Democrats who might be inclined to support the bills when they are considered by the full House or in the Senate.

Also this month, in an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Lew told the panel that he had pushed back against a group of international financial officials who had been unusually vocal in calling for American regulators to water down proposals to regulate derivatives. The foreign officials, including Michel Barnier, a prominent Commissioner of the European Union, have been incensed by proposals to impose new American derivatives rules on the foreign affiliates of American banks and on foreign banks operating in the United States. 
Without robust cross-border application, the new rules will be useless. But then again, when derivatives bets went catastrophically wrong in the financial crisis, it was the Federal Reserve and the American taxpayer that did the heavy bailing of global banks, so why should Mr. Barnier and company feel any urgency to rein in reckless trades that are profitable while they last?
But I digress. At the banking hearing, Mr. Lew said he told the Barnier group "quite directly" that a letter they had sent to him protesting the international derivatives' proposals was "not a helpful way to promote conversations" with independent regulators.
That's not exactly, "back off, dude." And while it's good to see Mr. Lew, who does not have strong financial reform credentials, speak up, the question is, to what end? Is Mr. Lew pushing for strong rules? Or is he saying just enough to shield the administration from charges that it has generally stood by while the banks diluted reform and, in the process, protected their size, their profits and their too-big-to-fail subsidies?
Mr. Lew's letter to Mr. Hensarling was hardly a full throated defense of financial reform. He stated that until regulators have been given a chance to write and implement rules, it is "premature" to attempt to repeal or amend Dodd-Frank. He wrote: "We should allow the regulators to complete their ongoing rulemakings, and then determine what changes, if any, might be necessary in certain areas to improve the effectiveness of these reforms." If I am a Wall Street banker or lobbyist, or a politician who might be interested in doing their bidding, what that says to me is there will be a time and a place to scotch the rules, just not now, when circumventing the process could be seen to reflect the administration's lack of political will to rein in the banks.
Also at the banking hearing, Mr. Lew said that the regulatory agencies charged with writing the cross-border rules - the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission - were "making real progress" on the issue. That is only half right. The C.F.T.C. has been making progress with proposals that are about as tough as possible given relentless push-back from Wall Street and international officials, but the S.E.C. has proposed unacceptably weak rules that are basically in line with what banks and European officials have been demanding. It is understandable that Mr. Lew would not directly insert himself into an inter-agency rift, but, again, it is not far-fetched to interpret his comment as a de facto endorsement of the S.E.C.'s approach, and ultimately of bank-friendly reform.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Turns to 'Boot Camps' to Bring New Workers Up to Speed

BYLINE: LYNNLEY BROWNING


HIGHLIGHT: For fees that can exceed $1,000 a day per student, Training the Street, Wall Street Prep and other companies teach basic skills like spreadsheet building and database extraction. 

 BODY:
Newly minted university graduates who have landed coveted jobs on Wall Street may have impressive résumés and sought-after references. But often, nuts-and-bolts skills like spreadsheet building and database extraction are not part of university curriculums.
When millions of dollars can be won or lost on one calculation, firms are finding it essential that their new hires can tell the difference between a pivot table and a header row.
Enter specialized boot camps where - for fees that sometimes exceed $1,000 a day - would-be masters of the universe can perfect Excel modeling techniques and financial analysis. Each year, tens of thousands of students at the nation's top business schools, and scores of new hires at financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Blackstone Group, now take courses run by companies like Training the Street and Wall Street Prep.
Graduates say the classes give them a new appreciation for the heart of financial analysis. An eight-hour crash course on leveraged buyouts from Training the Street was so intensive that it "kind of makes you want to slit your wrists," said Michael Rojas, who graduated from Columbia Business School this month. 
But over all, Mr. Rojas said, the training was thorough. "This is the stuff you really need to know, and that you don't learn in business school," he said. "They have a template model, and they walk you through page by page."
The growing ranks in boot camps underscore a little-noticed trend by Wall Street banks and other financial firms to outsource technical training. Such knowledge is crucial to carrying out the daily tasks of many disciplines on Wall Street - whether it is the merger deal-making, bond trading or sell-side analysis.
"I just want someone who can really use Excel and PowerPoint," said one senior loan syndication banker at a European bank, describing his recent interviews of newly minted M.B.A.'s in New York.
Nineteen of the country's top 20 business schools now use Training the Street to teach an estimated 20,000 business majors every year in how to interpret financial statements, value corporations and run spreadsheet analyses.
"A lot of investment banks are casting a wider net, so they're spending more time emphasizing getting people up to speed fast," said Matan Feldman, who founded Wall Street Prep in 2003 after working as an analyst and associate at JPMorgan Chase. Because of the camps, "you don't have as many clueless liberal arts majors anymore," Mr. Feldman said.
Even the banks themselves send legions of their young hires for training. Credit Suisse, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America and others have hired Training the Street to school summer interns on credit analysis and mergers and acquisitions.
Such fundamentals also are valuable outside of Wall Street in businesses such as brand management and to technology companies in Silicon Valley that do financial modeling, said Missy Bailey, senior associate director of M.B.A. career services at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California.
The training does not come cheap. Business schools pay Training the Street as much as $1,300 a student for a course. Wall Street Prep, also used by most top business schools and more than 150 banks and financial firms, charges corporate clients as much as $1,499 per student for a three-day course.
Darin Oduyoye, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said that the bank uses both companies for things like basic training for new associates and helping analysts prepare for licensing exams. "We also obviously augment these training and development opportunities with our own in-house programs," Mr. Oduyoye said.
In June, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil, and banks involved in the energy business, will send about 15 new or recent hires to a three-day course in New York run by Wall Street Prep on valuing oil and gas companies.
These programs are also courting ever-younger students, and their parents' wallets. In June, Training the Street will start a four-day Undergraduate Wall Street Boot Camp in New York and will charge students $3,000 (not including accommodations) to learn the basics of financial modeling, valuation and analysis. Wall Street Prep, widely viewed as more intensive on analytics, sells CD-ROMs for $39, for a basic Excel course, and as much as $499 for a "premium package" detailing financial modeling.
With the sluggish economy and a hiring downturn on Wall Street, where the number of securities and commodities jobs had declined by 30 percent to just under 170,000 since the peak in 2000, students say the courses, which include interview preparation, are a practical necessity.
Even the boot camp industry is acquiring a brass-knuckled intensity, as the camps expand to business schools in London, Singapore and Dubai; to undergraduate finance clubs; and to liberal arts majors at Colby College and Smith College, among others.
Much of the curriculum is developed by people who once worked in the Wall Street trenches. Wall Street Prep employs nine instructors, all former junior investment bankers.
Scott Rostan, who founded Training the Street in 1999 after working as an analyst at Merrill Lynch's investment bank, has a small army of former Wall Streeters as instructors. "If all of your competition is taking an outside boot camp and you're not, you're going to be behind the curve," Mr. Rostan said.
Surry Wood, now in his last year of business school at the University of North Carolina, spoke of an internship at Barclays Bank in New York last summer and building an enterprise valuation model for a company. His Bloomberg terminal valued the company at $5.7 billion, but Mr. Wood, using a Training the Street technique, came up with $5.5 billion, he said.
When the managing director asked Mr. Wood to walk him through the calculations, "I just broke it down for him," Mr. Wood said. "That was a very good moment for me. By the end of the summer he was kind of pounding the table for me." Mr. Wood starts full time at Barclays as an investment banking associate in July.
As boot camp training becomes more common, a saturation effect could occur. If everyone is taking classes like Excel Best Practices and Restructuring Modeling, doing so may not make one candidate stand out in job interviews.
But Wesley Hansen said such a course was vital when he switched to a career in finance. He was a camera operator on reality shows like "The Bachelor" before graduating last year from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, where he took Training the Street courses.
"I had no clue how to use Excel, so it helped me get a job, no doubt," said Mr. Hansen, who is now an equity analyst in California with the brokerage firm BMA Securities.

HEADLINE: What Is Reform Conservatism?

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: An agenda for an almost-movement. 

 BODY:
As I noted earlier this week, there's been a lot of liberal discussion of conservative reformers recently, ranging from the Washington Monthly's attempt at a taxonomy of the tendency to Mike Konczal's recent piece expressing doubts (echoed by my colleague Paul Krugman) about whether the reforming tendency within conservatism adds up to anything significant at all. Reading through the responses to Konczal's post from "reformish" types, I'm in the rare position of disagreeing ever-so-slightly with my friend and co-author Reihan Salam, who writes:
One challenge for [Konczal] is that he is describing an idiosyncratic and diverse group of thinkers, and it's not at all clear that the loose collection of conservative reformers he has in mind has coalesced into anything like a cohesive movement. That is, if the question is whether or not there really is a "conservative reform" movement in policy, the answer would have to be no under a stringent definition of a movement. It might be more apt to refer to a reformist tendency, which doesn't so much represent a dramatic departure from U.S. conservatism as it's been practiced in recent decades but rather a shift of emphasis. 
I agree with the last part: As Salam says, "conservative reform is conservative," which is part of why it (understandably) strikes many liberals as disappointing, counterproductive or woefully insufficient. But I think there's a little more intellectual cohesion among would-be reformers than he suggests - maybe not enough to qualify as a movement, but getting there at least.
How much cohesion you see, of course, depends on the definition you employ. If a "reform conservative" just means somebody who thinks that the Republican Party should offer different arguments on domestic policy than it did in 2012, then it's hard to find anyone on the right of center who isn't a reformer. (Sheldon Adelson qualifies; so does Allen West; so does ... you get the idea.) But what people who use the term mostly have in mind, I think, are those of us who think that the American right's biggest problem, both politically and practically, lies in economic policy, where the Reagan-era catechism is insufficient to meet contemporary challenges, and where the Republican Party is currently offering a set of policies and slogans that simply aren't responsive to the anxieties of Americans who aren't already securely in the upper class.
Now this reformist camp, too, is a broad circle: It includes veterans of Bush-era "compassionate conservatism" like Pete Wehner and Michael Gerson, combative moderates like David Frum and Josh Barro, moderate moderates like my colleague David Brooks, free-market populists like the Washington Examiner's Tim Carney, "crunchy con" localists like The American Conservative's Rod Dreher, pragmatic libertarians like The Daily Beast's Megan McArdle and her husband, Reason's Peter Suderman, and many others.
But within that circle (and close to its center, I'd say, though I'm biased) there's a tighter circle still, consisting of writers like Salam, National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru, the American Enterprise Institute's Jim Pethokoukis, National Affairs editor Yuval Levin, and others. And here I think you can see not just a tendency or an impulse, but at least the outline of a reasonably coherent reform agenda. It's rooted in two major premises, which I would summarize as follows:
1) The core economic challenge facing the American experiment is not income inequality per se, but rather stratification and stagnation - weak mobility from the bottom of the income ladder and wage stagnation for the middle class. These challenges are bound up in a growing social crisis - a retreat from marriage, a weakening of religious and communal ties, a decline in workforce participation - that cannot be solved in Washington D.C. But economic and social policy can make a difference nonetheless, making family life more affordable, upward mobility more likely, and employment easier to find.
2) The existing welfare-state institutions we've inherited from the New Deal and the Great Society, however, often make these tasks harder rather than easier: Their exploding costs crowd out every other form of spending, require middle class tax increases and threaten to drag on economic growth; their tangled web of subsidies and credits and tax breaks often benefit the already-affluent and create perverse incentives for the poor, and the distortions created by the way they pay for health care, in particular, contribute mightily to the rising cost of health insurance and thus the stagnation of middle class incomes. So we don't face a choice between streamlining the welfare state and making it more supportive of work and family; we should be doing both at once.
Proceeding from these premises, the basic "reform conservative" agenda looks something like this:
a. A tax reform that caps deductions and lowers rates, but also reduces the burden on working parents and the lower middle class, whether through an expanded child tax credit or some other means of reducing payroll tax liability. (Other measures that might improve the prospects of low-skilled men, ranging from a larger earned income tax credit to criminal justice reforms that reduce the incarceration rate, should also be part of the conversation.)
b. A repeal or revision of Obamacare that aims to ease us toward a system of near-universal catastrophic health insurance, and includes some kind of flat tax credit or voucher explicitly designed for that purpose.
c. A Medicare reform along the lines of the Wyden-Ryan premium support proposal, and a Social Security reform focused on means testing and extending work lives rather than a renewed push for private accounts.
d. An immigration reform that tilts much more toward Canadian-style recruitment of high-skilled workers, and that doesn't necessarily seek to accelerate the pace of low-skilled immigration. (Any amnesty should follow the implementation of E-Verify rather than the other way around, guest worker programs should not be expanded, etc.)
e. A "market monetarist" monetary policy as an alternative both to further fiscal stimulus and to the tight money/fiscal austerity combination advanced by many Republicans today.
f. An attack not only on explicit subsidies for powerful incumbents (farm subsidies, etc.) but also other protections and implicit guarantees, in arenas ranging from copyright law to the problem of "Too Big To Fail."
To bring things to a finer point, if reform conservatives were suddenly put in charge of the Congressional G.O.P.'s legislative agenda, the party would immediately advance Robert Stein's plan for family-friendly tax reform and champion some version of James Capretta's proposed replacement for Obamacare. It would continue to push hard for Paul Ryan's entitlement reforms, while setting more realistic targets for discretionary spending than his budget blueprints have done to date. It would try to revise the immigration reform bill along the lines suggested by Levin here, and failing that would probably push a more modest increase in high-skilled immigration, paired with more enforcement mechanisms, as an alternative to the comprehensive approach. It would become notably more sympathetic to the Brown-Vitter banking overhaul and to Derek Khanna-style proposals for copyright reform. And it would stop attacking Ben Bernanke for his supposed dovishness and recognize that if anything monetary policy has probably been too tight.
You'll notice, in what I've included and what I've left out above, that there are also things that a G.O.P. reformed along these lines wouldn't do. It wouldn't embrace (or re-embrace) a cap-and-trade bill, or any sweeping regulatory response to climate change. (The influence of Jim Manzi is strong here.) It wouldn't endorse further tax increases - or not unless something like the Wyden-Ryan Medicare plan was actually on the table. It would remain skeptical of many of the major features of Obamanomics - the design of the stimulus bill, the individual mandate, forays into industrial policy. It would be reality-based regarding the likely outcome of the gay marriage debate and non-Akinist on abortion, but it wouldn't try to jettison social conservatives or sideline their concerns; instead, it would mostly work to broaden the pro-family message into the realm of economic policy. And it wouldn't make immigration reform central to the party's "rebranding" effort.
Again, you can be a reforming conservative and disagree with some, most, or all of these ideas and choices and emphases. But I think that they constitute a common ground that a number of would-be reformers share almost completely, and that draws from multiple "reformish" tendencies - libertarian, moderate, compassionate conservative, etc. - within the broader right.
Is this a policy synthesis that would make the G.O.P. more effective at winning national elections? I think so, but that's certainly debatable. Is it an agenda that the party is likely to actually embrace anytime soon? That's much more doubtful: On a few fronts, it's already there or on its way, but the crucial idea that conservatism ought to focus directly on the economic interests of downscale Americans has not exactly caught fire within the G.O.P., and the party's relationship to reform-minded policy wonks remains ... well, distant is a kind way of putting it.
But obviously I think it does have at least one quality that makes it worth supporting even if the effort is ultimately in vain: Both its diagnosis and prescriptions are correct.

HEADLINE: Santander Sells 50% Stake in Asset-Management Arm to Investment Firms

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Banco Santander said on Thursday that it had sold a 50 percent stake in its asset-management arm to two investment firms, Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic, as the bank continues to raise money to bolster its balance sheet. 

 BODY:
Banco Santander said on Thursday that it had sold a 50 percent stake in its asset-management arm to two investment firms, Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic, as the bank continues to raise money to bolster its balance sheet. 
At the same time, the infusion of cash into the asset manager is meant to help it expand and compete, especially in regions like Latin America.
Under the terms of the agreement, Santander will reorganize the unit's 11 subsidiaries into a new holding company, with the private equity firms claiming half. The business was valued at about 2 billion euros, or nearly $2.7 billion. 
Santander will receive a net cash payment of about 700 million euros, helping add to the bank's coffers as it continues to struggle with economic difficulties at home. The Spanish bank has been divesting assets for several months, including its Mexican arm.
"This partnership puts Santander Asset Management at the forefront of the industry's consolidation process," Javier Marín, Banco Santander's chief executive, said in a statement. "It will help Banco Santander strengthen its relationship with our banking clients with a more competitive offering to address their investment needs."
The deal came about in part because of a longstanding familiarity between Santander and Warburg Pincus, which are already joint owners of an auto finance business in the United States. The two had been looking for additional ways to team up before hitting upon a deal involving the asset-management business, a person briefed on the matter said. General Atlantic was brought on as a respected firm with experience investing in financial businesses.
The new venture, Santander Asset Management, currently manages about 152 billion euros worth of assets.
The two private equity firms intend to help the asset manager become more independent from its parent. But the unit is also expected to take advantage of Santander's presence in markets like Mexico, Chile and Brazil, where the asset-management business has largely been restricted to firms tied to banks.
Santander Asset Management could eventually be in line for an initial public offering to help its owners cash out. It could also serve as a roll-up vehicle to buy smaller rivals, though the person briefed on the matter said that was a secondary objective.
"We are pleased to once again partner with Banco Santander and work closely with Juan and the rest of the S.A.M.'s talented management team to accelerate the company's growth plans in Latin America, Europe and beyond," Daniel Zilberman, a managing director of Warburg Pincus, said in a statement.
Jonathan Korngold, the head of General Atlantic's financial services group, added in a statement: "We are excited to help S.A.M. further extend its leadership position globally and to enable the company to pursue the exciting set of new growth opportunities that will be available to it as an independent entity."

HEADLINE: The Imperfect Immigrants

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: They were ordinary only in the way of all people who left behind extraordinary circumstances, and often their secrets did not travel with them. 

 BODY:
VISNJA GORA, Slovenia - Exactly 100 years ago a man of 22 left this village on the eve of a great war to build a life in the United States. To Ignac Vrhovec, the tired old ground of his homeland was tangled in his ancestors' encumbrances and spent by time. After he left, much of that land would change hands, from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to Italy, to Nazi Germany.
He traveled from an eyeblink of a town created in 1478 to a sprawling nation not even half as old. According to family lore, he arrived in the United States with only one thing of value: an heirloom earring, to be sold if he was desperate for return money. Over time, he made a home in Minnesota, started a family, became a success - the story of the American Becoming, the only difference being that Vrhovec was Slovenian, a distinct minority in the stew of our country's immigrants. 
A few days ago I went to Vrhovec's village with his granddaughter, Lisa Verhovek, and her husband, Sam (the surname's spelling was modified at entry, and Sam, a former Times reporter, took his wife's name). The clouds hung low over the forested hills and when they fell away, we caught views of fresh snow in the Julian Alps to the north. Our hosts brought out dried meat and apricots, and we drank a stiff mountain blueberry wine while trying to talk through the years.

In many ways, it was the perfect reverse journey: an American trying to understand more about herself by touching the stone of her grandfather's home and connecting to lost kin. But it was not without surprises - in what had become of the side of the family that stayed behind, and the elliptical tales of the young man who walked away from this village in 1913. Vrhovec, like so many American patriarchs, left a past full of permanent mystery. 
When I had tried to retrace the steps of my own Irish Catholic forebears, I found that the first American on my father's side had most likely slipped over a porous border from Canada into Michigan, without official sanction. He was the imperfect immigrant. Today, you would call him illegal, and somebody with a talk radio show would be railing about how his "type" were ruining the country.
At a moment when the United States is poised to do something historic about immigration, it's worth unearthing the exact details of how Egans, Vrhovecs and millions of others came to America. Very few were on the Mayflower's manifest. Very few were perfect citizens. They were ordinary only in the way of all people who left behind extraordinary circumstances. Their secrets, in many cases, did not travel with them. 
Today, many Republicans, cornered into rethinking their absolutist position by the nation's inevitable demographics, still oppose a pathway to citizenship for undocumented people who have been in the United States for years. They want storybook immigrants, nothing less - a blanket fantasy. Of course, there are those who waited in line, and had the money or connections or smarts to come into the country clean. But so many others, who are productive, proud Americans in every way but their citizenship papers, started their new lives in the shadows.
Slovenia, the land of Lisa Verhovek's ancestors, has been independent only since 1991. A country of two million people virtually unknown to most Americans, it has seen many sons and daughters walk away. An immigrant might have been a third child in line, facing a future without a stake in the family farm - the curse of old-world primogeniture. Or he may have been nothing more than an able-bodied male, which meant conscription to an army that couldn't care less for your stories, your songs, your foods. In every immigrant's saga, the reason to leave is stronger than the ties that bind.
And throughout Europe today, where so many young people face a bleak, even hopeless future, with unemployment for those under age 30 at Depression-era levels, you see and hear the same stirrings that motivated the 22-year-old from Visnja Gora. As well, history is never far below the surface in the former Yugoslavia: what your father or grandfather did in World War II, or before, when alliances were tangled, is reason for old grudges to fester. 
For the American woman returned to her family home, it is enough simply to walk on ground that has long been trampled by Vrhovec feet, to embrace a cousin with the same cheekbones, to visit a graveyard holding generations. The home where Lisa's grandfather was born, a farm on a steep hill, is empty now and mildewed, with weeds growing from the roof. It seemed sad and cast-away on a misty Saturday afternoon. 
But the surrounding countryside is green, overgrown from a springtime of heavy rain, and gardens are planted, full of promise. There are enough children in the village to fill a school - the best sign of tomorrow. 
We sat with a young Slovenian friend, Ziga Pirnat, with the translator skills of a scholar and the sensitive ear of a diplomat, and heard fragments upon fragments of stories. It was hard to know the truth. But even with the gaping holes in the forgotten early life of Ignac Vrhovec, you could not help being proud of his old country, for giving us a founding American family, and of his new country, for taking him in.

 BODY:
AMES, Iowa -- THE installation of the 408-foot spire atop One World Trade Center earlier this month made it, according to some reports, the tallest building in the United States.
So far, nothing is official: the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the international organization of skyscraper engineers, designers and builders that certifies a building's height, will weigh in only when One World Trade Center is completed. At an expected, historically symbolic 1,776 feet, the New York tower seems to have a solid claim.
But Chicagoans who live in the shadow of the 1,451-foot tall Willis Tower, which has held the title of nation's tallest for some 40 years, should cry foul -- because deciding just how tall a building is turns out to be more complicated than it might seem. 
The council has gotten into the habit of wading in to such disputes ever since Malaysia's Petronas Towers claimed to dethrone Chicago's Willis Tower -- then called the Sears Tower -- in 1998. Like that dispute, the coming argument over One World Trade Center centers on the distinction between ''architectural'' and ''functional'' height, and it raises questions about just what skyscrapers are intended to really do.
The council has three categories for measuring the heights of tall buildings: height to ''architectural top,'' ''highest occupied floor'' and ''height to tip.'' This may seem like splitting hairs, but the differences can be considerable.
The meanings of ''height to tip'' and ''highest occupied floor'' are self-evident. But ''architectural top,'' the category the council uses to officially crown the tallest building, is less clear; it includes ''spires,'' but not ''antennas, signage, flag poles or other functional-technical equipment.'' This wording deliberately makes the short, pointy tops of the Petronas Towers count, but leaves out the much taller antennas that crown the Willis Tower.
Adding pointy bits to skyscraper roofs to break a record -- or even to hit a certain number of feet -- has a long history in New York City. In the 1920s architects raised the height of 40 Wall Street while it was under construction to beat the Chrysler Building, also under construction, by two feet.
When 40 Wall Street opened in April 1930, it was hailed as the tallest building in the world, but its reign lasted only weeks. In late May, a secretly constructed spire raised the Chrysler's tip to 1,046 feet, making it not only the world's tallest building, but also the first fully occupied structure to break the 1,000-foot mark.
A similar sleight-of-hand underlies One World Trade Center's claims. Despite the height of its ''spire,'' it does not include any broadcast or cellular equipment -- only lighting. It therefore avoids having the ''functional technical equipment'' that disqualifies Willis Tower's protrusions from being ''architectural.'' Were its ''spire'' to be reclassified as an ''antenna,'' according to the council's criteria, One World Trade Center's official architectural height would be a far less evocative 1,368 feet -- 83 feet shorter than Willis Tower.
Do such distinctions matter? Who cares which building is tallest? There is obviously some economic benefit to claiming that potential tenants will reside in the country's ''tallest building,'' and the symbolic nature of building tall on this particular site is self-evident.
Skyscrapers in Dubai and East Asia have long eclipsed those of American cities, however, and the most innovative design work in skyscrapers now focuses on climatic performance and energy efficiency, not on pure height. Towers with breathing skins, intelligently controlled daylight and energy-recovery systems address more pressing contemporary concerns.
Seen in this light, the intentionally function-free spire atop One World Trade represents a large investment in cost and materials that adds to the project's carbon footprint while offering little aside from the potential record in return. On purpose or not, the council's criteria have set up a perverse incentive for such spires to rise atop supertall structures while intentionally forgoing potentially beneficial functions.
The council could address this by changing its criteria from ''height to architectural top'' to ''height to structural top,'' the tallest integral piece of structure required for the building to be fully occupied. This would disqualify the bolt-on spire that was flown to the structural top of One World Trade earlier this month, just as it would have disqualified the Chrysler's functionally suspect (if admittedly elegant) spire. Such a change would, of course, leave Willis Tower as the country's tallest.
As a Chicago partisan, I'm rooting for Willis Tower to come out ahead in the coming decision. And for me, like most Chicagoans, it will always be Sears.

HEADLINE: Colleges Show Uneven Effort To Enroll Poor

BYLINE: By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA

 BODY:
Opponents of race-based affirmative action in college admissions urge that colleges use a different tool to encourage diversity: giving a leg up to poor students. But many educators see real limits to how eager colleges are to enroll more poor students, no matter how qualified -- and the reason is money.
''It's expensive,'' said Donald E. Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University. ''You have to go out and identify them, recruit them and get them to apply, and then it's really expensive once they enroll because they need more financial aid.''
The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in a closely watched case over admissions at the University of Texas at Austin, and the court could outlaw any consideration of race. 
Opponents of affirmative action welcome that prospect, arguing that race-conscious admissions favor minority applicants who are not disadvantaged, and people on both sides of the issue contend that colleges should do more to achieve socioeconomic diversity. Polls show that while most Americans oppose racial or ethnic preferences in college admissions, they also think colleges should give extra help to the poor.
Some states have already banned affirmative action, including California, Florida, Michigan and Washington, and in each of them, the selective public universities stepped up their efforts to recruit disadvantaged students, hoping to enroll more black, Hispanic and American Indian students in the process.
Opponents of race-conscious admissions say they expect similar moves across the country if the Supreme Court strikes down affirmative action.
But even in those race-blind states, highly selective public colleges vary widely in how hard they work to identify high-achieving, disadvantaged students and prepare them for college, how heavily they weight disadvantage in admissions, and how generous they are with financial aid. Not surprisingly, they also differ greatly in how many disadvantaged students they enroll -- and the same is true among elite public and private schools that still do consider race and ethnicity.
Socioeconomic disadvantage can mean many things, like attending a low-performing high school or having parents who do not speak English, but one consistent measure available for nearly every American college is the number of students receiving Pell Grants, the main form of federal aid for low- and moderate-income students. In 2010-11, 35 percent of undergraduates going to four-year state colleges or private nonprofit colleges received Pell Grants. In general, the more selective the school, the lower that number was.
But in the University of California system, one of the most competitive in the country, more than 40 percent of students were Pell recipients, including 34 percent at Berkeley and 36 percent at Los Angeles, the two most selective campuses in the system. At the University of Michigan, which is similar in selectivity and prestige, and also operates under a ban on considering race, only 16 percent of undergraduates received Pell Grants.
So what accounts for the difference in the number of poor students enrolled in two similar elite public university systems, California's and Michigan's? Experts say that the level of state budget support, the intensity of recruitment efforts and other admissions decisions like legacy admissions are all factors.
One crucial factor is outreach programs, starting as early as the middle school years. Studies show that large numbers of talented low-income students are ill-prepared for college, or never apply to selective schools, as though those colleges and the students were invisible to each other.
California voters were the first to outlaw affirmative action, passing Proposition 209 in 1996, and in the following years, the University of California system expanded an already-robust set of programs to identify and nurture promising low-income students.
''Nobody else has had anything comparable,'' except, at times, the University of Washington, said Deirdre Bowen, a law professor at the University of Seattle who has written extensively on affirmative action. ''But it matters much more at highly selective places like Michigan and Virginia.''
Nancy Cantor, chancellor of Syracuse University and a former provost at Michigan, declined to comment on any particular school's efforts, but said, ''There's no question that some institutions have done a better job than others of building relationships in disadvantaged communities, which takes years.''
In a written statement, the University of Michigan cited a long list of programs it operates in disadvantaged communities, but they are relatively small compared with California's, and many of them have existed only since Michigan voters banned affirmative action in 2006.
''The university is strongly committed to diversity of all kinds in the student body, including socioeconomic diversity,'' the university said, adding that the proportion of students at Michigan from low-income families has grown significantly in the last decade. ''We are moving in the right direction.''
Another measure that increases the enrollment of disadvantaged students is accepting all top students from every high school, ensuring that low-income communities are well-represented. In areas with highly segregated schools, that has increased black and Latino enrollment in state universities. Texas, Florida and California have used this approach to varying degrees since they were barred from considering race; Michigan, like the elite schools that still have race-conscious admissions, has not.
Legacy admission -- the practice of giving preference to the children of alumni or donors -- overwhelmingly favors well-off, white students, leaving less room for poor students. Some schools, after dropping affirmative action for ethnic minorities, also dropped legacy preferences, notably Texas A&M and the University of Georgia. But Michigan's legacy program continues.
Public universities, in particular, caution that differences in low-income enrollment can reflect factors they have little control over, like the relatively low poverty rate in Virginia, or the level of help they get from state governments. States vary widely in direct support for their universities, and in the financial aid they provide; by both measures, Michigan ranks near the bottom, a fact that the university cited in discussing its low number of disadvantaged students.
State universities affect their socioeconomic mix by deciding how often to admit out-of-state students, who pay much higher tuition, and are less likely to be poor -- important considerations in an era of dwindling state support. Elite schools with national reputations could easily fill most of their seats from beyond their borders, but some choose to rely more heavily on that pool than others. Among U.S.-resident undergraduates, out-of-staters account for 11 percent at Berkeley, and 34 percent at Michigan.
An elite university's openness to accepting transfers from other schools also influences its economic diversity, because many transfer applicants start at community colleges or other, less prestigious public colleges, where low-income students are more prevalent.
In California and Texas, public universities are unusually welcoming to transfer students who have earned good grades elsewhere; they do not ask to see high school grades, or SAT or ACT scores, and they actively recruit from community colleges. Transfers accounted for 35 percent of newly enrolled students at Berkeley last year, 25 percent at Texas-Austin, and well under 20 percent at Michigan.
At most top public schools, more than 90 percent of the financial aid supplied directly by the universities is based on financial need; at Michigan, it is 66 percent. But the university said that much of the aid that is, in name, ''merit-based,'' goes to students who also receive ''need-based'' aid, making up for the paucity of aid from their home state.
''We have a longstanding pledge to meet the full demonstrated financial need of Michigan resident undergraduates,'' the university said, noting that it is ''the only public institution in the state and one of just a handful in the country to do so.''

Museums
Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (through Aug. 11) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg) 
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'John Singer Sargent Watercolors' (through July 28) Sargent fans and watercolor hobbyists will be in heaven with this exhibition's more than 90 watercolors from the first decade of the 20th century, all from the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and all representing picturesque scenes in Europe. Sargent pioneered the kind of loosely gestural yet clearly representational watercolor painting that today's popular culture adores. He has his detractors, though, who may profit from re-examining their prejudices in light of this beautiful show. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'A Different Kind of Order: The ICP Triennial' (through Sept. 8) The fourth, and best, edition of the International Center of Photography's triennial turns out to be that extremely rare thing in New York City these days, an exhibition of contemporary art for adults. The up-to-the-minute emphasis is on the continuing and enveloping impact of digital technology on photography. The results, as seen here, couldn't be more varied and gripping in content. This is a show that's in touch with the big, live, real world out there beyond Frieze New York. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints' (through June 9) Contemporary provocateurs could learn a thing or two from the venerable artists in ''Edo Pop,'' who mixed high and low culture in arch and urbane ways. In this show's 100 or so ukiyo-e, or color woodblock prints (drawn from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts), valiant samurai turn out to be Kabuki actors in costume; refined landscapes depict well-trodden tourist sites; and images of classical beauties accompanied by poems are more often than not portraits of courtesans. These spirited images bring to life Edo Japan's ''floating world,'' a sort of Renaissance of popular entertainment. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'Jack Goldstein x 10,000' (through Sept. 29) The first American museum retrospective of this brilliant but elusive artist, organized by the Orange County Museum of Art, is both a celebration and a cautionary tale. It revels in Goldstein's posthumous influence as it reveals the tragic disconnect of his life and his art, the desire to disappear complicated by an intense careerist drive. This exhibition offers (in addition to paintings, sculptures and Goldstein's signature films of the late 1970s) a rare look at the early, performance-based films: works like ''Milk,'' in which the persistent banging of a fist on a table finally topples a glass, or ''Spotlight,'' in which a beam chases the artist around an empty room. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'As it were ... So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue With Barbara Bloom' (through Aug. 4) Ms. Bloom, invited to organize a show from elements of the museum's collection, has turned to the Talmud for inspiration. Weaving together real and fictional narratives, historical and literary sources, she creates new and often ambiguous contexts for ceremonial and decorative objects like Torah pointers, Kiddush cups and spice containers. Somehow she manages to quote Nietzsche, Freud, Leonard Cohen, Joan Didion, the Bible and various Wikipedia entries, all without losing her own probing, skeptical voice. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'At War With the Obvious: Photographs by William Eggleston' (through July 28) In 36 transcendentally beautiful photographs shot in the Mississippi Delta region in the 1970s and early '80s, this pioneer of color photography captured those kinds of sacred moments when something you ordinarily would pass by without a thought -- a children's swing set overgrown by weeds, an abandoned gas station, a basket of fake flowers hanging on someone's front door -- suddenly takes your breath away. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Cambodian Rattan: The Sculptures of Sopheap Pich' (through July 7) Born in Cambodia in 1971, Soheap Pich first came to international attention in 2009 with a series of openwork, basketlike rattan sculptures that looked as light as air, but carried serious ideas in images of half-built cities, viscera, flowers and bombs. His impressive Met show is embedded in the permanent Asian collection. It starts outside the Chinese painting galleries, continues in mezzanine space usually devoted to South Asian material, and concludes in the galleries of Southeast Asian art with a gorgeous suspended Buddha. (An exhibition of new work is on view through June 14 at Tyler Rollins Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, in Chelsea.) (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Punk: Chaos to Couture' (through Aug. 14) This entertaining exhibition proves that high fashion rarely looks quite as frivolous and cluelessly 1 percent-ish as when it upgrades aspects of the obstreperous punk sartorial mode, adding gold-plated safety pins, careful rips and holes, and a feigned DIY look that can involve materials like garbage bags or cellophane. Cleverness abounds. A few designers absorb and transform punk attributes, but most garments simplistically scream punk. Not for nothing do they call the show's organizing department the Costume Institute. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Roof Garden Commission: Imran Qureshi' (through Nov. 3) Visitors to the Met's rooftop will discover something shocking: the stone terrace is splattered with paint the color of dried blood so that it resembles the scene of some terrible crime. Looking closer at the areas of spillage, viewers will find they have been delicately altered. With deft white and red brush strokes, the Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi has worked into the raw paint a pattern suggestive of leafy shrubbery and flower petals, turning the whole into a politically fraught, allegorical mix symbolizing dualities of life and death and hope and despair. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Velázquez's Portrait of Duke Francesco I d'Este: A Masterpiece from the Galleria Estense, Modena' (through July 14) This single-painting exhibition highlights a portrait made at a delicate diplomatic moment during the Thirty Years' War; the painting is on loan to the Met in part because the museum that normally houses it, the Galleria Estense in Modena, is repairing damage from a 2012 earthquake in the region. It's a chance to see another commanding Velázquez at this already well-stocked museum, and to appreciate that this artist's politically savvy portraits are more than just tools of statesmanship. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Subliming Vessel: The Drawings of Matthew Barney' (through Sept. 2) With its Gospels and reliquaries, the Morgan Library is at the right place for the first survey of graphic work by the most medievalizing of American contemporary artists. Encased in thick, pale, plastic frames, Mr. Barney's drawings of the past two decades have the look of precious pages from sacred books displayed on iPads. His images, with their emphasis on redemption through fleshly mortification, suggest sources in heroic epics and penitential religion, filtered through Sade and extreme sports. A display of collage-like storyboards for his films confirms the occult glamour of the personal cosmology he has developed, which feels as artificial and addictive as a video game. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Claes Oldenburg: The Street and the Store' and 'Claes Oldenburg: Mouse Museum, Ray Gun Wing' (through Aug. 5) Pop Art is based on two things: ordinariness and eating. It's about daily consumption; the democratic appetite, ravenous for meat, sweets, life on the street, and getting more of everything, cheap. No artist cooked up a tastier version of the primal Pop recipe than Claes Oldenburg did in New York in the late 1950s and early '60s. The art he made in that brief, fecund time is the focus of a two-meals-for-the-price-of-one MoMA feast. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
New Museum: 'Adhocracy' (through July 7) The term ''adhocracy'' was coined by the futurologist Alvin Toffler, who predicted that innovative, ad hoc forms of organization would replace more bureaucratically entrenched structures in business and government. This crowded design exhibition presents a variety of self-empowering things that people can make and do for themselves like build their own furniture and bicycles; make new appliances from functional parts of old, broken ones; raise money for bigger projects by means of Kickstarter; and, more problematically, make their own functional handguns using 3-D printers. 231 Bowery, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Galleries: Uptown
&#x2605; Paul McCarthy: 'Life Cast' (through July 26) One of the outstanding shows of the artist's career is best viewed as a single piece. Three fanatically realistic life-size sculptures of naked humans are paired with two video installations that reveal the meticulous casting process behind their ecstatic, mysterious exactitude. The piece is a homage to -- but also perhaps penance for -- Marcel Duchamp's ''Étant Donnés'' and its obsessive focus on the female sex. Hauser & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 794-4970, hauserwirth.com. (Smith)
'Salvaging the Past: Georges Hoentschel and French Decorative Arts from The Metropolitan Museum of Art' (through Aug. 11) This sometimes arcane but highly effective assemblage of rare furnishings, artifacts and a smattering of art and printed matter resurrects a once-renowned French interior designer whose collections -- and displays -- of 18th-century French decorative material and Medieval art were purchased en bloc by J.P.Morgan and given to the Met. They formed the nuclei of the museum's holdings in these areas, helped shape its departmental structure and influenced the arrangement of its galleries in numerous ways. Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Rodney Graham (through June 15) In four giant photographic transparencies mounted on lightboxes, the versatile Vancouver artist Mr. Graham ponders a man's middle age with comical ennui. Each is a fictional self-portrait of the artist as a construction worker, a scientist, an aging punk and an old hippie in a kayak. They are funny and touching because of the disproportionate relationship between their grandiose scale and their goofy images, which resemble those of downbeat Father's Day greeting cards. 303 Gallery, 507 West 24th Street, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com. (Johnson)
Jeff Koons: 'New Paintings and Sculptures' (through June 29) Hastily assembled as a retort to Mr. Koons's ''Gazing Ball'' exhibition now at David Zwirner, this exhibition reveals the artist to be both highly productive and uneven. His Photo Realist paintings are uniformly lifeless. The best works are a magenta stainless steel balloon sculpture inspired by the Venus of Willendorf and an inflatable gorilla, rendered in a dark material that resembles plastic or bronze but is actually polished granite. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Smith)
Jeff Koons: 'Gazing Ball' (through June 29) In his latest series, the artist everyone loves to hate could be said to revisit his ''Banality'' series of the late 1980s. He appropriates blazing white plaster casts of well-known Greco-Roman sculptures -- the ''Farnese Hercules,'' ''Sleeping Satyr (Barberini Faun)'' and ''Belvedere Torso'' -- and accents each with a blue mirrored ball of the yard-ornament variety to add irony and visual pizazz. Fighting cliché with cliché, they are neither especially good or bad, just average Koons. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Richard Serra: 'Early Work' (through June 15) This terrific exhibition looks back on five formative years in the career of Mr. Serra, one of the world's most admired living sculptors. One room contains objects made of lead, rubber, wood and stone produced by basic actions like cutting, folding and tearing. A second gallery features works made by propping up 4-by-4-foot lead panels and a single slab of hot-rolled steel, 8 feet tall and 24 feet long, that juts from a corner into the room with grand implacability. David Zwirner, 537 West 20th Street, (212) 517-8677, davidzwirner.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Wolfgang Tillmans (through June 22) The nomadic German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans addresses globalization in a curiously offhand way. This is true even in his latest works, which assert themselves more strongly as art objects thanks to Mr. Tillmans's experiments with inkjet printing; they are lush and almost painterly in their rich concentrations of pigment. Only after connecting the dots of the installation -- which moves from downtown Los Angeles to Kilimanjaro, a Masai hut to a construction site in Shanghai, a car headlight to a close-up of mold spores -- do you sense transformation and upheaval. Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Sara VanDerBeek (through June 8) With two glamorous installations of photographs and minimalist sculptures, Ms. VanDerBeek contributes to the Postmodern endgame tradition of art reflecting on itself. In the biggest gallery four white columns reflected in mirror glass covering large, abstract, vaguely cosmic photographs call to mind the pillar of salt that Lot's wife turned into when, contrary to divine command, looked back to the corrupt city of Sodom.

Galleries: SoHo
&#x2605; 'Mel Bochner: Proposition and Process: A Theory of Sculpture (1968-1973)' (through June 29) This beautiful exhibition is a veritable time capsule. It shows the artist's pioneering Conceptual works in a setting redolent of the early artist-oriented, pre-retail era of SoHo -- which is when they were made. Defiantly modest, they parse Minimalist space, measuring it openly with non-Minimalist objects (small stones, walnuts, burned matches) often annotated with writing or drawing in chalk, repeatedly locating the place where language, counting and dimensional experience overlap, to the confusion and excitement of eye and mind.

Galleries: Other
Jane Alexander: 'Surveys (From the Cape of Good Hope)' (through July 29) The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is an occupied zone this spring, with a transient population of unearthly beings camped out in its chapels and aisles. Neither angels nor devils, though suggesting both, the figures in the sculptural tableaus and related photographs were all created by the South African artist Jane Alexander. And while haunted by her country's history of apartheid, the work has no single meaning, no sum-upable content. Instead, painstakingly calibrated ambiguity leaves this strange and wonderful show open to political speculation and spiritual interpretation. Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 316-7490, stjohndivine.org. (Cotter)
Aiko Hachisuka (through June 14) The five colorful works in this New York debut distinguish themselves from the increasingly crowded field of stuffed fabric sculptures with their deliberation, complexity and wonderful sleights of hand. From certain viewpoints, they suggest giant, colorfully glazed ceramic planters or tangled bodies but are actually individually stuffed garments carefully stitched together, with paint applied in random shardlike patterns. Soft, cuddly friendliness contrasts with astute, slightly mysterious art-making. Eleven Rivington, 11 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 982-1930, elevenrivington.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
Don Voisine (through June 9) With hard-won control, this veteran abstractionist puts his carefully layered, impeccably painted black geometric shapes through their paces, illuminating a rich fusion of Modernist sources with a meticulous exploration of the mechanics of painting in the process. His efforts enact telling dramas of space, texture, color, edge and light -- all of painting's grand illusions -- especially when given your undivided attention.

Out of Town
'Albrecht Dürer: Master Drawings, Watercolors, and Prints from the Albertina' (through June 9) Albrecht Dürer had it all: the eye of a Raphael, the brains of a Leonardo, the looks of a cleaned-up Kurt Cobain. Traditionally, the category of great artist implies great painter, and Dürer was that, though there's reason to think that he was at his most inventive, involved and expansive in his works on paper. Evidence for that argument is in this startlingly generous loan exhibition of more than 100 works on paper that includes some of his best known images. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Montclair Art Museum: 'The New Spirit: American Art in the Armory Show, 1913' (through June 16) The Armory Show opened 100 years ago in Manhattan, introducing to Americans the shocking works of van Gogh, Cézanne, Picasso, Matisse and Duchamp and other European avant-gardists along with less adventurous efforts by hundreds of homegrown artists. This much more modest, centennial show presents a selection of works by artists who were included, most of them Americans. Paintings by Edward Hopper, Marsden Hartley and John Sloan stand out, but a small, vibrant pastoral scene by Matisse shows how far behind the avant-garde curve the Americans lagged. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Montclair Art Museum: 'Oscar Bluemner's America: Picturing Paterson, New Jersey' (through June 16) This lovely, small show presents works dating from 1910 to 1917 when the American Modernist Bluemner was catching up on European avant-garde developments. He combined realism and Cubism in paintings of farm buildings in rural landscapes and the industrial architecture of Paterson, his hometown. Favoring glowing reds and blues and opaque blacks, he painted images that seem illuminated from within like modern stained-glass windows. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Great and Mighty Things: Outsider Art From the Jill and Sheldon Bonovitz Collection' (through June 9) One good turn generates another: the gift of a beloved, finely calibrated collection of American outsider art to a major encyclopedic museum is celebrated with an equally excellent exhibition of same. It displays around 200 paintings, sculptures, drawings and assemblages, made mostly from the 1930s to the '80s by 27 outsiders, both renowned and less prominent. All are seen here at or close to their best, pressing against the increasingly unjustifiable division between outsider and inside. 2600 Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-1000, americanart.si.edu. (Rosenberg)
Last Chance
&#x2605; Asia Society: 'The Artful Recluse: Painting, Poetry, and Politics in 17th-Century China' (closes on Sunday) With the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, China's intellectual elite, many of them artists who worked in the imperial government, were thrown into a tailspin. Confucian ethics demanded filial devotion to the old regime. But how were they to demonstrate it? One way was to remove themselves from active life and signal their resistance through art. How they did so is the subject of this compellingly fine-grained painting show. Some artists sacrificed their lives for principles; others used recluse status as a career move. The emotional weight, psychological depth, and intellectual complexity of the work of this time is what comes through here. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Cotter)
Giosetta Fioroni: 'L'Argento' (closes on Sunday) This first American survey of Giosetta Fioroni reveals that we still have much to learn about postwar Italian art, despite recent gallery exhibitions of Lucio Fontana, Piero Manzoni, Giorgio Griffa, Gianni Colombo and Luigi Ghirri and museum shows of Michelangelo Pistoletto and Alighiero Boetti. In the silvery, evanescent paintings, drawings and films of Ms. Fioroni, who was born in Rome in 1932, we see how American Pop's celebrities and commodities took on new meanings in a post-fascist society. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Rosenberg)
Paul McCarthy: 'Sculptures' (closes on Saturday) The artist's love of chocolaty, implicitly excremental brown and ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' find expression in dark-walnut sculptures that riff on scenes from that 1937 Disney classic, especially the final one in which the rescued Snow White and Prince Charming ride away on his horse. Repeated versions in different scales intersect in a giant pair of bookends without which the show would probably collapse, though there are numerous excellent drawings. Hauser & Wirth, 511 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 790-3900, hauserwirth.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum: 'Jay DeFeo: A Retrospective' (closes on Sunday) The American artist DeFeo, who died in 1989 at 60, is famous for a single work, a gargantuan painting -- nearly 12 feet tall -- called ''The Rose,'' which she labored on exhaustingly for eight years, even after it had been removed from her San Francisco studio with a forklift. In the absence of other evidence, many people tend to see the piece as the sum of her accomplishment, but to this view the Whitney's tenderly shaped and visually absorbing survey says: No. There's more, and different. ''The Rose'' may have been the pivotal point of her career -- DeFeo herself said as much -- but streams of inventive, if less spectacular, work flowed toward it and from it.

HEADLINE: Bridge Collapse Tears at a Town's Economy

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
BURLINGTON, Wash. -- Interstate 5, before last week's bridge collapse over the Skagit River on the south end of town, was the great pumping arterial source of economic life here. It brought Canadians, shopping for furniture or clothes. It brought day-tripping outlet mall lovers from Seattle. Through an embrace of retailing begun as a town plan in the 1980s, Burlington, population 8,500, grew to have the highest level of retail sales per capita of any city in the state.
The malls are still open, and the cars and trucks creeping through town day and night along the detour routes are testament that the highway corridor, though temporarily crippled, is still in use. But now the people are not coming to buy, and they are mostly not stopping. The message by the state to avoid the area to help ease congestion, and the news images of stalled traffic and twisted steel, have created a secondary collapse, business and political leaders here said, in a community that was poised this year to finally break through, back to prerecession health. 
''No one wants to get out of the queue,'' said the city administrator, Bryan Harrison, whose office is only a few blocks from the creeping line of detoured cars and trucks. ''It's looking worse than the recession.''
Store owners said that sales were down 50 percent to 80 percent. Work hours have been cut. Sales tax collections have plummeted even as city expenses for things like police overtime -- patrolling the detour routes and keeping curious ''looky-loos,'' as Mr. Harrison called them, away from the bridge site -- have soared.
That a 160-foot section of highway bridge could catastrophically fail without causing serious injuries -- cars into the river, passengers treated and released -- is still a source of head-shaking wonder. About 70,000 vehicles used the half-century-old steel truss bridge every day, and the evening rush had barely ebbed when, around 7 p.m. last Thursday, a truck's oversize load struck a girder, crumpling the structure in a chain of events still being investigated by federal authorities.
State transportation officials said this week that they are hoping to have a temporary span in place by mid-June, with a permanent fix later this year. But they also cautioned that the temporary bridge -- truckloads of components began arriving this week -- will be constrained in its use and capacity, with a reduced speed limit. Detours for oversize vehicles will remain in place for months.
''Speed is very important, but we also don't want to lose sight of the fact that if we just look at the target of trying to do it as fast as possible, that may not be the right solution, ultimately, for the transportation system or the local community,'' said Jay Drye, an assistant regional administrator at the Washington Department of Transportation, who is in charge of the bridge restoration.
Some small-store owners, especially, are fearful that they will not be able to last out another economic hit, coming so soon after the brutal downturn of the recession. Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, released $150,000 on Tuesday to support local economies. Burlington is also starting an advertising campaign this weekend to get out the message that businesses are open and getting here is not as hard as people might have heard.
''We were finally starting to actually be able to breathe,'' said Angela Walden, who bought a Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchise here in 2006 with a childhood friend and business partner, Monique Banta.
Sales hit bottom in 2009, Ms. Walden said, but 2013 had started very strong, with chocolate and candy sales up 26 percent from the previous year, especially from more Canadians -- about 80 percent of the customer base -- venturing back south, spending Canadian dollars at favorable exchange rates.
''Now it's like someone let the air out of the balloon,'' she said.
Beyond being a delivery system for consumers and their wallets, Interstate 5, linking British Columbia with California and passing through Seattle and Portland, Ore., along the way, is also one of the nation's busiest freight hauling routes, according to federal figures.
That casts the economic shadow of the bridge collapse much farther than the cash registers of Burlington and Mount Vernon. But the lines of north- and southbound trucks also in turn compound and aggravate the severity of the local impact.
''The biggest effect of the trucks is gridlock -- it slows everything up,'' said Pam Nelson, the owner of Foothills Toyota in Burlington. She said she had proposed that the state create a staggered system that allows cars through the detour routes during the business day, trucks by night. But she acknowledged that transportation officials have a tough balancing act in making the improvised system work with the least possible pain to all concerned.
Entrepreneurial optimism is far from dead, though. Ms. Walden at the Chocolate Factory was laying out her usual number of Granny Smiths on Wednesday morning for making caramel apples. Three hundred is a good week for apples, so that's what she decided to make. She pushed a stick handle firmly into each one.
''The saleswoman in me says we can't sell it if we don't make it,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Romantic Advantage

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In the race to be the world's dominant economy, Americans have at least one clear advantage over the Chinese. We're much better at branding. American companies have these eccentric failed novelists and personally difficult visionary founders who are fantastic at creating brands that consumers around the world flock to and will pay extra for. Chinese companies are terrible at this. Every few years, Chinese officials say they're going to start an initiative to create compelling brands and the results are always disappointing.
According to a recent survey by HD Trade services, 94 percent of Americans cannot name even a single brand from the world's second-largest economy. Whatever else they excel at, Chinese haven't been able to produce a style of capitalism that is culturally important, globally attractive and spiritually magnetic. 
Why?
Brand managers who've worked in China say their executives tend to see business deals in transactional, not in relationship terms. As you'd expect in a country that has recently emerged from poverty, where competition is fierce, where margins are thin, where corruption is prevalent and trust is low, the executives there are more likely to take a short-term view of their exchanges.
But if China is ever going to compete with developed economies, it'll have to go through a series of phase shifts. Creating effective brands is not just thinking like a low-end capitalist, only more so. It is an entirely different mode of thought.
Think of Ralph Lifshitz longing to emulate WASP elegance and creating the Ralph Lauren brand. Think of the young Stephen Gordon pining for the graciousness of the Adirondack lodges and creating Restoration Hardware. Think of Nike's mythos around the ideal of athletic perseverance.
People who create great brands are usually seeking to fulfill some inner longing of their own, some dream of living on a higher plane or with a cooler circle of friends.
Many of the greatest brand makers are in semirevolt against commerce itself. The person who probably has had the most influence on the feel of contemporary American capitalism, for example, is the aptly named Stewart Brand. He was the hippie, you will recall, who created the Whole Earth Catalog.
That compendium of countercultural advice appeared to tilt against corporate America. But it was embraced by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and many other high-tech pioneers. Brand himself created the term personal computer. As early as 1972, he understood that computers, which were just geeky pieces of metal and plastic, could be seen in cool, countercultural and revolutionary terms. We take the ethos of Silicon Valley and Apple for granted, but people like Brand gave it the aura, inspiring thousands of engineers and designers and hundreds of millions of consumers.
Seth Siegel, the co-founder of Beanstalk, a brand management firm, says that branding ''decommoditizes a commodity.'' It coats meaning around a product. It demands a quality of experience with the consumer that has to be reinforced at every touch point, at the store entrance, in the rest rooms, on the shopping bags. The process of branding itself is essentially about the expression and manipulation of daydreams. It owes as much to romanticism as to business school.
In this way, successful branding can be radically unexpected. The most anti-establishment renegades can be the best anticipators of market trends. The people who do this tend to embrace commerce even while they have a moral problem with it -- former hippies in the Bay Area, luxury artistes in Italy and France or communitarian semi-socialists in Scandinavia. These people sell things while imbuing them with more attractive spiritual associations.
The biggest threat to the creativity of American retail may be that we may have run out of countercultures to co-opt. We may have run out of anti-capitalist ethoses to give products a patina of cool. We may be raising a generation with few qualms about commerce, and this could make them less commercially creative.
But China has bigger problems. It is very hard for a culture that doesn't celebrate dissent to thrive in this game. It's very hard for a culture that encourages a natural deference to authority to do so. It's very hard for a country where the powerful don't instinctively seek a dialogue with the less powerful to keep up. It seems likely that the Chinese will require a few more cultural revolutions before it can brand effectively and compete at the top of the economic food chain.
At some point, if you are going to be the world's leading economy, you have to establish relationships with consumers. You have to put aside the things that undermine trust, like intellectual property theft and cyberterrorism, and create the sorts of brands that inspire affection and fantasy. Until it can do this, China may statistically possess the world's largest economy, but it will not be a particularly consequential one.

HEADLINE: Business Leaders Pushing Election Of Council Allies

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
A group of real estate executives and corporate leaders, bracing for the departure of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, plans to spend up to $10 million to make sure the City Council elected this fall is friendly to business.
The organization, made up of real estate developers, property owners, banks, insurance companies, investment firms and others, has established a political action committee to direct donations to back candidates in both parties who support pro-development policies.
Called Jobs for New York, the PAC represents an aggressive new involvement in New York's heavily regulated city elections by a major independent expenditure group. The PAC also has the support of several unions whose fortunes are tied to construction, including those representing carpenters and laborers known as mason tenders. 
The effort is focused exclusively on Council races, in part because members tend to have great sway over development in their districts, but also because of the uncertainty surrounding the topsy-turvy mayoral campaign.
The Council will undergo extensive turnover this year with some 21 of its 51 members stepping down, mainly because of term limits.
The infusion of cash from the PAC reflects broader anxieties coursing through New York's business community as Mr. Bloomberg prepares to leave City Hall after 12 years. The mayoral race has been marked by sharp questions about whether the candidates, especially those in the Democratic primary, are committed to building on the Bloomberg legacy or to dismantling it.
During his tenure, the mayor has championed a pro-development agenda, pushing dozens of rezoning measures through the Council while investing billions of dollars to nurture commercial development and affordable housing -- sometimes over the objections of neighborhood residents.
The PAC effort is being spearheaded by the Real Estate Board of New York, which includes some of the most influential figures and families in the industry, including Larry A. Silverstein, the developer of the World Trade Center, Richard S. LeFrak, Daniel R. Tishman, the Speyers and the Rudins.
In an interview, Steven Spinola, the president of the real estate board, called Mr. Bloomberg's time in City Hall a ''wonderful era'' and said his organization's PAC intended to support candidates who would advance a pro-jobs, pro-development agenda similar to Mr. Bloomberg's.
A memorandum outlining the effort described the coming election as a ''transformative campaign that will shape the city's economic development atmosphere for years to come.''
The group plans to get involved in races in up to 25 Council districts throughout the city, backing candidates who support ''an agenda focused on creating good jobs, building affordable housing and improving the city's economy,'' the memo says. It will pay for district-by-district polling, phone banks, direct mail, and television and radio advertisements to support candidates seen as being allied with the interests of business leaders and their supporters in labor.
The focus underscores the enormous role the Council -- relatively weak in other areas of city government -- has in overseeing development. It tends to defer to individual members' views on whether to approve, modify or reject projects in their districts.
The effort signals the new electoral dynamic created by recent court rulings that allowed for a proliferation of independent expenditure groups, like so-called super PACs, in presidential and Congressional races around the country. In New York City, campaign regulators are preparing for the participation of outside organizations and putting in place rules that require independent expenditure campaigns to disclose the source of their money and details of their spending.
City campaign regulators said on Thursday that they could not recall an independent expenditure campaign of the financial scale envisioned by the Jobs for New York PAC.
Given the sums the organization is prepared to spend, it could play a powerful role in the local campaigns. In 2009, sitting council members raised an average of $175,000, while challengers raised an average of $125,000, according to an analysis by Citizens Union of New York City, a government watchdog group.
Local races, however, can be unpredictable and hinge on longstanding relationships and grudges; whether an industry PAC can truly influence Council races on a citywide scale is an open question. The organizers have tapped Harry Giannoulis, Maggie Moran and Phil Singer, all veterans of city, state and federal campaigns, to oversee the organization's activities.
The group said it planned to abide by state contribution limits -- $150,000 from individuals and $5,000 from corporations.
The PAC also has the support of several unions: Mason Tenders' District Council of Greater New York; UFCW Local 1500, which represents supermarket workers; and the New York City District Council of Carpenters.
Mike McGuire, the political director of the Mason Tenders said his members benefited from robust development. ''It means jobs,'' he said. ''Unionized building trades are the last of the good blue-collar jobs in New York City.''
Mr. McGuire also noted that the turnover on the Council was coming at a critical time, suggesting that new members could affect a gradually improving economy, depending on their views. ''A pro-development Council would be good for us,'' he said.
In an interview, Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a government watchdog group, indicated that the multimillion-dollar effort was a significant shift in city politics and might alter the nature of campaigning on the local level.
''The entire point of a City Council race is to reflect the needs of the neighborhoods in a district,'' Ms. Lerner said. ''This undercuts the neighborhood-based nature of a district and replaces neighborhood concerns with industry concerns.''

HEADLINE: Growth in First Quarter Was Moderate

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The economy grew at a modest 2.4 percent annual rate from January through March, slightly slower than initially estimated. Consumer spending was stronger than first thought, but businesses restocked more slowly, and state and local government spending cuts were deeper. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that economic growth in the first quarter was only marginally below the 2.5 percent annual rate the government had estimated last month. The rate is still much faster than the 0.4 percent growth during the October-December quarter.
Most economists think growth is slowing to around a 2 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter as the economy adjusts to federal spending cuts, higher taxes and further global weakness. Still, many say the decline may not be as severe as once thought. The numbers have been buoyed by solid hiring, surging home prices and record stock gains, which should keep consumers spending.
Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the small revision to first-quarter growth supported her view that the economy would grow a moderate 2.2 percent for the year, the same as last year.
Still, Ms. Lee said she expected growth to improve to 3.2 percent in 2014, as the job market accelerates and consumers grow more confident in the economy.
Employers have added an average of 208,000 jobs a month since November, well above the monthly average of 138,000 during the previous six months. And the government said on Thursday that weekly jobless aid applications had risen to 354,000, a level consistent with modest job gains.
In addition, the number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes edged up in April to the highest level in three years. The increase points to growth in home sales in the coming months.
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales rose 0.3 percent to 106. That is the highest since April 2010, when a home buyer tax credit inflated sales.
Signed contracts have jumped 10.3 percent in the last 12 months. 8There is generally a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale.
Sales of previously occupied homes rose in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.97 million, a 3 1/2 year high. Sales of new homes also rose in April, to nearly a five-year high.
Still, the supply of homes on the market remained low, and that could keep sales from accelerating later this year. The number of available homes for sale rose in April, the Realtors' group said last week, but was still down 14 percent from a year earlier.
Fewer homes for sale may be holding back sales in tight markets in the West, like Las Vegas and Phoenix. In those cities, many homeowners still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.

HEADLINE: The Natural World: Here, It's Had Work

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
Behind a white door in the basement of MoMA PS1, there's a room that's literally freezing cold. Inside are nearly a dozen boulder-size chunks of blue-tinged ice, fragments of a glacier in Iceland recovered by the celebrated artist Olafur Eliasson and transported here to create one of the more chilling artworks in ''Expo 1: New York,'' a sprawling, multisite extravaganza including a multitude of installations, shows-within-shows and events relating to the current and future state of our planet's ecology.
The obvious lesson of Mr. Eliasson's installation, ''Your waste of time,'' is that global warming is wreaking havoc on nature. But I couldn't help wondering: how much power does it take to keep the room so cold? A wall label explains that the cooling machinery is powered by solar panels temporarily installed on PS1's roof. Still, what's the project's carbon footprint? Does raising awareness of a phenomenon that most viewers already know of make it worth the energy drain? Whose time is being wasted? 
Elsewhere in the building is an exhibition of beautiful black-and-white images of Yellowstone National Park and other picturesque places in the American West by Ansel Adams, the beloved nature photographer. Organized by the Museum of Modern Art photography curator Roxana Marcoci, this show within the show, ''The Politics of Contemplation,'' acknowledges how much Adams's photography did to put preservation of the natural wilderness on the national political agenda. But what's to be done, I wonder, now that places like Yellowstone and even Mount Everest are being stressed by hordes of nature-loving adventure tourists?
Much to the credit of ''Expo 1'' as a whole, it raises many more questions than it answers. Overseen by Klaus Biesenbach, director of MoMA PS1, with help from the globe-trotting curator Hans Ulrich Obrist, among others, the exhibition casts too wide a net and offers too many different and contradictory perspectives for anyone to find in it support for any single earth-saving program.
One component of dubious value is attracting attention: ''Rain Room,'' a high-tech amusement in a temporary structure next door to MoMA's 53rd Street building in Manhattan. Produced by the group Random International, ''Rain Room'' welcomes visitors into a large chamber in which water showers from the ceiling but ceases wherever human bodies are detected by digital gadgetry. You walk in fearing you'll get drenched, but you stay dry. At one end of the room, a nearly blinding white light directs its beam through the precipitation. Because the water is under pressure, it falls not in drops but in short, needlelike lines, which refract the light into rainbows of color.
Visitors willing to wait in line for the ''Rain Room'' experience -- only 10 people at a time are allowed in -- may wonder what it contributes to deep thinking about ecological issues. It could have been made for the World's Fair of 1964, a more optimistic time when people thought that scientists might someday be able to control the weather. Today's meteorology is still scarily unpredictable, and ''Rain Room,'' for all its entertaining ingenuity, seems little more than a gimmicky diversion.
The buildingwide show at PS1 is ''Dark Optimism,'' an appropriately oxymoronic title. The first artwork you encounter is emblematic. Made by Chris Burden, it consists of two Titanic models suspended from a beam balanced on the tip of a miniature Eiffel Tower over a toy cityscape. Activated by a motor, the boats go round and round like vehicles on a perverse amusement park ride.
Even the romantic fantasy of nature's essential goodness is challenged. One of the most arresting works at PS1 is Pierre Huyghe's ''Zoodram 5 (After 'Sleeping Muse' by Constantin Brancusi),'' displayed in a dark room. Within a glowing aquarium, a large, live hermit crab resides in a reproduction of Brancusi's ''Sleeping Muse,'' and about a dozen spidery creatures called Arrow crabs move about on long, spindly legs. A guide in the room explained to me that Arrow crabs are fiercely territorial and will eat one another until only one remains, at which point the tank will be replenished with another batch of the little monsters.
The video ''Deeparture,'' by Mircea Cantor, shows a deer and a wolf in an otherwise empty white-cube-type gallery. The deer looks nervous, but the wolf doesn't seem to be paying it much attention. I suppose they both are too disoriented to behave naturally, which is something you might say about life in general these days.
In the context of the show, Sylvia Plimack Mangold's tenderly painted, Cézannesque pictures of bare-limbed trees exude a funereal mood, as if they were memorials for a dying species. But the work that befits the title ''Dark Optimism'' best might be a short video in the subshow ''Pro Bio,'' devoted to futuristic works about biology, genetics and so forth. One video, ''Emerging Artist,'' made by a group called DIS, dwells on the very pregnant bellies of three women while a female voice-over intones, ''The world is waiting for something -- the next artist, the next genius, the next legend.'' It's like a TV commercial in a dystopian sci-fi movie.
In its role as conversation starter, not finisher, ''Expo 1'' will include an extensive schedule of talks, panels and other educational events organized by editors of the magazine Triple Canopy. (Many events involving community-enhancing activities will also take place in a geodesic dome in Rockaway Beach, Queens.)
At PS1 I attended an illuminating dialogue between the writers Samuel R. Delany and Kelly Link about the state of science fiction today. Mr. Delany referred to the late-19th- and early-20th-century work of the sociologist Émile Durkheim, who discovered something previously unknown to social science: the relationships between rates of various sorts of phenomena. He showed, for example, that suicides increase as the rate of unemployment goes up. Mr. Delany's larger point was that to make ''educated guesses'' about the future, you need to think about correlations among developments that may seem unrelated.
Few works in the exhibition explicitly take up this idea, but it could have been the theme of ''Expo 1'' as a whole. An apposite video, ''Hopeless Lands,'' by the Chinese artist Liu Wei, studies people in a vast dump on the outskirts of Beijing, picking through refuse and loading presumably recyclable finds into large bags, the contents of which, no doubt, will be turned into more consumer goods. Though it resembles a hellish scene from a post-apocalyptic movie, the film is an abysmally telling glimpse of one link in a present-day global ecology of production and consumption. Nothing is isolated; everything, for better and for worse, is somehow correlated.
''Expo 1: New York'' continues through Sept. 2 at MoMA PS1, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, and other sites; (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org.

HEADLINE: Sirius

BYLINE: By NICOLAS RAPOLD

 BODY:
Before ''The X-Files'' there were cable-television U.F.O. shows, raising spooky questions and little shivers of wonder about the cosmos, with testimony from assorted astrophysicists and freethinkers. Amardeep Kaleka's documentary ''Sirius,'' which seeks to induce government transparency about extraterrestrial life, rolls out eyewitnesses to U.F.O.'s and such, but also cross-pollinates with a more recent vintage of economic doomsaying. 
Thus Dwight D. Eisenhower, shown in a popular clip declaiming against the military industrial complex, shares screen time with a pocket-size humanoid corpse under analysis by a Stanford University biologist. Steven Greer, a medical doctor and leader of a transparency effort, lectures on government secrecy about extraterrestrials between dense montages of testimony and a gravelly, insinuating voice-over that offers some of the more extreme pronouncements. (References to Sept. 11 truther claims is probably also a no-no.) We also hear (but understand little) about how Mr. Greer and others commune with aliens through a kind of meditation.
It perhaps exceeds the earthly purview of a humble film critic to evaluate claims of extraterrestrial life, but it's definitely unwise to bury the audience in suggestive statements and footage without dwelling long enough on any one thing to persuade. Though the would-be mini-alien yields some suspense, Mr. Kaleka's film feels a bit like wandering into a hotel convention hall full of true believers who have been chatting for hours.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Amardeep Kaleka 1 hour 56 minutes; not rated
