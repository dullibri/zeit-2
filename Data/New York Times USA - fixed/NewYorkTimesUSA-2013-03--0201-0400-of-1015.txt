HIGHLIGHT: How John Brown&#8217;s 1859 raid inspired a minister-turned-colonel to carry out a similar attack on Jacksonville, Fla. in 1863. 

 BODY:
A raid into the South was afoot. So reported The New-York Tribune, which sketched out a few details of a plot to surprise Southerners "not with the phantom, but the reality of servile insurrection." At the behest of a radical white abolitionist, a group of free African-Americans had laid the groundwork for the clandestine incursion by preparing enslaved populations, who waited, ready "to rise in thousands." After capturing a Southern town, the abolitionist and his colleagues, black and white, planned to establish a base from which to organize and arm a force of escaped slaves. The raid would be the opening salvo in a war on slavery.
This story, no doubt, has a familiar ring. Yet the year in question was 1863, not 1859. The place was Jacksonville, Fla., not Harpers Ferry, Va. And the leader was not John Brown, but Thomas Wentworth Higginson. 
On March 6, 1863, Colonel Higginson set out from a base in the South Carolina Sea Islands with almost 1,000 men, most of them former slaves, to capture Jacksonville. He hoped the town would become the first in a chain of mainland Union outposts along the Southeastern seaboard, an antislavery refuge reminiscent of the Appalachian colony plotted by John Brown. Like Brown, Higginson believed his raid would attract thousands of runaway slaves, while striking fear in the heart of the white South. 
The echoes of John Brown were probably more than coincidence. Just a few years earlier Higginson, a Unitarian minister from Worcester, Mass., had been a member of the group of Brown supporters known as the "Secret Six." The most militant voice in the Secret Six, Higginson raised money to finance the raid at Harpers Ferry and pushed Brown not to hesitate in putting his plan into effect.
On the surface, this alliance between Higginson - a Harvard-educated liberal - and Brown - a rough-hewn Calvinist - is surprising. Yet like many of his fellow Transcendentalists, Higginson found much to admire in the grizzled frontiersman. Brown was a man of nature, forceful action, and higher-law idealism. He personified the romantic ideals to which Higginson himself aspired. The Worcester minister compared Brown to the heroic knights in Walter Scott's historical romances, while Higginson's friend Henry David Thoreau called the militant abolitionist "a transcendentalist above all." 
Little wonder that Higginson, Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson were among the first to publicly defend the failed Harpers Ferry raid, which left 17 people - 10 of whom were Brown's men - dead. As Americans rushed to condemn Brown, these New Englanders offered eloquent defenses that helped to transform public opinion, at least across much of the North.
After the raid the ties between Higginson and Brown grew even deeper. Unlike some of his co-conspirators, Higginson neither fled the country, nor renounced his support for Brown and his raid. Instead, he collected money for Brown's legal defense and plotted to free the imprisoned abolitionist and his colleagues. When rescue proved unworkable and Brown was executed, Higginson wrote a series of articles on slave rebellions, an idea, he admitted, that was "suggested by the late Virginia affair."
Once Confederates opened fire on Fort Sumter in the spring of 1861, Higginson proposed another invasion of Virginia, perhaps to be led by Brown's son, John Brown Jr. He hoped this antislavery mission would take pressure off Washington, while also unsettling Confederates. "I want at least to get the name of John Brown rumored on the border," Higginson confessed. 
Although this venture never came to fruition, Higginson continued to try to involve Brown's progeny in the burgeoning conflict. Six months later he invited Brown's son Salmon to join a new regiment that he was raising. The regiment was disbanded, but in the fall of 1862 Higginson took charge of another - the First South Carolina Volunteers - the first official regiment composed of former slaves. 
Again Brown was on his mind. "I had been an abolitionist too long, and had known and loved John Brown too well, not to feel a thrill of joy at last on finding myself in the position where he only wished to be," he wrote of his decision to assume command of the volunteers. The following spring, Higginson picked up in Jacksonville where Brown had left off three and a half years earlier.
Higginson pitched his Jacksonville raid to superiors along lines that Brown would have found familiar. Fifteen years earlier, the militant abolitionist had outlined a plan to lead a liberating force into the Appalachian Mountains in a private conversation with Frederick Douglass. Noting his familiarity with these mountains, which were "full of natural forts" and "good hiding-places," Brown insisted that he "could take a body of men into them and keep them there despite of all the efforts of Virginia to dislodge them." He planned to divide his force into small squads, which would emancipate slaves on nearby plantations, recruiting "the most restless and daring" to join their ranks. Brown hoped to extend these "operations" ever deeper into the South and, eventually, destroy slavery from within.
Higginson plotted a remarkably similar venture in 1863. Since the start of the war he had argued that arming former slaves was the key to Union victory. Now, in the wake of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, Higginson believed he was being given the opportunity to fulfill this "destiny." Although many Americans - perhaps even the president himself - still harbored doubts about blacks' martial capacities, Higginson had no such misgivings. 
The colonel would lead the volunteers into Jacksonville, where they would establish a permanent mainland foothold in the Department of the South, which comprised South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. The Florida town would be the first in "a chain of such posts," he wrote Brig. Gen. Rufus Saxton in February, which "would completely alter the whole aspect of the war in the sea-board slave States, and would accomplish what no accumulation of Northern regiments can so easily effect." Just as Brown had touted the natural advantages of the Appalachians, Higginson highlighted northeastern Florida's proximity to the Okefenokee Swamp, which made it "infinitely more defensible" than the Sea Islands. Utilizing his black soldiers' firsthand knowledge of the region, Higginson hoped to disrupt local slave economies, liberate the thousands of slaves who lived in the region and, perhaps most critically, add new black recruits for the Union cause.
Higginson's plan followed Brown's in its broadest strokes, but the colonel also sought to learn from the failures of the abolitionist martyr. Despite his unwavering support for Brown after Harpers Ferry, Higginson believed that the raid had ended in disaster because its leader had impulsively abandoned "the more deliberate and wholly practicable plans of his earlier days" in favor of a hasty "descent upon Harper's Ferry." 
Higginson and his commanding officer, Rufus Saxton, would not make the same mistake. They carefully plotted their expedition for nearly a month, selecting the small northeastern Florida town of Jacksonville as their initial target because it sat on the St. John's River, which the Union Navy already controlled, and had a good port. 
Surrounded by flat terrain and defended by few Rebel troops, Jacksonville was nothing like Harpers Ferry. The former would be easy to defend, but the latter, which was encircled by wooded hills and thousands of armed white Virginians, had proved to be, in Douglass's words, "a perfect steel trap" for Brown and his small band of men. Higginson also made sure he would not be outnumbered, setting out from Port Royal Island with about 1,000 men from the First and Second South Carolina Volunteers.
Befitting Higginson's diligent preparation, the Jacksonville expedition resulted in less immediate bloodshed and greater short-term success than the Harpers Ferry raid. Without so much as firing a shot, Higginson's regiments steamed up the St. Johns River and, on March 10, took control of the town. 
Their first night was disquieting. Local blacks informed the volunteers that there was a Confederate camp just eight miles west of Jacksonville, but nightfall came before they had a chance to build defensive works. Higginson ordered his men to post themselves around the perimeter of the town and wait for dawn. It was "the most terribly anxious night I ever passed," confessed Higginson in his journal. 
When the morning came, the volunteers swiftly began securing the town of 500 people, most of whom were white women and children. Meanwhile, Jacksonville residents complained bitterly about poor treatment at the hands of Higginson's black soldiers. The colonel investigated these allegations, which in most cases proved baseless. Still, he ordered his men to avoid the townspeople whenever possible. 
Like Brown, who had gone to great lengths to keep his hostages out of harm's way, Higginson also tried to protect innocent townspeople from danger. When Confederate forces let it be known that they intended to attack Jacksonville, the colonel permitted about 150 locals to leave town. As if to remind them of the spirit of the moment, one Union officer whistled "John Brown's Body" while the townspeople evacuated.
The threatened rebel assault on Jacksonville never came. But the volunteers did skirmish with local Confederate units when they ventured out to liberate slaves from local plantations. Adhering to his initial plan to capture more than just Jacksonville, Higginson eventually requested reinforcements so that his men could "more freely ... act up the river, & range through the country." Not long after white troops from Maine and Massachusetts arrived, however, Higginson received an order to abandon the tiny outpost. He was stunned. Strangely, Maj. Gen. David Hunter, commander of the Department of the South, never explained his decision to initiate a full retreat from Jacksonville. 
Higginson suspected that it reflected the influence of conservative advisors, who opposed emancipation and black enlistment. But, as he later admitted, the decision may have been the result of a "scarcity of troops" in the department. Hunter was on the cusp of a major offensive against Charleston and, while he had no plans to include Higginson's black troops in that campaign, the general viewed the white reinforcements that had been sent to Jacksonville as essential to the attack. 
Higginson reluctantly ordered his men to return to the South Carolina Sea Islands, less than a month after they had left them. The First and Second South Carolina Volunteers would liberate almost 1,000 slaves later that summer on other excursions, but they never managed to establish a permanent mainland outpost for their war against slavery.
Nevertheless, the Jacksonville campaign bore fruit out of failure. Its early success helped to convert white Union soldiers, and white Northerners more generally, to acceptance of the enlistment of African-Americans into the Union Army. The raid also provided bait for black recruiters, who pointed to the mission as evidence that African-American soldiers would, indeed, be given the opportunity to fight. 
Finally, as the historian Stephen Ash has recently argued, the campaign, though short-lived, may have convinced the War Department to take up African-American recruitment in earnest. Lincoln had finally embraced the enlistment and arming of black men in his Emancipation Proclamation, yet three months later recruitment was proceeding slowly, with only eight total regiments in active duty. Not long after the news of the Jacksonville expedition made its way to Washington, however, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton ordered the full-scale enlistment that would put 180,000 black men in blue by the end of the war. 
Higginson, for his part, believed that his mission had made the difference. In May 1863, he recounted a story that he had heard from a fellow officer in his journal. "Secretary Chase told him the Cabinet at Washington kept their whole action in regard to enlisting colored troops waiting to hear from us in Florida, & when the capture of Jacksonville was known, the whole question was regarded as settled," wrote Higginson. "This is, I think, the best expression of the importance of our action that has yet occurred."
Jacksonville's legacy, in turn, points to one last connection to Harpers Ferry. Even more than Higginson's campaign, John Brown's raid failed to accomplish its immediate aims. Yet it too advanced the antislavery cause significantly over the long term. After all, with the assistance of Higginson and his fellow Transcendentalists, Brown had transformed himself into an antislavery martyr in the weeks after Harpers Ferry. Church bells tolled from Chicago to Boston after he was executed on Dec. 2, 1859. 
South of the Mason-Dixon Line, of course, this outpouring of support for Brown and his seditious raid was too much. The Baltimore Sun declared it "preposterous" for the South "to live under a Government, the majority of whose subjects or citizens regard John Brown as a martyr and a Christian hero, rather than a murderer and a robber." The Richmond Enquirer was more to the point: "The Harper's Ferry invasion has advanced the cause of Disunion more than any other event that has happened since the formation of the Government." 
Harpers Ferry and Jacksonville, then, dovetailed not only in conception but also in outcome. Aiming to help the enslaved destroy slavery from within, both abolitionist missions failed in their immediate efforts but succeeded in their long-term goals. While Harpers Ferry pushed the nation closer to war, Jacksonville contributed to Union victory. Together, they helped to bring the institution of slavery to an end. 
In the wake of the Harpers Ferry raid, Thomas Wentworth Higginson had written John Brown's family that their condemned father had "failed in his original effort only to succeed in a greater result." The same might be said of the colonel's Florida mission several years later.

HEADLINE: With Legal Reserves Low, Bank of America Faces a Big Lawsuit

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: A lawsuit over Bank of America&#8217;s mortgage portfolio could cost the bank tens of billions more than it had planned, prompting critics to say the bank has not set aside enough for a settlement. 

 BODY:
Bank of America has been underestimating its legal risks for years, and brazenly so, according to its critics. Is that strategy about to pay off with the Federal Reserve
On Thursday, the Fed will release figures on how much capital the nation's biggest banks must have to cover a "stress" situation. The following week, investors find out whether those banks will be able to return more of their capital to shareholders by paying dividends or buying back stock.
Last year, the Fed passed most of the big banks and let them pay out billions. Bank of America, sensing a request would be unwelcome, didn't even ask. This year, however, Wall Street expects that Bank of America will get the green light.
Yet the bank continues to face gargantuan payouts to clean up legal disputes from the bubble years. Now a lawsuit suggests that the bank's mortgage portfolio could cost it tens of billions more than it had planned. In one big case, if things go wrong, Bank of America may be required to make good on many more billions worth of bad mortgages from Countrywide Financial, which the bank acquired, in the sense that one acquires Ebola virus, in 2008. 
Bank of America, however, has kept its legal reserves low - perhaps dangerously so.
The dispute involves a 2011 settlement that Bank of America reached with some of the world's biggest investors, including Pimco and BlackRock, for $8.5 billion. That amount covers more than $400 billion of Countrywide loans, on which there have been tens of billions of losses. The actual loss total is in dispute because they are estimates, but it ranges from $70 billion or so to well over $100 billion. That means, at the high end of the range, the settlement was for pennies on the dollar. On a conference call last week held by Mike Mayo, the CLSA bank analyst, a legal expert suggested that if things went south in the courts for Bank of America, the settlement might rise to $25 billion to $30 billion.
Bank of America contends that its reserves are reasonable, based on its estimated probable payouts. The bank wouldn't raise them "based on speculation from third-party observers who are not directly involved in any of these matters," a spokesman said.
Even in the fun house of litigation about mortgages, this one is particularly complicated. The dispute revolves around the question of whether another bank, BNY Mellon, working on behalf of mortgage-backed securities investors, was reasonable and acted in good faith in agreeing to the settlement. It is being hashed out in New York State Supreme Court. BNY Mellon is the trustee on 530 securitizations, or bundles of Countrywide mortgages, that were sold to investors.
The insurer American International Group, along with some others, including the New York and Delaware attorneys general, are fighting about the settlement. Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, has accused BNY Mellon of breaching its fiduciary duty. A BNY Mellon spokesman said, "We believe we have fulfilled all of our duties as trustee in this case."
The small settlement doesn't sit right. The group of investors who agreed to it hold only about a quarter of the securities, making it appear as if a minority has forced a bad deal on the majority in order to get few quick bucks and resolve any dispute. The Pimcos and BlackRocks of the world don't like to sue big banks. Things can get a little uncomfortable on the golf links. (They contend it was reasonable, given all the legal uncertainties of a protracted dispute.)
And who blessed the $8.5 billion figure anyway? To figure out whether it was fair, BNY Mellon relied on a firm called RRMS Advisors, a mortgage analysis firm.
The RRMS estimate has been in dispute for some time now. The firm relied on information from Bank of America, and critics contend it underestimated problems in the loans and the total losses. How BNY Mellon found little RRMS isn't clear; the bank wouldn't comment. RRMS's Brian Lin, who conducted the analysis, stood by his report, but declined to comment further.
Recently, other court rulings have boded ill for Bank of America. Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan has ruled that an insurer called Assured Guaranty was able to dispute mortgages that it backed and that were made by a small bank called Flagstar, without having to show that the contractual breach was the direct cause of the loss. In other words, the borrower may have defaulted, but Assured didn't have to demonstrate that it was because she didn't make $150,000 a year as a tarot card reader, as had been claimed on the borrower's loan application. If Bank of America is hit by such a ruling too, it might have to pay more. It argues its contracts are different.
So is Bank of America vulnerable? Not surprisingly, it is keeping whole swaths of expensive Manhattan law firms working all hours of the day to make the case that it isn't. BNY Mellon, too, contends it acted reasonably.
And the banks contend the $8.5 billion settlement is in line with other similar settlements. Of course, the investors continue to face huge hurdles even if rulings in this case start to go their way.
But even if the chances are low that the cases don't go in Bank of America's favor, an increase in legal reserves could be huge. So this is a low-probability, high-risk event. Another way of saying that is that it is a "stress" situation. And who just put banks through stress situations? Ah, right, the Federal Reserve.
The Fed, whose earlier decisions have been generous to the banks, declined to comment for this column.
As Professors Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig, authors of the new book, "The Banker's New Clothes," have argued, the big banks are undercapitalized and the simplest way for them to start building capital is to keep their profits instead of returning them to shareholders.
A look at Bank of America's estimates for how much it will have to pay for its mortgage liability is telling. It has gone up steadily each year. In 2009, the bank had a reserve of $3.5 billion. By last year, it had jumped to $19 billion, with an estimate of additional loss of up to another $4 billion.
And so Bank of America seems to have been consistently underestimating its legal exposure. (And it has other, undisclosed legal reserves for different cases. The incentives to lowball those are much greater, because the public cannot scrutinize them.)
In keeping the reserves low, Bank of America has already won. If it turns out that the bank loses its cases and has to pay much more money, it nevertheless has managed to make its books look that much better for years. That surely helped as it has tried to dig itself out of its financial crisis hole.
"This is an accounting arbitrage," says Manal Mehta, a hedge fund manager who has been on a lonely crusade for years to follow the complexities of these cases. "The accounting rules give you a lot of latitude in setting reserves," he says. Bank of America is "hiding behind that."
Fortune may favor the bold, but regulators just give them a pass.

HEADLINE: A Call for a National Strategy on Veterans

BYLINE: MIKE HAYNIE and NICHOLAS ARMSTRONG


HIGHLIGHT: A National Veterans Strategy would include a national dialogue to define our societal obligations to those who volunteer for military service and establishing policies to carry out those obligations, engaging government, the private sector, veterans service organizations and local communities to combine resources in support of veterans and their families. 

 BODY:
Stand on the corner of H Street and Vermont Avenue in Washington, D.C., and in every direction you'll see the ways and means of American government - the White House in front, the Treasury to the left and the huge Office of Management and Budget building down the street and to the right. This vista is both symbolic of - and essential to running - our system of governance "by the people, for the people." 
On that same corner sits the Department of Veterans Affairs. No building in Washington is more emblematic of the sacrifices made by citizens of this nation in service to the ideals of freedom and democracy. 
At the entrance to the department is a bronze plaque that reads, "To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan." These words, spoken by President Abraham Lincoln in his Second Inaugural Address, embody the notion that all Americans are inherently connected to those citizens who "have borne the battle." In truth, however, America has a somewhat uneven history with regard to upholding this assumed social contract. 
As the nation approaches the end of its longest war, in Afghanistan, we suggest a historic (and long overdue) action: crafting and institutionalizing a coordinated, comprehensive, whole-of-the-nation National Veterans Strategy.
What do we mean by a National Veterans Strategy? First, we mean starting a national dialogue to define our societal obligations to those who volunteer for military service. Second, we mean establishing policies to carry out those obligations, engaging government, the private sector, veterans service organizations and local communities to combine resources in support of veterans and their families. In a report released recently by our offices at Syracuse University, the Institute for Veterans and Military Families and the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism, we recommend several steps the federal government should take toward creating such a strategy. Those include creating an interagency commission to develop the policy, establishing an office to oversee the policy and forming a coalition of private groups willing to collaborate in supporting veterans and their families. 
A National Veterans Strategy represents an opportunity not just to improve programs, but also nurture healthier civil-military relations and ensure a strong, sustainable national defense. It's a chance to confer new meaning to President Lincoln's words. But why now? 
First, there is a fiscal and public policy argument. More than 1,300 federal and state policies, executive orders and agency directives affect veteran services and benefits. We believe this plethora of policies is complicating meaningful collaboration and reducing efficiency in putting public and private sector resources to their best use in service to veterans. Nearly every federal agency has some responsibility for veterans-related programs, and this disparate policy landscape - though well intentioned - means there is redundancy in programs, ineffective use of resources and insufficient interagency and public-private coordination. 
In 2013, the United States will spend an estimated $140.3 billion on veterans programs and services through the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than double the level in 2000. Demand for benefits and services will continue to increase, as an additional one million service members leave the military by 2016. In the face of likely fiscal constraints, a National Veterans Strategy could prove an effective means to align policy, coordinate federal, state, local and private-sector efforts and rationalize fiscal choices in a way that limits the potential for veterans' issues to become politicized during partisan budget debates. 
There is also a national security argument for creating a National Veterans Strategy. The sustainability of the all-volunteer force depends upon attracting talented, service-minded young people to a military career. Yet consider a Pew research poll indicating that while 9 in 10 Americans hold a favorable perception of the military, fewer than half would recommend military service to a young person. The best way to reinforce positive attitudes toward military service is, we believe, effectively supporting and advancing the well-being of veterans and their families. 
Finally, there is an argument grounded in the founding traditions and moral norms of our nation. America's legacy of caring for its veterans dates back to the late 17th century at Plymouth colony, where pensions were provided to military veterans disabled while protecting the colony. 
Maintaining a force of volunteers carries with it certain obligations, incurred by citizens and institutions that benefit from the military service of others, an obligation that ensures that military service is treated as something more than simply a vocation. Institutionalizing a National Veterans Strategy is therefore a moral act that will strengthen our nation's ability to satisfy this covenant between the volunteer force and the society they serve.
How, then, would a National Veterans Strategy be organized? What would be its priorities? How would it be implemented? These are all questions that must be addressed through a national dialogue. 
Importantly, our call to action is not solely directed at, nor dependent on, government. A National Veterans Strategy is an opportunity for engaged citizenship, and the process should be inclusive and collaborative. Organizations and leaders in the veterans' community should engage public and private sector stakeholders, ideally under the framework of a presidentially directed commission, to discuss and ultimately seek a consensus on a strategy. From there, it would fall to the White House and Congress to turn those recommendations into programs and policies.
President Calvin Coolidge said, "The nation which forgets its defenders will be itself forgotten." Let future generations say of this generation, "They were the ones who finally got it right." Let us seize the opportunity to come together and marshal our disparate skills and resources behind an enduring legacy. Let us be the generation of Americans who create an enduring National Veterans Strategy - a strategy to honor, support and empower this next "Greatest Generation" and cement our nation's commitment to future generations of veterans.

HEADLINE: The Benefits of Working in the Office

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: Research shows that in some industries, casual interaction among employees enhances creativity and innovation. Plus, some benefits, like free meals, might actually give workers a tax break. 

 BODY:
Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer, inspired much debate and rebuke when she recently abolished Yahoo's work-at-home policy. In academia, "working from home" is a treasured euphemism for heading home after your morning class to have lunch, read the newspaper and take a nap. I hate to see anything that would endanger this hallowed tradition. 
But encouraging working at in the office makes sense, especially for a company like Yahoo. While some studies suggest that working from home can increase worker productivity, a different line of research shows that in knowledge-based industries, casual interaction among employees enhances creativity and innovation. 
Ms. Mayer is right to pursue this goal, although she might have better luck with carrots than sticks. For one thing, the "carrots" of working at the office might actually give the employees a tax break.
Ms. Mayer came to Yahoo from Google, which is famous for its extravagant benefits, including free food and snacks, on-site gyms, subsidized massages, concierge services, on-site doctors, free on-site haircuts and so on. (Mashable illustrated some of the common workplace amenities in Silicon Valley.) 
Some items, like free or subsidized dry-cleaning, are clearly taxable benefits for the employee. Other benefits, like an on-site gym, are permitted to be provided tax free by regulation. Still others, like free meals, are probably taxable, but may not always be reported as income, and are unlikely to become the target of an I.R.S. crackdown. 
The legal test for meals is whether the meals are provided on-site "for the convenience of the employer." There must be a substantial noncompensatory business purpose, like a need to have employees available for emergencies, or an absence of sufficient restaurants nearby.
From Google's perspective, lavish benefits do more than keep employees happy. A pleasant environment keeps them at work, draws them into the office on weekends and makes it easier for them to be productive when they are on site. Free haircuts minimize time away from the office. Free food encourages employees to eat together, collaborating on projects and encouraging the cross-pollination of ideas. If eating meals on site is tantamount to a condition of employment, then perhaps the meals are properly excluded from income.
The tax policy challenge is that while many of these perks may help the employer, they also provide substantial untaxed personal benefits to the employee. Not every lunch conversation will be focused on work. Why is that a problem? The logic of taxing fringe benefits is rooted in the concept of horizontal equity. 
Suppose Abe works at Yahoo, makes $150,000 a year and is taxed at an effective 33 percent rate, thereby paying $50,000 in taxes. Bridget, by contrast, makes $120,000 and also enjoys $30,000 of untaxed fringe benefits. 
Bridget's tax liability is only $40,000 (33 percent of $120,000), meaning that she pays $10,000 (or 20 percent) less in taxes, yet received the same economic compensation as Abe. To the extent that Bridget's benefits are really compensation, and not for the convenience of the employer, this is unfair.
Still, it seems churlish to ask the government to crack down on efforts to make the workplace a more pleasant environment. Given the importance of creativity and innovation to economic growth, a tax subsidy for benefits that foster casual interaction at work makes a lot of sense, even if some portion of the benefits might really be a form of compensation. 
Rather than requiring the I.R.S. to ask whether fringe benefits are compensatory, the Treasury Department could write regulations directing the agency to exclude from income items and services - like meals, climbing walls or foosball - if those items are consumed in a work environment intended to increase collaboration. Services that merely substitute for otherwise nondeductible, everyday living expenses, like dry-cleaning, would remain taxable. 
One concern is the distributional impact of such an approach: it mostly helps those who are already well-off. Fringe benefits are commonplace for computer programmers in Silicon Valley, but I haven't heard of too many auto mechanics or janitors who get similar perks at work. 
 A common example of a fringe benefit that is technically income but goes untaxed is the employee retention of frequent flier miles earned during the course of business travel. For a discussion of this and other customary deviations from the Internal Revenue Code, see Lawrence Zelenak, Custom and the Rule of Law in the Administration of the Income Tax, 62 Duke L.J. 829 (2013).

HEADLINE: The Republican Party's "Donorism" Problem

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why elite self-interest may be a bigger obstacle to Republican reform than grassroots ideology. 

 BODY:
Politico's Jonathan Martin has a good piece today about the divide between conservative policy writers and Republican politicians, and the absence (which I've touched on recently) of any actual G.O.P. elected officials willing to champion the various reformist ideas that have been floating around right-of-center journals and magazines and blogs recently (and really for years now). I agree with most of the people quoted in the piece - and particularly Bill Kristol and Ramesh Ponnuru, who both bemoan the absence of domestic policy entrepreneurism among the party's backbenchers. But Martin's conversation the American Enterprise Institute's Jim Pethokoukis seemed particularly worth highlighting:
... Pethokoukis has been particularly outspoken about the need for Republicans to detach themselves from the banks ... In an interview, the think tanker said, "The banks need to be downsized, broken up or at least restructured in some fashion. But that view has made little penetration with the politicians." 
And Pethokoukis says part of the reason for that is something that inhibits other policy reforms: donorism.
"The campaign money may be playing a role," he acknowledged.
With ambitious politicians trekking to Wall Street to raise cash and frequently sending their former staffers to lobby for the banks on K Street, the ardor elected Republicans may have for cracking down on financial institutions is diminished.
Every battle within the G.O.P. tends to be explained in moderate-vs.-conservative terms, and when the subject of policy innovation comes up it's usually framed as a matter of sensible centrists trying to push their ideas against an intransigent right-wing base. But financial reform is just one of the many areas where the divide might be aptly described as a "donorist" (to borrow Martin's phrase) versus "populist," and where the party's rank-and-file and their tribunes might actually be more receptive to new policy ideas than the self-described moderates who often write the party's biggest checks.
True, grassroots conservatives have a depressing tendency to rally around gimcrack proposals ("9-9-9," the gold standard etc.) and the hucksters who promote them. But if you're looking for a potential constituency for a Republican economic agenda that doesn't just start and end with lowering marginal tax rates for high earners, you're much more likely to find it among social conservatives who backed Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum in Republican primaries or even the viewers who thrilled to Glenn Beck's jeremiads against corporatism than among the party's biggest moneymen - most of whom, for understandable reasons, tend to like the G.O.P.'s near-obsessive focus on the top marginal tax rate just fine.
This isn't to say that the "donorists" are averse to reframing the party's agenda. The raft of semi-prominent signatures on a Republican brief in support of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage and the sudden renewal of elite-level enthusiasm for immigration reform are both examples of donor-influenced policy experiments.
But as those examples suggest, a Republican Party that changes in ways that make its biggest donors comfortable will look for ways to moderate on social issues and only social issues, the better to keep the party's "it's always 1980" economic agenda more or less intact. And while there's a case to make for a social-issues shift, up to a point - "legitimate rape" and "self-deportation" obviously didn't help Mitt Romney in 2012 - a party that seems out of touch and out of date on basic pocketbook issues probably isn't going to rebuild its support just by converging with the Democrats on gay marriage and immigration. To the extent that big-donor self-interest prevents a reckoning with this reality, it may prove a bigger problem for the G.O.P. in the long run than "the base" as it's conventionally covered and understood.

HEADLINE: Global Slavery, by the Numbers

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: A Big Data start-up analyzed reports from governments and human rights organizations, then presented its findings in a pretty graphic full of ugly truths. Among the findings: Slaves may cost as little as $60, and children are often used for fishing and harvesting stones. 

 BODY:
Here are some chilling statistics: The lifetime profit on a brickmaking slave in Brazil is $8,700, and $2,000 in India. Sexual slavery brings the slave's owner $18,000 over the slave's working life in Thailand, and $49,000 in Los Angeles. 
These are some of the numbers recently published by a foundation financed by a New York company that analyzes data for business intelligence, which deployed the same techniques to look at the worldwide trade in human trafficking. 
While slavery is illegal across the globe, the SumAll Foundation noted, there are 27 million slaves worldwide, more than in 1860, when there were 25 million. Most are held in bonded servitude, particularly after taking loans they could not repay. Slaves cost slightly more now, with a median price of $140, compared with $134 per human then. Debt slaves cost on average $60; trafficked sex slaves cost $1,910.
"The big shocker for us was the implicit value of human life compared with different commodities," said Dane Atkinson, chief executive of SumAll, the company that financed the foundation with 10 percent of company equity, or $500,000. "Life is cheaper than some bottles of wine."
On average today, a person is a slave for six years, after which the person usually escapes, repays the debts holding them, or dies. Most of the world's slaves are in South Asia.
The foundation obtained the data from a number of sources, including United Nations and World Bank reports, but also criminal filings and reports from human rights organizations and third-party accounts.
"Another big shocker for us was how poor the data quality is," said Mr. Atkinson. "We come from a corporate world, where reliability is within about 2 percent. There are lots of donations to fight slavery, but very little is done to make the cost clear to people. 
Fishing appears to be the most common occupation of child slaves - practiced this way in Cambodia, Ghana, Uganda, Indonesia, the Philippines and Peru. In Madagascar, children are enslaved to gather stones.
Seeking to shock people to gain attention, the SumAll Foundation put its data into a snappy-looking graphic that wouldn't at a superficial glance be out of place in a mail order catalog. 
"Looking for an extra pair of hands to get you through the winter months?" the copy reads. "You'll find a slave that is right for you at an eye-popping price."
While this may open the group to charges of sensationalism, Mr. Atkinson said it was an effort to make clear that the developed world is also a consumer of slave labor. "There is a lot of first-world spending geared toward slavery," he said. 
As to whether he'd bring up any connection with slavery to his own corporate customers, he said, "we're not brave enough to do that yet, but it's something we'd like to surface. We're talking to more sources so we can elevate some ugly numbers about how many consumer goods in the U.S. in some way touch slavery."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Ties in a Prospect for Deputy at the S.E.C.

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: As Mary Jo White confronts scrutiny over her ties to big Wall Street firms, a leading candidate to be her enforcement chief &#8212; Andrew J. Ceresney &#8212; has trod a similar path. 

 BODY:
Mary Jo White, who appears set to become a top Wall Street regulator, is seeking to allay skepticism about her spins through the revolving door between government service and private practice.
Yet even as she confronts concerns about her work for JPMorgan Chase in financial crisis cases and Morgan Stanley's board in vetting a chief executive, she is turning to a colleague who has trod a similar path.
Andrew J. Ceresney, who served as Ms. White's lieutenant as both a defense lawyer and as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, is a leading candidate to ultimately become her enforcement chief at the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people briefed on the matter. A Washington outsider and relative unknown beyond legal circles, Mr. Ceresney would help set the tone for policing financial fraud, effectively making him a top cop on Wall Street. 
 He could join as soon as spring, potentially serving as co-chief with the agency's acting head of enforcement, the people briefed on the matter said. 
But the job is not yet his. Ms. White, who is expected to sail through a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, must first confront questions about her ties to Wall Street. And Mr. Ceresney (pronounced Sir-rez-ney) could heighten such scrutiny.
At the S.E.C., Mr. Ceresney, 41, would have to police some of the same firms he spent a decade defending.
After working at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, he built a lucrative legal practice at Debevoise & Plimpton. At the firm, he represented the likes of Kenneth D. Lewis, former chief executive of Bank of America who faced regulatory investigations over the bank's hasty takeover of Merrill Lynch during the depths of the financial crisis.
Mr. Ceresney, who defended JPMorgan from federal inquiries into wrongful foreclosure practices, also worked side by side with clients under scrutiny for selling troubled mortgage securities at the height of the housing boom.
His career path mirrors that of Ms. White, who alternated between Debevoise and the federal government for three decades.
During stints as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn and later as the first woman to be United States attorney in Manhattan, she helped oversee the prosecution of the crime figure John Gotti and directed the case against those responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. She left in 2002 with the reputation as a tenacious prosecutor with an independent streak.
Since then, at Debevoise, she has represented nearly every big bank on Wall Street. Her clients included JPMorgan Chase, UBS and Michael Geoghegan, the former head of HSBC.
To avert potential conflicts stemming from her work on behalf of Wall Street giants, Ms. White had already agreed to recuse herself for one year from most matters involving former clients. Ms. White also vowed "as far as can be foreseen" never to return to Debevoise and plans to soon cut financial ties with the firm.
Some Senate Banking Committee members are not satisfied. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, has questioned whether Ms. White's pledge to avoid matters involving former clients would undercut her ability to run the agency. Mr. Ceresney would probably follow Ms. White's lead and recuse himself from certain cases, an important ethical move but also a potential hindrance to his authority.
The questions surrounding the revolving door illustrate how, even as Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney prepare to usher in a new era at the S.E.C., the agency is dogged by old concerns. While the agency has mounted cases against Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street giants, consumer advocates continue to complain that the enforcement unit remains too timid.
But there is another school of thought on the revolving door - that it actually bolsters prosecutorial instincts. Anyone fit to shine a light on the darkest corners of Wall Street, S.E.C. officials say, must navigate its ins and outs. The arguments echo claims that Franklin Delano Roosevelt picked the famed financier Joseph P. Kennedy as the first S.E.C. chairman because Kennedy "knew where the bodies were buried."
Mr. Ceresney could also breathe new life into the enforcement unit as it enters a critical phase.
Some enforcement officials, according to people briefed on the matter, are seeking a leadership overhaul after the recent departure of Robert Khuzami, who revamped the unit after it missed years of warning signs of the huge Ponzi scheme operated by Bernard L. Madoff.
"Coming out of Madoff, you needed a guy like Khuzami who was going to reform the place," said Thomas A. Sporkin, a senior S.E.C. enforcement official until last year when he departed for BuckleySandler. "This next person has to boost morale and broaden the agenda."
Mr. Ceresney, however, is unlikely to present a radical shift from his predecessor, given their similar résumés. Mr. Khuzami cut his teeth prosecuting terrorists for Ms. White when she was the United States attorney in Manhattan.
Mr. Ceresney's potential arrival also coincides with the tenure of another protégé of Ms. White, George Canellos, who became the S.E.C.'s interim enforcement chief last month. The pair, believed to be friends, are expected to overlap for a while, people briefed on the matter said.
Mr. Ceresney, a Yale Law School graduate who clerked for Judge Michael Mukasey, a former United States attorney general who is now a partner at Debevoise, would also inherit a deep bench of investigators. David P. Bergers, director of the S.E.C.'s Boston office who slid into the deputy role under Mr. Canellos, could continue as the enforcement unit's No. 2. Matthew T. Martens, the enforcement division's chief litigation counsel, and Daniel Hawke, who leads the market abuse unit, are also among the officials who have received consideration for more senior roles.
An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Debevoise.
The news about Mr. Ceresney comes as the American Bar Association's annual conference on white-collar crime gets under way. More than 1,000 criminal defense lawyers and government prosecutors from across the country have convened at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas for three days of symposiums and panels. Among the sessions is "The New Landscape of Insider Trading Cases," featuring Mr. Khuzami, the outgoing enforcement chief.
Colleagues say Mr. Ceresney, who lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two children, is a brilliant lawyer and note that, unlike Mr. Khuzami, he is not an imposing figure. One former colleague described him on Wednesday like this: "short in stature but long on brains."

HEADLINE: Amid Suffering, Animal Welfare Legislation Still Far Off in China

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Animals suffer. So what excuse is there for treating them badly? Is &#8220;culture&#8221; a reason? 

 BODY:
BEIJING - About animals, "The question is not, 'Can they reason?' nor, 'Can they talk?' but, 'Can they suffer?'" So wrote Jeremy Bentham, the English philosopher, more than 200 years ago.
It seems anomalous that China, the world's second-biggest economy, lacks animal welfare legislation (other places do too, though in Asia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines have been praised for their protection laws.) In the country that is a motor for regional and world economic activity and home to one-sixth of the world's population, growing numbers of activists are still waiting for protection laws amid enormous, routine animal suffering, they say.
In a new report by the online environmental magazine, , Peter Li, a politics professor in the United States and China policy expert at the Humane Society International, predicted such protection would come in China, though he's not holding his breath: "I know animal protection legislation will not be born in the near future," he said in an article titled, "Younger generation face long wait for law-change on animal cruelty." (Here it is in Chinese, too.) 
A proposed draft of China's first comprehensive animal welfare law, the China Animal Protection Law, was issued in September 2009, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. It has yet to become law, Xinhua said late last month. "In terms of law we haven't seen any progress since 2009," said Toby Zhang of Animals Asia, a China spokesman for the Hong Kong-based NGO. Nor is it tabled for discussion at the current meeting of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, he said, though some people lobbying at the event for more and quicker attention to the issue.
Meanwhile, the suffering goes on.
This article cited Liao Kan, a researcher at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, saying about 15 million animals are involved in scientific research in China each year.
"The poor treatment of animals has provoked public uproar in recent years, resulting in an increase in the number of organizations like NSAPA," the Nanchang Small Animals Protection Association, Xinhua wrote.
Mr. Zhang agreed. "There is a lot of pressure and calls for change among the people," he said, pointing to regular "animal rescues" staged by ordinary citizens, including a dog rescue in Chongqing early this month, he said. The rescued animals are generally headed for sale in markets and restaurants.
The situation is extreme. Here's an excerpt from a recent report by Animals Asia, "Friends... or Food?" on the dog trade in China. It makes for tough reading. You can download and read it here.
Dogs are raised on small farms of up to about 200 animals, says Animals Asia, the Hong Kong-based NGO with offices around the world. When they're ready for market they are jammed into cages for "a long road journey by truck which often lasts for several days, throughout which the animals have no free access to food or water, and only an occasional cursory hose down to prevent dehydration and death."
On arrival at the wholesale market, "The drivers climb the pyramid of cages, before hurling each one several meters to the ground, crushing limbs and paws and smashing faces of the terrified prisoners as the cages crash to the concrete.
"Using crude metal tongs which clamp the choking dogs and cats around the neck (or sometimes miss and stab into the soft palate), the traders then either hurl them into larger cages for weighing and onward sale, or offload them into pens. Once on solid ground the trembling animals urinate, defecate and literally fall on any available water bowls in the pens to quench a 3 day thirst, visibly relieved that the pain has stopped and hopeful that their nightmare is over.
However, "their relief is short-lived as customers walk by, chose their victim, and the tongs grip once again. The screaming animals are then bludgeoned in front of the other terrified dogs with a blow across the muzzle, using an instrument resembling a baseball bat.
"Tragically, the blow is not hard enough to render the poor animals unconscious for long. At this point they are howling pitifully in pain and confusion, with blood and mucus pouring from their nose and mouth - only to be bludgeoned again and again."
Why? There's a culinary reason.
"We're told the idea is that when the traders finally dispatch the dogs, they want the heart beating rapidly so that the blood will gush out swiftly, which is believed to enhance the flavour of the meat. [#x2028]In amongst all this carnage, the other dogs and cats are looking on, knowing that their turn is soon to be dragged out and slaughtered."
Why is it tolerated?
Animals Asia writes: "Cruelty to animals is not unique to Asia: animals all over the world are horrendously mistreated in factory farms, the fur trade, sport hunting or in animal testing.
"But rather than happening behind closed doors as it often does in the West, the cruelty in Asia is more open and therefore subject to greater scrutiny and judgment.
"Animal welfare is a relatively new concept in many places in Asia, and as a result it is vital that we ensure we work together with one voice to give the animals the best protection possible," the group wrote.
There are other reasons, rooted in politics, said Mr. Li, the China specialist at the Humane Society International.
"Compared with other interest groups in China, animal activists have received less attention from the government since they do not pose immediate threat to social or political stability," he said.
However, like all NGOs in China, their activities are viewed with suspicion and are monitored. The authorities "are not prepared to lift controls on the registration of animal protection NGOs," said Mr. Li.
The debate will rage on. Is "Asian culture" an excuse for allowing animals to suffer? Or, as Mr. Bentham said, is the only reason we need to treat animals better a recognition that they suffer, too?
In its report, Animals Asia quoted a Korean animal rights activist:
"Culture has often been used as an excuse to turn away from suffering and people in both Asia and the West often use cultural relativism to soothe their conscience for doing nothing," Sung Su Kim said.
"Surely we want to regard various practices in our history (such as slavery and cannibalism) as something to be rid of rather than treat them as 'culture' and demand respect accordingly."

HIGHLIGHT: Why aren&#8217;t we talking about what the public wants when it comes to Social Security and Medicare? 

 BODY:
The debate over reform of Social Security and Medicare is taking place in a vacuum, without adequate consideration of fundamental facts.
These facts include the following: Two-thirds of Americans who are over the age of 65 depend on an average annual Social Security benefit of $15,168.36 for at least half of their income.

Currently, earned income in excess of $113,700 is entirely exempt from the 6.2 percent payroll tax that funds Social Security benefits (employers pay a matching 6.2 percent). 5.2 percent of working Americans make more than $113,700 a year. Simply by eliminating the payroll tax earnings cap - and thus ending this regressive exemption for the top 5.2 percent of earners - would, according to the Congressional Budget Office, solve the financial crisis facing the Social Security system.
So why don't we talk about raising or eliminating the cap - a measure that has strong popular, though not elite, support? 
When asked by the National Academy of Social Insurance whether Social Security taxes for better-off Americans should be increased, 71 percent of Republicans and 97 percent of Democrats agreed. In a 2012 Gallup Poll, 62 percent of respondents thought upper-income Americans paid too little in taxes. 
Medicare, in turn, is financed by a flat 1.45 percent tax on the first $200,000 of earnings for a single person and $250,000 for a married couple, matched by the employer, after which it rises by a modest 0.9 percent on all income above the $200,000 and $250,000 levels.
The Medicare and Social Security taxes are jointly known as FICA (for Federal Insurance Contributions Act) - or payroll - taxes. The combined FICA taxes are highly regressive. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center found that the poorest quintile pays a 7.3 percent FICA rate, while the top quintile pays 6.8 percent. The top 1 percent of the income distribution pays a 2 percent rate, and the top 0.1 percent pays just 0.9 percent. In other words, the rate paid by the poorest quintile is 8.1 times as high as the rate paid by the top 0.1 percent. The regressive character of the payroll tax, compared to the progressive structure of most other federal taxes, is clear in the accompanying chart (Fig. 1), from the Tax Policy Center:
In the case of Social Security, proposals to raise the age of eligibility for full benefits amount to a benefit cut of 6 to 7 percent for every year that eligibility was increased. "The reduction in monthly benefits for some beneficiaries would lower average income and increase poverty rates in the future among the elderly," according to the Congressional Budget Office. If the retirement age were raised to 70, and if the early retirement age was kept at 62, the C.B.O. found that the penalty for those taking early retirement would increase: "people who claimed at 62 would receive only 55 percent of their primary insurance amount, compared with the 70 percent they would receive under current law."
As 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day, 72 percent of them are currently without the protection of a defined benefit pension plan, which leaves growing numbers dependent on inadequately funded 401(k) and other voluntary (defined contribution) plans to keep their heads above water.
At the same time, life expectancy has been extended to unprecedented lengths:
A man reaching age 65 today can expect to live, on average, until age 83. A woman turning age 65 today can expect to live, on average, until age 85. And those are just averages. About one out of every four 65-year-olds today will live past age 90, and one out of 10 will live past age 95.
In a 2012 report, the Government Accountability Office found that 
older workers' unemployment overall and long-term unemployment rates have increased dramatically since the recession began in 2007. In December 2011, the unemployment rate for older workers was 6.0 percent, up from 3.1 at the start of the recession, but down from its peak of 7.6 percent in February 2010. In particular, long-term unemployment rose substantially, and at a greater rate for older than younger workers. By 2011, 55 percent of unemployed older workers had been actively seeking a job for more than half a year (27 weeks or more).
In addition, the G.A.O. found that "long-term unemployment can put older workers at risk of deferring needed medical are, losing their homes, and accumulating debt." In a survey of workers, the G.A.O. identified "out-of-date skills, discouragement and depression, and inexperience with online applications as reemployment barriers for older workers."
And of course the elderly will be saddled with increased expenditures for medical care and other necessary services as they age.
Cutting benefits is frequently discussed in the halls of Congress, in research institutes and by analysts and columnists. The idea of subjecting earned income over $113,000 to the Social Security payroll tax and making the Medicare tax more progressive - steps that would affect only the relatively affluent - is largely missing from the policy conversation.
The Washington cognoscenti are more inclined to discuss two main approachesthat are far less costly for the affluent: means-testing of benefits and raising the age of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare. (Sidenote: policy makers and national journalists who weigh in on this issue generally earn more than $113,700 a year.) Means-testing and raising the age of eligibility as methods of cutting spending appeal to ideological conservatives for a number of reasons.
First, insofar as benefits for the affluent are reduced or eliminated under means-testing, social insurance programs are no longer universal and are seen, instead, as a form of welfare. Public support would almost certainly decline, encouraging further cuts in the future.
Second, the focus on means-testing and raising the age of eligibility diverts attention from a much simpler and more equitable approach: raising the payroll tax to apply to the earnings of the well-to-do, a step strongly opposed by the ideological right.
Third, and most important in terms of the policy debate, while both means-testing and eliminating the $113,700 cap on earnings subject to the payroll tax hurt the affluent, the latter would inflict twice as much pain.
The C.B.O. estimates that elimination of the payroll earnings cap would cost the well-to-do the equivalent of 0.6 percent of Gross Domestic Product, while substantially reducing Social Security payments to the top third of the income distribution, through means testing, would only cost those better off recipients the equivalent of 0.1 percent of G.D.P.
Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard and an authority on the history of the American welfare state, contended in a phone interview that policy elites avoid addressing the sharply regressive nature of social welfare taxes because, "at one level, it's very, very privileged people wanting to make sure they cut spending on everybody else" while "holding down their own taxes."
Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, agrees that elite proponents of cutting benefits for the elderly have a narrow view based on their own high incomes and comfortable lives: "The median voter has a much more well-rounded sense of the risks associated through everyday life than the elite," he said in an interview.
In the rarefied community that sets many of the terms of national policy making, a recurring theme is the notion that the federal government is subsidizing the "good life" of the nation's elderly at the expense of needed investments in young people, in infrastructure and in innovation.
Writing in The Times, Yuval Levin, the editor of the National Interest and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, argued on Feb. 19 that both Democrats and Republicans
should agree at least to spend less money on the wealthy - via means-testing. It may surprise some Americans to learn that the United States spends quite a lot on the affluent, especially through the entitlement programs at the heart of the budget fight: Social Security and Medicare. Both programs move money from relatively poorer young people to relatively richer old people, and they are growing ever more expensive. Means-testing - allocating benefits according to need - might offer both sides a way out.
Not to be outdone, the Heritage Foundation, bastion of the Republican right, has called for the imposition of tough means-testing on both Social Security and Medicare. The plan would cut benefits in half for a single person when income exceeds $82,000, and eliminate benefits altogether for those making more than $110,000. Benefits for married couples would be cut in half when their combined income reaches $137,000 and are eliminated altogether when income reaches $165,000.
"At the end the day," write the authors of Heritage's "Saving the American Dream," 
our plan, while economic in nature, has a higher moral purpose. If entitlements are not reformed, the next generation and future ones will have to pay punitive tax rates that will end liberty as we have known it. Our proposal aims to preserve America's promise bequeathed to us by past generations.
Contrary to the claims Heritage is making, current levels of federal taxation are at historically low levels, and the increases needed to finance restoration of the Social Security trust fund will not break the bank.
Federal tax revenues in 2009, 2010 and 2011 have been 15.1 percent, 15.1 percent and 15.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product, lower than any level since 1950.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the amount of new revenue required to bring the Social Security trust fund into balance over the next 75 years would amount to 0.6 percent of G.D.P.
The same C.B.O. document presents a series of alternative ways to achieve such a goal, including the elimination of the current $113,700 cap on income subject to the Social Security payroll tax. If the cap or ceiling were lifted, the amount of money raised would be 0.6 percent of G.D.P., the exact amount of income needed to get Social Security out of the red - a striking coincidence.
This approach has substantial public support, which is reflected in the finding in the extensive NASI survey that "a sharp contrast between what Americans say they want and changes being discussed in Washington." The report goes on:
Large majorities of Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, agree on ways to strengthen Social Security - without cutting benefits. Fully 74% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats agree that "it is critical to preserve Social Security even if it means increasing Social Security taxes paid by working Americans."
The question in the NASI survey reads as follows:
Workers currently pay 6.2% of their earnings to Social Security, matched by the employer. One proposal would very gradually raise the Social Security tax rate over the next 20 years. Example: For a worker earning $50,000, gradually raising the tax rate by 1/20th of 1% per year for 20 years would mean, each year, paying about 50 cents more per week, matched by the employer. This change would close 53% of Social Security's financing gap. Do you favor or oppose this change?
Sixty-nine percent of respondents favored the proposal, including 65 percent of Republicans; 11 percent opposed; and 21 percent had no opinion.
A Kaiser Family Foundation poll (see Figs. 2and 3) found strong opposition to reductions in Medicare and Social Security benefits and strong support for taxing the rich.
In fact, let's go back and look at the dependence of retirees on Social Security. Fig. 4 illustrates data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute which shows the dependence on Social Security in 2010 for those over the age of 65 by quintile. For the first and second quintiles - the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution - Social Security provides nearly 90 percent of total household income. For those in the middle quintile, Social Security accounts for over 75 percent of total income.
On Nov. 12, 2012, the trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds issued a report concerning Social Security:
After 2020, Treasury will redeem trust fund assets in amounts that exceed interest earnings until exhaustion of trust fund reserves in 2033, three years earlier than projected last year. Thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2086.
The trustees estimate in the same report that the Medicare trust fund will reach "exhaustion" even sooner: 2024.
My conversations with a range of academics and policy analysts revealed very little consensus over strategies to deal with the fiscal crises facing the two major entitlement programs. Thoughtful scholars like Timothy Smeeding, a professor of public policy at the University of Wisconsin, Madison; the economist Jonathan Gruber of M.I.T.; and Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, contend that my own favorite solution, eliminating the cap on income subject to Social Security taxes, goes too far, and that that ceiling should, instead, be raised to somewhere between $150,000 to $215,000.
Robert Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a current trustee of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, said he could see the advantage of raising the age of Social Security eligibility to encourage more labor force participation as long as federal policies lessened the cost to employers of hiring older workers. He cautioned that such a step should include protection of benefits for low-income workers forced by hardship to take early retirement.
James Wetzler, former chief economist on Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation and a former New York State tax commissioner, warned that increasing tax burdens on the affluent, while reducing or eliminating their retirement benefits, poses the danger of "creating a class of influential people - relatively high earners - with a vested interest in eliminating the program."
Elite anxiety over entitlement-driven budget deficits and accumulating national debt has created a powerful class in the nation's capital. The agenda of this class is in many respects on a collision course with mounting demands for action by those lower down the ladder to address the threat to government social insurance programs. Intransigent opposition by the better off and their representatives to raising the necessary revenue means that not only Social Security and Medicare face a budgetary ax.
Among the additional likely casualties: WIC, which provides free nutrition for women, infants and children; long-term and emergency unemployment compensation benefits; low-income housing vouchers; vaccines for poor children; schooling for children with disabilities; special education; preschool programs; child care for disadvantaged and vulnerable children; after-school programs; treatment of the mentally ill; and meals for sick and homebound seniors.
This conflict could not have come at a more difficult time: the United States is in the midst of a zero sum struggle requiring politicians to pick losers, not winners. The population of those over 65 is set to multiply, with longevity steadily increasing even as median annual household income for the population at large has shrunk to $51,584 in January 2013 from $54,000 in 2008.
In this kind of conflict over limited goods, one of the most valuable resources that can get lost in the fray is the wisdom of the electorate at large. In this case, the electorate is pointing toward progressive tax increases for those closer to the top far more readily than members of the political class, for whom high-earners are a crucial source of campaign contributions.
The very nature of the basic security Americans are entitled to is at stake.

HEADLINE: Time Warner Ends Talks With Meredith and Will Spin Off Time Inc. Into Separate Company

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: The primary sticking point between the two companies was the fate of several titles, including Time and Sports Illustrated, which Time Warner wanted to shed but which Meredith was not eager to acquire. 

 BODY:
 9:14 p.m. | Updated What do you do with a group of celebrated magazines that no one seems to want?
Time Warner found its answer on Wednesday. It announced it would spin off its Time Inc. magazine unit into a separate, publicly traded company, a move that will allow the media conglomerate to focus entirely on its cable television and film businesses.
The announcement came hours after Time Warner and Meredith Corporation ended negotiations on a proposal that would have joined in a separate company many Time Inc. titles with magazines published by Meredith. 
Laura Lang, the chief executive of Time Inc. who started the job just over a year ago, said she would depart once the spinoff of the magazine division was complete.
The deal with Meredith fell apart in part because of Time Warner's concern over the fate of four of Time Inc.'s famous but struggling magazines - Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations who could not publicly discuss private conversations. At one point Meredith expressed some interest in the news and sports magazines, but Meredith decided not to pursue them because such a deal would have diluted its controlling family's shares in the new company, another person with knowledge of the negotiations said. If Time Warner retained those four titles, the economics of a full spinoff proved more appealing, this person said.
Time Inc. is the nation's largest magazine publisher, and the revelation last month that it was in talks to sell off many of its titles was viewed as another clear sign that the industry was buckling under intense financial pressures. The breakdown in talks threw into sharp relief how once-glamorous magazines like Time and Sports Illustrated have become troubled assets, with Time Warner wanting to shed them and Meredith not wanting them.
Time Inc., suffering from industrywide declines, has consistently lagged in Time Warner's quarterly earnings. In the three months that ended Dec. 31, revenue at Time Inc. fell 7 percent to $967 million. In the same period, revenue at the company's cable television channels, including TNT, TBS and HBO, grew 5 percent to $3.67 billion.
In a statement late Wednesday, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, said a complete spinoff would provide clarity for the company as it concentrated on its high-growth businesses, primarily in cable television.
"After a thorough review of options, we believe that a separation will better position both Time Warner and Time Inc.," Mr. Bewkes said. "Time Inc. will also benefit from the flexibility and focus of being a stand-alone company," he added.
Meredith's prevailing interest in a deal had been to put together what would have essentially been a women's magazine publisher. The new entity would have combined its National Media Group, which includes stalwarts like Ladies' Home Journal and Better Homes and Gardens, with Time Inc.'s Lifestyle and Style & Entertainment brands, which include People and InStyle.
Meredith executives had wavered in their interest in Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated, the people with knowledge of the negotiations said. Time Warner originally planned to keep them, citing news-gathering synergies with the company's CNN channel, but that thinking changed. Time Warner executives walked away from the deal, believing they would be better off spinning off all of Time Inc.'s magazines without Meredith.
"We respect Time Warner's decision and certainly remain open to continuing a dialogue on how our companies might work together," said Stephen M. Lacy, Meredith's chairman and chief executive.
The new company would have borrowed money to pay a one-time dividend of around $1.75 billion back to Time Warner.
Another sticking point in the negotiations was over which company would have ownership of Time Inc.'s London-based property, IPC Media, which publishes a mix of general-interest and upmarket titles like InStyle, Country Life and Decanter. IPC also includes an advertising business and a news trade and sales distribution company called Marketforce.
Founded by Edwin Thomas Meredith in 1902 with the publication of Successful Farming magazine, Meredith, based in Des Moines, Iowa, has always been a folksy, domestic company with strong Midwestern roots. Acquiring Time Inc.'s international business would have made for an odd pairing.
Time Inc. would be only the latest asset Time Warner has shed as it has evolved into a cable television and movie production company. Once a corporate giant, in recent years Time Warner has divested itself of AOL, Time Warner Cable, the Warner Music Group and the Time Warner Book Group.
Publishing divisions have been financial drags on other media companies as well. This summer, News Corporation is expected to complete a split of its publishing assets, including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and HarperCollins, into a separate, publicly traded company. The cable channels FX and Fox News and the 20th Century studios will remain in a company called Fox Group.
Ms. Lang, the former chief executive of Digitas, a digital advertising firm, took over at Time Inc. at a tumultuous time. The company had a nine-month leadership vacuum after the departure of its previous chief executive, Jack Griffin, a former Meredith executive who clashed with the culture of Time Inc.
Shortly after she was hired Ms. Lang brought on Bain & Company, a Boston consulting firm, to help her turn the company around. She moved quickly to strike a deal that made all of its magazines available via Apple's newsstand. But her efforts were not enough to stem the industrywide declines in subscription and advertising revenue.
Revenue at Time Inc. has declined by around 30 percent over the past five years. Last month, Time Inc. said it would lay off 6 percent of its 8,000 employees, which will cost Time Warner $60 million in restructuring.
 Christine Haughney and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting. 
An earlier version of this article misstated the name of Meredith's founder. He was Edwin Thomas Meredith, not Edwin Thomas.
An article on Thursday about Time Warner's decision to spin off its magazines into a separate publicly owned company misstated, in some copies, the surname of a former Time Inc. chief executive. He is Jack Griffin, not Griffith. And a picture caption with the article misstated the middle initial, in some copies, of the chairman and chief executive of Time Warner. As the article correctly noted, he is Jeffrey L. Bewkes, not Jeffrey K.

HEADLINE: Young Poets Society

BYLINE: MEGHAN O'ROURKE


HIGHLIGHT: Each year, the Lilly fellowships offer five young poets prestige, publicity and &#8212; most elusive of all &#8212; money. The latest crop of winners represents how important, and how controversial, these awards have become. 

 BODY:
 Each year, the Lilly fellowships offer five young poets prestige, publicity and - most elusive of all - money. The latest crop of winners represents how important, and how controversial, these awards have become. 
There are a lot of things poets have to worry about these days, but selling out isn't one of them. Poetry is so marginal (at least economically) that there's probably more money in needlepoint, thanks to Etsy. A poet's working life is one of scrapping and scraping to get by, while scavenging free moments in the day to inscribe a tiny number of words onto the page. Grants like the Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowship - $15,000 handed out by the Poetry Foundation to five emerging talents every year - are among the prestigious ways that poets can be rewarded for their work, and encouraged to make more of it. 
The announcement of the most recent Lilly fellowships caused a small uproar on the Internet because all five winners were men. It didn't help that the foundation is a controversial institution in the world of poetry - a well-financed behemoth whose president has complained that today's poetry isn't "entertaining" enough, urging poets to engage with a general audience, quit teaching and take up a life like Hemingway's - full of marlin fishing and such. The foundation was created in 2003 after Ruth Lilly, the reclusive and eccentric heir to the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical fortune, shocked the literary world by donating nearly $200 million to Poetry magazine, which had once been an avant-garde journal famous for championing modernist poets like T. S. Eliot. The newly flush foundation was meant not only to revitalize the magazine, which had grown stuffier over the years, but also to drum up a broader audience for poetry in America. Yet critics argue that the foundation, led by an investment banker and poet named John Barr, hasn't spent its money wisely or aggressively enough. Among its most visible projects to date are a Web site that draws some 12 million unique visitors a year; a high-school recitation program; a redesign for Poetry magazine; and, most contentiously, an eyebrow-raising $21.5 million headquarters in Chicago. Barr is leaving the Poetry Foundation in July and will be replaced by the respected poet and critic Robert Polito, who currently directs the writing program at the New School; his appointment may be a sign that the foundation has heard its critics' voices.
Unlike the foundation's other projects, the Lilly fellowships directly support poets. (The fellowships actually predate the larger gift - they were established by Lilly and Poetry in 1989.) While one may wish that the XX chromosome had been represented in this year's crop of winners, it's not hard to see why the editors at Poetry chose them. Though stylistically diverse, each poet here has an assured, distinctive voice. Their poems are musical, socially engaged, in one case a little mythic; in another case, rueful about America's racial struggles; in a third, wry about making a choice between the power of street violence and the thrill of writing. They deal frontally with crime and race, with the chaotic hardships of the underclass and the rich pockets of nonwhite culture in America. These are not avant-garde poems; they aren't elliptical or faddishly whimsical. They evince a love for language analogous to a designer's love for pattern and texture; the best poems shimmer on the page, and also push against our assumptions about what kind of language is "poetic language." Which is to say that they manage to be beautiful while also using what Wordsworth called "the real language of men." Make that "people." 
An article on Page 66 this weekend about five young men who won the Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowship describes the group incorrectly. Though no women are included, it is not the case that the X chromosome is not "represented in this year's crop of winners." All five men, of course, have an X chromosome paired with a Y. (The women have neither a Y nor a fellowship - just X X.)

HEADLINE: Cautious Mood as Stocks Rise

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Dow&#8217;s nominal high prompted few cheers on Wall Street. | Will the rally lead to more deals? | As Wall Street titans battle over Herbalife, there can be a tendency to forget the fundamentals. | Gary Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission says he plans to stay in the Obama administration through at least December. 

 BODY:
The nominal high that the Dow Jones industrial average reached on Tuesday prompted few cheers on Wall Street, in contrast to the recoveries of years past. Even as the gain capped nearly five and a half years of progress since the depths of the financial crisis, there were questions about whether the forces that fueled the rally - in large part, the Federal Reserve's stimulus and strong corporate profits - would be enough to keep it going, Peter Eavis writes in The New York Times. James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, cautioned that "prudent investors would be well served to tread carefully and look for improving economic evidence to support any moves to higher levels."
 Will the rally lead to more deals? Recent weeks have shown that deal makers are not deterred by a surging market, even amid concerns that some valuations may be getting particularly lofty, as The New York Times's James B. Stewart recently noted. For now, market experts say stocks have room to go higher, especially as the Fed plans to continue its efforts to stimulate the economy. "The Fed and other central banks have been driving the market, and there's no sign that's going to stop," Byron Wien of the Blackstone Group told Jeff Sommer of The New York Times. 
While many note that the broader economy is still struggling, some are arguing that the strength of the corporate sector provides a solid foundation for a rally. "I think 2013 is a year where those who've been really skeptical of this market have to rethink their arguments," said Thomas Lee, the chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase. "It's been a pretty healthy rally."
Still, not all companies in the Dow are seeing the benefit of rising stock values, Nathaniel Popper writes in The New York Times. Bank of America, for instance, is today worth half of what it was five years ago, as it continues to work through the legacy of the housing collapse and the financial crisis.
MISSING THE POINT ON HERBALIFE | The battle among Wall Street investors over Herbalife amounts to a reverse of the famous "Godfather" line, Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column: it's not business, it's personal. Accordingly, the talk surrounding the nutritional supplements company is focusing not on the health of the company itself but on the arguments made by the prominent hedge fund managers in what resembles a junior high school feud.
"No one appears to be doing an actual investigation or asking the right questions. The central issue, in case you need reminding, is whether Herbalife is a pyramid scheme," as the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman claims, Mr. Davidoff writes. "This is important, as not just billions are at stake, but an entire company and the tens of thousands of people who are affiliated with it."
ON THE AGENDA | Data on factory orders in January is out at 10 a.m. The Federal Reserve releases its "beige book" about the economy at 2 p.m. At noon, Walt Disney has its annual meeting. Mervyn A. King, the governor of the Bank of England, and Andrew Bailey, the central bank official who will lead a new British regulator, are questioned by a parliamentary committee. A House Financial Services subcommittee holds a hearing on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at 10 a.m. Leon G. Cooperman of Omega Advisors is on CNBC at 7 a.m. Ralph L. Schlosstein, chief executive of Evercore Partners, is on Bloomberg TV at 4 p.m.
GENSLER IS EXPECTED TO STAY | Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is telling officials that he plans to stay in the Obama administration through at least December, even as he considers other options, DealBook's Ben Protess reports. The White House approached Mr. Gensler in January about serving a second term at the agency, and while he has yet to commit, he has no deadline and is considering staying, Mr. Protess says, citing three people briefed on the matter.
"But another corner of the Obama administration could draw him away from the trading commission, a once sleepy agency that he overhauled after the financial crisis. Mr. Gensler, the people briefed on the matter said, has discussed other senior financial roles with the White House. The jobs could include deputy Treasury secretary and head of the Commerce Department. Two of the people said Mr. Gensler was once interested in running the Securities and Exchange Commission, though President Obama recently nominated Mary Jo White for that job."
Mr. Gensler maintains that his task at his current agency is not complete. "It's an incredible privilege and there's still a lot of work to be done here at the C.F.T.C.," he said in an interview.

HEADLINE: The Sequester App

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins try to balance the budget since Washington can&#8217;t be bothered. 

 BODY:
 Gail Collins: David, I've been pretty calm about all the fiscal-cliff crises, but now I'm really getting ticked off. I hate this sequester thing.
 David Brooks: I've been admiring your steady nerves during all this. You've been like Obi-Wan Kenobi staring down Darth Vader. I've been more jittery, like Woody Allen on a first date, with Harry Reid in the role of Mariel Hemingway.
 Gail: Wow, it may take me awhile to get past that image.
But we're talking sequester. You know what makes me angriest? All these cliffs make government more inefficient and wasteful. The people who run the various federal agencies are spending all their time figuring out contingencies for the next crisis - how they can spend 1 percent less next month, but then maybe 1 percent more or 2 percent less the month after that. They can't plan for anything else. 
 David: That's nothing. To me, there are two big problems. The first is that a huge chunk of the cuts go to discretionary programs that make up a sliver of the budget, while almost none of the cuts come out of Medicare. As if we needed another piece of legislation that transfers even more wealth from the young to the old.
Plus, I'm a conservative, so I believe in deliberation. The sequester outlaws deliberation, and yet somehow people who call themselves conservative are embracing it. 
 Gail: In theory, the folks who rail about government waste should be the most worried about this, but many of them couldn't care less. They don't want government programs to be good. They just want to make them go away.
 David: My message to Republicans: Never talk about domestic discretionary programs. They're not driving the deficit, and cutting them only makes Republicans look like corporate greedheads. Focus on entitlements.
 Gail: Who do you want to blame for this mess? As our fellow columnist Bill Keller argued the other day, President Obama would be in a much stronger position politically if he'd used the election campaign to highlight the specifics in his own deficit-cutting plan beyond tax hikes for the rich. But Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine and The Washington Post's Ezra Klein have been making the case that Republicans simply don't want to make a deal. If the president agrees to their demands, they just change the terms.
 David: I do agree that only the president can really frame the debate, and he ran a small-bore campaign and so does not have the mandate to send the country off on a different course. I also don't understand the long term Democratic project. After you run out of rich people to tax, which may have already happened, where are you going to get the money to support the programs you like? Milton Friedman once fantasized that government would become a check-writing machine. It would just write the checks and give up on making social policy. Democrats are bringing Friedman's fantasy to fruition.
 Gail: I would argue that we have a long, long way to go before there's any danger of taxing the rich out of their richness.
But this blame thing is pretty wearying. Do you think it'd be possible to dump it all on Windows 8? I really hate Windows 8.
 David: I feel sorry for each successive Windows system. On the other hand I really love the Taxi app Uber. You can order a car on your phone and watch on the map as it comes to your house. I can't tell you how happy this makes me.
 Gail: Do you think they could do a sequester app? You could see the cuts invading your neighborhood - there go five teachers, here comes the line at the local airport security, stretching into the parking lot. It could have a little feature that makes your phone vibrate when somebody gets a furlough notice within 10 blocks of your current location.
But about the current crisis: Let's work out a grand bargain. I always enjoy doing that with you. I'll go first and say that the goal should be half tax revenue and half spending cuts.
 David: You've lost me already. International experience suggests a 3 to 1 cuts-to-revenue ratio produces the most debt reduction. That's why Obama embraced the 2.5 to 3 to 1 ratio last term. My plan is simple. I propose a progressive consumption tax, a lower corporate tax, means-testing of Medicare and chain CPI to reduce Social Security. Easy as pie.
 Gail: During our extremely civilized negotiations, I suspect I will be prepared to meet you at two-ish to one.
As far as Social Security goes, I don't believe it's an imminent problem, and I'd rather leave it alone. But in the spirit of this enterprise, I'll give you a Social Security cut. You can have that change in the consumer price index. It'll reduce the increase in payouts over the long run and save a lot of money. But in return, I'd want to fiddle with the basic formula so we can protect the recipients who have no other income.
 David: You've got a deal.
 Gail: If only we ran the world. What about Medicare?
 David: I hear some people say that health care inflation is in permanent decline and that will solve a lot of our problems. Other experts vehemently disagree, saying that if you look at the history of health care costs, there are always these pauses before costs shoot up again. I suspect that will be true as long as there's fee-for-service and the incentives are what they are.
 Gail: We could do a whole lot more to reform the system if the Republicans would stop yelling "death panels!" every time the president tries to control costs. But moving on - I'll let you reduce Medicare benefits for the wealthier recipients if you'll allow all government health care programs to limit the prices they pay for prescription drugs, the way other countries do.
 David: I reserve the right to back out on that if I think it will hurt innovation. The rest of the world piggybacks on our research, but we should still keep doing it.
 Gail: Maybe we could compromise by letting Medicare refuse to pay for expensive drugs when there's a less costly alternative that works just as well. 
And of course, as part of our bargain, we'll ditch the sequester. Stupid sequester.
 David: At least it will allow us to find out what's on the other side of the reductio ad absurdum. Once you've done the stupidest possible thing, how do you do something even dumber? It forces us to be creative.
 Gail: Like a law requiring the population to give up wearing socks if the deficit isn't cut in half by 2020? Can't wait to see what son of sequester looks like.
Meanwhile, in the real world at the end of the month there's another cliff. It looks as if Congress is going to kick the can down the road with a continuing resolution - which just means agreeing to keep doing whatever we've been doing for a little while longer, even though nobody really likes it.
 David: But that's what 90 percent of government policy is all about.
 Gail: You know, I really miss sex scandals. They're generally colorful. They almost never mean anything over the long run. And while they're going on, the people who actually keep the government running are let alone to go about their business. Good old sex scandals.
 David: I am definitely hoping Mark Sanford wins his House race, which I call the Gail Collins Full Employment Act.

HEADLINE: Japan's New Leader Dares to Challenge Old Order in Bid to Energize Economy

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TAHARA, Japan -- Just two months into office, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is showing an increasing willingness to take on some pillars of Japan's establishment -- the central bank and the country's politically influential farmers -- in an aggressive attempt to finally breathe some new life into Japan's listless economy.
Mr. Abe has already forced the departure of the cautious head of the central Bank of Japan and nominated a replacement who vowed Monday to do ''whatever it takes'' to fight crippling deflation that has eroded profits and wages and stifled spending. Mr. Abe is also expected to announce soon that his nation will join negotiations on an American-led Pacific free-trade pact that the Obama administration hopes will offset China's growing economic and political might, but that could also force Japan to make painful, market-opening changes it has resisted for nearly two decades.
Joining the pact risks alienating farmers, longtime staunch supporters of Mr. Abe's conservative Liberal Democratic Party, who would face more intense competition from cheaper imports. 
But the broader public appears more willing to embrace drastic economic measures at a time when Japan, the region's waning economic superpower, feels threatened by China, helping push Mr. Abe's approval ratings to around 70 percent in recent polls. That is a vast improvement from his disastrous first term in office six years ago, and from concerns that his hawkish views might alienate him once again from voters.
''The future of Japan's economic growth depends on us having the willpower and the courage to sail without hesitation onto the rough seas of global competition,'' Mr. Abe declared in a speech to Parliament last Thursday.
Critics warn that his stimulus measures, including a new wave of public works projects, could increase Japan's already crushing public debt, or set off a currency war as the prospect of drastic easing by the central bank has caused the yen's value to plummet.
They also worry that Mr. Abe's effort to combat deflation could include radical steps that they warn could disturb global financial markets by unleashing a flood of Japanese money into developing economies, causing dangerous, speculative bubbles.
The many economists who support Mr. Abe's plans, however, have a different warning: that any economic benefits could prove short-lived unless they are accompanied by a longer-term growth strategy.
The trade pact, they say, will be a good litmus test of Mr. Abe's willingness to force such deeper structural changes in Japan. It could also force the country to face a long-debated and difficult decision: whether it is willing to trade some of the egalitarianism it takes such pride in to embrace a freer form of capitalism that could break the grip of vested interests and reverse a long decline.
''The T.P.P. is a battle over what kind of country we want Japan to be,'' said Hisaharu Ito, a top official in Aichi Prefecture's Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, referring to the trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. His organization represents some 10,000 full-time farmers who fiercely oppose the trade group.
He added, ''Do we want to turn into a harsh society of winners and losers, or remain a gentler society where benefits are shared?''
Japan's joining the trade group could have an added advantage for the United States, possibly opening some of Japan's still impenetrable markets to American products.
Here in Tahara, a city in central Aichi, where rice paddies and cabbage fields run up against a Lexus plant, Shigeaki Okamoto is the rare voice in the farming community pushing for change. He says Japanese farmers could compete without the tariffs they have been sheltered behind if they were allowed to become entrepreneurial.
Mr. Okamoto tried to export rice to China, only to be told that a company controlled by a farm co-op has a monopoly on sales to that country. He says such restrictions are typical of government bureaucrats and farming co-op officials who have tried to block him every step of the way with arbitrary regulations and even attempts to ostracize him from others farmers.
''Japan is wrapped in an invisible web that prevents you from showing any sort of initiative,'' said Mr. Okamoto, 51.
Mr. Abe's promises of economic revival have already created a budding optimism in urban areas like Tokyo, where the stock market has rallied and restaurants seem more crowded than they were during years in which many people resigned themselves to Japan's fading prospects. The new, if fragile, hopefulness has been boosted by rising corporate profits, as a weakening yen has brought desperately needed relief to badly shaken electronics corporations and other exporters struggling to compete with Chinese and Korean rivals.
The yen has dropped 20 percent in recent months, on the strength of Mr. Abe's promises to rethink Japan's priorities.
While the new prime minister is off to a strong start, political analysts said it was too early to tell if he will be the rare decisive Japanese leader who can make a real impact, like his mentor, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, whose liberalizing policies Mr. Abe is apparently seeking to continue.
Economists say the jury is still out on whether Mr. Abe's measures, popularly called Abenomics, will be drastic enough to restore growth to a $5.9 trillion economy that in yen has shrunken back to the same size it was in the early 1990s and caused the country to slip behind China on the list of the world's largest economies. (The current ranking is the United States first, followed by China and Japan.)
Mr. Abe started his push for changes at the Bank of Japan less than a month after taking office in December, pressing its leaders to set a target of causing rising prices, or inflation, at a rate of 2 percent per year. When the bank failed to follow quickly with bold measures to accomplish that goal, Mr. Abe's Liberal Democrats threatened to rewrite the law to make the bank more obedient.
That was enough to drive the incumbent central bank governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, who has long been criticized for inaction, to announce that he would step down three weeks earlier than planned. On Thursday, Mr. Abe nominated his replacement, Haruhiko Kuroda, an Oxford-trained former Finance Ministry official.
Even Mr. Abe's own economic advisers say it is unclear what Mr. Kuroda will do, and point out that he is more cautious than other people whose names were floated as possible replacements for Mr. Shirakawa. Still, at parliamentary hearings on his nomination on Monday, Mr. Kuroda pledged to do ''whatever it takes to escape from deflation,'' without giving specifics.
Mr. Abe's advisers say they expect Mr. Kuroda to at least catch up with the more aggressive increase of the money supply adopted by the United States' Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, since the 2008 financial crisis.
One adviser, Nobuyuki Nakahara, a former member of the Japanese bank's governing Policy Board, said Mr. Kuroda's most likely first steps would be to sharply increase purchases of corporate bonds and real-estate-linked securities.
Mr. Nakahara and others call it ironic that the Bank of Japan has fallen behind the Fed, given that the Japanese central bank a decade ago pioneered Mr. Bernanke's current strategy of flooding the economy with money, known as quantitative easing.
There have been calls for the Japanese bank to once again break new ground by taking more unprecedented steps, like buying foreign bonds or unlimited numbers of newly issued Japanese treasuries, which would essentially hand a blank check to the Japanese government.
Many Japanese voters seem to agree that bolder steps are needed as anxiety grows over Japan's geopolitical standing versus China's.
''People here realize that economic revival is tied to Japan's security,'' said Robert Feldman, an economist in Tokyo at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.

HEADLINE: Runoff Set in Race for Los Angeles Mayor

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- After finishing first and second in Tuesday's nonpartisan mayoral primary, City Councilman Eric Garcetti and City Controller Wendy Greuel will face each other in a May 21 runoff to take over a city that faces a $216 million budget gap and rising pension costs that could cripple municipal finances.
Judging by the dismal turnout in the primary, with only 18 percent of registered voters going to the polls, Ms. Greuel and Mr. Garcetti may face an uphill battle to engage the roughly four million residents in the nation's second-largest city. 
Mr. Garcetti received 33 percent of the vote, with much of his support centered in his Hollywood City Council district, while Ms. Greuel received 29 percent and did particularly well in the San Fernando Valley, which she used to represent on the Council.
Much of the primary campaign focused on the candidates' personal stories. Ms. Greuel, a former city councilwoman, has emphasized that she would be the first woman elected mayor, while Mr. Garcetti, the son of former District Attorney Gil Garcetti, has played up his family's Mexican heritage. If elected, he would also become the first Jewish mayor of the city.
The two are now likely to turn their attention to courting supporters of Kevin James, a Republican who came in third in Tuesday's elections, and Jan Perry, an African-American city councilwoman who received 15.9 percent of the vote, just behind Mr. James.
''There weren't candidates running who could draw from traditional bases, and in L.A. that really matters,'' said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles. ''They're going to need to reach out to African-Americans and white liberals on the West Side, which are two big groups up for grabs. They are relatively unknown players on the big stage and really need to build coalitions to win.''
Both Democrats, Mr. Garcetti, 42, and Ms. Greuel, 51, agree on a wide range of issues and could struggle to differentiate themselves in a general election. Both have tried to position themselves as the best person to bring together business and labor interests in negotiating contracts and budget deals, as well as improve the city's economy.
After voters rejected a ballot measure to increase the city's sales tax to 9.5 percent, city officials said Wednesday that they were considering new ways to further cut the city budget, which could include reducing the size of the police department or paring back street repairs.
The role of public employee unions is likely to be a key issue in the runoff.
Ms. Greuel came under repeated attack from opponents for the support she has received from the union that represents workers at the Department of Water and Power, which spent more than $2 million to help her in the primary. On Wednesday, she was endorsed by the powerful local Service Employees International Union, which represents tens of thousands of city and county workers and could provide critical votes in the runoff. Mr. Garcetti has the backing of the teachers' union, the Teamsters and other local unions.
''We're going to be talking about who is going to create a better business environment and how to put this city back to work,'' said Bill Carrick, a strategist for the Garcetti campaign, who said Ms. Greuel has not proved she can cut costs. ''She's hidden behind the old cliché of getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse, but it is almost meaningless how much money she has found in her role as the controller.''
In her speech to supporters Tuesday night, Ms. Greuel said Mr. Garcetti could not be trusted, which is why she also had support from business groups, including the Chamber of Commerce.
''What they know is I'm going to be the person who stands up and says exactly what I mean,'' she said in an interview with KPCC radio Wednesday. ''I'll be able to have those tough conversations and ultimately solve the problems that face Los Angeles.''
Two incumbents for the Los Angeles school board were re-elected after competitive races that drew millions of dollars from around the country, including $1 million from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, to support candidates backed by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa.
The current board president, Monica Garcia, received 54 percent of the vote, enough to avoid a runoff. And Steve Zimmer, an alumnus of Teach for America who was backed by the teachers' union, beat a challenger who had the support of the mayor's coalition.

HEADLINE: Cry About the Real Wolf

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
The White House horribly botched its messaging on the sequester.
The Obama administration desperately wanted to define the sequester's immediate job casualties and calamitous disruptions.
In a way, Obama's strategy was understandable, and may well have worked on a different group of Republicans from the present crop, which is constitutionally opposed to anything that this president supports.
It's like one of those Warner Brothers cartoons where Bugs Bunny argues with Yosemite Sam and then takes Sam's position only to have Sam continue to disagree out of spite and anger and ignorance. In our version, Sam then threatens to blow the economy to smithereens. It would be funny it weren't so tragically real. 
The White House wanted to cause enough outcry that it would pressure Republicans into a deal that would avert indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts.
But the outcry never came. Republicans gambled that it never would. They called the White House's bluff.
The public had grown numb with the sky-is-falling hysterics in Washington, so much so that few were paying close attention to the sequester. A CBS News poll issued this week found that only 28 percent of Americans said that they were paying very close attention.
Many Republicans played down the sequester's potential fallout, while fact checkers castigated the White House for exaggerating it.
This seems to have won some converts among the tangentially engaged electorate.
Sure, most people preferred some balance of spending cuts and tax increases, and a plurality blamed Republicans in Congress for not coming up with a deal, according the CBS News poll. But the percentage of people who said that the sequester would either be good for the country or wouldn't have a real impact was equal to the percentage of people who believed that it would be bad for the country.
And, since the country didn't fall apart during the first week of the sequester, many Americans may be even more open to the argument that the administration was crying wolf. In fact, the Dow Jones industrial average hit a record high this week, and there were no long lines at airports for any reason other than a brewing snowstorm.
But remember that in the story of the boy who cried wolf, ultimately, a real wolf does show up after all the false cries, and that very real wolf destroys a vulnerable flock.
The lesson, as applied to our present dilemma, is that alarmism erodes credibility, but real danger can still lurk.
The pain of the sequester is that kind that lurks: a slow, creeping disaster mainly affecting those Americans on the fringes who are barely inching their way back into a still-bleak job market -- or hopelessly locked out of it -- and poor Americans too old or too young to participate in it.
That is how the effects should always have been framed: not as a danger to air travelers and contractors, but as a prowling danger to the most vulnerable in our flock.
Not framing it this way harkens back to a larger problem in our culture: a failure, or outright unwillingness, to acknowledge America's poor -- both working and not -- and to appreciate their struggle.
When I think about the effects of the sequester, I can't help thinking about the people in my hometown in rural north Louisiana and in places like it.
In my hometown, the median family income is less than $30,000, and poverty rates are staggeringly high, according to the American Community Survey. This isn't necessarily because people don't take work if they can find it, but because much of the work they can find doesn't pay a living wage.
So they supplement their salaries with the public benefits they're eligible to receive.
The town is also home to the Head Start program for the area, and some of the only professional jobs available are at the school.
It is in places like this, places full of the working poor who don't take airplanes or own stock, that the effects of the sequester will be all too real.
The director of the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the sequester could cost 750,000 jobs this year. Those are not likely to be lost from the top down but from the bottom up. And the estimate of job losses isn't simply a factor of government pink slips, but the blow to the private sector when billions of dollars are withdrawn from the larger economy.
Pundits and politicians have mocked the cuts for being small in the grand scheme of an enormous national budget, but those are the callous waggings of tongues that have never given voice to the fear of poverty or tasted the bitterness of hunger.
For the rest, the less fortunate, those trying their best to feed their families and praying that illness passes over their houses, these cuts will be no joke.
Those are the people the White House and Congressional Democrats should highlight: good people dealt a poor hand and trying to make good of it.
There is another America, unseen and uncelebrated, where the wolf is ever sniffing at folks' heels.

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Plans a Budget That Retains Tax Increases and Medicare Cuts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans will preserve Medicare cuts that their presidential nominee loudly denounced last year and accept tax increases they sternly opposed just months ago in a new tax-and-spending blueprint that would bring the federal budget into balance by 2023, senior Republicans said Wednesday.
But the politically charged proposal, which emerged as the House easily passed legislation to keep the government financed through Sept. 30, is not expected to include workers currently 55 and over in major changes recommended for Medicare, after more moderate Republicans objected. The vote on the short-term spending bill was moved up because of a predicted storm that failed to meet expectations but that still shut down the federal government.
''Our goal is not to pass a budget and forget about it,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee. ''Our goal is to get a down payment on this problem for America. The value of a Republican majority ought to be, at the very least, to help delay a debt crisis from hitting this country.'' 
Although the House budget will not formally be unveiled until next Tuesday, the briefing by Mr. Ryan kicked off what could be a more orderly process of reviewing the nation's fiscal picture after two years of chaotic clashes on the issue.
As the spending measure advanced, President Obama kept up his charm offensive with Republicans in pursuit of a bipartisan deal to reduce the deficit and undo the automatic spending cuts that took effect on Friday. He dined with nearly a dozen Senate Republicans at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington on Wednesday night, and he continued his phone calls, reaching out to Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, and speaking for some time to Mr. Ryan, the congressman confirmed. Mr. Obama is expected to invite him to lunch in the coming days.
Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, one of Mr. Obama's fiercest critics in the Senate, who nonetheless accepted a dinner invitation from him, said: ''I've always said I'm willing to work with anybody who's willing to acknowledge the problem to solve it. Maybe that got noticed. I'll certainly give the president the benefit of the doubt.''
Introduction of the House budget will be the first substantive step toward any bipartisan legislative deal on the deficit, but the path forward is narrow and steep. Mr. Ryan said his plan would bring the budget into balance in a decade, largely by sticking to the prescriptions of his last two budgets, which Mr. Obama made foils of his re-election campaign. Those include cutting spending on food stamps and social services, converting Medicare into a system that gives older people a fixed subsidy that would be used to buy insurance on the private market and turning Medicaid -- the health care program for the poor -- into block grants to states.
''I wouldn't expect big surprises from us next week,'' Mr. Ryan said.
But he made clear he would extend some olive branches, for the sake of comity but also in pursuit of his balanced budget. The tax increases on the affluent that Mr. Obama secured in January during the showdown over the so-called fiscal cliff will be reflected in the revenues Republicans expect to flow to the Treasury in their budget.
''Revenue went up significantly two months ago with the fiscal cliff deal,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''We're not going to refight that fight.''
Also, Mr. Ryan offered tempered praise for the cuts to Medicare that helped finance the Affordable Care Act, cuts that he denounced as his party's vice-presidential nominee but that will help him avoid subjecting people older than 55 to his Medicare changes. ''Because of Obamacare, you have -- for a moment in time -- lower Medicare spending rates,'' he said.
With higher taxes, Medicare cuts and an unexpected slowdown in health care spending, budget experts say the House budget needs only about $100 billion in additional cuts toward the end of the decade.
In Mr. Ryan's last two budgets, he also banked the $716 billion in Medicare cuts for the health law for deficit reduction, but when the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, attacked the president for those cuts and pledged to restore that money, Mr. Ryan fell in line.
''Paul Ryan and I will restore those dollars to our seniors and to Medicare,'' Mr. Romney said last October at a campaign appearance in Henderson, Nev., with Mr. Ryan at his side.
But Mr. Ryan had good reason to drop that pledge. He needed the money. As budget chairman he had argued that to get the budget to balance, he needed to have Medicare savings go into force earlier, even if that meant dropping the pledge to shield those 55 and over.
''It's a concern to a number of members,'' said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. ''Many of us campaigned on making sure that there would be no changes for retirees or near-retirees.''
But before lawmakers can fight over the broad shape of the federal government, they must keep the current government open for business, and the House moved Wednesday to do that. The vote, 267 to 151, included 53 Democrats and indicated that the Senate would have little political latitude to take the spending bill in a drastically different direction.
The House bill gives military and veterans' programs some breathing room under the automatic spending cuts that took effect on Friday by increasing financing for Pentagon priorities. The measure also seeks to thwart the Postal Service's plan to halt Saturday home delivery by requiring a six-day schedule.
But domestic programs are left largely unprotected from cuts of up to 11 percent under the so-called sequester.
''Today the House has taken the first step towards assuring the American people that the federal government will stay open, which President Obama agrees should be our shared goal,'' said Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio. ''The Senate should pass the House measure without delay so we can continue focusing on helping Americans get back to work and putting the country on a path to a balanced budget.''
That is not likely to happen. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she would demand the kind of changes the House afforded military programs for at least some of the nondefense side of the spending bill. That way Congress can prioritize programs that bolster economic growth now, like transportation and infrastructure, and strengthen future economic growth through science and technology, even within the strictures of across-the-board cuts.
She praised the House for moving quickly on its bill rather than flirting with a government shutdown on March 27, when the current stopgap spending bill expires. But, she said, the bill ''is too spartan for us because it does not contain domestic priorities.''

HEADLINE: Officer's Grisly Trial Has a Jury That Appears Tech-Savvy

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER; Daniel Krieger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
One day last month, as Judge Paul G. Gardephe was overseeing jury selection for the trial of a New York police officer accused of plotting to kidnap, kill and eat women, he asked prospective jurors about issues that could call their impartiality into question.
A woman spoke up. ''I am not sure, but I believe that our children know each other,'' she said, referring to the judge's family. 
''Well, I hope they like each other,'' he remarked, asking if that fact caused her to believe she could not be fair.
''No, Your Honor,'' the woman replied. She was chosen to be among the 12 jurors and 3 alternates on the panel, in Federal District Court in Manhattan, that is about to begin deliberating on whether the officer, Gilberto Valle, should be found guilty.
Prosecutors have charged that Officer Valle planned crimes via chats and other messages on a fetish Web site, while his lawyers say he was engaged in fantasy role play on the Internet and never intended to harm anyone.
The jury of six men and six women, who are expected to hear closing arguments on Thursday, have given no hint in court at how they view the case. But they appear to be a diverse group of residents from the New York City area who, if nothing else, are hard to shock, having endured a selection process that asked whether the grisly and often sexually explicit testimony and images in the case would make it hard for them to be impartial. All of them said no.
Five of the seated jurors are from Manhattan, four from Westchester County, two from the Bronx and one from Putnam County. They range in age from 22 to 61, based on information they provided during selection.
And to the extent that the case revolves around allegations of crimes being planned in cyberspace, the jury appears to be anything but unsophisticated when it comes to the Web.
All 12 said that they used the Internet for at least an hour a day, and one man, a corporate lawyer from Manhattan, said he was on the Web all day at work and later at home. Some said they did online banking and bill-paying; several were members of social network sites like Facebook and Twitter; some said they posted photographs; and one said ''I 'G-chat' with my friends.''
A 50-year-old juror from Westchester who is self-employed wrote on her questionnaire: ''Rarely chat or I.M. as I'm home when friends are @ work.''
At least four jurors revealed backgrounds in computer science. One Manhattan woman, 39, has an information technology job with the City of New York; a Bronx man, 45, said he read Hacker News, and described himself as a software engineer and computer researcher for a large corporate software lab.
Other jurors include a teacher, an actuary, a transit operator, an equipment buyer and a security administrator. Two said they were self-employed; one is unemployed.
And none appeared fazed by the disturbing images that they were told would most likely arise at trial -- and have.
About 90 prospective jurors got a questionnaire that noted that Officer Valle's communications had taken place on fetish Web sites in which people posted images and videos of sexually violent and deviant conduct, like necrophilia, sexual asphyxiation, bondage and sadomasochism.
The questionnaire also included examples of images that might be displayed in court, including one of a naked woman being cooked over a fire. During the selection process, court, the judge read some of the responses from prospective jurors aloud.
''Too wicked, cannibalism, too perverted,'' one person wrote. Another wrote, ''I just don't think I can stomach it.''
But the questionnaires filled out by the 12 jurors who were ultimately selected for the trial show that none indicated that such aspects of the case would make it hard for them to be fair.
Indeed, where the questionnaire listed more than a dozen fetish Web sites and asked prospective jurors if they had visited any of them, one of the jurors picked for the case indicated that he had.

HEADLINE: Proposed Dam Presents Economic and Environmental Challenges in Alaska

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
At a time when large dams are being taken down, not put up, the state of Alaska is proposing to construct one of the tallest and most expensive hydroelectric dams ever built in North America.
The Alaska Energy Authority is planning to build a 735-foot, $5.2 billion structure on the Susitna River in a largely empty south-central part of the state, which is watered by runoff from the arc of the Alaska Range. The dam, designed to generate up to 600 megawatts of electricity, would create a new power supply for more than two-thirds of the state's population.
But in Alaska, where natural energy resources and wildlife are both foundations of the economy, the proposed dam presents twin conundrums. 
One is economic: which is better, creating a reliable source of hydroelectricity and weaning some of the state off natural gas, or building a spur off a proposed pipeline to bring gas from the North Slope to the populated region from Fairbanks to the Kenai Peninsula? Or both? The other is environmental: what serves the environment best, replacing natural gas-fired electricity with hydroelectricity, which is free of greenhouse gas emissions, or keeping the Susitna watershed untrammeled and avoiding the risks involved in changing the dynamics of a major salmon stream?
For environmentalists, the choice is uncomfortable. ''It is a bit of a hard choice for the environmental community to have to make. Do we choose a big natural gas project or do we choose a big dam?'' said Corinne Smith, a Nature Conservancy official in Alaska responsible for the study of the Matanuska-Susitna Valley where the dam would be located.
While energy is a foundation of the Alaskan economy, it is most visible in the federal arena. The big political fights over energy have involved federal lands, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or the National Petroleum Reserve. Discussions over how Alaskans should generate their own energy are less frequent and lower-key.
But now, the prospect of building the new dam is being drawn into a debate in the Legislature over a proposal much more familiar to environmental groups: the plan to build a $45 billion natural gas pipeline from the North Slope to the Midwest, perhaps including a spur that would carry some gas to south-central Alaska, where regional power plants are already fueled by gas.
Having this gas provide reliable electricity at stable and affordable prices, said an analyst of both projects, would make the dam superfluous and avoid its environmental impacts. But of course, there are significant environmental impacts associated with the 800-mile proposed pipeline.
Can the state afford both? Key legislative leaders think so, even though the oil revenues that made Alaska rich are inexorably dwindling along with the oil bounty of the North Slope.
''We're lucky we're financially healthy,'' said Representative Charisse Millett, co-chairwoman of the special Energy Committee in Alaska's House of Representatives. ''We don't want to pick one project -- we want to go down parallel paths.''
Moreover, the decades-old dam proposal, dusted off by the Legislature and Gov. Sean Parnell in 2010, would help the state abide by its policy that Alaska obtain half its energy from renewable sources by 2025. The dam legislation passed without a single dissenting vote.
Both the dam and the pipeline appeal to the state's appetite for supersize ventures, said Steve Colt, an environmental economist at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
''We're always looking for the next boom and we've been remarkably lucky in coming across one thing after another,'' he added. ''People were thinking the gas pipeline would be the next big thing. Now, it's the most expensive hydroelectric project ever built in North America.''
Construction of the dam, according to Emily Ford, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Energy Authority, would provide an essential new source of electricity and a hedge against a surge in energy prices. Oil price increases, of course, benefit the state in its role as an exporter of North Slope oil, but hurt regions in the state dependent on oil-fueled electricity and heating.
''We were looking for solutions to provide an affordable and stable power source'' for more than 500,000 people in the Railbelt, the south-central region from Fairbanks to the Kenai Peninsula, Ms. Ford said.
Opponents of the dam, however, say that the declining supply of natural gas feeding most of the power plants in the Railbelt could be replaced with supplies form the North Slope, or from untapped resources in the gas-rich areas of the Cook Inlet.
Cook Inlet, at the mouth of the Susitna River, is one of the world's richest salmon fishing grounds. Susitna is among the four biggest state rivers used by salmon species when spawning.
As Chris Wood, president of the environmental group Trout Unlimited, said, ''The fact is that this dam, in ways we don't know, would change the flow of the Susitna.'' In late July last year, for the first time, a reduced population of Chinook salmon resulted in the partial closure of the area for fishing.
The impact of large dams on salmon runs and the riverine environment has kept large hydroelectric projects elsewhere in the country off the federal list of renewable energy sources -- but not off Alaska's.
The concern for Mr. Wood and local opponents is not that the dam will block salmon runs, as large dams in the West have. The site of the Susitna project is far upriver, beyond the reach of all but the hardiest fish.
Instead, the issue is the way the dam will alter the river's rates of flow. Richard Leo, president of Susitna Dam Alternatives, argued that ''in the wintertime, the dam is going to be releasing flow many times greater than normal.'' Juvenile salmon, he said, ''will no longer be able to hover near the edge of the river, they will literally have to swim for their lives.''
Ms. Ford, the spokeswoman for the energy agency, said that all the major issues, from stream flows to fish behavior, are being studied in an extensive review process that will take at least two more years. In 2015, if things go as planned, the state will ask federal regulators for a license, she said, and construction could start in 2017.

HEADLINE: In Survey, Fed Finds Economic Growth Is Widespread

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stronger auto sales, better hiring and a continued housing recovery helped the American economy grow in January and February throughout the country, according to a survey released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve. 
The survey noted that 10 of the Fed's 12 banking districts reported moderate growth, while the Boston and Chicago districts reported slow growth. The survey, called the beige book, provided anecdotal information on economic conditions through Feb. 22.
The information will be discussed along with other economic data during the Fed's next policy meeting on March 19 and 20Consumer spending increased in most regions, but much of the gains were driven by auto sales.
Many districts said consumers spent slightly less after taxes rose and gas prices increased. Some districts also expressed concern about federal spending cuts that started March 1.
Housing markets showed increased strength in nearly all of the country. Manufacturing grew modestly in most districts after struggling through most of 2012. Many districts reported improvement in individual job markets.
Analysts said the survey was slightly more upbeat than the previous one by the Fed, noting the modest rebound in manufacturing in the last two months. Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the latest survey was ''more encouraging news on the U.S. economy.''
Many economists believe the Fed will maintain its low-interest-rate policies at current levels, taking no new steps at the March meeting.
In January, the Fed stood behind aggressive steps it introduced in December to try to lower unemployment. It repeated its intention to keep its key short-term interest rate at a record low at least until unemployment falls below 6.5 percent. The Fed also said it would keep buying Treasuries and mortgage bonds to help lower borrowing costs and encourage spending.
When the Fed last met in January, the unemployment rate was 7.9 percent. The government will report on February's unemployment figures on Friday, and some economists are forecasting that the jobless rate will decline to 7.8 percent, with the economy adding 152,000 jobs.
The payroll processor A.D.P. said Wednesday that American businesses added 198,000 jobs in February. The private survey also revised January's hiring figures to show that companies added 215,000 jobs that month, 23,000 more than what had initially been reported.
That suggests the government's February unemployment report could come in above economists' forecasts.
In another positive economic sign, orders for machinery and other factory goods that signal business investment surged in January.
Orders for so-called core capital goods, which also include equipment and computers, rose 7.2 percent from December, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. It was the largest gain in more than a year and higher than the initial 6.3 percent increase estimated by the government last week.
Total factory orders fell 2 percent in January compared with December. But the decline was mostly a result of a steep drop in aircraft and military orders.
Demand for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, dropped 4.9 percent. Demand for nondurable goods, such as chemicals and paper, rose 0.6 percent.

 BODY:
Bank of America has been underestimating its legal risks for years, and brazenly so, according to its critics. Is that strategy about to pay off with the Federal Reserve?
On Thursday, the Fed will release figures on how much capital the nation's biggest banks must have to cover a ''stress'' situation. The following week, investors find out whether those banks will be able to return more of their capital to shareholders by paying dividends or buying back stock.
Last year, the Fed passed most of the big banks and let them pay out billions. Bank of America, sensing a request would be unwelcome, didn't even ask. This year, however, Wall Street expects that Bank of America will get the green light.
Yet the bank continues to face gargantuan payouts to clean up legal disputes from the bubble years. Now a lawsuit suggests that the bank's mortgage portfolio could cost it tens of billions more than it had planned. In one big case, if things go wrong, Bank of America may be required to make good on many more billions worth of bad mortgages from Countrywide Financial, which the bank acquired, in the sense that one acquires Ebola virus, in 2008. 
Bank of America, however, has kept its legal reserves low -- perhaps dangerously so.
The dispute involves a 2011 settlement that Bank of America reached with some of the world's biggest investors, including Pimco and BlackRock, for $8.5 billion. That amount covers more than $400 billion of Countrywide loans, on which there have been tens of billions of losses. The actual loss total is in dispute because they are estimates, but it ranges from $70 billion or so to well over $100 billion. That means, at the high end of the range, the settlement was for pennies on the dollar. On a conference call last week held by Mike Mayo, the CLSA bank analyst, a legal expert suggested that if things went south in the courts for Bank of America, the settlement might rise to $25 billion to $30 billion.
Bank of America contends that its reserves are reasonable, based on its estimated probable payouts. The bank wouldn't raise them ''based on speculation from third-party observers who are not directly involved in any of these matters,'' a spokesman said.
Even in the fun house of litigation about mortgages, this one is particularly complicated. The dispute revolves around the question of whether another bank, BNY Mellon, working on behalf of mortgage-backed securities investors, was reasonable and acted in good faith in agreeing to the settlement. It is being hashed out in New York State Supreme Court. BNY Mellon is the trustee on 530 securitizations, or bundles of Countrywide mortgages, that were sold to investors.
The insurer American International Group, along with some others, including the New York and Delaware attorneys general, are fighting about the settlement. Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, has accused BNY Mellon of breaching its fiduciary duty. A BNY Mellon spokesman said, ''We believe we have fulfilled all of our duties as trustee in this case.''
The small settlement doesn't sit right. The group of investors who agreed to it hold only about a quarter of the securities, making it appear as if a minority has forced a bad deal on the majority in order to get few quick bucks and resolve any dispute. The Pimcos and BlackRocks of the world don't like to sue big banks. Things can get a little uncomfortable on the golf links. (They contend it was reasonable, given all the legal uncertainties of a protracted dispute.)
And who blessed the $8.5 billion figure anyway? To figure out whether it was fair, BNY Mellon relied on a firm called RRMS Advisors, a mortgage analysis firm.
The RRMS estimate has been in dispute for some time now. The firm relied on information from Bank of America, and critics contend it underestimated problems in the loans and the total losses. How BNY Mellon found little RRMS isn't clear; the bank wouldn't comment. RRMS's Brian Lin, who conducted the analysis, stood by his report, but declined to comment further.
Recently, other court rulings have boded ill for Bank of America. Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan has ruled that an insurer called Assured Guaranty was able to dispute mortgages that it backed and that were made by a small bank called Flagstar, without having to show that the contractual breach was the direct cause of the loss. In other words, the borrower may have defaulted, but Assured didn't have to demonstrate that it was because she didn't make $150,000 a year as a tarot card reader, as had been claimed on the borrower's loan application. If Bank of America is hit by such a ruling too, it might have to pay more. It argues its contracts are different.
So is Bank of America vulnerable? Not surprisingly, it is keeping whole swaths of expensive Manhattan law firms working all hours of the day to make the case that it isn't. BNY Mellon, too, contends it acted reasonably.
And the banks contend the $8.5 billion settlement is in line with other similar settlements. Of course, the investors continue to face huge hurdles even if rulings in this case start to go their way.
But even if the chances are low that the cases don't go in Bank of America's favor, an increase in legal reserves could be huge. So this is a low-probability, high-risk event. Another way of saying that is that it is a ''stress'' situation. And who just put banks through stress situations? Ah, right, the Federal Reserve.
The Fed, whose earlier decisions have been generous to the banks, declined to comment for this column.
As Professors Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig, authors of the new book, ''The Banker's New Clothes,'' have argued, the big banks are undercapitalized and the simplest way for them to start building capital is to keep their profits instead of returning them to shareholders.
A look at Bank of America's estimates for how much it will have to pay for its mortgage liability is telling. It has gone up steadily each year. In 2009, the bank had a reserve of $3.5 billion. By last year, it had jumped to $19 billion, with an estimate of additional loss of up to another $4 billion.
And so Bank of America seems to have been consistently underestimating its legal exposure. (And it has other, undisclosed legal reserves for different cases. The incentives to lowball those are much greater, because the public cannot scrutinize them.)
In keeping the reserves low, Bank of America has already won. If it turns out that the bank loses its cases and has to pay much more money, it nevertheless has managed to make its books look that much better for years. That surely helped as it has tried to dig itself out of its financial crisis hole.
''This is an accounting arbitrage,'' says Manal Mehta, a hedge fund manager who has been on a lonely crusade for years to follow the complexities of these cases. ''The accounting rules give you a lot of latitude in setting reserves,'' he says. Bank of America is ''hiding behind that.''
Fortune may favor the bold, but regulators just give them a pass.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Charity Takes Gun Lobby Closer to Its Quarry

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
On a Monday evening in early February, two months into a national debate over gun violence after the massacre at a Connecticut elementary school, representatives of the firearms industry were wining and dining lawmakers in Washington.
The occasion was the ''Changing of the Guard'' reception and dinner for the incoming leadership of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, which counts more than 250 members in the House and Senate. Hosting the gathering was a little-known but well-connected organization, the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation.
Despite its low profile, the foundation has close ties to members of Congress, allowing its donors, who give as much as $100,000 a year, to mix with lawmakers at shooting contests, banquets and wine tastings. The food and drink at last month's gathering were paid for in part by the National Rifle Association and the trade group for the gun industry. 
Over the past year, sportsmen's caucus members have clinked glasses and puffed cigars at a ''Wine, Wheels and Wildlife'' fund-raiser at a North Carolina vineyard, a ''Whiskies of the World'' and cigar reception on Capitol Hill, and a ''Stars and Stripes Shootout'' in Tampa, Fla., where the top shooting awards went to a Republican congressman and a lobbyist for the N.R.A. Such events provide the firearms industry and other foundation donors with a tax-deductible means of lobbying the elected officials who shape policies important to their businesses.
A private charity not affiliated with the government, the foundation carries the cachet of its relationship with the sportsmen's caucus in Congress, which it provides with research on policies affecting hunting and fishing. But while ostensibly focused on those outdoor pursuits, it also presses issues important mainly to the gun industry, which is one of its largest contributors.
The foundation opposes restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines, a ban on military-style AR-15 rifles and the imprinting of bullets with traceable serial numbers to help solve crimes. All of those proposals have surfaced in the current legislative debate, which is expected to continue Thursday when a Senate Judiciary Committee considers a bill to curb illegal gun trafficking.
The foundation says its positions fit naturally with its mission ''to work with Congress, governors and state legislatures to protect and advance hunting, recreational angling, and shooting and trapping.''
''There is significant overlap between access to firearms and the ability to participate in hunting and recreational shooting activities,'' it said in a statement.
Others see the linkage to hunting as part of a calculated effort by the firearms industry to advance policies that have little to do with outdoor sports. Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., a New Jersey Democrat who as a co-chairman of the law enforcement caucus has butted heads with the sportsmen's caucus on gun issues, said pro-gun groups had stoked fear in Congress by portraying any limits on firearms as a threat to legitimate pastimes like hunting.
''They see this as if they give in on any one item, it will put them on a slippery slope to coming into your home and taking your guns away,'' Mr. Pascrell said. ''They're creating hysteria.''
Lawmakers have long formed caucuses on specific subjects as varied as drug addiction and capital gains taxes. Special interests often press their cases with caucus members, sometimes through receptions, trips and fund-raisers. But most caucuses do not have foundations or institutes set up specifically for that purpose, and financed with private contributions.
Established in 1989 as the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus Foundation -- the word ''caucus'' was dropped in 1994 -- the foundation is a nonprofit charity under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, meaning it can accept unlimited, tax-deductible donations. Its charitable purpose, according to tax records, is to ''provide scientific research, wildlife management, public education and conservation information.'' It says it does this by giving nonpartisan ''advice, support and information'' to the sportsmen's caucus and elected state officials.
Many of its programs focus on wildlife conservation, on open space and on hunting, including an annual report on its economic benefits. It has held briefings or issued policy statements on opening public lands and waterways for hunting and fishing, easing limits on imports of skins and other trophies from polar bear hunting and opposing regulation of the lead content in fishing-line sinkers. But it also backs gun-industry positions whose relevance to its historical focus on hunting and fishing is indirect at best.
The foundation president, Jeff Crane, declined to be interviewed. But in written responses to questions, the foundation said that ''limiting the purchase of firearms and ammunition has a direct impact on state-based professional fish and wildlife management'' because it would mean less revenue from federal excise taxes, which finance those programs. Many hunters and target shooters also use rifles that gun-control advocates would classify, wrongly, as assault weapons, it said.
''It has become increasingly important to ensure that the interests of recreational shooters are represented,'' the foundation said.
The foundation's board has included top executives of Freedom Group, the largest American maker of firearms, and ATK, the country's biggest producer of ammunition. In 2010, the foundation disclosed that its most generous donor in its history was the gun industry's trade association. (It said last week that another donor, which it would not identify, had since taken top honors.)
Contributions ballooned from $434,000 in 2001 to more than $2 million in 2011, with its top-tier donors including firearms makers and retailers like Remington, Winchester and Walmart. Other high-level donors include the N.R.A., outdoor groups like Safari Club International, and ExxonMobil, Amgen and Altria.
The foundation is blunt in its appeal to donors. Its Web site says that ''no organization has access to so many elected officials,'' adding that ''we know how important it is to have an effective voice in the political arena looking out for your interests.''
''Our promise to you is to keep delivering big returns on your investment,'' the foundation said in a message to donors.
In a 2004 update to donors, the foundation explained that it had decided to ''increase the value'' of one of its shooting events by moving it closer to Washington so industry executives could ''interact with members of Congress.''
''For the 150 industry representatives that attended the 2004 events, the move was well worth it,'' it said. ''During the shootout, industry teams were paired with the members of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus.''
The foundation has also branched out to provide a similar bridge between its financial supporters and state legislatures. It sponsors an annual gathering with legislators, held last year at a resort in Myrtle Beach, S.C., where activities included a wild hog hunt, surf fishing and the firing of guns with silencers provided by the American Silencer Association.
In its written responses to questions, the foundation said it is in touch with members of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus on ''an as-needed basis,'' depending on pending legislation and the needs of ''the sporting community.'' Its ''focus while interacting with members of the caucus is to provide them with information and to educate them on issues of importance to sportsmen,'' it said.
As with most Congressional caucuses, members of the sportsmen's caucus do not vote in lock step, and many do not take part in the foundation's social events. There are also differences of opinion among caucus leaders on ways to address gun violence.
Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, a co-chairman of the caucus, is also a member of the House Democrats' task force on preventing gun violence, supports a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and has an F rating from the N.R.A. -- making him, he acknowledged, a ''rare breed'' in the caucus.
But as a lifelong hunter, Mr. Thompson said, he enjoys attending sportsmen foundation events and has no trouble spending time with representatives of the N.R.A. and other special interests that pay for them.
''They don't have any influence over me,'' he said. ''I see them at social functions and gatherings. They've been very supportive of a lot of the issues the caucus is interested in, even if we don't agree 100 percent on everything.''
In contrast to Mr. Thompson, the House Republican co-chairman of the sportsmen's caucus, Representative Bob Latta of Ohio, has an A-plus N.R.A. rating and has expressed skepticism about any new gun restrictions. He declined to be interviewed.
The caucus is regularly used as a launching pad in Congress for pro-gun legislation. The sponsor and all 27 original co-sponsors of a 2005 bill that shielded the firearms industry from liability suits were caucus members. More than 100 members co-sponsored the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, which was aimed at rolling back gun control measures in Washington, D.C., but died in committee in 2011.
Also in 2011, caucus members wrote amendments that would have prevented gun dealers from having to report customers who make multiple purchases of certain weapons in states bordering Mexico, and would have rolled back restrictions on imports of shotguns with tactical features like extended magazine tubes. The N.R.A. issued a statement praising the amendments' authors, Representatives Denny Rehberg of Montana and John Carter of Texas, both Republicans.
''Representative Carter, like Representative Rehberg, is a member of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, and believes that federal gun regulations often create burdens for law-abiding citizens,'' the N.R.A. said. The N.R.A. declined to comment on its relationship with the caucus and foundation.
Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut who has been highly critical of the gun industry's influence in Washington, said the N.R.A.'s ''association with the sportsmen's caucus plays up this mythology that they speak for sportsmen when, increasingly they don't.''
''They represent views that help gun manufacturers,'' he said.
Last year, the N.R.A. was a ''titanium'' donor to the sportsmen's foundation, giving at least $50,000. That was one level below the $100,000 ''platinum'' category.
The N.R.A. ranked higher in the foundation's sport shooting competition with Congressional staff members: its chief lobbyist won a top honor for target shooting at the 2012 event, sharing that distinction with legislative aides to four House members and a senator.
Bearing Arms: Articles in this series are examining the gun industry's influence and the wide availability of firearms in America.

HEADLINE: Open Jobs and Good Candidates, but Employers Won't Commit

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
American employers have a variety of job vacancies, piles of cash and countless well-qualified candidates. But despite a slowly improving economy, many companies remain reluctant to actually hire, stringing job applicants along for weeks or months before they make a decision.
If they ever do.
The number of job openings has increased to levels not seen since the height of the financial crisis, but vacancies are staying unfilled much longer than they used to -- an average of 23 business days today compared to a low of 15 in mid-2009, according to a new measure of Labor Department data by the economists Steven J. Davis, Jason Faberman and John Haltiwanger.
Some have attributed the more extended process to a mismatch between the requirements of the four million jobs available and the skills held by many of the 12 million unemployed. That's probably true in a few high-skilled fields, like nursing or biotech, but for a large majority of positions where candidates are plentiful, the bigger problem seems to be a sort of hiring paralysis. 
''There's a fear that the economy is going to go down again, so the message you get from C.F.O.'s is to be careful about hiring someone,'' said John Sullivan, a management professor at San Francisco State University who runs a human resources consulting business. ''There's this great fear of making a mistake, of wasting money in a tight economy.''
As a result, employers are bringing in large numbers of candidates for interview after interview after interview. Data from Glassdoor.com, a site that collects information on hiring at different companies, shows that the average duration of the interview process at major companies like Starbucks, General Mills and Southwest Airlines has roughly doubled since 2010.
''After they call you back after the sixth interview, there's a part of you that wants to say, 'That's it, I'm not going back,' '' said Paul Sullivan, 43, an exasperated but cheerful video editor in Washington. ''But then you think, hey, maybe seven is my lucky number. And besides, if I don't go, they'll just eliminate me if something else comes up because they'll think I have an attitude problem.''
Like other job seekers around the country, he has been through marathon interview sessions. Mr. Sullivan has received eighth- and ninth-round callbacks for positions at three different companies. Two of those companies, as it turned out, ultimately decided not to hire anyone, he said; instead they put their openings ''on hold'' because of budget pressures.
At one company, while signing into the visitor's log for the sixth time, he was chided by the security guard.
''He thought I worked there and just kept forgetting my security badge,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''He couldn't believe I was actually there for another interview. I couldn't either! But then I put on a happy face, went upstairs and waited for another round of questions.''
The hiring delays are part of the vicious cycle the economy has yet to escape: jobless and financially stretched Americans are reluctant to spend, which holds back demand, which in turn frays employers' confidence that sales will firm up and justify committing to a new hire. Job creation over the last two years has been steady but too slow to put a major dent in the backlog of unemployed workers, and the February jobs report due out on Friday is expected to be equally mediocre. Uncertainty about the effect of fiscal policy in Washington is not helping expectations for the rest of the year, either.
''If you have an opening and are not sure about the economy, it's pretty cheap to wait for a month or two,'' said Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University. But in the aggregate, those little delays, coupled with fiscal uncertainty, are stretching out the recovery process. ''It's like one of those horror movies, an economic Friday the 13th, where this recession never seems to die.''
Employers might be making candidates jump through so many hoops partly because so many workers have been jobless for months or years, and hiring managers want to make sure the candidates' skills are up to date, said Robert Shimer, an economics professor at the University of Chicago.
But there's also little pressure to hire right now, so long as candidates are abundant and existing staff members are afraid to refuse the extra workload created by an unfilled position. Employers can keep dragging out the hiring process until they're more confident about their business -- or at least until they find the superstar candidate.
''They're chasing after that purple squirrel,'' said Roger Ahlfeld, 44, of Framingham, Mass., using a human resources industry term for an impossibly qualified job applicant.
An H.R. professional himself, Mr. Ahlfeld has been looking for work since August 2011, and has been frustrated to find himself the ''silver medalist'' for a couple of jobs after six separate rounds of interviews totaling 10 to 20 hours for each position, not including prep work and transportation time. For both of those jobs, though, there still has been no gold medalist. After eight months, they remain unfilled, with the companies intermittently posting a job ad, taking it down, and then posting it again.
In addition to demanding credentials beyond what a given position traditionally requires, employers have thrown up more hurdles as screening devices.
In his job hunt over the last year, Mr. Sullivan has taken several video-editing tests, which he says he aced. But he has also been subjected to a battery of personality and psychological exams, a spelling quiz and even a math test (including a question that began, to the best of his recollection, ''If John is on a train traveling from New York at 40 miles per hour, and Susie is on a train from Boston...'').
He passed the math test with a 90 percent score, he said.
''Sister Callahan would be very proud that I was able to remember math problems I learned in prep school,'' he said. ''But what on earth does that have to do with the job I was applying for? It was like something out of 'Seinfeld.' ''
For the companies themselves, economists say, the gantlets they have constructed may be wasting managers' time and company resources. Besides, there are diminishing returns to interviewing candidates so many times; a recent internal analysis at Google, a company that developed a reputation for over-interviewing even when the economy was good, showed that the optimal number of interviews for any given candidate was four. But according to user reviews on Glassdoor.com, the average Google interview process has expanded in the last two years, to 30 days from 21. Google declined to comment.
And for applicants, the expenses add up fast.
Mr. Sullivan calculates that the three positions he applied for cost him $520.36 in parking fees, two parking tickets, gas and trips to Starbucks while waiting for his interviews. (He recently switched to taking a coffee thermos, he says.) That excludes the costs of producing and mailing his video work, dry-cleaning bills for the suits he dons for interviews and thousands of dollars of fees to become certified in new video-editing programs.
Job seekers just have to hope that the investment pays off.
Jameson Cherilus, 23, counts himself as one of the lucky ones. Since graduating at the top of his 2012 class at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, he has spent hundreds of dollars traveling from his home in Bridgeport to interview for jobs in New York. After about six weeks of interviews for an entry-level administrative position at a talent agency, he was finally offered the job in mid-December.
There's just one catch.
More than two months later, he said, ''They still haven't given me my start date.''

HEADLINE: Euro Zone Economy Ended Year on Sour Note

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- The euro zone economy ended the year on a sour note, official data confirmed Wednesday, with major indicators shrinking across the 17-country currency zone.
Nevertheless, investors pushed European stock indexes to their highest levels in more than four years before they closed slightly lower. On Tuesday, a rally on Wall Street sent the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high.
Gross domestic product in the euro zone shrank 0.6 percent in the October-December quarter from the previous three months, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, reported from Luxembourg. The figure, the same as the initial estimate made Feb. 14, confirmed the gloom surrounding the region's economic prospects. 
Analysts do not expect the data Wednesday to have much influence on the European Central Bank's Governing Council, which meets Thursday to set interest rates. While central bank policy makers may judge that there is sufficient economic justification to take new measures, including cutting their main interest rate target from 0.75 percent, the inconclusive election last month in Italy is likely to lead to a cautious stance in Frankfurt, they said.
All of the major euro area economies shrank in the fourth quarter, with Germany contracting 0.6 percent, France 0.3 percent, Spain 0.8 percent and Italy 0.9 percent.
Household spending fell 0.4 percent from the third quarter, while investment fell 1.1 percent and exports fell 0.9 percent.
For all of 2012, gross domestic product in the euro zone shrank 0.9 percent from 2011, Eurostat said.
''The euro zone is clearly the main weak link in the global economy,'' Andrew Kenningham, an economist in London with Capital Economics, said. ''And it's more likely that it will get worse than better.''
He forecast that the euro zone would contract 2 percent this year, as Spain, Italy and France struggled.
By contrast, Japan, where G.D.P. fell 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter from the third, will probably manage growth of about 1 percent this year, Mr. Kenningham said, while the United States, which posted a scant 0.1 percent fourth-quarter gain, will probably grow about 2 percent.
The sovereign debt crisis that has led Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek bailouts and raised borrowing costs to dangerous levels for Spain and Italy has been treated with the medicine of tax increases and government spending, restoring market confidence at the cost of social pain. Just Friday, Eurostat reported that euro zone unemployment had risen to a record 11.9 percent in January from 11.8 percent in December.
Despite that, investors remain bullish on European equities and have pushed the Euro Stoxx 50, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, to its highest level since September 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers touched off the worst period of the financial crisis. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose to an all-time high, a performance that analysts attributed to investors' fears about the economic future beginning to recede.
Gary Jenkins, managing director of Swordfish Research in London, said the stock market gains could be explained partly by European finance ministers taking a somewhat more ''dovish'' tone this week on the need for austerity measures in the euro zone. Liquidity poured by central banks into the financial system, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, has also contributed, he said.
''We've had a tremendous amount of monetary stimulus thrown at this market,'' he said.
Mr. Jenkins said he expected the rally to last for as long as the economic data continued to show some improvement or at least did not get substantially worse.
Paradoxically, he said, very strong data could slow the gains, since real economic growth would lead central banks to start thinking about an end to their easing policies.
Mr. Jenkins said he expected the European Central Bank to stand pat on Thursday. ''If they moved to cut rates now, it might seem fairly panicky,'' he said, adding that such a move would be unnecessary, since borrowing costs in Italy and Spain have come down from the levels last year that fueled worries about bailouts.
But investors will be watching the press conference after the announcement with Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, he said, for clues about the central bank's future direction.
In particular, he said, Mr. Draghi would be quizzed about his thoughts on outright monetary transactions -- secondary market purchases of sovereign bonds -- that the E.C.B. proposed as a means of aiding embattled governments, and how the bank could help Italy if it became necessary.
The transactions were conceived as aid to be granted when a government requested assistance, Mr. Jenkins noted, but the mechanism ''doesn't fit the bill when you don't have a government.''
The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down 0.12 percent on Wednesday, and the FTSE 100 in London closed down 0.07 percent.
Asian indexes were higher, following on the performance of the Dow the day before. The Nikkei 225 stock average in Tokyo closed up 2.1 percent, and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong advanced 1 percent.
The euro was at $1.2985, down from $1.3020 late Tuesday in New York.

HEADLINE: Egypt Shies Away From Economic Overhauls

BYLINE: By FARAH HALIME

 BODY:
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government is backing away from an ambitious economic strategy of tax increases and subsidy cuts because the political support for these moves is lacking and because it fears inciting further unrest.
The prime minister, Hesham Qandil, said last week that the government was preparing a new version of overhauls that the government hopes will unlock a $4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.
The government has been working for months on a package of revenue increases, including a sales tax, and sharp cuts in subsidies, particularly on fuel. 
But officials involved in the drafting process say that under the revised plan, most major budget cuts and revenue-generating measures will not be implemented for several months.
The delays are occurring as the U.S. secretary of state, John Kerry, visited Cairo on Saturday and urged political parties to ''come together around the economic choices and to find some common ground.''
Any consensus between the governing Islamist party, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the opposition is unlikely. The National Salvation Front, an umbrella opposition group that includes Nasserists as well as the former presidential candidate Amr Moussa, has said it will boycott parliamentary elections scheduled for late April.
''It's become a wholly political issue, so whatever is spelled out will not get any support, those are the realities,'' said a senior official at the ministry of finance who is involved in the drafting process and asked not to be identified by name.
''The measures are still the same, but what has shifted is a more gradual phasing-in of the measures given the political agenda,'' he said.
An economist who advises the central bank and was consulted on the plan said the Egyptian government would spend some time refining a program, and any major steps ''won't be taken before summer.''
The government would start with the least controversial measures, including a ''luxury'' sales tax on tobacco, alcohol and soft drinks, he said. Income tax changes were unlikely to be pushed through until at least July.
The government has raised the minimum income liable for tax to 12,000 Egyptian pounds, or $1,780, from 9,000 pounds. The top 25 percent bracket will also be raised to 2 million pounds from 1 million pounds.
The plan would also gradually increase fuel prices for energy-intensive industries, aiming to cap the budget deficit at 10.9 percent of G.D.P. this fiscal year and reduce it to 9.5 percent of G.D.P. in the next. Without the changes, the budget deficit would be as much as 12.3 percent of G.D.P., the government said.
There is a danger that Egypt is heading for a grim summer of higher food prices, food and fuel shortages and electricity blackouts that many observers in and out of government fear could be a recipe for further unrest.
There are steady cases of ''civil disobedience'' across the country, with workers challenging the government of President Mohamed Morsi. The unemployment rate has risen to 13 percent from about 10 percent before the revolution two years ago. About 74 percent of those without work are 15 to 29 years old.
''As we've seen over the past few years, food prices can be a major catalyst for political unrest,'' said Neil Shearing, an economist at Capital Economics in London.
Reaching a final agreement on an I.M.F. accord has become a central issue for Egypt's economic policy horizon, not only because of the funds being offered but because a number of other donors, including the European Union and the United States, have made the successful conclusion of a loan deal a condition for their own assistance to investment in Egypt.
An I.M.F. spokesman said last week that the organization was analyzing the government's ''revised fiscal projections'' before resuming discussions with the Egyptian authorities.
In a summary of the government's economic plan obtained by lobby groups during a meeting to discuss the Egyptian economy, the government acknowledges that it ''has decided to adopt a more gradual method'' to achieve financial stability.
The plan does not mention cutting subsidy spending or detail other tax increases.
By and large, the government has been reluctant to risk controversial changes like cutting energy subsidies because that would anger voters ahead of parliamentary elections. Fuel subsidies account for almost all of Egypt's forecast budget deficit of 135 billion pounds.
The government has delayed plans to ration subsidized fuel through a system of smart cards until July instead of April as originally planned.
While it ended subsidies on 95-octane gasoline, the highest-grade fuel available, at the end of last year, this only led many motorists to switch to subsidized lower-octane fuel.
Egypt's public finances appear in a state of near crisis, with foreign currency reserves at $13.6 billion, their lowest point in 15 years.
''Much of the crisis is related to oil and gas production and overcoming this logjam,'' said Angus Blair, president of Signet Institute, a Cairo-based research group. Oil companies operating in Egypt say that low domestic gas prices discourage investment in new resources.
''Clearly the changes have to happen before summer or we will see major electricity power cuts,'' Mr. Blair said. Last year, gas shortages led to power cuts at power plants, which are mostly gas-fired.
Most economists agree that the longer Egypt's policy overhauls take, the more extreme any change will have to be to bring receipts in line with expenditures. Already there are rumors that a lack of hard currency to finance imports is leading to shortages of wheat and fuel.
''If Egypt's external position doesn't improve in the next two to three months, it may be forced to go for an I.M.F. deal and in this case, it will not have a choice over energy subsidies,'' said Said Hirsh, an economist at Volterra Partners, an economic consulting firm in Britain.
Egypt's only lifeline, he said, may be more aid from Qatar, which has already pledged $4.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Chávez Transformed the Way Venezuelans View Themselves

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; María Eugenia Díaz contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.

 BODY:
LA GUAIRA, Venezuela -- Ever since her home was washed away in the devastating mudslides that killed thousands along Venezuela's coast in 1999, during President Hugo Chávez's first year in office, Graciela Pineda waited for him to carry out his vow to rebuild.
''It's been 13 years, waiting and waiting, and we've gotten nothing,'' said Ms. Pineda, 50, who lives as a squatter with eight members of her family, crammed into a derelict apartment in a wasteland of debris and vacant lots in a once upscale neighborhood called Los Corales. Across the street, a building leans cracked and crumpled, threatening to tumble onto the road.
And yet Ms. Pineda remained loyal to Mr. Chávez to the end, voting for him again in October when he won another six-year term -- and crying for him on Tuesday when he died.
''Who wouldn't cry for a president like him?'' she said. ''Everything here was Chávez. He was our country.'' 
Despite a rocky economic record and strings of broken or half-filled promises during his 14 years in office, the fundamental legacy of Mr. Chávez is not made of concrete and steel, highways and houses, but something less tangible: he has changed the way Venezuelans think about themselves and their country.
''He has made people who didn't feel they were part of democracy before feel like they're part of the system,'' said Joy Olson, director of the Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy group. ''That hasn't happened in very many countries. If you look at the United States, poor people don't feel like they're very much a part of the system, and he did that.''
The dynamic was on full display Wednesday as enormous crowds thronged the streets to watch Mr. Chávez's modest brown wood coffin, covered in a Venezuelan flag, being carried through the capital, Caracas.
As the procession traveled from the hospital where he died to the military academy where he studied as a young, unheralded cadet, hundreds of thousands of mourners -- many dressed in his movement's characteristic red shirt -- chanted, cried, tossed flowers or held up cellphones to photograph the coffin as it passed. The procession stretched for miles, a river of red with drivers and motorcyclists trailing behind in an impromptu cortege.
''Chávez opened our eyes,'' said Carlos Pérez, 58, a cookie salesman who drove into town with his wife and took part in the caravan. ''We used to be stepped on. We felt humiliated.''
Of course, Mr. Chávez's government made its imprint in material ways as well. After long neglecting a housing shortage it has built tens of thousands of new homes and apartments in the last two years, and as a counterpoint to the neglect here in Los Corales, a small, well-run hospital in a nearby neighborhood called Macuto has become a symbol of rebirth after the 1999 mudslides.
A maternity hospital before the tragedy, it has expanded, with more than 200 babies born there each month and doctors performing hundreds of vital operations, including eye and breast cancer surgery. Its services are free.
But the hospital, which officials said was one of only three in a state of 352,000 people, is also an example of the contradictions of Mr. Chávez's revolution: it took more than a decade to get it fully back in operation.
''It was very slow,'' said Dr. Luz Stella Antolinez, the hospital director, who opened the facility in October 2010. ''What was missing was the will to get things done.''
Still, Dr. Antolinez called Mr. Chávez a historical figure with the stature of Simón Bolívar, the South American independence hero, or even Joan of Arc.
''He changed our consciousness,'' Dr. Antolinez said. ''Venezuela will not go back to what it was. All these millions of people, for 14 years the president spoke to them, now they know they are worth something.''
Ideologically, Mr. Chávez was something of a chameleon, taking on and shedding policies and programs as they suited him.
He was a self-described socialist who expropriated private businesses and property but looked the other way as opportunists enriched themselves off government contracts.
He preached about economic independence and created chains of subsidized grocery stores but neglected agriculture and relied heavily on imported food.
He excoriated capitalists and lectured about service to the country but tolerated or ignored widespread corruption.
He condemned the United States at every turn but depended on it to buy the oil that made his movement possible. He spoke of a people's right to self-determination but allied himself with tyrants in Libya, Syria and Iran.
Mr. Chávez mined and deepened the divide between the masses of Venezuela's poor and the middle and upper classes, presiding over a bitterly divided country. He mercilessly taunted and insulted those who disagreed with him, calling them fascists, good-for-nothings, traitors, oligarchs, reactionaries and puppets of the United States.
And he warned ceaselessly of enemies, inside and outside the country, who he said were poised to take away from the poor the benefits they had received under his government.
Conditions for the poor have certainly improved over the last decade and a half, and the ranks of the poor have shrunk. Government programs have given poor people access to low-cost food and free health care and have knocked down barriers to higher education, though many of those programs are plagued by inefficiencies and long waits.
Venezuela has the world's largest reserves of crude oil, and the economy rises and falls with the oil industry. When Mr. Chávez first took office, oil was selling for less than $10 a barrel. This year it has sold for more than $100.
Those oil riches have fueled his movement, but critics say his policies, including the expropriation of private companies and price controls, have hobbled the economy, led to shortages of basic goods and created a system that cannot be sustained. Oil production has stagnated, and the state-run oil company has failed to make the enormous investments needed to increase it. A blast at a refinery in August killed dozens of people and raised questions about maintenance and safety.
Investment in other crucial areas of the economy, including the electrical network, has been deficient and in much of the country there are regular power failures. Roads and bridges are in bad shape, bottlenecks at ports are common and, despite the sustained increase in oil prices, the country has the lowest cumulative rate of economic growth among the seven largest economies in South America since 1999, according to United Nations data.
Mr. Chávez named his movement after his hero, Bolívar, and vowed to created what he called 21st-century socialism. But exactly what that is can be hard to define.
''There's not a lot of ideological coherence in Chavismo,'' said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy group. ''It is a mood, a sensibility, a real rejection of the traditional political order, a concern for greater social justice, greater participation by those who are excluded.''
Mr. Chávez prided himself on winning election after election, and his government put in place a digital voting system that is considered generally free of fraud. His opponents called Venezuela's elections free but not fair, pointing to huge government resources spent on his campaigns.
Mr. Chávez also did away with the democratic separation of powers. A pliant legislature granted him the power to dictate laws on his own. And he dominated the judiciary, where loyal judges dependably ruled in his favor. He used government-run television and radio stations as part of a powerful propaganda machine and forced the country's most-viewed broadcaster, RCTV, which vigorously promoted an opposition agenda, off the air.
The corollary to Mr. Chávez's aggressive advocacy for the poor at home was his attack on the United States.
With a defiant anti-imperialist discourse, he led a group of nations, including Cuba, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Bolivia, with leftist governments dedicated to diminishing American influence. And he helped form and strengthen broader regional groups, like Unasur, an organization of South American nations, that stressed Latin American identity and tilted the balance further away from the United States.
Meanwhile, this coastal city continues to struggle on its long road to recovery from the 1999 mudslides. Two large waterfront hotels that once provided hundreds of jobs and drew millions of tourism dollars have never reopened. A plan to rehabilitate them in time for the South American Beach Games, scheduled to take place here in December, was recently abandoned, according to local news reports. For many, the vacant rooms are yet another symbol of broken promises. But for others, they are an unlikely sign of Mr. Chávez's empowerment of the poor and his rejection of an international order dominated by the rich.
Benjamín José Astudillo, 50, whose family runs a small restaurant on the beach, near a stretch of sand once reserved for guests of the Sheraton, said Mr. Chávez wanted the beach to be for Venezuelans, not ''the gringos.'' He added, ''The gringos aren't going to come here anymore.''

HEADLINE: A Leader's Cry In Venezuela: 'I Am Chávez'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and GINGER THOMPSON; William Neuman reported from Caracas, and Ginger Thompson from New York. Reporting was contributed by Lizette Alvarez from Miami; María Iguarán from Cumaná, Venezuela; Clifford Krauss from Houston; and Simon Romero from Caracas.

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- In the weeks leading up to his mentor's death, Vice President Nicolás Maduro's imitations of President Hugo Chávez became ever more apparent.
He has taken on many of Mr. Chávez's vocal patterns and speech rhythms, and has eagerly repeated the slogan ''I am Chávez'' to crowds of supporters. He has mimicked the president's favorite themes -- belittling the political opposition and warning of mysterious plots to destabilize the country, even implying that the United States was behind Mr. Chávez's cancer.
He has also adopted the president's clothes, walking beside his coffin in an enormous procession on Wednesday wearing a windbreaker with the national colors of yellow, blue and red, as Mr. Chávez often did.
But now that Mr. Chávez is gone, the big question being raised here is whether Mr. Maduro, his chosen successor, will continue to mirror the president and his unconventional governing style -- or veer off in his own direction. 
''He can't just stand there and say 'I am the Mini-Me of Chávez and now you have to follow me,' '' said Maxwell A. Cameron of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
The puzzlement over what sort of leader Mr. Maduro will prove to be extends to Washington, where American policy makers have been feeling out Mr. Maduro for months, years even, to determine whether he might provide an opening for closer ties between the two nations.
American officials say Mr. Chávez, despite his very public denunciations of Washington, worked behind the scenes to keep trade relations between the two countries, especially in the oil sector, strong. They recalled how Mr. Chávez once picked up the phone and dialed an American diplomat to talk policy, an odd move for a leader who more than once barred American ambassadors from Caracas and regularly denounced Washington and its leaders, sometimes using barnyard epithets. ''The United States needs to fix this,'' Mr. Chávez said during the call, which concerned the ouster of the Honduran president in 2009. ''You are the only ones who can.''
Beneath the bluster, American diplomats and analysts said, Mr. Chávez could be a pragmatist, albeit a sometimes bombastic one, and they hope Mr. Maduro will prove to be even more of one.
''I know Nicolás Maduro well,'' said William D. Delahunt, a former Massachusetts member of Congress. ''I know he's a pragmatist.''
The United States reached out to Mr. Maduro last November to gauge interest in improving the relationship. He responded positively, and the two nations held three informal meetings in Washington, the last one taking place after it was clear that Mr. Chávez's condition was severe, American officials said.
The Venezuelans wanted to once again exchange ambassadors, but Washington insisted on smaller steps to build trust, and it seemed that a tentative plan was in place, American officials said. But then the talks stalled this year and have not resumed, leaving American officials wondering about Mr. Maduro's true intentions toward the United States.
''Maduro is just beginning to govern and create his own identity,'' a State Department official said. ''I don't believe we had ever concluded one way or another whether he was a moderating influence. Our effort to reach out and create a more productive relationship was not based on a belief that he would be easier to deal with necessarily.''
Most diplomats and political analysts agree that the start of the post-Chávez landscape looked bleak; Mr. Maduro accused the United States of plotting against the country and expelled two American military attachés. But some observers saw the moves as an overtly calculated -- one analyst called it ''inelegant'' -- attempt by Mr. Maduro to unify a traumatized country bracing for Mr. Chávez's death, appeal to the president's supporters and propel his own chances of winning an election to succeed him.
''Maduro has to be careful about every step he takes, and every word he utters about the United States,'' said one senior American official who is closely watching developments here. ''How he is going to handle that pressure is the big unknown. We're about to find out.''
One past sign of Mr. Maduro's willingness to listen to critics -- which was not one of Mr. Chávez's strong points -- was his attendance at meetings with members of the Venezuelan opposition that were held in the United States after a 2002 coup that briefly removed Mr. Chávez. The sessions were organized by Mr. Delahunt and took place in Hyannis Port, Mass., prompting participants to call themselves ''El Grupo de Boston.''
But more recently Mr. Maduro has shown himself as a hard-liner, lashing out at his political enemies and lambasting Henrique Capriles Radonski, the state governor he will probably face in the election, for his recent trip to New York.
Among oil executives and analysts, there was cautious optimism that Mr. Chávez's death could soften the hostility his government had toward foreign investment in exploration and refining. ''It makes sense that Maduro will be more pragmatic to get the country going,'' said Jorge R. Piñon, former president of Amoco Oil Latin America. He said he had talked with several oil executives and come away surprised by their optimism.
''Industry executives believe that there is a high probability that a Maduro administration will be a bit more realistic on what is needed to increase the country's oil production,'' Mr. Piñon added, ''and change the investment model to attract more foreign investment.''
On the streets, the vast majority of Chávez supporters say they will vote for Mr. Maduro, often for the simple reason that Mr. Chávez told them to before he succumbed to cancer. At the procession on Wednesday, some actually chanted as the coffin passed, ''Chávez, I swear it, I will vote for Maduro!''
But there are some Chávez loyalists who say they are unhappy with Mr. Maduro, at times for reasons that illuminate the drawbacks inherent in his political mimicry.
In the eastern city of Cumaná on Wednesday, some ardent Chávez supporters said they found Mr. Maduro's constant attacks on the political opposition too jarring -- a startling assertion, since Mr. Maduro uses virtually identical language to the phrases popularized by Mr. Chávez, repeating the same insults and put-downs, calling his opponents ''good-for-nothings'' and accusing them of selling out the country to the United States.
But coming from Mr. Maduro, the same words seem to have a different impact.
''I don't like Maduro because I feel that he does things that incite hatred, which is not a revolutionary feeling,'' said Luis Marcano, 67, an unemployed cook in Cumaná.
Mr. Maduro, whose father was involved in left-wing politics, became a political activist as a young man, joining a group called the Socialist League, traveling to Cuba at one point for political training. Back in Caracas, he took a job as a bus driver and then shifted to union activities.
Eventually, he became involved with Mr. Chávez, who staged a failed coup in 1992. Mr. Maduro fought to have Mr. Chávez released from prison and then worked on his first presidential campaign in 1998. He became a legislator and then president of the National Assembly.
He later served six years as Mr. Chávez's foreign minister before he was named vice president after the president's re-election in October.
During that long career by Mr. Chávez's side, Mr. Maduro earned a reputation as an agile survivor of the inner circle, where absolute loyalty was a prerequisite. He was seen by many as a yes-man who kept his position by hewing closely to his boss and taking care not to outshine or contradict him.
''Nicolás Maduro is a soldier that has to obey orders, just like any other,'' said Rommel Salazar, 40, a teacher and musician in Cumaná. ''I will vote for him because I must obey Chávez's instructions.''
But he added a warning, saying that if Mr. Maduro does not adhere to the line set by Mr. Chávez, his followers will hold him accountable. ''He will have nailed himself to the cross,'' Mr. Salazar said.

HEADLINE: Venezuelans Recall Leader's Love of Game

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- Luis Sojo, manager of Venezuela's national team, likes to sleep in. But on mornings after games he expected a call from Hugo Chávez, the country's president, who died on Tuesday.
Like his hero, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Chávez was an ardent baseball fan who loved to chat about the game, especially with Sojo, a former Yankees infielder. After one World Baseball Classic game, Chávez called to ask why Sojo had not used his closer, Francisco Rodriguez, during the middle innings when Venezuela had given up a lead. 
''He loved baseball, and he knows everybody on the team,'' Sojo said Wednesday before Venezuela beat the Mets, 14-10, in the country's last game before it plays the Dominican Republic in a Pool C first-round game on Thursday in San Juan, P.R. ''The country is very sad now, so we said, 'Let's win it for him.' ''
Chávez used his cultlike following to champion the poor and pump up the country's pride. But he also left the country's economy in tatters and its cities plagued by crime.
Sojo and his players steered clear of discussing Chávez's politics and policies, in part because some of them were concerned about the safety of their families back home. Instead, they focused on the president's love of the game and his death.
''Everybody knows that there are two sides, but at the same time, we all feel bad about it because he is a human being,'' said Rockies outfielder Carlos Gonzalez, who played right field on Wednesday. ''We are dedicating our game to the whole country. I think a lot of people just breathe baseball in our country and expect great things from this team. That's why we have a lot of responsibility.''
The vocal Venezuelan fans who attended the game Wednesday were not as shy. Many had traveled from Venezuela, while others had emigrated to the United States in part because of better opportunities.
''I'm not happy he died, but I'm happy we might have a change in our country, and hopefully we'll go in a different direction,'' said Leonardo Solorzano, an electrical engineer from Sarasota, Fla., who moved to the United States 11 years ago. ''If there is no Chávez, there is no Chavismo.''
Chávez's death produced an awkward moment for Major League Baseball. Before Venezuela played the Miami Marlins in Jupiter, Fla., on Tuesday, representatives of the Venezuelan team asked for their country's flag to be lowered and a moment of silence for Chávez to be observed before the game. Both requests were denied.
Major League Baseball, which runs the W.B.C., takes its cue in such matters from the State Department. Chávez was no friend of the United States, and relations with Venezuela were further strained this week when two American military attachés were ordered to leave the country after they were accused of sowing disorder.
Baseball officials want to leave politics out of the ballparks, but they offered to help the Venezuelans with anything they wanted away from the field.
United States and Venezuelan flags were flying at full staff at Tradition Field on Wednesday.
The Mets appeared flummoxed by being thrust on an international stage. But Johan Santana, a Venezuelan, broke the ice. Santana wanted to pitch for his national team, but nearing 34 and recovering from injuries, he was asked by the Mets -- for the second straight tournament -- to focus instead on getting ready for the season.
After finishing his workout in left field on Wednesday, Santana visited the Venezuelan team, which was stretching along the first baseline. He hugged and joked with Miguel Cabrera, Rodriguez and several of the team's other stars.
As Santana passed by, Sojo jokingly yelled in his direction, ''You were supposed to pitch for me today; what happened?''
Santana, who is from the town of Tovar Merida, met Chávez in 2004 after he won the first of his two Cy Young Awards. He was honored at the presidential palace in Caracas and addressed the national assembly.
He is not the only link between the Mets and Chávez. On an official visit to the United States in 1999, shortly after he was elected president, Chávez threw out the first pitch at Shea Stadium and met with Edgardo Alfonzo, the Mets' Venezuelan-born second baseman. The game was better remembered for the behavior of Manager Bobby Valentine, who was ejected and returned to the bench wearing a fake mustache.
In August 2010, Chávez phoned Rodriguez, then the Mets' closer, who had been arraigned on charges that he assaulted the grandfather of his children after blowing a save at Citi Field. Chávez told Rodriguez that Venezuela was proud of him but also said, ''Calm your impulses.''
Santana and Rodriguez are two of the many Venezuelans to play for the Mets. The first was Elio Chacon, who played in the team's inaugural season in 1962.
More than two dozen of his countrymen have followed, including Alfonzo, who helped the Mets reach the World Series in 2000. The Mets were so impressed with his play that they sent scouts to scour the country looking for other stars. They also expanded their relationship with Magallanes, the team Alfonzo played for in Venezuela.
More recently, Dave Hudgens, the Mets' hitting coach, managed in the Venezuelan Winter League, winning a championship in 2010. Hudgens understands the passion for baseball in Venezuela and the need for the team to play well, a topic that Rodriguez addressed on Wednesday.
''The best thing we can give them is to be able to put on a good show,'' he said. ''Not forget what happened, because we're not going to erase it in two, three days, but at least give us a little serenity, bring some positive energy to them.''

HEADLINE: Amid Cuts, Does a President Dare Tee Off?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Fair or not, the extracurricular lives of American presidents are often measured by how they compare with the everyday pursuits of the people they lead.
And so as the nation's federal workers and others prepare to tighten their belts amid budget cuts, reduced overtime and furloughs, it is inevitable that someone would ask the question about President Obama and golf.
It came this week from, among others, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and Republican presidential candidate, who expressed outrage that the White House had canceled daily tours of 1600 Pennsylvania at the behest of the Secret Service, which said its officers were needed more elsewhere. 
''Canceling White House tours is childish and dishonest,'' Mr. Gingrich said on Twitter, citing a recent golf vacation the president took to the Floridian Yacht and Golf Club resort with a handful of friends and his Secret Service entourage. ''The golf weekend in Florida cost enough to keep the White House open for months.''
Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, even proposed an amendment that would prohibit the president from going on any more golf trips at federal expense until the tours resume at the White House.
Ari Fleischer, press secretary to President George W. Bush, said: ''If George Bush were playing golf while this was under way, there would be pandemonium in the press corps about it.''
For Mr. Obama, the months ahead will be tricky. Few people object to a president taking some time to relax -- to work out, play basketball, sit on a beach, go to dinner. And like all presidents before him, Mr. Obama does all those things with the costly machinery of government orbiting around him.
But the budget cuts known as sequestration are going to have an outsize effect on government workers who, like Mr. Obama, get their paycheck from the federal treasury. Some will be furloughed as often as once a week. Others will lose overtime, forcing them to cancel vacations or trim household expenses.
Officials said the White House staff would be affected, too. Some people will be furloughed, some nonessential equipment purchases will be delayed, and some staff members -- though, by law, not the president himself -- will be subject to reduced salaries.
''People are going to be hurt,'' Mr. Obama declared just hours before the cuts went into effect last week.
So the president's White House advisers are going to have to confront the question of how, or whether, to adjust his family's activities. Should they go to Martha's Vineyard? Will Michelle Obama and the couple's daughters avoid trips like the ski vacation they took to Aspen last month? And what about the golf that Mr. Obama frequently plays at the nearby Joint Base Andrews?
Mr. Fleischer pointed out that the Pentagon's leaders have warned that the budget cuts will have a serious impact on the readiness of the nation's military. ''What does it say about a sequester if a military golf course can stay open during it?'' he said.
Charlie Black, a Republican consultant, said presidents deserved some time off, but added that Mr. Obama was vulnerable to criticism because he and his advisers ''blew way out of proportion'' the impact of the cuts.
''Maybe the crisis the president inflated will be alleviated enough for him to go to Martha's Vineyard in August,'' Mr. Black said.
A White House adviser said he did not know what Mr. Obama's plans were for trips in the coming months, but he said the president's staff would consider the impact of the budget cuts at the time.
''It's too early to say,'' said Josh Earnest, the deputy White House press secretary. ''But he is the president of the United States wherever he goes, 24 hours a day. People don't begrudge him taking a little time off.''
If the past is any guide, Mr. Obama tends to push ahead with life outside his day job even when it is sure to risk criticism.
The Obamas spent a week at an estate in Martha's Vineyard in 2009 and 2010, even as the economic crisis was still gripping the country. In 2011, he went to the island just after the debt crisis fight but left early after an earthquake hit Washington and Hurricane Irene headed toward the East Coast.
Mr. Obama has also traveled to Hawaii each year in late December and his family has taken short vacations to Yosemite and the mountains of North Carolina. Mrs. Obama, her daughter Sasha and some friends took a trip to Spain in the summer of 2010 that drew criticism for its cost.
Such is the life of a modern president and his family. The first President Bush was mocked as out of touch when he was seen on a speedboat in Kennebunkport, Maine, during an economic downturn. President Bill Clinton hobnobbed with Hollywood glitterati and took heat for it.
And like Mr. Obama, the second President Bush was criticized for his frequent golf outings, which sometimes made him seem disconnected from the grim task of leading a nation in war.
For Mr. Obama, the golf weekend in Florida last month drew criticism at the time. But that was before budget cuts that officials say will build in intensity over the spring and summer.
For now, aides say they know of no plans for another such outing.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Ties In a Prospect For Deputy At the S.E.C.

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Mary Jo White, set to become a top Wall Street regulator, is seeking to allay skepticism about her spins through the revolving door between government service and private practice.
Yet even as she confronts concerns about her work for JPMorgan Chase in financial crisis cases and Morgan Stanley's board in vetting a chief executive, she is turning to a colleague who has trod a similar path.
Andrew J. Ceresney, who served as Ms. White's lieutenant as both a defense lawyer and as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, is a leading candidate to ultimately become her enforcement chief at the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people briefed on the matter. A Washington outsider and relative unknown beyond legal circles, Mr. Ceresney would help set the tone for policing financial fraud, effectively making him a top cop on Wall Street. 
He could join as soon as spring, potentially serving as co-chief with the agency's acting head of enforcement, the people briefed on the matter said.
But the job is not yet his. Ms. White, who is expected to sail through a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, must first confront questions about her ties to Wall Street. And Mr. Ceresney (pronounced Sir-rez-ney) could heighten such scrutiny.
At the S.E.C., Mr. Ceresney, 41, would have to police some of the same firms he spent a decade defending.
After working at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, he built a lucrative legal practice at Debevoise & Plimpton. At the firm, he represented the likes of Kenneth D. Lewis, the former chief executive of Bank of America who faced regulatory investigations over the bank's hasty takeover of Merrill Lynch during the depths of the financial crisis.
Mr. Ceresney, who defended JPMorgan from federal inquiries into wrongful foreclosure practices, also worked side by side with clients under scrutiny for selling toxic mortgage securities at the height of the housing boom.
His career path mirrors that of Ms. White, who alternated between Debevoise and the federal government for three decades.
During stints as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn and later as the first woman to be United States attorney in Manhattan, she helped oversee the prosecution of the crime figure John Gotti and directed the case against those responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. She left in 2002 with the reputation as a tenacious prosecutor with an independent streak.
Since then, at Debevoise, she has represented nearly every big bank on Wall Street. Her clients included JPMorgan Chase, UBS and Michael Geoghegan, the former head of HSBC.
To avert potential conflicts stemming from her work on behalf of Wall Street giants, Ms. White had already agreed to recuse herself for one year from most matters that involve former clients. Ms. White also vowed ''as far as can be foreseen'' never to return to Debevoise and plans to soon cut financial ties with the firm.
Some Senate Banking Committee members are not satisfied. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, has questioned whether Ms. White's pledge to avoid matters involving former clients would undercut her ability to run the agency. Mr. Ceresney would probably follow Ms. White's lead and recuse himself from certain cases, an important ethical move but also a potential hindrance to his authority.
The questions surrounding the revolving door illustrate how, even as Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney prepare to usher in a new era at the S.E.C., the agency is dogged by old concerns. While the agency has mounted cases against Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street giants, consumer advocates continue to complain that the enforcement unit remains too timid.
But there is another school of thought on the revolving door -- that it actually bolsters prosecutorial instincts. Anyone fit to shine a light on the darkest corners of Wall Street, S.E.C. officials say, must navigate its ins and outs. The arguments echo claims that Franklin Delano Roosevelt picked the famed financier Joseph P. Kennedy as the first S.E.C. chairman because Kennedy ''knew where the bodies were buried.''
Mr. Ceresney could also breathe new life into the enforcement unit as it enters a critical phase.
Some enforcement officials, according to people briefed on the matter, are seeking a leadership overhaul after the recent departure of Robert Khuzami, who revamped the unit after it missed years of warning signs of the Ponzi scheme operated by Bernard L. Madoff.
''Coming out of Madoff you needed a guy like Khuzami who was going to reform the place,'' said Thomas A. Sporkin, a senior S.E.C. enforcement official until last year when he departed for BuckleySandler. ''This next person has to boost morale and broaden the agenda.''
Mr. Ceresney, however, is unlikely to present a radical shift from his predecessor, given their similar résumés. Mr. Khuzami cut his teeth prosecuting terrorists for Ms. White when she was the United States attorney in Manhattan.
Mr. Ceresney's potential arrival also coincides with the tenure of another protégé of Ms. White, George Canellos, who became the S.E.C.'s interim enforcement chief last month. The pair, believed to be friends, are expected to overlap for a while, people briefed on the matter said.
Mr. Ceresney, a Yale Law School graduate who clerked for Judge Michael Mukasey, the former United States attorney general who is now a partner at Debevoise, would also inherit a deep bench of investigators. David P. Bergers, director of the S.E.C.'s Boston office who slid into the deputy role under Mr. Canellos, could continue as the enforcement unit's No. 2. Matthew T. Martens, the enforcement division's chief litigation counsel, and Daniel Hawke, who leads the market abuse unit, are also among the officials who have received consideration for more senior roles.
An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Debevoise.
The news of Mr. Ceresney's possible hire comes as the American Bar Association's annual conference on white-collar crime gets under way. More than 1,000 criminal defense lawyers and government prosecutors from across the country have convened at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas for three days of symposiums and panels. Among the sessions is ''The New Landscape of Insider Trading Cases,'' featuring Mr. Khuzami, the outgoing enforcement chief.
Colleagues on Wednesday said Mr. Ceresney, who lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two children, was a brilliant lawyer and noted that, unlike Mr. Khuzami, is not an imposing figure. One former colleague described him like this: ''short in stature but long on brains.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Endangered or Not, but at Least No Longer Waiting

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
Perhaps it does not seem cause for celebration that the Oregon spotted frog, a four-inch-long amphibian that prefers the Pacific Northwest's dwindling marshy spots, is to be considered this year for federal protection as an endangered species.
Tell that to the frog. It has been languishing for 22 years -- since 1991 -- awaiting its day in the bureaucratic sun.
The eastern massasauga rattlesnake has been a candidate for protection since 1982, a legless bridesmaid, never a bride. Ditto the elfin-woods warbler. Like them, the Dakota skipper butterfly, a cucumber-bodied flier that zips unusually fast (for a butterfly) over the Minnesota and Dakota prairies, is dying out as development shrinks its habitat. It nevertheless has hung on, its candidacy deferred since 1975.
Belatedly, the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service is giving them all -- and 258 more -- a thumbs up or down for protection under the Endangered Species Act, the 1973 law that was among the early triumphs of the environmental movement. 
It is evidence of the law's travails that it took a federal judge to get them to this point.
Under a 2011 settlement of two lawsuits by conservation activists, the wildlife service has pledged to decide the fates of all the backlogged species by 2018. A schedule issued by the service on Feb. 8 promised to decide by September whether to add 97 species to the endangered list, including 70 covered by the lawsuit settlement.
Moreover, the service has finished preliminary work on more than 550 other potential candidates for the endangered-species list, almost all of which will be further evaluated after the backlog is erased.
''They've dramatically increased the number of decisions they're making -- both positive and negative decisions, but the vast majority of decisions are positive,'' said Kierán Suckling, the executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, an Arizona conservation organization that is a party to the settlement.
It is the most feverish activity on imperiled wildlife in two decades, an improbable feat amid ferocious attacks from conservative critics and in an economy with little money to spare for environmental frivolities.
The wildlife service, the steward of most of the 1,400 species on the endangered list, casts the settlement as an opportunity to get back to its mission.
''We accomplished what we wanted to do through the settlement negotiations: to really reduce the litigation so we could have more control over our priorities and focus our limited resources on the species that need attention the most,'' Gary Frazer, who heads the agency's endangered-species unit, said in an interview. ''We definitely see it as a good thing.''
The hundreds of backlogged candidates have waited ''an unacceptably long time'' for final consideration, he said.
Skeptics might ask whether any species that can wait decades for listing was endangered to begin with. The answer, experts say, is that some aren't; the wildlife service is likely to remove some from consideration after re-evaluation. But most of the rest are probably in declines lasting decades that would not be arrested without outside help.
''Extinction is not an event. It's a process,'' said Patrick A. Parenteau, an expert on the law at the Vermont Law School in South Royalton, Vt. Habitats slowly shrink, populations wither, inbreeding increases and a species weakens until some outside force -- a storm, a fire, a dry spell -- administers the coup de grâce. The Interior Department said in 1990 that 34 species had gone extinct while awaiting decisions on listing.
The reasons for the backlog vary. Past lawsuits by conservationists forced the wildlife service to spend time and money on tasks like designating protected habitats for already listed wildlife instead of considering new candidates, Mr. Frazer said. Outsiders say chronic budget shortages, past mismanagement and, most recently, politics have also added to the delays.
Under President George W. Bush, ''a lot of the management of the program was taken out of the Fish and Wildlife Service and put in hands of political appointees,'' Jamie Rappaport Clark, president of Defenders of Wildlife and a wildlife service director under President Bill Clinton, said in an interview. One Interior Department official resigned in mid-2007 amid charges of politicizing the listing process.
Mr. Frazer, who also headed the endangered species program during Mr. Bush's first years in office, was demoted to liaison to the United States Geological Survey from 2004 to 2008.
Conservationists say that President Obama is somewhat more supportive. But activists, not the government, are behind the law's revival. During Mr. Bush's presidency and early in Mr. Obama's, the Center for Biological Diversity and a Colorado group, WildEarth Guardians, went on the offense, bombarding the wildlife agency with demands to consider hundreds of new species for endangered status.
When the Fish and Wildlife Service said it could not respond within legal time limits, the conservation groups sued to force a response, reaching the 2011 settlement after lengthy negotiations.
Should many of the 800-plus species listed in the settlement be granted federal protection, as seems most likely eventually, the endangered list could increase as much as 60 percent -- and encompass more territory than ever before.
That could prompt a salvo of legal challenges to listings from businesses and conservative activists. They say that a greatly expanded endangered species list is almost certain to affect more areas and lead to more responses from affected industries.
''Once they start listing these critters, they're going to set off reactions,'' Mr. Parenteau said. ''There's no way they can insulate themselves from being challenged.''
The petroleum industry has already raised concerns about the potential listing of two species, the lesser prairie chicken and the Gunnison sage-grouse, whose habitats, stretching across the Great Plains and Southwest, have been carved up by farms, oil exploration and other development. The wildlife service is poised to decide by September whether the sage-grouse will join the endangered list and whether to declare more than 2,600 square miles of its range ''critical habitat.'' Such habitats can require special efforts to protect imperiled species, but large portions, including all existing developed land, are excluded.
In a November letter asking for a public hearing on the settlement, the Independent Petroleum Association of America warned that ''the pure depth and breadth of these settlement agreements could harm our membership'' and slow oil and gas exploration.
A spokeswoman, Julia Bell, added, however, that the industry and state governments were making voluntary conservation efforts in hopes of heading off federal action.
Developers are increasingly anxious over the possible listing of more than 400 mussels that live in rivers close to urban areas, mainly in the Southeast.
''You're looking at a doubling of species in areas that are economically stressed'' from the collapse of the housing market, Michael Mittelholzer, an assistant staff vice president at the National Association of Home Builders, said in an interview.
Developers who build near endangered species can be required by the Clean Water Act and other measures to acquire federal permits and to avoid adversely affecting imperiled wildlife. Mr. Mittelholzer said acquiring permits is lengthy and complex, and the definition of adverse impact vague.
''Put that in the context of an industry trying to show some green shoots, and it could be very difficult,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Posters on Teenage Pregnancy Draw Fire

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
The curly-haired baby looks out from the poster with sad eyes and tears dripping down his tawny cheeks.
''I'm twice as likely not to graduate high school because you had me as a teen,'' the text next to his head reads.
In another poster, a dark-skinned little girl casts her eyes to the sky and says, ''Honestly Mom ... chances are he won't stay with you. What happens to me?'' 
These images, part of a public education campaign targeting teenage pregnancy that the city unveiled this week, are drawing mounting criticism from reproductive health advocates, women who had children as teenagers, and others who say they reinforce negative stereotypes about teenage mothers without offering any information to help girls prevent unplanned pregnancies.
The criticism escalated Wednesday into a sharp exchange between the mayor's office and Planned Parenthood of New York City, typically an ally of the administration on reproductive health matters. Planned Parenthood issued a statement denouncing the poster campaign, saying that it ignored the racial, economic and social factors that contribute to teenage pregnancy and instead stigmatized teenage parents and their children.
The mayor's office responded, saying that it was ''past time'' to be ''value neutral'' about teenage pregnancy and that it was important to ''send a strong message that teen pregnancy has consequences -- and those consequences are extremely negative, life-altering and most often disproportionately borne by young women.''
Haydee Morales, vice president for education and training at Planned Parenthood of New York City, said the organization was ''shocked and taken aback'' by the tone of the new campaign.
''Hurting and shaming communities is not what's going to bring teen pregnancy rates down,'' she added.
She said that the campaign's message -- that teenage pregnancy leads to poverty -- was backward.
''It's not teen pregnancies that cause poverty, but poverty that causes teen pregnancy,'' she said.
The posters -- many of which bear the tagline, ''Think being a teen parent won't cost you?'' and emphasize the expense of raising a child -- have been put up in bus shelters in neighborhoods with high rates of teenage pregnancy and will be installed in subways next week.
The Bloomberg administration has aggressively sought to reduce teenage pregnancy by mandating sex education in public schools and by empowering high school nurses to provide birth control, including the morning-after pill.
The city's teenage pregnancy rate has declined by 27 percent in the past decade, roughly equaling the national rate of decline. Nearly 9 out of 10 teenage pregnancies in the city are unplanned, according to the Bloomberg administration.
According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a child born to a teenage mother who has not finished high school and is not married is nine times more likely to be poor than a child born to an adult who has finished high school and is married.
Robert Doar, commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration, said the campaign's goal was to send a message about personal responsibility that would resonate with teenagers.
''We think it's important to speak frankly and in a way that people will hear about the responsibilities of parenthood and the responsibilities of raising a child,'' he said.
The city spent about two years and over $400,000 producing the campaign, which included hiring a marketing firm to conduct focus groups with teenagers, as well as with the parents of teenagers, and with parents who had children when they were teenagers.
The posters include a number to text to receive facts about teenage pregnancy and to play a game about a pregnant teenager, Anaya, and her boyfriend, Louis. Via text messages, the game chronicles a series of challenges facing Anaya and Louis and asks the person playing the game what they should do, which the player indicates by texting a response. The humiliations Anaya faces drive home a message that teenage pregnancy leads to family conflict, social isolation and poverty.
''My BFF called me a 'fat loser' at prom,'' Anaya says in a typical exchange. (The city has since changed ''fat loser'' to simply ''loser.'') In other examples, Anaya's father calls her ''stupid,''' and her best friend stops talking to her.
Carolina Pichardo, 30, of Manhattan, who became pregnant with her daughter from an unplanned pregnancy when she was 18, said she was upset and angry when she saw the ads, because they reinforced the shame that she said teenage mothers already felt too strongly. ''I felt like a statistic,'' she said of becoming a teenage mother. ''When they use those same statistics against us, it doesn't really help, because we already feel like we're a part of it.''

HEADLINE: From One Budget Fight to the Next

 BODY:
Unable to stop the sequester's job-killing spending cuts, President Obama now says he wants to move past the endless wars of budget attrition. Though he still wants a long-term deficit deal, he said last week, it is time to turn to immigration, gun control, universal preschool, a higher minimum wage and voting reform. 
But Republicans are not going to allow that pivot. Most are unalterably opposed to all of those initiatives, and want to keep their focus on cutting domestic programs and fighting off tax increases. At a time when Republicans are divided on many social issues, the budget wars are one of the few things that unite them.
A variety of insidious new budget proposals are now emerging from the House. On Wednesday, by a 267-to-151 vote, the House approved a stopgap spending resolution to keep the government running for the last half of the fiscal year, replacing the one that expires on March 27.
Such ''continuing resolutions,'' which fund the government at the previous year's level, demonstrate Congress's inability to do its most basic job of making spending decisions. But this new resolution is worse because it also includes the sequester's brutal cuts -- except in a few crucial areas that are Republican priorities.
The House bill would give the Pentagon a brand-new budget, allowing it to make the cuts in low-priority areas, preventing the reductions in military readiness that generals have been warning about. It prevents staffing cuts in the Border Patrol, and adds money for Israel and embassy security. It makes health care reform a target for special cuts, and even specifies that no money is to be spent on the community group known as Acorn, though that group has not existed since 2010.
But it allows no flexibility or extra money to prevent cuts to programs like unemployment benefits, nutrition aid, housing assistance and education grants. Republicans do not care about those programs and left the sequester cuts in place for them. Simple fairness demands that Senate Democrats call for equal flexibility and money for the most important domestic programs in their version of the bill, as Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, the new Appropriations Committee chairwoman, has vowed to do. (Mr. Obama already said that he would not use the threat of a government shutdown to fight the sequester cuts, rejecting the extortionate tactics Republicans regularly use.)
The Republicans have made it clear that the spending fight will never cease. They haven't promised not to abuse the next debt-ceiling increase, necessary in the next few months, to get further cuts. And Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, will soon unveil his caucus's 2014 budget, which will start to make good on the party's ruinous plan to balance the budget in 10 years. To do so, he is reviving his discredited proposal to turn Medicare into a voucher program, and considered making it worse by cutting benefits for people who are now 56 and younger; an earlier plan cut benefits for those 55 and below.
Republicans are hoping to wear down their opposition with these eternal battles. But their proposals are too dangerous to allow that to happen.

HEADLINE: Hugo Chávez

 BODY:
Hugo Chávez dominated Venezuelan politics for 14 years with his charismatic personality, populist policies and authoritarian methods before his death this week. His redistributionist policies brought better living conditions to millions of poor Venezuelans. But his legacy is stained by the undermining of democratic institutions and the embrace of malevolent foreign leaders like Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. 
There is no denying his popularity among Venezuela's impoverished majority. He won elections by devoting a substantial share of the country's oil income to building public housing, creating health clinics and making affordable food available to the poorest citizens. But there have also been shocking levels of corruption, shoddy construction, chronic shortages of basic goods, and neglect in the investment needed to maintain and increase oil production. Billions have been squandered through inept and careless management. And the financial ability to sustain Mr. Chávez's social programs has been seriously eroded.
His government weakened judicial independence, intimidated political opponents and human rights defenders, and ignored rampant, and often deadly, violence by the police and prison guards. On foreign policy, Mr. Chávez provided subsidized oil exports to Central America and Cuba, a major factor in keeping the Cuban economy afloat and Raúl Castro in power. But often his principal theme seemed to be taunting the United States.
During his final illness Mr. Chávez designated Vice President Nicolás Maduro as his political heir. Mr. Maduro will be the ruling United Socialist Party's presidential candidate in new elections in the coming month. He has no political base of his own and is sure to be challenged by rivals from Mr. Chávez's coalition of nationalist military officers, leftist civilians and government contractors, as well as center-right opposition forces.
Venezuela's future matters to Americans because its oil wealth makes it a major political and economic force in Latin America, and it supplies around 10 percent of the oil imported by the United States. The Bush administration badly damaged Washington's reputation throughout Latin America when it unwisely blessed a failed 2002 military coup attempt against Mr. Chávez. The United States should now make clear its support for democratic and civilian transition in a post-Chávez Venezuela.

HEADLINE: Carmakers in Europe Hope for Recovery in Free Trade With U.S.

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
GENEVA -- As the industry convenes here for the Geneva auto show amid the worst European car market slump in decades, there is at least one ray of hope: the green light President Barack Obama recently gave to negotiations for a U.S.-E.U. free-trade pact.
Prospects for a trade pact have brightened the spirits of automakers along with many other types of Continental companies. And not only because it might make it easier for their products to compete in America's giant consumer market.
European auto companies, particularly German ones, want to make it easier to sell cars they now make in the United States in their home markets. 
''I am a big advocate of a free-trade agreement with the United States,'' Norbert Reithofer, the chief executive of Bayerische Motoren Werke, said here on Tuesday. An agreement could add hundreds of millions of euros annually to BMW's revenue, in part by easing restrictions that now add tariffs to the cars his company makes in Spartanburg, South Carolina, but ships back to sell in Germany and other European countries.
Mercedes faces similar issues with the vehicles it makes in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Right now, a Mercedes M-Class utility vehicle made there carries a 10 percent European Union import tariff not levied on Mercedes sedans made in Rastatt, Germany.
Companies decide where to manufacture based on many factors including labor costs, taxes and currency risk. With a trade pact in place, though, tariffs and regulations might no longer need to be part of that calculation. Whether their business is cars, instant coffee or carbon steel, with corporations that work both sides of the Atlantic, the old-style notions of import-vs.-export and country of origin may no longer obtain.
European companies like Siemens, Nestlé and ThyssenKrupp have manufactured products in America for decades. But usually those were products destined for U.S. buyers. Once a free-trade pact is in place, it might make more sense for companies to export those products back to Europe.
The United States and the European Union are each other's biggest trading partners, and a pact is seen as a cheap way for both sides to generate growth. But European automakers in particular could use a lift. Europe's auto market has all but collapsed since the financial and economic crisis of 2007; last year, the number of vehicles sold in the Union was the lowest since the mid-1990s.
German automakers, which now sell more cars in the United States than they do in Germany, are particularly eager for a trade deal, which some optimists hope could be reached by the end of next year. A trade pact would no doubt intensify competition in the U.S. auto market, particularly at the premium end, by making it easier for BMW and Mercedes to export to the United States. But the benefits could also flow the other way.
What is more, a free-trade pact could create jobs in the United States, said Joachim Schmidt, a member of the Mercedes-Benz management board who is responsible for sales. Mercedes plans to manufacture the next generation of its C-Class sedan in Tuscaloosa as well as other locations beginning next year, Mr. Schmidt said during an interview here.
Momentum toward a pact has been building since Mr. Obama endorsed efforts to begin formal negotiations in his February State of the Union address.
While the negotiations will be complex, officials have already agreed informally on the broad outlines of a treaty in preliminary talks that concluded earlier this year. That is why trade representatives on both sides of the Atlantic have said they could reach a formal agreement by the end of 2014.
For the first time, said Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of Daimler, ''leadership on both sides have been in favor.'' But he quickly added, ''There is a still a long way to go.''
Tariffs are not the only issue. In the case of automakers, a trade accord ideally would harmonize safety requirements and emissions standards, so that the same car built in Europe could be sold in the United States, and vice versa, without modifying bumpers, headlights and other components.
Some industry executives are doubtful that American and European regulators can agree to accept each other's crash tests and other standards. ''It's very difficult to do,'' said Stephen T. Odell, president of Ford of Europe. The company is planning to export the Ford Mustang to Europe, which will also require various adjustments to meet European regulations.
Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Fiat and Chrysler, said here that he was concerned that efforts to synchronize regulations could lead to more red tape rather than less. But he noted: ''I have a lot of hope. President Obama made this an important item on his agenda. We're certainly willing to work with authorities to make it happen.''
A free-trade pact could help Fiat as it seeks to reintroduce its Alfa Romeo brand in the United States. Mr. Marchionne said the long-awaited return of Alfa would come this year when the company began selling its 4C sports car in America. Alfa presented the two-seat coupe in Geneva this week.
Noting that Dustin Hoffman drove an Alfa in the classic 1960s movie ''The Graduate,'' Mr. Marchionne said the brand had a good heritage in America and was ''uniquely revivable.''
Volkswagen could also benefit from a trade pact, though probably less than BMW or Mercedes. Since 2011, VW has been producing a version of its Passat in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which has helped revived its American sales. But the Passat built in Tennessee is designed for American consumers, and VW is not expected to export it to back to Europe.
Volkswagen's Audi unit, which has been able to improve U.S. sales recently, would also benefit from an accord. Audi builds most of its cars in Europe.
The European carmakers least likely to get much benefit from a trade deal the French companies.
Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroën abandoned the U.S. market decades ago, and as they struggle financially back home, it is unlikely they will return anytime soon.
There is also some wariness among the European manufacturers, like Ford, that focus on selling lower-priced models. They still feel burned by a trade pact with South Korea that they complain opened up Europe to Hyundai and Kia, which have been gaining market share, without providing reciprocal benefits to European companies -- mainly because the Korean domestic market is so relatively small.
Mr. Odell of Ford said that political leaders should not expose European carmakers to more competition from abroad, unless Europe's national political leaders were also going to stop interfering with their attempts to close unprofitable factories or otherwise cut costs. French carmakers have faced such resistance from Paris, for example, and General Motors' Opel unit in Germany has struggled with unions backed by state politicians.
''You have to allow people to restructure,'' Mr. Odell said. ''You can't have it both ways.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Witches Lose the Warts

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
Lena Duchannes is new in town, exotic and seductive to a handful of bored locals in the Southern community where she lives. But if that weren't enough to turn her into man bait, her pallid good looks would do the trick.
Lena, the sweet-and-sulky heroine of ''Beautiful Creatures,'' the film adapted from the young-adult novel of the same title, is a witch -- a caster, in the parlance of her kind -- who can, by a glance, shatter glass or summon a tempest or, when the spirit moves her, capture the heart of a hunky young man.
She is one in a coven of weird sisters who in recent months have darkened the plots of adolescent fiction and films, and cast an enchantment on the concert stage and the fashion runways, where witchy apparitions have come to represent a kind of wish fulfillment.
''The witch is the ultimate bad girl,'' said Carly Cushnie of the design team Cushnie et Ochs, who riffed on the Salem witch trials in the fall collection she unveiled last month. ''You want to be her.'' 
It's a concept, all right. Witchcraft and its moody expressions -- long weedy hair, peaked hats and pointy boots -- have attained a strange cachet of late. No longer the hideous wart-covered crone of folklore and fairy tale, the witch of current films, like ''Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters'' and ''Oz: The Great and Powerful,'' and recent youth-oriented novels like ''Released Souls'' and ''A Discovery of Witches,'' has swept aside the vampire as a symbol of power, glamour and style.
The Saint Laurent collection Hedi Slimane showed in Paris last fall, with its wide-brimmed hats, flowing capes and ethereal drifts of chiffon, had a whiff of sulfur about it. The line, as Mr. Slimane revealed, owed a debt to the kinds of self-anointed Gypsy sorceresses who thrived during the 1970s in subterranean Los Angeles, equal parts Stevie Nicks and Marjorie Cameron, the latter an urban legend in her day who painted pagan goddesses and dabbled in the occult arts.
Diaphanous frocks and mantles favored by Ms. Cameron, who died in 1995, and her spiritual kin have wafted into collections as diverse as those of Pamela Skaist-Levy and Gela Nash-Taylor, whose label, Skaist-Levy, was obliquely inspired by Ms. Cameron, and Thom Browne. With its chalk-faced models clad in white tights and sharp-shouldered goth-tinged frocks, Mr. Browne's fall show in New York last month might have been an outtake from a Tim Burton film.
Fashion's black-magic women are trading on something subtler than raw sex appeal.
''Maxidresses and capes are not really revealing a lot of skin,'' said Hayley Phelan, the senior editor of the style blog Fashionista.com. Vaguely feminist in spirit, according to Ms. Phelan, ''they're celebrating a kind of beauty,'' she said, ''that maybe appeals more to other women than to men.''
Wiccan spirits surfaced at Gareth Pugh in London last week, draped in hooded capes and sweeping gowns with a distinctly pagan cast, and at Ann Demeulemeester and Rick Owens in Paris, each designer offering gauzy gowns and wraps that flirted with the dark side.
Jessica Rayne, a South African designer with a predilection for filmy black frocks trailing fringe and lace, has explored pagan imagery and lore as a source of romance.
''The witch is a strong character,'' Ms. Rayne said, ''encompassing what it is to be a woman: powerful and sometimes terrifying.
''She's crazy but engaging,'' Ms. Rayne went on, ''the kind of woman you fall in love with, though it scares you to death.''
Tapping that sort of spooky drawing power, updated variations on '90s hits like ''Charmed'' began appearing on small screens more than a year ago. ''The Secret Circle,'' though canceled after a season, has developed a cult nonetheless, as has the new Web series ''13 Witches,'' about a family of pagans with a thirst for revenge.
Hollywood stepped in with ''Hansel & Gretel,'' in which the comely Famke Janssen portrays the witch as raven-haired temptress, and ''Oz: The Great and Powerful,'' with Rachel Weisz as Evanora, the Wicked Witch of the East. Scheduled for release early next year is ''Maleficent,'' its title character, Sleeping Beauty's nemesis, fetchingly conjured by Angelina Jolie, whose crimson pout and leather-wrapped horns are lacquered to a sheen.
The music world has spawned its own pantheon of witchy women, among them the flame-haired Florence Welch. Obsessed with witchcraft as a child, Ms. Welch has confided in interviews, ''I always wanted a more magical reality.''
This latest infatuation with paganism can be read as a timely acknowledgment that the world isn't all one could wish it to be. Contemporary witches and dystopian fantasies are, in some views, a corrective to the childhood notion that the good and the fair will invariably prevail. ''There is evil,'' Lena's boyfriend, Ethan, reminds her in ''Beautiful Creatures.'' In that film, wickedness is embodied by Ridley, Lena's voluptuous, ornately tricked out cousin.
Sugarcoated entertainments are less likely to appeal to moviegoers reeling in the recession's aftermath, Jeremy Gutsche, the editor of the online publication Trendhunter, suggested.
''Consumers want a more edgy, dark and villainous vibe to make these childhood stories more enticing,'' Mr. Gutsche said. One, he might have added, more in tune with their adult experiences.
The witch as heroine, or shameless avatar of vice, may be catnip as well to a younger generation that models itself on self-possessed, candidly subversive action heroes like Katniss Everdeen of ''The Hunger Games'' or Lisbeth Salander of ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,'' whose long-hooded overcoat, red-rimmed eyes and feral piercings bring to mind a hybrid of street thug and Satanist.
In contrast, her lacy tees, swishy skirts and Doc Martens lend Lena of ''Beautiful Creatures'' the look of a sweet-natured art school refugee. But beneath the raffish garb is a force of nature who can turn her back on the charms of the local lads to consort with a higher authority.
Why, after all, should she settle for the thrills, and frustrations, of earthly love when, as her mother assures her, ''Love's a spell created by mortals to give their females something to play with''?
A poor substitute, that is, for power. Similar thinking informs ''Oz,'' which, when it opens in theaters on Friday, will treat audiences to the spectacle of Evanora, swathed in sumptuous green satin, persuading her sister, Theodora, who has been jilted by her lover, to embrace the consolations of the dark side: a kingdom of her own, perhaps -- oh, and yes, a killer wardrobe.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With: Video Artist Nalini Malani

BYLINE: MEARA SHARMA and HENRY PECK


HIGHLIGHT: On melding political and social themes in art and more. 

 BODY:
 Nalini Malani is a pioneering video and installation artist who lives and works in Mumbai. Born in Karachi in 1946, she came to India as a refugee of the partition of India, an experience that deeply informs her art practice. Her piece at the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, "In Search of Vanished Blood(2012)", is a "video play" that melds Greek and Indian myths with the revolutionary poetry of Faiz Ahmed Faiz through projection, sound and hand-drawn animation. The effect is a multilayered commentary on social fracturing, gender violence and the echoes of American hegemony. 
 Ms. Malani spoke with India Ink on why she incorporates texts and myths in her work and how she approaches political and social issues in her art. 
 Q. 
In your visual art, you work with a range of literary texts - poems, plays, stories. What appeals to you about the literary?
 A. 
I envy writers. They work with a poverty of means, and they can write anywhere. All you need is a pen and paper, or a little laptop. Also, the different types of formats, from biography to autobiography, travelogue, short story, letters to a lover... It's amazing, the range. The background that I come from is a fairly traditional, orthodox one. When I was studying, anything that wasn't an oil painting was a deviation. So to me it seemed that using the example of the novelist was a way of getting into other areas of art-making. The nuancing that a novelist can bring out is amazing, and I'm interested in the challenge of transforming that kind of nuance into the visual.
 Q. 
You call your piece, "In Search of Vanished Blood," a video play, not a film. Why?
 A. 
I'm very interested in theater. The theatrical moment. The liveness. But in India it's very difficult to do theater, so I've found another way, to do it in video. Like a play, the whole thing is manufactured, planned from start to finish - the setting, look. I'm not the kind of video artist who works on the street, documentary-style. I want my shoot to be like a complete theatrical blackbox.
 Q. 
And your "video play" has a very provocative backdrop: a world map with the United States at the very center.
 A. 
Yes - and it's not a map that I sought out. It was already there, in the conference room. In China, you might have China in the center, and a British company might put Greenwich at the center. But on this map you have the United States. The centrality of the U.S. - how so many of our problems have started there, the banking system, consumerism - this is something that has interested me for a while. All the economists we have in the world who believe in capitalism have finally failed. And why have they failed us? One of the reasons is appealing to greed. The same is happening in India. We know this has failed - but it continues - and why does it go this way?
 Q. 
With this idea of malign circumstances reverberating outward, I'm reminded of a similar ripple effect with India's partition, and the importance of partition in your own life and work. Partition has been called "a living wound." Is it still?
 A. 
Cutting the country on religious lines was terrible in itself, but more terrible because they left behind a tool for further cutting, for the right wing to do whatever they like. In 1992, the Babri Masjid was broken by hammers. And under the guise of communal problems, construction companies join hands with fascists to destroy the slums, in places where everybody was living together in complete harmony. So under any excuse this thing starts up.
It's all part of the business of greed. And it's not about the Hindu-Muslim conflict. It's more about greed - about destroying what's in the way, what is standing in between me and what I want.
 Q. 
You work extensively with myths, many of which have been reinvented and reinterpreted numerous times. What continues to draw you to the myth?
 A. 
There's a universal truth to them. They've come down through generations, and there's no one author. They're like seeds - you plant one and so much comes out. I'm fascinated by the melding of cultures, and subsequently myths.
Wendy Doniger has done a comparative study between Hindu and Greek myths and there are so many similarities. People forget that the whole army of Alexander the Great stayed behind. The Greeks could not fit into the Hindu caste hierarchy so they chose to become Buddhist. And an Indo-Hellenic Buddha came about.
For the moment my obsession is Cassandra, the Cassandra myths, because she had the prophecy to see the future. And just like Cassandra, we have Sahadeva in the Mahabharata. He knew the future but he needed to be asked. If no one asked him, he would seethe inside. He was powerless. Which is what's going on now. It's like we're cursed - we can see, we know what's going to happen, but we're frozen.
 Q. 
What is your approach, or strategy, in bringing potent social and political issues into your artistic work?
 A. 
Well, first it is a passion, and an emotion, that draws me to something. If something strikes me, then I think about the strategy in representing it. But I like to work in several layers. The first layer is beauty - so the audience is attracted, seduced. It's a kind of anti-Brechtian point of view. It is the door that beckons you in.
But having brought you in, there are other pages that I hope will unfurl and open. And then finally I'd like someone to say, "Oh, the horror of it." Like in the "Heart of Darkness." The horror.
 Q. 
You've participated in numerous events of this kind. Is this biennale significant for Indian art?
 A. 
I've participated in 21 biennales! The first was Havana. I've lived a long life. I think it is very significant here, and very important to support this. It gives us a sense of identity beyond India, in the international world. And it's also important for bringing a sense of the visual into India. There have been so many problems with the visual world in India - the architecture, the neglect of heritage sights. I think it all has to do with a lack of training in the visual arts. So one hopes that with a biennale, with such a range of people coming in with a focus on the visual, there might be a change in what our eyes can see, and what we set our eyes upon. And education in the arts would improve.

HEADLINE: Filling a Fed Vacuum in Bank Supervision

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve must stop its internal wrangling and impose more effective control over the biggest banks, and Sheila Bair is the kind of strong regulator to lead the effort, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
President Obama should nominate Sheila Bair as vice chairwoman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. This position was created by the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation (Section 1108 in Title XI) but has gone unfilled for nearly three years - clearly not in line with the intentions of legislators, who even specified that this official should testify before Congress on a semiannual basis. 
Ms. Bair is an experienced regulator, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the author of "Bull by the Horns," an excellent book on what went wrong with the financial system and how to fix it. She currently works as an effective advocate for financial reform as a senior adviser at the Pew Charitable Trusts, and she founded and is chairwoman of the Systemic Risk Council (I am a member of this council). 
No one has stronger bipartisan support and a better working relationship with reasonable people across Washington. There is now a potential vacancy on the Fed board, as Elizabeth Duke's term as governor expired more than a year ago; she continues to serve until a successor is appointed. The reformist wing at the Fed desperately needs serious reinforcement. 
And the Federal Reserve itself faces a broader impending crisis of legitimacy if it fails to decisively confront the problem of too big to fail. Anyone who believes in the importance of an independent central bank should work hard to force the Fed to act decisively on big banks.

Since the fall, Daniel Tarullo, an academic expert on banking and currently the lead Fed governor for financial regulation, has given some encouraging speeches, including a discussion of the need to impose effective size caps on the largest banks. He is also known to be in favor of stronger capital requirements than some of his Fed colleagues. And he is much more likely to push for bank holding companies to finance themselves with enough equity and long-term subordinated debt to serve as a loss-absorber in the case of financial failure.
But Mr. Tarullo has not yet made much discernible progress - and there is a real danger that the Fed will slip into a wait-and-see policy that will lead nowhere.
When questioned by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, in a recent hearing, Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, was vague and unconvincing on the importance of additional measures to reduce the dangers posed by "too big to fail" banks.
And I was further discouraged on Monday by the wording of a speech by Jerome Powell, a relatively new member of the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Powell's line is that while "success is not assured" for existing measures that aim to end "too big to fail," we should merely study additional steps (such as size caps; see Pages 12-13 of his speech). 
Mr. Powell did not deny the existence of too-big-to-fail subsidies - and this puts important distance between his views and those expressed, for example, by people at JPMorgan Chase. But he did not suggest that the Fed should measure the subsidies these institutions receive - or the dangers that they pose. In effect he and his colleagues are saying, "Trust us, and we'll continue to provide you with vague answers and promises of future progress."
There is a more general level of vagueness in Mr. Powell's speech that is deeply disconcerting (and I felt the same way about Mr. Bernanke's exchange with Senator Warren). When will the Fed board decide that the "too big to fail" reform project is insufficient and on what basis? It's already nearly three years since the passage of Dodd-Frank, yet the implicit subsidies and general unfair competitive advantages of megabanks show no signs of receding.
Will the "living will" process - in which banks are supposed to present plans for their own demise in the event of big losses - be used to bring effective pressure to bear on the big banks, as Thomas Hoenig of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposes? There is no sign of this in Mr. Powell's view of the world, despite the fact that even William Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, views the first round of living wills (submitted last year) as inadequate.
In fact, global megabanks as currently constituted could in no way prepare a credible living will; they are simply too complex for their own management to understand - as demonstrated by JPMorgan Chase's losses of more than $6 billion in the so-called London Whale case. The materials involved in a full disclosure would fill a small college library, and most of them would prove irrelevant once liquidation started. And any such document can immediately become out of date; a day of intense derivative trading can significantly change the risk profile of a big company, and the nature of the systemic risks that it poses.
Mr. Powell is an experienced financial sector executive and, behind closed doors, most such people are candid about the problems of megabanks. I'm sure that Mr. Powell's intentions are good, but perhaps inadvertently he is siding with industry people who seek to use delaying tactics at every opportunity.
For example, Mr. Powell referred to the resolution of global megabanks without sufficiently emphasizing the inherent difficulties of cross-border resolution (see Pages 9-10 of his speech). Again, I am confident that Mr. Powell is fully informed about the lack of progress in creating an integrated resolution regime between Britain and the euro zone, as well as the serious difficulties within the euro zone itself. 
Citigroup brags about having 200 million customer accounts in 160 countries and processing $3 trillion in transactions every day. How exactly does Mr. Powell or anyone else propose to unwind that when the cross-border issues are profoundly complicated and it's every regulator for himself? Citigroup, after all, falls into a state of insolvency roughly every decade.
As for the cooperation between the F.D.I.C. and the Bank of England, to which Mr. Powell refers (again, see Pages 9-10), this is a valiant effort. But I have talked in detail with Paul Tucker, the relevant deputy governor at the Bank of England (including at the public meeting of the Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee of the F.D.I.C. in December). The Bank of England has a fundamentally different approach to bank resolution than that of the F.D.I.C. Both sides, by statute and under political pressure, must keep their options open. 
In any crisis, national interest comes first, which means the potential for an unseemly scramble by regulators to grab assets. This is exactly how markets become destabilized.
Mr. Powell refers (see Page 6) to a "public simulation of the failure of large financial institution" under an ordinary liquidation agreement that he helped design in October 2011. And he draws encouragement from that experience, which refers to the simulation organized by The Economist at its Buttonwood conference. But according to top-level participants in that exercise, with whom I have spoken, the cross-border piece was designed to be trivial, with the relevant regulators presumed willing and able to cooperate, because the event had to fit within a two-hour time slot. The inherent complexity of modern cross-border banking was simply assumed away in the interest of making for good viewing.
This is not a serious way to think about financial crises. 
If Mr. Powell were serious about ending too big to fail, he would express in public his support for efforts to measure the subsidies that these financial institutions continue to receive. The Fed is perfectly capable of calculating and publishing numbers that would be informative regarding whether these subsidies are rising or failing.
As I mentioned here last week, in the early 2000s the Fed staff calculated the federal subsidies to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at around 40 basis points (I cited a 2003 paper and a 2004 speech by Alan Greenspan, then the Fed chairman). Why not do analogous calculations for today's too-big-to-fail financial institutions? I understand that Mr. Powell is not in a position to tell the Fed staff what to do, but calling for more precise measurement and public reporting on subsidies is hardly expressing a radical thought.
Any excuse that such subsidies are hard to measure (which is what I hear from the industry, not from Mr. Powell) is inherently lame. In fact, it would be laughable if that were ever to come from the Fed. Is inflation or the "natural rate" of unemployment easy to measure? The Fed is in the business of filtering out noise and understanding fundamentals. 
Of course, the Fed did a very bad job across almost all dimensions of its mandate before the crisis of 2008. That is exactly why its legitimacy is called into question. It is baffling that so many Fed insiders refuse to understand how another financial crisis, centered on unfettered too-big-to-fail financial companies, would undermine the fragile political consensus that currently supports central-bank independence.
Broader political momentum is most definitely shifting toward confronting the power of very large financial institutions. On Tuesday, I was chairman of an event on "too big to fail" at the Peterson Institute for International Economics with Sheila Bair; Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio; and Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah and Republican presidential candidate. (You can watch the video on the institute's Web site.)
Senator Brown made a strong case, from the left, for constraining the size of very large banks. Mr. Huntsman made a convergent case, from a conservative perspective, for measuring and ending the subsidies these financial institutions receive to maximize economic growth. Ms. Bair provided the hands-on, detailed view about how to move our current rules decisively and appropriately in the right direction.
Yet on Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged that some of the largest financial institutions may have become too big to prosecute. "I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy," he said in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, reported on thehill.com blog. "And I think that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have become too large."
Still, the Obama administration says it wants to promote women to positions of responsibility. Ms. Bair is not just the best woman for the job of supervision at the Fed; she is by far the best-qualified person. Is this White House serious about financial reform, or is it just paying lip service?

HEADLINE: The Civil War's War on Fraud

BYLINE: MARK GREENBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The Confederacy wasn&#8217;t the only enemy of the Union Army. Rampant fraud was a threat, too. 

 BODY:
Popular memory holds that among the many differences between Billy Yank and Johnny Reb were the clothes on their back. Union soldiers, we are told, had more and better everything, while rebels had to scrounge for uniforms, weapons and even shoes. But especially in the early years of the Civil War, this was more an impression than reality. Union supplies were poor and in short supply, thanks to unimaginable levels of fraud. 
Cheaply made shoes plagued the soldiers' feet. Uniforms of lousy fabric would literally fall apart in rain. Standard-issue coats and blankets were too thin to withstand the winter cold. Guns were sometimes unable to fire and stocks and shells of gunpowder were found filled with sawdust. And newly ordered horses and mules arrived at the front withered, old and sometimes even blind. 
A good part of the problem lay in the growing pains of a still-developing war machine, where, for example, the lack of Southern cotton made the creation and procurement of quality uniforms and blankets more difficult for Union soldiers. But the root of the problem was the legion of unscrupulous contractors who knowingly supplied shoddy materials to the Union. 
With virtually no checks in place in 1861 to combat fraud, contractors had free rein in their sales to the government, sometimes with the assistance of greedy military men. In response, Congress throughout the war worked to counter the ever-evolving economy of fraud that dragged heavily at the war effort - and as a result created an antifraud framework that remains in place today.
Spurred by early war reports and loud calls from New York Representative Charles Van Wyck, on July 8, 1861, the House approved the creation of the Select Committee on Government Contracts. In his trademark biting hyperbole, Van Wyck underlined the necessity of such a body, describing "the mania for stealing ... almost from the general to the drummer boy." The new committee was tasked with investigating the procurement system and given broad latitude to act.
The small committee of seven members was originally chaired by Van Wyck, but he was replaced by Illinois Republican Elihu Washburne, a close ally of the president and the original political patron of Ulysses S. Grant. The body maintained a significant pace of activity through the 37th Congress, holding field hearings in several cities, receiving testimony from hundreds of witnesses and ultimately issuing over 3,000 pages of findings.
The Committee's three reports identified numerous cases of fraud in the supplying of horses, clothing, ammunition and other vitals to Union soldiers, and widespread malfeasance out West. The Committee found that both the Department of War under Simon Cameron and the Department of the Navy under Gideon Welles had awarded contracts not to the lowest bidder through proper advertisements, but to friends and associates.
The Navy Department was lashed for using private commission agents to procure un-seaworthy vessels. One such agent, Alexander Cummings, had secured a ship, the Cataline, at an exorbitant price, and another, George Morgan, enriched himself with a high commission for his purchases on behalf of the department. Things were even worse in the War Department. Cameron was assailed for awarding rich contracts to close allies in the railroad industry, much to the delight of his congressional critics.
Perhaps most striking were the findings in the West. Through several hearings in St. Louis and in Cairo, Ill., in October 1861, the committee uncovered rampant fraud by agents working under Gen. John C. Frémont at the center of the Union's Western Department headquarters just three months after the general took the job. Writing the president, Washburne sounded the alarm: "The robberies, the frauds, the peculiarities in the government which have already come to our knowledge are absolutely frightful."
Frémont had done business with a shady California contractor who worked without a contract and received exorbitant compensation. Perhaps even more troubling was the case of Maj. Justus McKinstry, the Western Department quartermaster. Eventually court-martialed on 63 separate counts through evidence exposed by Washburne's committee including bribery and outright fraud, McKinstry was cashiered out of the Army, one of the biggest rogues in the war. Another purchaser, Simon Stevens, was implicated in the "Hall Carbine" affair, in which the government unknowingly repurchased arms it had already discarded as uselessly obsolete. 
Coverage of the committee's activities was insatiably detailed, as the press was fascinated by the reports of stunning thievery. A New York Times editorial appraising one of the committee's reports reflected this colorful interest, calling the findings "a library of corrupt readings" whose "painful and dreadful" disclosures will "produce a feeling of public indignation which would justify the most summary measures against the knaves whose villainy is here dragged into daylight."
Despite its success and the interest in the public stoked by media coverage of its hearings, the committee's activities were highly controversial in Congress from the start. The House had fought over Van Wyck's request for expanding jurisdiction and having the ability to hold field hearings, as many critics asserted turf concerns that the new body would impinge on the oversight of existing standing committees.
Soon after it began its hearings, the committee's work came under attack from radical Republicans. Many radicals were agitated that the committee's findings were not more sharply critical of enemies in Lincoln's cabinet, including Welles and Cameron (who would be pushed out in January 1862, in part because of the committee's revelations) and were disappointed that, unlike the Committee on the Conduct of the War, which was dominated by fire-breathers, the Government Contracts Committee was filled with moderates. 
The radicals were also initially infuriated when the committee described in harsh detail the crimes occurring in the Western Theater under Frémont's leadership, as many radicals had lionized the man known as the Pathfinder for his 1861 proclamation emancipating captured slaves in his department (which Lincoln quickly had rescinded so as not to upset the then-wavering border states).
Other critics sought to protect allies implicated by the committee's findings. Simon Stevens was a protégé of the radical leader Senator Thaddeus Stevens, who in turn raged that the committee had "no honest purpose to know the truth" except to go "scandal-hunting." Similarly, an exposed thief, Capt. E.M. Davis, whose fraud in procuring military supplies was breathtakingly diverse, was the brother of Republican Representative William M. Davis of Pennsylvania, who savaged the committee.
Despite these political criticisms, fraud was a difficult issue to politicize completely. The findings offered by the committee's members and the positive, heavy media coverage of its hearings - not to mention the scores of letters sent home by soldiers complaining of their poor supplies - shielded the committee, such that a motion offered by Representative Stevens to curtail its work was soundly defeated. And while earlier moves to pass broadly encompassing antifraud legislation did fail, Congress would finally act on the body's work.
On March 2, 1863, the 37th Congress's final day, Congress approved the False Claims Act to combat the problem of war profiteering. The bill banned the making of false claims to the government, including forgery, embezzlement and conspiracy to defraud the government in contracts. Punishment was harsh: wrongdoers faced prison time and up to $5,000 in penalties, and could also be hit with a fine double the amount they had stolen plus $2,000 for each claim - an enormous sum in 1863. 
Equally important were the unique enforcement mechanisms of the bill. In 1863, there was no Department of Justice or federal prosecutorial apparatus to deal with criminal networks. Therefore, the legislation included a whistleblower, or "qui tam," provision to encourage citizens to come forward with knowledge of ongoing fraud - if their claims proved correct, they would receive a share of the recovered money.
The principal sponsor of the bill in the Senate, Michigan's Jacob Howard, acknowledged this: "In short, I have based the...sections upon the old-fashioned idea of hold out a temptation," and "setting a rogue to catch a rogue...a reward for the informer who comes into court and betrays his co-conspirator...widely used to combat instance of fraud by companies supplying the Union Army."
Qui tam derived from a Latin phrase which means, "he who prosecutes for himself as well as the king," and it allowed private citizens (called relators in the law), to come forward and file civil suits against fraud merchants. Those relators who helped make a successful case would receive half the amount the government ultimately recovered from the dishonest contractor. 
The idea traced back as far as 14th century England, and was common in colonial America. Qui tam provisions were also in several of the first bills passed by Congress as a means of encouraging people to help root out fraud too intricate and pervasive for the young government alone to adequately uncover. 
Though often overlooked in general accounts of the wartime Congress's achievements, the False Claims Act remains a significant legacy of the era. After being defanged during World War II, bipartisan amendments passed by Congress in 1986 reinvigorated the bill, and the law has since saved the government over $20 billion in recovered monies, and exponentially more in deterrence, continuing to serve as a robust a bulwark against fraud.

HEADLINE: Do You Really Have to Go to College?

BYLINE: DALE J. STEPHENS


HIGHLIGHT: Dale J. Stephens, an author and vocal proponent of self-directed learning, challenges the notion that college is the only way to become successful. 

 BODY:

As high school seniors await thick envelopes and weigh their options, one young man is making the case for another college choice: None of the above. 
The last time Dale J. Stephens appeared on this blog, he was described as "something of a heretic in the world of higher education." He argued against the five reasons people give for going to college.
Mr. Stephens, a vocal proponent of self-directed learning, is the author of "Hacking Your Education" and the founder of UnCollege.
In his commentary below, Mr. Stephens challenges the notion that college is the only way to become successful. We hope you'll share your thoughts in the discussion that follows. - Tanya Abrams 
This is the time of year when high school seniors across the country are checking the mail obsessively. They're rushing down the driveway whenever an unusually loud car goes by, hoping the letter carrier has delivered that all-important, life-altering piece of paper: the acceptance letter to their dream school.
You should know, however, that not everyone is paying attention to the mailbox. Some teenagers are making plans to engage in self-directed learning.
All your life, parents, teachers, and guidance counselors have drilled the idea into your head that you must go to college. It has been made clear that if you don't get good grades and attend a four-year college, the rest of your life will be a dismal failure.
I'm arguing that all of this is wrong. The social cues that defined what you thought about education ought to be questioned.

There is a community of people who are making a different choice. Instead of going into debt, they are taking the future into their own hands. They are using the real world to find mentors and learn practical skills. They are traveling, volunteering, interning and apprenticing. 
While many might see this path as extremely risky, I argue that going to school and graduating with an average of $26,000-plus in debt is at least as risky in today's uncertain job market.
Of course, debt is not the only factor to consider when making decisions about higher education. Learning outcomes are also important, but there are disturbing numbers there as well. According to "Academically Adrift" - a book based on a study about undergraduate education in the United States - as many as 45 percent of students show "no improvement in critical thinking, complex reasoning or written communication during their first two years in college."
Furthermore, some recent college graduates are not faring too well in the job market. According to the economist Andrew Sum of Northeastern University, more than 44 percent of college graduates under 25 who were area studies majors were unemployed in 2009 or working in a job that did not require their degree.
Today, self-directed learning is easier than ever. Not long ago, if you told someone that the Internet was coming, there was no chance they would have believed you. Now, you can learn, on your own, the skills you need to succeed. Not only are the resources free, but they're accessible from nearly anywhere in the world.
If you'd like to learn how to code, you don't need a $150,000 piece of paper to tell you that you can. Instead, you can do it yourself. The best part? People will pay you for it.
The connection economy we live in today has had drastic effects on the incentives and economics of education - yet it seems that colleges haven't really taken notice.
Now, entire course loads can be watched online. The breadth of information on the Web is so vast that if you think you don't have the resources to learn something, you'd be lying to yourself.
While the educational experience at college is flawed - with 90- to 120-minute lectures simply inducing passive, lackadaisical learning - Silicon Valley has cost-effective solutions to it, even if you opt for the system.
Massive open online courses, commonly referred to as MOOCs, are now replacing lecture halls. Students don't have to sit in a classroom anymore; they can learn on their own terms, at their own pace. They choose what they want to learn. If they are enduring a start-up crisis of their own, they can stop being stuffed Shakespeare (whom I adore), switch gears and adapt.
It's fluid, it's flexible, and it's an education designed for the student.
Self-directed learners, or hackademics as I'd like to call them, aren't just learning for a fraction of the cost. In many cases, they're doing it for absolutely free.
With educational resources like Udacity, edUx, Coursera, M.I.T. Open Courseware, and Khan Academy, you can go from grasping the fundamentals to synthesizing entire class loads, without the burden of crushing, unforgivable debt (Oh yes, it's unforgivable). As the New York Times reporter Tamar Lewin wrote, "No one knows just how these massive courses will evolve, but their appeal to a broad audience is unquestioned: retirees in Indiana see them as a route to lifelong learning, students in India as their only lifeline to college-level work."
Right now, we need to see in terms of return of investment. Our generation came in believing that with a college degree, came the security of a job and the tangible skills to do it. We also came in believing that the price was bearable.
Not anymore. Now, we see students in paralyzing debt, coming out of college settling for a job they didn't want. The simple fact is, with a connection economy as powerful as ours, the real world is starting to give a greater return on investment than the manufactured one we set up in college.
Devbootcamp, a nine-week Ruby on Rails course, teaches novices how to program for the cost of $12,200. Yet, the return on investment is incredibly high: Three months after completing the course, 90 percent of graduates found jobs, many of them with starting salaries as high as $80,000.
The reason this happens is because the curriculum doesn't focus on being a "well-rounded student," which is intellectual newspeak for "more classes." Instead it focuses on, as Michael Staton likes to call it, "extreme employability," which aligns the curriculum with job incentives.
In Pareto-speak, it's finding the 20 percent of the material that reaps 80 percent of the rewards. If you have the flexibility to choose your own education, you also have the flexibility to choose your own life. This is the blessing of the hackademic.
We need to see college as a choice, not a requisite. Social norms dictate that we all need to go to college - but if you look through history, how many times have social norms steered us in the wrong direction?
What's at stake is the livelihood of the people who are here to prosper. It's the difference between graduates racking up debt they can't pay off, and hackademics living with the freedom they were told was coming. Life started out simple - do as you're told, and you'll be O.K. Yet, ironically, this is exactly the kind of thinking that'll get you into trouble.
The rules are being rewritten, and colleges aren't taking action. In fact, it seems that they aren't even taking notice. Now, life is on you. Now, I'd argue, is the best time to take charge of your education. And by doing so, you might just be taking charge of your life.

HEADLINE: Bailout Official at the Treasury to Leave Post

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Matt Pendo, the chief investment officer of the bailout program, is stepping down on Friday. He will be succeeded by Charmian Uy, who joined the department last summer. 

 BODY:
After more than two years of long train rides and selling off more than $120 billion in assets, the chief investment officer of the Treasury Department's bailout program is stepping down. 
The official, Matt Pendo, will serve his last day on Friday. He will be succeeded by Charmian Uy, who joined the department last summer from Sunoco, where she was treasurer.
Leaving Treasury will mean the end of commuting to Washington from Connecticut, where Mr. Pendo's wife and four children remained. Mr. Pendo, 49, took the 5:30 a.m. train from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan every Monday, returning late in the week.
"The body and family can take only so much of that," he said in an interview. He has no immediate plans, other than spending time with his family.
During his two-year tenure as chief investment officer, Mr. Pendo oversaw a substantial unwinding of financial lifelines given during the financial crisis, notably the complete sell-off of the Treasury's holdings in the insurance giant American International Group.
"Matt is an exceptionally talented individual and served the taxpayers extraordinarily well," Timothy G. Massad, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement.
A former investment banker who spent 25 years at Merrill Lynch and then Barclays, Mr. Pendo began working at Treasury in November of 2010, serving as deputy to his predecessor, David N. Miller. He was immediately thrust into the work of getting the government out of the many investments it had acquired in various rescue programs.
During his time as chief investment officer, Mr. Pendo oversaw the sale of the federal government's 92 percent stake in A.I.G. over 19 months. The process yielded a profit of $22.7 billion to taxpayers.
Mr. Pendo also helped navigate Treasury's exit from its investment in Chrysler, as well as setting up a way for the government to auction off its preferred stock holdings in the nation's banks. Several of those exits yielded more than $1 billion in profit.
The government has begun to sell its shares in General Motors, and will completely unwind its stake by early next year. That will most likely generate a billion-dollar loss to taxpayers.
But Mr. Pendo said that he remained proud of his team's work. "We had to figure out a balance between the speed of an exit and the return to taxpayers," he said. "We tried to do the right thing."

HEADLINE: Not Every Parent Chases College Prestige

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: I can&#8217;t imagine worrying about whether my child attends a prestigious college &#8212; but maybe I&#8217;m speaking too soon. 

 BODY:
 Taking Sides 
 KJ Dell'Antonia and Hope Perlman, both parents who are slowly approaching college applications for children, discuss whether parents should be worrying about the impact of a child's high school choices on her college career, and why. Read Hope Perlman's essay here. 
When I first read Hope Perlman's honest words about her college admissions anxiety for her daughter, I honed in on this phrase, written as she contrasted her hopes that her children would get into top-tier universities with Madeline Levine's book about the myths and pressures that surround our adulation of the Ivy League experience: 
I have dear friends who seem to agree with Levine. I've been in conversation with them about their college hopes for their children and they've looked me in the eye and told me they really, really don't care if the college their child attends is prestigious, as long as it's the right fit. And I've looked right back at them, impressed, but ultimately unable to believe they really mean it.
It's rare for me to theorize ahead of my data. My oldest child is in sixth grade, and college applications seem a blissfully long way off. I can't say for certain what I'll feel like a few years from now. 
But I believe that I am that parent who "really, really" doesn't care if the college my child attends is prestigious. I believe there are more parents like me out there than much of the zeitgeist on the state of parenthood now might lead us to believe, and I believe our children will thrive - and I have Willie the Wildcat, whose glorious purple image is above, to back me up. 
I went to Kansas State University, and I'm proud of my school and the education I received there. Among the many things I learned was this: where you get your education matters far less than how determined you are to do something with it. When I think about my children growing up and applying to college, I have yet to worry about where they'll apply, let alone where they'll go. What I do worry about is making sure they have the interest and gumption to apply somewhere, to do it themselves and to make the cost of college worthwhile. 
At this point - and again, this may be easy to say now, and harder four years from now - I would rather have a child who is fiercely determined to attend Green Elephant College on the shores of Lake Gingerbread because of the strength of its woodworking program and the ability to dual-major in marine bio-boatbuilding than one applying to the closest Ivy League college because everyone else is. Passion and drive are transferable from topic to topic and place to place, but not from person to person. My ambition can't substitute for theirs. So when I do worry, I worry about whether they'll have that passion, not whether they'll apply it in the name of making a college application look good. (And I worry about how much college will cost, and how they will contribute - economics certainly played into my choice - but indulge me for the moment in discussing only the college choice itself.)
I should say that my husband disagrees with me, at least about whether we should try to influence our children's still-theoretical high school course choices and college applications. Life is easier, he points out, with the social ties that come from prestigious schools, and my "name brand" graduate school gives Willie the Wildcat some luster and opens doors. Of course we shouldn't be filling out applications or pushing prestige over happiness, he says, but if our children are capable of attending selective schools, don't we owe it to them to make sure they understand the ways their choices in high school might affect their college chances, and the ways that college choice affects their life? 
Maybe I would agree, if I thought I really understood either of those things myself. Instead, I think that by trying to push children in a particular direction, both my husband and Hope are trying to game a system that can't be fooled. Choosing A over B when making class choices for 10th grade might change a child's entire future, or it might not. The only thing it is really guaranteed to change is whether a child does A or B in 10th grade - and if A isn't what that child wants or cares about, it is hard for me to imagine that A is going to take a child anywhere she really wants to go. I feel the same way about college. College A doesn't guarantee success or contacts or happiness or anything else. All it guarantees is a bill from College A.
From here - still safely in the realm of sixth grade - it is easy to roll my eyes at the assumed value of a particular college degree, let alone any of the choices that might or might not get a kid there. What is hard for me is to imagine feeling differently, or pushing a child toward one school or another, or even sending a child to college who isn't deeply invested in the idea of going. Just as Hope finds it hard to believe that any parents could "really, really" not care about how prestigious a school their child attends, I find it hard to believe that I could ever really, really believe that it's that important - not with Willie and my own erratic choices in my back pocket. 
Parents of children who are in the college application game, where do you fall on the spectrum? Do you worry about whether your child will get into a "good" school? If our children are blind to the ways choosing one high school class over another could appear to a college, are we obligated to open their eyes? Should we push the child making an easier course choice into a more impressive class, or respect her desire to spend more time on art or sports or something else? Whose worry is the college choice: the parent, the student - or both?

HEADLINE: 10 Years After the Invasion of Iraq, a World of Hurt

BYLINE: SCOTT JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Across the world, countries as disparate as the United States, Britain and Uganda grapple with the gruesome legacies of a war. 

 BODY:
This month marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. You could certainly be forgiven for thinking it might be a time for reflection, remembrance and, ultimately, moving on. 
As it happens, though, this year's anniversary is opening plenty of new wounds. From the Pentagon to the British court system, and even to Uganda, fresh revelations about torture, murder, kidnapping and alleged body-part snatching are surfacing.
The Guardian newspaper unveiled the results of a year-long investigation purporting to show that U.S. military advisers, with the knowledge and support of many senior officials, including former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and disgraced Gen. David Petraeus, oversaw a vast program of torture inside Iraqi prisons. 
According to the British daily, two senior American military officials, Col. James Steele and Col. James H Coffman, ran a high-level secret program inside Iraqi prisons to extract information from alleged insurgents and Al Qaeda terrorists. 
The program was reportedly funded with millions of dollars in American assistance, and was run with the connivance of members of several radical Shiite militias who tortured their captives. An Iraqi general, Muntadher al-Samari, told the newspaper that the two American advisers "knew everything that was going on there...the most horrible kinds of torture."
The revelation is, in the saddest possible way, the fulfillment of what James Fallows of The Atlantic magazine predicted six months before the March 19, 2003 invasion. In a piece last week taking stock of the real toll of the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Fallows wrote that the war was "the biggest strategic error by the United States since at least the end of World War II and perhaps over a much longer period."
If U.S. media coverage during the run up to the Iraq war is widely seen as less than skeptical, to put it mildly, the pushback 10 years later is full-throated indeed. 
Most of the stories appearing in newspapers and magazines this month focus on the tremendous losses incurred in the war, be they economic ($3 trillion in taxpayer dollars evaporated), human (4,486 American dead, 32,226 American wounded and more than 100,000 Iraqi dead) or political (the loss of American prestige abroad for years), instead of the victory over Saddam Hussein. 
Writing in the St. Louis American about a recent scathing documentary film called "Hubris: Selling the Iraq War," Jamala Rogers, a columnist, said, "We should be on fire about the pack of lies that led us into a war."
Even the conservative former Bush speechwriter and the conservative columnist David Frum conceded in the Daily Beast that "most Americans have condemned it as a disastrous mistake." And the Military Times, in the first of a four-part series, acknowledged that military leaders still had questions about the "legality" of the war. 
Though the United States was the principle architect of the war, its chief collaborator, Britain, is also facing ghosts on this 10th anniversary. Hearings began this week in what's known as the Al-Sweady inquiry - a long-awaited investigation into the deaths and subsequent mutilation of several Iraqis during a May 2004 firefight known as the Battle of Danny Boy, near Majar al-Kabir, in southern Iraq. 
Some 20 Iraqis were killed. The Iraqi complainants in the case have long said that some of the initial victims were only wounded in the battle, but later tortured and killed after being taken to a nearby British base for questioning. 
The inquiry has been a long time coming, and is bound to dredge up painful - and costly - memories, even as Britain, like much of the world, tries to come to terms with all it lost in the war. "It is damaging and unacceptable that it takes so long to address these matters," said an editorial in the Herald Scotland. 
One of the units involved in the incident, the Sutherland Highlanders, formerly a part of the British Army, was integrated into Scotland's forces in 2006. "This is not only morally wrong but self-defeating. It robs the U.K. of its moral authority to criticize brutality and high-handedness in the army or police in countries such as Zimbabwe, South Africa and Russia," the paper editorialized.
During the inquiry, a high court judge accused the British Defense Ministry of "serious breaches" and "lamentable" behavior.
The legacy of the Iraq war is still alive in Africa. Uganda, whose partnership with George W. Bush's "coalition of the willing" was mocked by many, was grappling with gruesome allegations this week when an African newspaper revealed that three Ugandan women who were lured to Iraq in the aftermath of the invasion allege that their organs were harvested there. 
Last year, the BBC documented a much less sensational story: how more than 100 Ugandan women wound up in Iraq in the first place, attracted to the war zone by unscrupulous human traffickers posing as legitimate businessmen. 
"If body parts are removed, do they grow?" Chris Mudoola told All Africa News this week, calling for a medical examination of the women. Mr. Mudoola is accused of being the person who took the women to Iraq while working for an organization called Uganda Veterans Development, according to the paper.
No accounting of the war would be complete without a tally of the money lost in addition to the hundreds of thousands of lives. But even there, the news this week was grim. In its final, and perhaps most depressing, report yet, the special U.S. inspector general for Iraq reconstruction said this week that the roughly $206 billion in Iraqi and American funds designed to rebuild the country "underperformed."

HEADLINE: Another S.E.C. Contender With Wall St. Ties

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Mary Jo White, who faces questions about her Wall Street work, may end up tapping a deputy who has taken a similar path. | Carl C. Icahn has joined the fight over Dell. | Time Warner is spinning off its Time Inc. unit. | Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. says some firms are so big that bringing criminal charges against them could threaten the economy. 

 BODY:
Even as Mary Jo White, President Obama's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, faces concerns about her work in private practice, she may end up finding a deputy in a lawyer who has taken a similar path. Andrew J. Ceresney, who was Ms. White's lieutenant as both a defense lawyer and as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, is a top contender to become her head of enforcement at the S.E.C., DealBook's Peter Lattman and Ben Protess report. "A Washington outsider and relative unknown beyond legal circles, Mr. Ceresney would help set the tone for policing financial fraud, effectively making him a top cop on Wall Street. He could join as soon as spring, potentially serving as co-chief with the agency's acting head of enforcement, the people briefed on the matter said." 
But both Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney face hurdles. Ms. White, whose confirmation hearing is set for Tuesday, must address questions about her work with clients like JPMorgan Chase and the board of Morgan Stanley. "At the S.E.C., Mr. Ceresney, 41, would have to police some of the same firms he spent a decade defending. After working at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, he built a lucrative legal practice at Debevoise & Plimpton. At the firm, he represented the likes of Kenneth D. Lewis, a former chief executive of Bank of America who faced regulatory investigations over the bank's hasty takeover of Merrill Lynch during the depths of the financial crisis."
Ms. White, who also built a reputation as a tenacious prosecutor, has already agreed to recuse herself for one year from most matters involving former clients. "Mr. Ceresney would probably follow Ms. White's lead and recuse himself from certain cases, an important ethical move but also a potential hindrance to his authority." Still, "the questions surrounding the revolving door illustrate how, even as Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney prepare to usher in a new era at the S.E.C., the agency is dogged by old concerns."
IN DELL DEAL, ICAHN STEPS IN THE WAY | The activist investor Carl C. Icahn is preparing to add his voice to the shareholder opposition to the proposed $24.4 billion buyout of Dell. Mr. Icahn is expected to reveal a major stake in Dell and, like other investors, is expected to express dissatisfaction with the price of the deal by the company's founder, Michael S. Dell, and the private equity firm Silver Lake, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports.
 Mr. Icahn's stake in Dell amounts to roughly 6 percent, according to CNBC, which cites unidentified "trading sources." He has already discussed the deal with advisers to a special committee of Dell's board, Mr. de la Merced reports, citing a person briefed on the matter. "The directors had asked Mr. Icahn to participate in the process to find potential higher bids, which is scheduled to end on March 22. But Mr. Icahn refused, the person said."
The special committee, which issued a statement on Wednesday telling shareholders it had fought to get the best price, said it considered possible alternatives to the sale, including what's known as a leveraged recapitalization. In addition, the special committee has sought to allow competing bidders to enter the fray. "Several companies already have signed nondisclosure agreements to take a peek at Dell's books as part of the so-called go-shop period, according to the person briefed on the matter. Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and the Blackstone Group have all expressed interest."
TIME WARNER TO SPIN OFF TIME INC. | Time Warner is spinning off its Time Inc. magazine unit into a separate, publicly traded company, after talks with Meredith Corporation ended, the Media Decoder blog reports. The move, resolving questions about what Time Warner would do with its magazines, allows the company to focus on its cable television and film business. The chief executive of Time Inc., Laura Lang, said she would depart when the spinoff of the magazine division is complete.
"The deal with Meredith fell apart in part because of Time Warner's concern over the fate of four of Time Inc.'s famous but struggling magazines - Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations who could not publicly discuss private conversations," Amy Chozick reports on the Media Decoder blog.
SANDBERG'S WALL STREET TOUR | Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, is heading to Wall Street with her message about women in the workplace. She is scheduled to visit Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase for private events on Thursday and Friday to discuss her book, "Lean In," which is scheduled to be published on Monday, DealBook reports. The events kick off her East Coast book tour.
ON THE AGENDA | Pandora Media reports earnings after the market closes. Data on consumer credit in January is out at 3 p.m. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan announce interest rate decisions. The Federal Reserve announces the results of bank stress tests at 4:30 p.m. James Chanos of Kynikos Associates is on CNBC at 7 a.m. Robert Dudley, the chief executive of BP, is on Bloomberg TV at 8:30 a.m. Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock is on CNBC at 4:10 p.m.
HOLDER FEARS BANKS ARE TOO BIG TO CHARGE | Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said on Wednesday that some financial firms had become so big that bringing criminal charges against them could threaten the economy, The Hill reports. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Holder said: "If you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy."

HEADLINE: Another S.E.C. Contender With Wall St. Ties

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Mary Jo White, who faces questions about her Wall Street work, may end up tapping a deputy who has taken a similar path. | Carl C. Icahn has joined the fight over Dell. | Time Warner is spinning off its Time Inc. unit. | Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. says some firms are so big that bringing criminal charges against them could threaten the economy. 

 BODY:
Even as Mary Jo White, President Obama's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, faces concerns about her work in private practice, she may end up finding a deputy in a lawyer who has taken a similar path. Andrew J. Ceresney, who was Ms. White's lieutenant as both a defense lawyer and as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, is a top contender to become her head of enforcement at the S.E.C., DealBook's Peter Lattman and Ben Protess report. "A Washington outsider and relative unknown beyond legal circles, Mr. Ceresney would help set the tone for policing financial fraud, effectively making him a top cop on Wall Street. He could join as soon as spring, potentially serving as co-chief with the agency's acting head of enforcement, the people briefed on the matter said." 
But both Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney face hurdles. Ms. White, whose confirmation hearing is set for Tuesday, must address questions about her work with clients like JPMorgan Chase and the board of Morgan Stanley. "At the S.E.C., Mr. Ceresney, 41, would have to police some of the same firms he spent a decade defending. After working at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, he built a lucrative legal practice at Debevoise & Plimpton. At the firm, he represented the likes of Kenneth D. Lewis, a former chief executive of Bank of America who faced regulatory investigations over the bank's hasty takeover of Merrill Lynch during the depths of the financial crisis."
Ms. White, who also built a reputation as a tenacious prosecutor, has already agreed to recuse herself for one year from most matters involving former clients. "Mr. Ceresney would probably follow Ms. White's lead and recuse himself from certain cases, an important ethical move but also a potential hindrance to his authority." Still, "the questions surrounding the revolving door illustrate how, even as Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney prepare to usher in a new era at the S.E.C., the agency is dogged by old concerns."
IN DELL DEAL, ICAHN STEPS IN THE WAY | The activist investor Carl C. Icahn is preparing to add his voice to the shareholder opposition to the proposed $24.4 billion buyout of Dell. Mr. Icahn is expected to reveal a major stake in Dell and, like other investors, is expected to express dissatisfaction with the price of the deal by the company's founder, Michael S. Dell, and the private equity firm Silver Lake, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports.
 Mr. Icahn's stake in Dell amounts to roughly 6 percent, according to CNBC, which cites unidentified "trading sources." He has already discussed the deal with advisers to a special committee of Dell's board, Mr. de la Merced reports, citing a person briefed on the matter. "The directors had asked Mr. Icahn to participate in the process to find potential higher bids, which is scheduled to end on March 22. But Mr. Icahn refused, the person said."
The special committee, which issued a statement on Wednesday telling shareholders it had fought to get the best price, said it considered possible alternatives to the sale, including what's known as a leveraged recapitalization. In addition, the special committee has sought to allow competing bidders to enter the fray. "Several companies already have signed nondisclosure agreements to take a peek at Dell's books as part of the so-called go-shop period, according to the person briefed on the matter. Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and the Blackstone Group have all expressed interest."
TIME WARNER TO SPIN OFF TIME INC. | Time Warner is spinning off its Time Inc. magazine unit into a separate, publicly traded company, after talks with Meredith Corporation ended, the Media Decoder blog reports. The move, resolving questions about what Time Warner would do with its magazines, allows the company to focus on its cable television and film business. The chief executive of Time Inc., Laura Lang, said she would depart when the spinoff of the magazine division is complete.
"The deal with Meredith fell apart in part because of Time Warner's concern over the fate of four of Time Inc.'s famous but struggling magazines - Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations who could not publicly discuss private conversations," Amy Chozick reports on the Media Decoder blog.
SANDBERG'S WALL STREET TOUR | Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, is heading to Wall Street with her message about women in the workplace. She is scheduled to visit Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase for private events on Thursday and Friday to discuss her book, "Lean In," which is scheduled to be published on Monday, DealBook reports. The events kick off her East Coast book tour.
ON THE AGENDA | Pandora Media reports earnings after the market closes. Data on consumer credit in January is out at 3 p.m. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan announce interest rate decisions. The Federal Reserve announces the results of bank stress tests at 4:30 p.m. James Chanos of Kynikos Associates is on CNBC at 7 a.m. Robert Dudley, the chief executive of BP, is on Bloomberg TV at 8:30 a.m. Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock is on CNBC at 4:10 p.m.
HOLDER FEARS BANKS ARE TOO BIG TO CHARGE | Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said on Wednesday that some financial firms had become so big that bringing criminal charges against them could threaten the economy, The Hill reports. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Holder said: "If you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy."

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Artist and Visionary: William Matthew Prior Revealed' (through May 26) William Matthew Prior (1806-1873), the subject of this fascinating exhibition, painted portraits in the ''American primitive'' mode. His paintings of solemn, pie-faced tots, stiffly posed yet animated by some inner mystery, are especially compelling. But he also had the chops to paint like a well-trained academician. He was an abolitionist too. Some of his best portraits are of black people. He was also into spiritualism, and he was a savvy entrepreneur. He was, altogether, a most remarkable character. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Life, Death and Transformation in the Americas' (continuing) For generations, one of the first things visitors to Brooklyn Museum encountered was the Hall of the Americas, the two-story rotunda right off the main lobby. And when you were in it, you knew you were home. A few years ago during renovations, the museum put the Americas material in storage, but now it's back in new galleries on the fifth floor. The look is very different -- ultraminimalist Arctic white and sky blue -- but the 102 objects, from a collection that is a jewel in Brooklyn's crown, are utterly gripping. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
The Frick Collection: 'Piero della Francesca in America' (through May 19) Reuniting six panels from an altarpiece by Piero, this ravishing show approximates an intimate quattrocento chapel in the Frick's grand Oval Room. At the center of the installation is a seventh painting, the Clark Art Institute's ''Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels,'' which comes from a different altarpiece in the painter's hometown, Sansepolcro and exemplifies Piero's uncanny orchestration of figures, architecture and religious symbolism. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Gutai: Splendid Playground' (through May 8) The first large, in-depth examination of Japan's best-known postwar art movement is a mind-shifting event that brings together all the mediums it encompassed, brilliantly interwoven. The eccentrically made paintings suggest that Japan produced Abstract Expressionism's strongest second generation, the artists who most convincingly and directly extended Pollock's innovative drip technique. But the show reveals little-known precedents for Happenings, Minimalism and various strains of Post-Minimalism. It should permanently dislodge any notion of postwar modernism as a strictly Western phenomenon. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Zarina: Paper Like Skin' (through April 21) ''Paper is an organic material, almost like human skin,'' the artist Zarina Hashmi has said. In her exhibition at the Guggenheim, it's that and more: paper is sculpture, poetry, currency and, above all, a kind of permanent home for a nomadic spirit. Her art speaks poignantly, though sometimes opaquely, of relocation and exile; works like the 2001 woodcut ''Dividing Line'' reference the violent 1947 partition of India and Pakistan, while ''Ten Thousand Things,'' a set of small paper collages recreating works from her oeuvre, nods to Duchamp's museum-in-a-suitcase. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423 3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia' (through May 22) American museums are increasingly collecting contemporary art from outside the Western Hemisphere, and the Guggenheim, supported by the financial corporation UBS is leading the pack. This inaugural show in the acquisitions campaign highlights work from South and Southeast Asia. Certain artists -- like Amar Kanwar, from India, and Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, from Thailand -- have international reputations. Others, like the sculptor Tang Da Wu, from Singapore, and the painter Aung Myint, Myanmar, both born in 1940s, are less familiar. Nearly all the work of the roughly two dozen artists refers in partisan, political and personal ways to specific histories. The inclusion of those histories in our art museums is long, long overdue. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
Jewish Museum: 'Sharon Lockhart/Noa Eshkol' (through March 24) Sharon Lockhart's film installation is based on the dances by Noa Eshkol (1924-2007), a little-known (in this country) Israeli choreographer who, along with the architect Avraham Wachman, developed a system that uses numbers and symbols to record body movement. Ms. Lockhart's photographs are of spherical models designed by Ms. Eshkol and Mr. Wachman; ephemera include actual notation, posters announcing Ms. Eshkol's performances and historical photographs. Textile works on display upstairs were made by Ms. Eshkol later in her life. The total functions as a new project by Ms. Lockhart and as a two-person exhibition, a combination of homage and appropriation that both recuperates a ''forgotten'' artist and respectfully presents her work and ideas, while simultaneously mining them to create a new body of artwork. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Matisse: In Search of True Painting' (through March 17) This stunning exhibition skims across the great French modernist's long, productive career with a mere 49 stellar, often pivotal paintings arranged in pairs or groups according to subject. Examining his penchant for working in series and copying his own canvasses, they shed new light on the arduous evolution of Matisse's seemingly effortless art, forming one of the most thrillingly instructive exhibitions about the artist, or painting in general, that you may ever see. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity (through May 27) The title may suggest a double-dose of pandering, but the show itself is a stunning combination of great paintings, ravishing gowns, historical clarity and pitch-perfect contextualizing. Demonstrating how the Impressionists and more conservative painters alike used the latest fashions to define their sitters as real people, it builds fascinating webs of new information and viewpoints around some of the best-known, most beloved paintings of all time, quite a few of which don't often travel to this country. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Path of Nature: French Paintings from the Wheelock Whitney Collection, 1785-1850' (through April 21) ''Sparkle with repose'' was the effect the British artist John Constable said he was after in his landscapes. His French contemporaries had the same idea. Today, Constable's a star. But León Pallière? Adrien Dauzats? Alexandre-Hyacinthe Dunouy? Only wonkish scholars are likely to know their names. Lucky for them, and for us, that one of those scholars is Whitney Wheelock III, who has a passion for French art from the years between neo-classicism and Romanticism, and a special love for gleaming little oil sketches done out of doors. In 2003 he gave his pictures to the Met, where 50 of them, along with some exquisitely funky genre paintings, make up this small gem of a show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
MoMA PS1: 'Cyprien Gaillard: The Crystal World' (through March 18) Romantic ennui suffuses the films of this French artist, whose ''Desniansky Raion,'' on view in this show, was one of the hits of the New Museum's ''Younger Than Jesus'' exhibition in 2009. He is a canny player with postmodern aesthetics, semiotics and technology, but a pessimist about human civilization. The main event here is ''Artefacts,'' a montage of scenes shot by Mr. Gaillard using his iPhone in the Babylon province of Iraq and at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. It is a stylishly bleak meditation on empire, entropy and archaeology. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Huma Bhabha: Unnatural Histories' (through April 1) In this midcareer survey, long-enduring forms from the ancient world lend some gravity to the throwaway materials that are now commonplace in contemporary sculpture. You could also say that the precariousness of recent assemblage and installation art haunts Ms. Bhabha's monstrous, totemic figures, which are typically made of Styrofoam, clay, rubber, wood scraps and wire mesh; either way, the juxtaposition is arresting. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt: Tender Love Among the Junk' (through April 1) Mr. Lanigan-Schmidt makes luminous art out of trash: candy wrappers, cling wrap, reflective plastics, aluminum foil, plastic bottles, beer cans and too many other kinds of cheap refuse to list. As this four-decade retrospective reveals, his devotion to his materials and hobbylike processes has yielded an oeuvre of transcending beauty, eroticized religiosity and poignant autobiography. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Drawing Surrealism' (through April 21) This sensational show of 165 works by 70 artists from 15 countries traces the movement from its early automatist stirrings to the doorstep of Abstract Expressionism. Expanding the field of players with numerous new names, it also has a wonderful clarity, organized according to the techniques that the Surrealists commandeered (collage and photography), breathed life into (frottage, decalcomania and exquisite corpse) and frequently crossbred. It may be among the best encapsulations of Surrealism you will ever see. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Degas, Miss La La and the Cirque Fernando' (through May 12) Viewers catching their first glimpse of ''Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando'' will tend to agree with an early Degas biographer who called the painting ''one of his most surprising canvasses.'' But after a close look at this curious 1879 picture of an aerialist hanging from a rope by her teeth (on loan from the National Gallery in London, and displayed with related studies, sketchbooks, circus programs and other ephemera), they will recognize Degas's skeptical eye and classical perspective on modern entertainment. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Artist's Choice: Trisha Donnelly' (through April 8) The 10th artist invited to select an exhibition from the Modern's collection does the series proud. Installed in three far-flung galleries within the museum's vaunted painting and sculpture collection, her effort disturbs the march of masterworks by concentrating on photographs, drawings and other works on paper as well as several kinds of design. At every turn it asks what is art, who is an artist and what makes for greatness? (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925' (through April 15) The pursuit of the holy grail of early modernism at its most feverish is presented as a multiple-medium, multinational effort in this dizzying, magisterial cornucopia. The 350-plus works by 84 artists encompass painting, sculpture, music, poetry, dance, film and photography; alternate between the tentative and the prescient; and capture something of both the terrors and thrills of the project, with clusters of paintings by Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian among the high points.

&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Projects 99: Meiro Koizumi' (through May 6) It would be hard to find another work of contemporary art that protests war with such soulful grace as Meiro Koizumi's ''Defect in Vision'' (2011), the main attraction of this small show. This 12-minute, black-and-white video dramatizes a final conversation between a kamikaze pilot and his wife, both of whom are blind, as they eat together in a small, old-world-style dining room. It is a riveting meditation on the doomed, myth-saturated mind of Japan's warrior class in the last days of World War II. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.

Neue Galerie: 'German Expressionism 1900-1930: Masterpieces From the Neue Galerie Collection' (through April 22) German Expressionism was a messy, complicated movement, with numerous stylistic and philosophical variations. It's not easily corralled into a tidy overview, despite the best efforts of the Neue Galerie in this collection show. The installation sorts everything into two groups, using the rubrics of ''primitivism'' and ''modernity.'' ''Primitivism'' seems to mean the gallery of jarringly bright, vigorously brushy paintings by members of the Brücke and the Blaue Reiter; under ''modernity'' are Neue Sachlichkeit portraits by Otto Dix, George Grosz, Christian Schad and others, made with caustic humor and an eye for the grotesque. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' (through May 26) History is written by the winners, which in contemporary art usually means the market. It's often also written by people who weren't on the scene and have to take the winners' word for what happened and what mattered. Such is the case with this retrospective show that too often favors the currently best-selling survivors of a fraught era over many now less well-known on-the-ground players. There's good art here, but the spirit of a furiously skeptical utopian moment -- very high, very low -- rarely breaks through the institutional nostalgia. And the chance to probe some market myths -- exactly how political was that 1993 ''political'' Whitney Biennial? -- is lost. Like all surveys of the immediate past, ''NYC 1993'' will get everyone kvetching, and it's a must-see, if only to find ways to bring the story into the present differently. Nari Ward's 1993 installation ''Amazing Grace'' in the New Museum's next-door space is for the ages. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Radical Terrain' (through April 29) The third and last of three beautifully produced, back-to-back mini-surveys in the series Modernist Art From India, this exhibition combines landscape painting done in India in the years following independence in 1947 with recent work by young artists -- some South Asian, most not -- that corresponds to or comments on the older art. Small in size and unfamiliar in content, the show is large with history. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through March 31) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org; folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sinister Pop' and 'Dark and Deadpan: Pop in TV and the Movies' (through March 31) The dark and truculent mood of this collection show is conversant with recent presentations of Warhol's death-and-disaster paintings, but the curators make plenty of room for other artists (including photographers). The point is not to cast a pall over Pop as we know it; it's to find common ground between the winking consumerism of early-1960s art and the antiwar, anti-corporate sentiment of work made later in the decade and into the 1970s. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Blues for Smoke' (through April 28) As a musical category blues is hard to pin down, and this show makes the job harder, which seems to be its point. It's saying: blues isn't a thing; it's a set of feelings, a state of mind, maybe a state of grace. In origin, it's African-American, developing with gospel and jazz, and folding into R&B, funk and hip-hop. But it has long since become a transethnic, transcultural phenomenon bigger than music, an enveloping aesthetic that includes art. And when you have art by the likes of Zoe Leonard, Kerry James Marshall, Rachel Harrison, Martin Wong, William Pope.L, Alma Thomas, Wu Tsang and David Hammons, you cannot go wrong. Whitney Museum of American Art, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum: 'Jay DeFeo: A Retrospective' (through June 2) The American artist DeFeo, who died in 1989 at 60, is famous for a single work, a gargantuan painting -- nearly 12 feet tall -- called ''The Rose,'' which she labored on exhaustingly for eight years, even after it had been extracted out of her San Francisco studio with a forklift. In the absence of other evidence, many people tend to see the piece as the sum of her accomplishment, but to this view the Whitney's tenderly shaped and visually absorbing survey says: No. There's more, and different. ''The Rose'' may have been the pivot point of her career -- DeFeo herself said as much -- but streams of inventive, if less spectacular work, work flowed toward it and from it.

Galleries: Uptown
Yishai Jusidman: 'Prussian Blue -- Memory After Representation' (through March 23) These well-made, photo-based paintings render various gas chambers built at Nazi concentration camps in shades of Prussian blue. They exemplify the kind of obvious, emotionally manipulative work that functions more as an editorial than as art; seems generated by little personal necessity; borrows liberally from other artists and ubiquitous tropes; and tends to clog far too many overly earnest international exhibitions. Their perfection as symptoms of some of the least interesting tendencies of our time makes them worth seeing. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 249-8950, as-coa.org. (Smith)

&#x2605; 'Jean-Michel Basquiat' (through April 6) It is not true that only the good die young, but Jean-Michel Basquiat did at 27 in 1988. He was not only good; at his best he was one of the most original artists of his generation. If that sounds like an extravagant claim, have a look at the high-quality selection of 59 of his bristling, faux-primitive paintings in this show. There is not a lot of art from the '80s that feels this alive today. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Johnson)
Ragnar Kjartansson: The Visitors' (through March 16) Bonhomie and nihilism go hand in hand in ''The Visitors,'' a recent video installation by this talented Icelandic performance artist. Divided among nine channels, it shows Mr. Kjartansson and eight friends making music at the endearingly scruffy mansion Rokeby Farm, in the Hudson Valley. Despite its vaguely melancholy refrain, repeated over the course of an hour, the piece evolves into a mellow jam session that's almost indistinguishable from its charmingly run-down setting. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9100 luhringaugustine.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Walt Kuhn: 'American Modern' (through March 16) The 100th anniversary of the Armory Show has occasioned a fresh look at Walt Kuhn, an organizer of the 1913 show whose own paintings have been somewhat marginalized. It includes several large-scale figure paintings on loan from museums and is accompanied by a full catalog. ''Sleeping Girl,'' a portrait of an exhausted dancer slumped over her dressing table (from the Ogunquit Museum of American Art), adds a starkly outlined, Matisse-like body to a head we recognize from Brancusi's ''Sleeping Muse.'' Here too are later paintings of entertainers, dancers and clowns, the sort of popular, down-to-earth subject matter that Kuhn liked to call ''buckeye'' and others have seen as kitsch. DC Moore, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 247-2111, dcmooregallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Larry Poons: 'New Paintings' (through March 16) Half of a two-gallery show is better than none in the case of this maverick formalist's recent efforts. Four paintings left up past the original closing date attest to his latest version of ''all-over'' surface compositions, painted one relatively free-standing stroke at a time using myriad colors. You expect to see nymphs and satyrs, or maybe Vuillard's mother, to emerge from the turbulent thickets, but the curling, leaping marks remain their elaborately allusive selves, at once finicky and free and altogether engrossing. Danese, 525-531 West 26th Street, fourth floor, Chelsea, (212) 223-2227, danese.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Dieter Roth. Björn Roth (through April 13) Concentrating on the collaborations of the Swiss-German maverick Dieter Roth (1930-98) and his son Bjorn, this sprawling show adds a veneer of class to the inauguration of Chelsea's latest oversize trophy gallery. Numerous large, messy works noisily navigate the border between art and life. But the best does so quietly: the 128-monitor video piece ''Solo Scenes'' simply records the elder Roth living out life in his studio-home in Basel. Hauser & Wirth, 511 West 18th Street, (212) 790-3900, hauserwirth.com. (Smith)
Galleries: SoHo
&#x2605; 'Frozen Lakes' (through March 24) The 1977 ''Pictures'' show at Artists Space caught a trend in the bud, with work based on images pulled, with cool detachment, from films, television and magazines. ''Frozen Lakes'' is ''Pictures'' updated for the digital age. Pop culture, drama and coolness are still in play, but the source for much of the imagery is now the Internet. And the emphasis is less on where the images come from than on where they're going and how: everywhere, in continuous data streams. Among the several interesting young artists, Ed Atkins, Charlotte Prodger and James Richards are standouts. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org.

'Beat Memories: The Photographs of Allen Ginsberg' (through April 6) During two periods in his life -- from the early 1950s to about 1964 and from the early '80s until his death in 1997 -- the poet Allen Ginsberg made photographs and added handwritten captions. Images of his now famous pals, including the writers Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and Gregory Corso, as well as Neal Cassady, their logorrheic muse, make this show required viewing for Beat fans.

&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

Out of Town
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh, Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through April 28) On the surface, this probing, perspective-altering exhibition, one of many events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, looks straightforward, even ordinary. We know most of the paintings and photographs on sight; they're classics. What we know less well is their meaning within the context of the nation's single greatest internal catastrophe, and that's what the show is about. It travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art this spring, running from May 21 to Sept. 2. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-1000, americanart.si.edu. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Yale University Art Gallery (continuing) In a museum era dominated by vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind institutional ideal of opposites in balance: an encyclopedic teaching museum, big enough to get lost in, small enough for intimate art encounters. New galleries of Indo-Pacific art are a particular attraction, but so are other collections, including one of the countries premier holdings in American art and a small, matchless display of very early Italian Renaissance painting. A special exhibition, ''Societe Anonyme: Modernism for America,'' made up of Yale-owned material, is on view through July 14. 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu.

Last Chance
&#x2605; 'Distance and Desire: Encounters with the African Archive (Part II: Contemporary Reconfigurations)' (closes on Saturday) Africa is an unstinting source of new photography, of which New York would see little were it not for a few commercial galleries and the Walther Collection. Last fall the Walther, a German foundation with a project space in Chelsea, initiated a series of three consecutive exhibitions under the umbrella title ''Distance and Desire: Encounters With the African Archive.'' The first show included European ethnographic photography. The current one illustrates how much a product of invention and fantasy ethnography can be. The Walther Collection Project Space, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, Chelsea, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
Lucy Dodd: 'The Studio Before 54' (closes on Sunday) The impressive solo debut of this recent graduate of Bard College features three enormous paintings as wry as they are beautiful and spatially startling. They are also as much rubbings or drawings as paintings, and bear the imprint of the floors on which they were made. Their eccentric, implicitly domestic structure involves exposed edges and canvas-wrapped stretchers. To their great credit, they also effortlessly take back the XL format usually dominated by men. No5A, 5A East 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 242-2905. (Smith)
&#x2605; Charlotte Dumas: 'Anima' (closes on Saturday) The sitters for this beautiful show of portraits are Army horses used to pull caissons in military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery. They've been photographed after their workday is over, when they are back in the stable, settling down for the night. Seen under soft light in shadowy stalls they have an archaic, monumental beauty. Classical examples of the portrait genre, the pictures also convey a sense of deep interspecies connection. Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, sixth floor, Chelsea, (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com. (Cotter)
'The Eye Is Part of the Mind: Drawings From Life and Art by Leo Steinberg' (closes on Saturday) As a precocious adolescent, the fabled art historian Leo Steinberg studied drawing at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and continued to draw almost up to the time of his death two years ago, at 90. He pooh-poohed his draftsmanship as conservative, but he also preserved examples and brought them out to share with colleagues and friends. Now two of those collegial friends, David Cohen and Graham Nickson, have selected some 60 figurative drawings for a tribute. The exhibition takes its title from a 1953 essay in which Steinberg argued against formalist abstraction, then dominant, as the be-all of art, and for the continuing connection of art to life. He practiced what he preached in his work. Here's the proof. New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-6466, nyss.org. (Cotter)
Paul Laffoley: 'The Boston Visionary Cell' (closes on Saturday) Judging by his mandala-type compositions on usually square canvasses, Mr. Laffoley has yet to encounter a system of mystical thought he could not absorb into his own project. Profusely annotated with press-on vinyl letters, his works refer to a dizzying array of mental adventurers from Socrates to the Theosophist charlatan Madame Blavatsky. This show is an excellent introduction to one of the most unusual creative minds of our time. Kent Fine Art, 210 West 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, Chelsea, (212) 365-9500, kentfineart.net. (Johnson)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (closes on Monday) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Wolfgang Laib: Pollen From Hazelnut' (closes on Monday) Mr. Laib is the honeybee of the international art world. Since the 1970s, his trademark activity has been gathering pollen from trees and plants in the countryside near his home in southern Germany. He puts the pollen in bottles and flies to distant places around the world to create ephemeral installations of yellow dust on museum and gallery floors and inseminate the minds of his viewers with thoughts of harmony between human civilization and nature. ''Pollen From Hazelnut,'' in MoMA's atrium, is his largest pollen field to date. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Trevor Paglen: 'The Last Pictures' (closes on Saturday) In an art project that was equal parts hard science, ''Twilight Zone'' theater, and existential inquiry, the artist Trevor Paglen had 100 photographs representing life on earth etched onto a silicon disk and had the disk attached to a communications satellite that was then sent into space to orbit the Earth indefinitely. What view of that life would the pictures give to extraterrestrial eyes? A grim, complex and fascinating one, and the show takes us through it step by step. The artist gives a guided tour on Saturday at 3 p.m. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com. (Cotter)
A. R. Penck: 'New Paintings' (closes on Friday) The most visionary and accessible German Neo-Expressionist painter is showing his best new work in several years, building on his well-known pictographic universe in new ways. It is variously magnified and abstracted, fusing cave painting, Constructivism and Morse code; pulled apart and upholstered with bright colors and elaborated into connected networks that suggest Stuart Davis. ''Land-scape -- Remote'' is especially strong, but the whole show suggests an artist at his ease, with nothing to lose. Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com. (Smith)
Alexandre Singh: 'The Pledge' (closes on Wednesday) One of the first projects done in the United States by the French-born, British-raised artist Alexandre Singh was a sprawling, delirious collaboration with Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe titled ''Hello Meth Lab in the Sun,'' installed at the Ballroom Marfa in Texas. Mr. Singh's solo exhibition at the Drawing Center is another full-gallery, somewhat psychedelic installation, albeit a considerably more subdued one. Black-and-white inkjet prints of collages that Mr. Singh made in response to interviews with artists and scientists are arranged like maps and schematics on the gallery's walls. It's a sleek display, vibrating with art historical references. But despite the high-tone interview subjects and visual references the show is unsparingly vapid, about as exciting as paging through a design magazine. 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Schwendener)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Fore' (closes on Sunday) In 2001 the Studio Museum in Harlem opened a dynamite group exhibition called ''Freestyle,'' which turned out to be the first in a series of shows introducing emerging artists of African-American descent. In the latest edition, ''Fore,'' organized by three young staff curators, Lauren Haynes, Naima J. Keith and Thomas J. Lax, covers the waterfront in terms of media, which it samples and mixes with turntablist flair, and in its contents, ranging from abstract to personal to political, sometimes combining all three. Firelei Báez, Sadie Barnette, Crystal Z. Campbell, Zachary Fabri, Yashua Klos, Akosua Adoma Owusu, Valerie Piraino and Nikki Pressley are some of the names to look for. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Josette Urso: 'Snow Day' (closes on Saturday) Contrary to the show's title, the strongest of these lush abstractions are the ones in which the drifts and banks of brilliant white oil paint are the least obtrusive or disappear altogether. In them the artist's propensity for weaving, noodling and circling -- as well as generally messing wet-on-wet color into subtly crazed patchworks of contrasting patterns, textures and pictorial ideas -- takes over. The resulting meanders are self-referential: a wry, opulent cartography of their own making. Kathryn Markel, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-5368, markelfinearts.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'We Buy White Albums: Rutherford Change' (closes on Saturday) The artist Rutherford Chang has temporarily turned Recess into a record shop, though only one title is in stock, the Beatles's 1968 ''White Album,'' and the shop is buying copies, not selling them, with more than 700 accumulated. Along with the scuff marks of time and use, many of the blank-slate covers carry words and drawings added by past owners. Mr. Chang's project is both an exercise in archiving and an act of creation. He photographs each album on arrival, and after the show is over he will produce a composite image from all the pictures: a new sedimented visual record of a cultural artifact. Recess, 41 Grand Street, SoHo, (646) 863-3765, recessart.org. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: A Budget Delayed, to Little G.O.P. Sympathy

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After a year-end fiscal crisis and protracted deficit-cutting negotiations between the White House and Congress scrambled the government's accounting, the president was more than a month late in meeting a deadline set by law for getting his annual budget to Capitol Hill in the new year.
President Obama? Yes, and Republicans are not happy about it. But before him there was President Ronald Reagan, who exactly a quarter-century ago sent his budget to Congress 45 days late, citing the disruptions and data changes forced by the late-1987 deficit reduction deal that he had negotiated with Democrats, who controlled Congress. 
As of Friday, Mr. Obama is 32 days late in delivering his budget for the 2014 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. Even now, White House officials will not say when it will surface, but some privately suggest early April.
That time frame would cause Mr. Obama to break Mr. Reagan's record for tardiness by a president who is not new to the office. The blueprint's arrival would follow House and Senate action over the next two weeks on their respective budgets, reversing the usual order; the president has gone first since 1921. And the delay would lend new meaning to the abbreviation for the White House Office of Management and Budget, O.M.B. -- Obama's Missing Budget.
Unlike Congressional Democrats in 1988, who expressed understanding for the lateness of Mr. Reagan's budget, Republican leaders now are not as sympathetic toward Mr. Obama, in another sign of the current heightened partisanship.
On Thursday, Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, challenged the White House, saying, ''Where is their plan to balance the budget?'' And earlier this week, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, took note of the rumors of an April budget submission and scolded Mr. Obama from the Senate floor, saying, ''That goes far beyond the pale of just missing deadlines.''
''It's time for the president to get his budget plan over to us -- not next week or next month, but now,'' Mr. McConnell said.
Mr. Obama's budget office might have had his budget ready by late March, some Democrats say, if the only delaying factor was the four months of wrangling since the November election over fiscal crises of Congress's and the White House's own making. But now Senate Democrats want Mr. Obama to hold off on releasing his budget until they finish work on their own this month, lest Republicans seize on inconsistencies between the two to score political points.
But the serial fiscal crises are the main culprit. First, the two parties contended over the so-called fiscal cliff late last year, which threatened broad tax increases; they ultimately agreed to limit those to the richest taxpayers. Then Mr. Obama and Republicans tussled to an impasse over spending and taxes. Absent their agreement on a deficit-reduction alternative, the standoff forced indiscriminate across-the-board spending cuts, known as sequestration, for military and domestic programs, starting last weekend.
And now Congress and the White House are preoccupied with the March 27 expiration of the law setting current spending levels for federal programs and agencies, seeking a mutually agreeable extension that will prevent a government shutdown.
For the administration's number crunchers, all this has meant that the usual work of preparing the president's budget has had to take a back seat as the bureaucrats help the negotiators and advise federal agencies left in the lurch. Each outcome of the high-level talks changes the spending and revenue data underlying the next budget. On New Year's Day, as on most days, work went on at the budget office.
Just after the year began, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, wrote to the acting director of Mr. Obama's budget office, Jeffrey D. Zients, asking when the president's proposal would reach Congress. Mr. Zients did not give a date in his response two days later, only confirming that the budget would be delayed because of ''the protracted 'fiscal cliff' negotiations,'' which consumed the final two months of 2012.
This week, after another two months of fighting over the budget cuts from sequestration, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, still did not have a date for reporters. ''There is no question that the series of crises, largely manufactured, that we and Congress have been having to deal with over the past several months have had an impact on that process.''
The postponement of Mr. Obama's budget ''is only to be expected, given what we've been through,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director. But, he added, ''lots of trees are going to be killed for no significant purpose if it's not meaningful.''
He and other fiscal analysts say it should be no wonder that the House and Senate budget committees will be able to produce their own budget proposals before the administration does. Congressional budget resolutions are significantly less detailed, filling pages while administration budgets fill volumes. A president's budget, with tens of thousands of line items for expenditures and revenues projected years ahead, must stand as something of a historical record of the fiscal moment, regardless of what Congress does with many of the particulars.
''The president's budget might be dead on arrival in Congress for political reasons, but it shouldn't be irrelevant for numbers reasons,'' Mr. Reischauer said. ''And given the fiscal cliff uncertainty, there was no knowing what the numbers would be, what the base was off of which the policies would be proposed. And then, of course, we had the question of what was going to happen with the sequester.''
Typically, only new presidents are notably late in submitting budgets because they take office shortly before the due date, currently the first Monday in February. President Bill Clinton was 66 days late in 1993, and President George W. Bush was 63 days late in 2001.
But Mr. Obama holds the record. As he took office at the height of a recession and a financial crisis, his bigger priorities in early 2009 were passing an economic stimulus and rescuing the auto and financial industries. His first budget was 98 days late.

HEADLINE: Hit-Run Suspect Charged With Felonies

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN and JULIE TURKEWITZ; Ravi Somaiya contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The suspect in a hit and run that killed a young pregnant woman, her husband and, later, their newborn son was returned to New York on Thursday and charged with three felony counts of criminally negligent homicide.
The suspect, Julio Acevedo, waived extradition at a brief Thursday morning hearing in Pennsylvania before a Lehigh County judge, and was later handed over to the New York police for the long drive to the 78th Precinct station house in Brooklyn.
At his arraignment in Criminal Court in Brooklyn late Thursday night, Mr. Acevedo was charged with criminally negligent homicide, as well as leaving the scene, excessive speed, assault and reckless driving, and the judge ordered him held without bail. The severity of the crash had led to calls -- from many in the Orthodox Jewish community, to which the couple belonged, and beyond -- for the police and prosecutors to aggressively pursue the driver of the BMW. 
Gayle Damf, a Brooklyn assistant district attorney, said that based on Mr. Acevedo's criminal record, he could face anywhere from 15 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
Ms. Damf said that on the night of the crash, two witnesses saw Mr. Acevedo's vehicle speed around a fire truck. After the crash, she said, ''They approached him. They asked if he was O.K.'' She continued: ''He said he was fine.'' The witnesses then approached the vehicle of the couple, Raizy and Nathan Glauber. When the witnesses turned around, ''he was gone,'' Ms. Damf said. The same witnesses later identified Mr. Acevedo in a police lineup.
A lawyer for Mr. Acevedo, Kathleen Julian, said that the crash ''was an accident, a horrible accident.'' She added: ''The facts are going to show it was an accident.''
The police had arrested Mr. Acevedo on felony charges of leaving the scene, and earlier Thursday night, added an additional charge of first-degree vehicular manslaughter for the death of the boy, who was delivered prematurely immediately after the accident and died a day later. Prosecutors did not file that charge.
New York courts have examined the issue of an emergency delivery after an accident: in 2002, a Brooklyn court found a drunken driver who hit a pregnant woman could be charged with manslaughter in the death of her 8-month-old fetus that was delivered after the crash and died shortly after.
A charge of manslaughter, prosecutors with experience in this area said, generally requires the driver to have criminal intent or be intoxicated, as was the case in 2002.
''The law is, if the baby is born prematurely and the only reason the baby is born is from his actions, and then dies, he caused the death of that child,'' said Arthur L. Aidala, a criminal defense lawyer and former assistant Brooklyn district attorney. ''All it takes is a breath'' from the baby for it to be considered a live birth.
Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the office of the chief medical examiner, said late Thursday that the couple's child died of ''extreme prematurity'' because of ''blunt force injuries'' sustained by Ms. Glauber during the accident.
Also on Thursday, the other driver in the crash spoke publicly for the first time at a news conference arranged by a taxi drivers' trade association.
Pedro Nuñez Delacruz, a veteran cabdriver, said he had no recollection of the crash that killed the Glaubers, both 21, who were in his car.
''Before the accident, there is nothing I can remember,'' he said.
The crash occurred just after midnight on Sunday on Kent Avenue as Mr. Delacruz turned from Wilson Street, which has a stop sign at the intersection.
''I know the area,'' Mr. Delacruz said. ''I've worked in this area for 10 years. I do this five days a week. Of course I'm going to stop at a stop sign.''
The police have said Mr. Acevedo, who did not have a stop sign or light, had been driving a borrowed BMW at ''more than 60 miles per hour'' when it slammed into the driver's side of the cab, owned by Mr. Delacruz.
Mr. Delacruz, a 32-year-old father of three whose wife is pregnant, said that the death of the family had devastated him. ''I'm not good,'' he said in Spanish.
''There is nothing that he did wrong,'' Fernando Mateo, the founder of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, said in a telephone call after the news conference. Mr. Mateo said Mr. Delacruz was in the process of formally transferring his car's paperwork to a new company, Brooklyn Car Service. On the day of the crash, that paperwork had yet to be processed, meaning the car should not have been sent to pick up passengers, the Taxi and Limousine Commission said.
Logs from Brooklyn Car Service list several pickups by Mr. Delacruz for the company that night, but none after 11:04 p.m.
Mr. Delacruz said he did not pick the Glaubers up on the street, but he did not say what company sent him.
Mr. Acevedo, 44, who is unemployed and had a pending court date at the time of the crash on a drunken-driving arrest, told the judge at his extradition hearing in Pennsylvania that he lived with his mother in Brooklyn. He said his last job was maintaining vehicles for a bus company.
Scott Brettschneider, a lawyer retained by Mr. Acevedo on Wednesday, said it was up to the prosecution to provide evidence of criminal behavior behind the wheel if they sought to bring stiffer charges than leaving the scene of an accident causing injuries (or, in this case, deaths), a felony. ''Other than a horrible accident, there has to be more than that,'' he said in a telephone interview before the arraignment.
Mr. Brettschneider said he had previously given legal advice to Mr. Acevedo during his time in prison. Mr. Acevedo, who has struggled with alcohol, has a history of serious crime and served more than eight years in prison for a 1987 killing.
''I think we have to see what the prosecution has,'' Mr. Brettschneider said. ''They have to prove everything.''

HEADLINE: Pope Wanted. Must Possess Magnetic Charm. And Grit.

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN and DANIEL J. WAKIN; Rachel Donadio, Michael Paulson and Jim Yardley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ROME -- No candidate for pope can have it all. But the cardinals who will elect the next pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church seem to be looking for someone who combines the charisma of Pope John Paul II with the grit of what one Vatican analyst called, only slightly tongue in cheek, ''Pope Rambo I.''
While it is too early to talk of front-runners, hints to the characteristics sought in a future pontiff can be discerned from the utterances of the cardinals who have spent the past week in meetings at the Vatican. Before Wednesday, when they stopped giving interviews, the cardinals frequently cited attributes the church now needs: a compelling communicator who wins souls through both his words and his holy bearing, and a fearless sheriff who can tackle the disarray and scandal in the Vatican.
Their focus on communication and good governance is in many ways an acknowledgment of the deficiencies of Pope Benedict XVI, who flew off in a helicopter to an unexpected retirement last week after a rocky eight-year tenure. But it is also a sign of the nostalgia for Benedict's predecessor, John Paul II, a magnetic presence who commanded the spotlight on trips around the world and even as he lay dying. 
On Benedict's watch, the church lost sway in Europe, the United States and even Latin America. The central bureaucracy in Rome, the Curia, fell more deeply into dysfunction and even corruption. Cardinals from several countries commented this week that they were seriously troubled by recent reports in the Italian news media about a secret dossier that was given to the departing Benedict and was said to contain explosive evidence of sexual and financial blackmail. The confidential dossier is supposed to be shown to the next pope.
Few candidates come with the whole package of talents, and the Italian news media have even floated the notion that the cardinals are considering ''tickets'' that would pair a pastoral pope with a tough, savvy secretary of state who could act as an administrator and, if need be, enforcer.
The next pontiff may not need to execute a crackdown on Vatican infighting and misdeeds, but he must at least have the executive smarts to appoint a deputy fearless enough to confront the entrenched Vatican bureaucracy.
''The first thing he has to do is put greater order in the central administration of the Curia,'' said Cardinal Edward Egan, the retired archbishop of New York. ''He has to be willing to take criticism.''
And at the same time, ''He has to be a man who understands the faith and can announce it in an attractive and uncomplicated way,'' said Cardinal Egan, who voted in the conclave that elected Benedict, but is now just beyond the voting age limit of 80.
As of Thursday, all of the 115 cardinals eligible to vote and expected to come had arrived in Rome. But exactly when they will be locked into the Sistine Chapel to vote for the next pope remained uncertain. The cardinals have been meeting behind closed doors in the Vatican's Paul VI hall every day this week, listening to one another speak about the challenges facing the church.
For those whose names have been circulated as ''papabile,'' or candidates for pope, the speeches serve in part as auditions.
The lag in scheduling the conclave indicated that the cardinals were still at the stage of assessing one another's personalities, records and ideas, said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, in a news media briefing on Thursday.
Any serious papal candidate has to be prayerful, theologically sound and fluent in Italian, the language of the Vatican and of Rome, which is, after all, the pope's own diocese.
Several cardinals have also said that the next pope must have had experience as bishop of a diocese. That description would exclude some cardinals who have served most of their years in the Curia and those with little pastoral experience, like Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, the erudite Italian whom Benedict gave the honor of preaching at the Vatican's recent Lenten retreat.
Cardinal Donald Wuerl, archbishop of Washington, said in an interview, ''Being a shepherd of a local church, I think, would be a very important factor if you're going to be engaged in this idea of renewing the church spiritually.''
Several cardinals have also emphasized that a pope must be able to reach out to other faiths, improve relations with bishops around the world and forcefully present Catholic teaching.
Many of those mentioned as papabile are said to have proven talents as administrators, either in their archdioceses or in the Roman Curia, or both. These include Cardinals Angelo Scola, archbishop of Milan; Odilo Pedro Scherer, archbishop of São Paulo, Brazil; Peter Erdo, archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest and primate of Hungary; Leonardo Sandri, an Argentine with long experience in the Roman Curia; and Marc Ouellet, a Canadian who heads the Vatican's powerful Congregation for Bishops.
But several of those prelates are known to be short on charisma or presence. Cardinals Erdo and Ouellet are said by associates and former students to be more comfortable reading from a prepared text than speaking spontaneously in front of crowds or giving interviews.
Other cardinals, meanwhile, have had their reputations climb with a proven ability to communicate with mass audiences, notably Cardinal Luis Antonio G. Tagle of the Philippines. But his age, just 55, works against him. He is the second-youngest cardinal, after Baselios Thottunkal of India.
Age is an important criterion, especially after the resignation of Benedict, who is 85. Many cardinals agree that the future pope would ideally be in his 60s, and Cardinal Wilfrid F. Napier of South Africa narrowed the age to the early 60s. He suggested in an interview that it was time for a longer papacy, to carry forward efforts to strengthen the church.
''You need more time to build on those foundations,'' Cardinal Napier said. ''I think we need a longer papacy to generate the energy and keep the momentum going.'' He added, ''From informal conversations, some of the other cardinals would be looking in that direction as well.''
In the past, it would have been unthinkable to have a serious papal contender from the United States, an economic and political superpower, but Vatican watchers say that for the first time ever, there is enthusiasm for two Americans who have both charisma and administrative strengths: Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, a garrulous presence, and Cardinal Sean Patrick O'Malley of Boston, a Franciscan friar.
While it remains unlikely that either will become pope, largely because the United States is still perceived as a global superpower whose interests do not always dovetail so smoothly with those of the Catholic Church, this conclave is the first to break the taboo.
''For the first time Americans are even being considered -- that's the news,'' said Marco Politi, a veteran Vatican watcher in Italy.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall Unexpectedly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting a pickup in the labor market and the pace of economic growth.
The decline in jobless claims, released on Thursday, may foreshadow a strong report on February employment.
The figures were the latest to indicate the economy's resilience amid higher taxes, although a separate report showing that the United States trade gap widened in January dimmed the near-term outlook a bit. 
''Fundamentally, we are getting on a little better footing right now,'' said Omair Sharif, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Stamford, Conn.
Initial claims for state jobless aid fell 7,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 340,000, the Labor Department said. It was the second consecutive weekly decline, and it confounded economists' expectations for an increase to 355,000.
The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, fell 7,000 to 348,750, the lowest level since March 2008.
On Jan. 1, a 2 percent payroll tax cut ended and tax rates rose for wealthy Americans. In addition, $85 billion in federal budget cuts took effect on March 1 that could slice as much as 0.6 percentage point from growth this year.
Economists were encouraged by the drop in claims. ''It suggests that some jobs are being created, and there is income that is falling into the consumers' pockets,'' said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.
In another sign of improving economic conditions, household debt grew at its fastest pace since early 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Federal Reserve said in a report. Consumers continued to increase their borrowing in January from December, adding $16.2 billion in debt.
Meanwhile, a separate report showed that worker productivity fell at its fastest pace in four years in the fourth quarter, but the decline was likely to be temporary as economic growth is expected to increase after stalling in late 2012.
''First-quarter growth is going to be substantially stronger than where we ended last year,'' Mr. Bullard said.
The economy grew at a 0.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the first three months of this year range as high as 2.8 percent, mostly reflecting an increase in the pace of business restocking.
The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit widened to $44.45 billion in January from $38.14 billion in December. Exports fell, giving back the bulk of December's gains, while imports rebounded after being depressed by disruptions to port activity in the previous months.
The inflation-adjusted trade deficit widened to $48 billion from $44.2 billion in December. Economists said this suggested that trade would be a small drag on first-quarter growth.
''The sharp deterioration in trade shaves a bit from the outlook for growth in the first quarter,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. ''There are signs that domestic demand is firming, which would provide a major offset to weakness abroad.''
While the latest jobless claims data fell outside the period for the government's report on February employment due on Friday, economists said they would not be surprised if job growth during the month beat expectations.
A Reuters survey of economists said employers probably added 160,000 jobs last month, a small increase from 157,000 in January. That would just be enough to hold the jobless rate steady at 7.9 percent.
Economists say job gains of at least 250,000 a month are needed to significantly reduce unemployment. Job growth averaged 200,000 in the three months through January.
Worker productivity fell at a 1.9 percent annual rate, the weakest pace since the fourth quarter of 2008, the Labor Department reported. A month ago it estimated that productivity, hourly output per worker, fell at a 2 percent pace.
It increased at a 3.1 percent rate in the third quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the decline in productivity to be revised to a 1.6 percent rate.
The drop largely reflects a surge in hiring while output continued to expand at a slower pace. The economy added about 600,000 jobs in the fourth quarter, but gross domestic product grew at only a 0.1 percent rate.

HEADLINE: Downeast

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
All those daunting economic numbers that tabulate how many Americans are unemployed and how many factory jobs have been lost in the last 30 years can seem abstract until you run into a documentary like ''Downeast.'' This modest film by David Redmon and Ashley Sabin looks at one small effort to save a handful of jobs in Gouldsboro, Me. It's a tale of hope, frustration and disappointment that reminds us that behind all those big numbers are real human beings. 
The film chronicles what happened when Stinson Seafood, the last full-time sardine cannery in the United States, closed in 2010, with a loss of 128 jobs. It tells the tale from the perspective of Antonio Bussone, an Italian immigrant in Boston who tries to buy the site with hopes of reopening it as a lobster-packing plant and bringing back some of the lost jobs. The obstacles he encounters, first from a local leader, then from forces even further beyond his control, seem heartbreakingly laughable, if there can be such a thing.
This is not an easy documentary to watch, in the sense that the filmmakers let the story tell itself, without narration or expert commentary. That ultimately makes it all the more touching. ''If everybody in this room is as dedicated to their job as I am, it will succeed,'' one longtime Stinson worker says as she starts work at Mr. Bussone's new venture. The touching naïveté of that statement is soon painfully evident.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by David Redmon and Ashley Sabin 1 hour 20 minutes; not rated

HEADLINE: Shareholders in Europe Demand Control

 BODY:
Voters in Switzerland this week overwhelmingly approved a referendum to give shareholders a binding say on executive pay. The Swiss measures are the latest and most far-reaching of various say-on-pay policies now in place or under consideration in many European nations. Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands all have some form of voting on binding pay. 
The Swiss measures require lawmakers to pass a law giving shareholders the right to hold a binding vote on all compensation for executives and directors of Swiss-based public companies. The law will also ban one-time bonuses for joining or leaving a company, and it will require greater transparency. For example, pension funds will have to disclose how they vote at shareholder meetings, which will enable a fund's members to assess whether their interests have been represented.
Top corporate executives may bristle at the suggestion that they are overpaid. But the higher the pay, the likelier it is to be disconnected from market fundamentals or the concerns of shareholders, employees and, in cases of bailed-out bankers, taxpayers.
While American laws do not require the level of control imposed by some European nations, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been too slow in carrying out the shareholder protections that are on the books. In the United States, shareholder votes on executive pay are nonbinding. That's better than having no say at all, which was the case before the rules were changed in 2011 under the Dodd-Frank law. But a nonbinding vote still regards shareholders as advisers, rather than owners. And the S.E.C. has not yet proposed rules to implement a Dodd-Frank provision that requires companies to calculate and disclose the ratio of a chief executive's compensation to the company's median pay package. That data is crucial to gauging whether executive pay is excessive and how pay disparities affect company performance and the economy.
This week, in a pre-emptive strike against rules that have not yet been written, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, introduced a bill that would weaken the executive pay disclosures required by Dodd-Frank. That would be exactly the wrong way to go.

HEADLINE: It's About the Work, Not the Office

BYLINE: By JENNIFER GLASS. 
Jennifer Glass is a professor of sociology and senior researcher in the Population Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin.

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
THE recent decision by Marissa Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo, to eliminate telecommuting for all workers brings her company back in line with most of corporate America, where working from home is more illusion than reality. Although many -- some estimate most -- American jobs could successfully be performed at home, only roughly 16 percent of American employees actually telecommute in any given year. And that figure is reached only by using a very generous definition of telecommuting -- working from home at least one hour per week.
The idea behind the Yahoo announcement, as well as a more limited announcement from Best Buy this week that will add restrictions to its telecommuting policy, was that bringing workers back to the office would lead to greater collaboration and innovation. This is despite numerous studies showing that telecommuting workers are more productive than those working on-site.
Yet a work force culture based on long hours at the office with little regard for family or community does not inevitably lead to strong productivity or innovation. Two outdated ideas seem to underlie the Yahoo decision: first, that tech companies can still operate like the small groups of 20-something engineers that founded them; and second, the most old-fashioned of all, that companies get the most out of their employees by limiting their autonomy. 
Consider the reality of telecommuting in the United States: most of the telecommuting hours put in by managers and professionals occur after they have worked at least 40 hours at the office. For them, working from home means checking e-mail, returning calls and writing reports during evenings, weekends and vacations.
I suspect Yahoo is not keen on eradicating that type of telecommuting, which increases work hours and squeezes ever greater productivity from workers. Its change was aimed at eliminating the type of telecommuting that substitutes for time spent at the office and that gives employees the opportunity to avoid long commutes and design their work hours around family or community obligations.
Why are companies so leery of this type of flexibility? Managers are tempted to use ''face time'' in the office as the de facto measurement of commitment and productivity. They are often suspicious about employees who work out of sight, believing they will shirk or drift if not under constant supervision. As a result, telecommuting is often viewed as a perk to be handed out after employees have proved their worth.
But another important reason may be the difficulty of developing reliable metrics to measure the performances of employees who work at home, especially when they are involved in team projects. We tend to attribute quality work to those we see all the time and with whom we discuss work performance and accomplishments.
This belief may be especially strong at tech companies, whose heady early days of creative innovation suggested that living at the office with your young peers produced the fastest results. What we tend to forget is that many unsuccessful tech companies also started that way, and that even the successful ones eventually had to grow beyond the boundaries of a group of friends pulling all-nighters of inventive exploration, getting a new platform or search architecture to work.
After all, Yahoo now has 14,000 employees -- it's hard to imagine that all of them have a mission to innovate and create new processes and products. These are customer service representatives, technical repair workers. Does Yahoo really want them creatively innovating, going off script with untested solutions?
Regardless, employees, creative or not, get older, marry, bear children, watch their parents grow infirm, and want lives outside the workplace. And despite companies' best efforts to replace family and simulate home life by providing cafeterias, game rooms and concierge services for dry cleaning, most people eventually learn the hard way that companies will not care for you when times are hard; they will cut your pay or forgo your 401(k) match in economic downturns, and will dispose of you when you become ill or disabled. As Robert Frost reminds us, home is the place where they have to take you in. Work is not that place.
In the last week, I have heard a number of claims that research supports the idea that workers on-site are more innovative than those who work from home. I remain skeptical. The notion that impromptu conversations with colleagues in the cafeteria are the core of innovation seems a bit simplistic; in my experience, they are just as likely to produce talk of better jobs at competing firms or last night's ''American Idol'' winner. Besides, much of this ''research'' simply shows that workers who collaborate with others in loose networks generate better ideas. It doesn't suggest that the best way to create new products and services is by isolating your employees in the silo of a single location.
It is no coincidence that some of the most successful engines of innovation in our economy are our great research universities. Yet I have never seen a single university administrator try to corral faculty members into more face time at the office. Instead, researchers are encouraged to travel to conferences to meet with peers and find out the latest developments in their fields, and to use technology to maintain contact with a web of associates around the globe who can be mustered on demand for consultation and support.
To give one small example, two of my colleagues, at Cornell University, a demographer and geographer, recently came up with the idea for a study to improve the retention of women working in science while chatting during their children's after-school swim lessons. Even within Cornell, stuck in their respective units, they might never have met. The logic that insists that the best new ideas come from staying within one's company walls as long as possible sounds like a return to the corporate groupthink of an earlier era.
Were there other ways to foster collaboration within Yahoo? Of course. Ms. Mayer could have insisted on core work hours or days for all employees, when everyone works on-site. Or Yahoo could have developed collaborative work spaces off-site, closer to the neighborhoods where telecommuting employees live, to provide them with opportunities to connect to others doing similar work. Large screens to Skype in telecommuting team members for daily or weekly meetings could be a routine part of every group space. Above all, managers could focus on a results-oriented system of evaluation for all employees, telecommuting or not. This sends the message that outcomes are more important than location or hours on the job.
If the Dilbertization of Yahoo actually improves innovation, I'll change my tune. But companies like Yahoo will not get more out of their employees by watching them like hawks and monitoring their every move. Nor can they recreate the dynamism of their founding moment by trying to return to a perpetual organizational adolescence. The 37-year-old Ms. Mayer, new mother, may have yet to learn that.

HEADLINE: Looming Cuts Add to Problems at Nuclear Site

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
RICHLAND, Wash. -- Here in the place where plutonium production for the nation's bomb arsenal was elevated to industrial scale, in the rolling scrub country of south-central Washington, dangerous industrial pollutants are still getting into the soil only a few miles from the Columbia River.
For the nation's largest environmental cleanup project, a legacy of World War II and the cold war, the announcement last month of six newly confirmed leaking tanks of radioactive waste was added evidence that even after decades of work and billions of dollars in taxpayer sacrifice, the Hanford Nuclear Reservation's risks remain unresolved. 
But as Washington's new governor, Jay Inslee, swept onto the site on Wednesday for a hard-hat tour and a briefing, and federal officials warned of layoffs from budget cuts rippling through the federal Department of Energy, the reminder was equally clear, state and federal officials said, that government has always been the real defining force at this place.
Nature might, in the end, bat last at Hanford, in deciding whether the land can ever be healed, but in the meantime government policy and spending decisions are running the bases.
''I'm very disturbed that at the very month that we have six new leaking tanks of radioactive material, the sequestration hits, which could result in the furlough of several thousand people,'' said Mr. Inslee, a Democrat and a former congressman.
The federal Department of Energy said this week that up to 4,800 workers out of Hanford's 9,000-person work force, mostly employed by private contractors, could be hit with furloughs or layoffs starting April 1. About 1,200 workers were already laid off from late 2011 to January 2013 -- unrelated to the mandatory budget cuts known as the sequester -- as technical problems slowed down construction of a $12.3 billion waste processing plant at the site. Those cuts have already rippled through the local economy.
''It's nasty,'' said Joan Nelson, 72, the owner of Rosy's Ice Cream and Diner, a breakfast and lunch spot in Richland, where employee hours have been cut as residents stopped going out to eat as much. Ms. Nelson -- she named the place for a doll she and her sisters shared growing up -- said Richland has always swung in its ups and downs with the vicissitudes of the federal check. The city was essentially built from scratch as a federal company town for Hanford workers starting in 1943.
''It's a roller coaster,'' she said.
Her husband, David -- in a typical example of the web connecting the town and the vast federal works outside it -- is an electrical engineer at Hanford.
Federal cleanup managers, in interviews with reporters who were invited to the site for Mr. Inslee's walkabout, emphasized that the new leaks pose no public health threat to Richland or anywhere else. The amounts are small, less than three gallons a day from the six newly identified leakers, and are far from any underground or surface water that might be contaminated, including the Columbia River itself, they said.
But the uncertainties in financial terms, about how things might proceed from here, and with what tools, are genuine and grave, they said.
''We've got a lot of risks out there -- sequestration is one of them,'' said Tom Fletcher, who administers Hanford's 177 tanks of radioactive waste as the assistant manager of tank farms at the Department of Energy's Office of River Protection.
Mr. Inslee, who has declared a ''zero tolerance policy,'' as regards environmental threats at Hanford -- and the federal government's decades-old promise to fix what it broke on the land -- said he would be unrelenting in keeping the pressure on.
He applauded a decision this week by the Department of Energy to accelerate proposals to send some lower-level nuclear waste -- including material from five of the leaking tanks -- to a repository in New Mexico. But those plans also face hurdles in approvals and technical details, and are years into the future in any event, Mr. Inslee conceded, which means the leaks will continue.
That federal spending could retreat even as the need for its continuation is underscored by new leaks, Mr. Inslee said, is the real threat at Hanford.
''Not only will it slow down this process, which we have been waiting decades to get done, but it will also make it more expensive for the taxpayers in the long run,'' he said, referring to the job cuts. ''So this is extremely discouraging news that the Congress has not been able to solve this problem.''
No one doubts that the cleanup of Hanford -- in scale and technical challenge, and therefore, cost -- is anything but daunting. Nine nuclear reactors, producing plutonium for bombs -- from the one that exploded over Nagasaki in 1945, to the ballistic missile stockpiles of the 1950s through the '80s -- created waste that piled up year upon year to a total of about 56 million gallons' worth. About one million gallons of that is believed to have leaked over time from 67 of the 149 single-shell storage tanks at the 586-square-mile site.
Part of the problem that has nagged construction of a treatment plant -- which would fuse the waste with glass into stable, storable logs for long-term burial, a process called vitrification -- is knowing with certainty the composition of the waste that might flow through pipelines from the tanks.
That led to a halt of construction last year at one of the four giant structures, called the pretreatment building, until technical questions could be resolved, said Todd A. Nelson, a spokesman for the lead contractor at the plant construction site, Bechtel National. Work was also reduced on one other building, he said, pending resolution of technical questions and completion of design.
Those kinds of problems have been Hanford's chronic pattern, said Tom Carpenter, the executive director of Hanford Challenge, a Seattle-based watchdog group that has represented whistle-blowers at the site.
''What you end up with is a system that's very good at spending money,'' he said.
And wasting it: On Thursday, a Colorado company called CH2M Hill Hanford Group and its parent company, a contractor in managing the waste tanks, agreed to pay $18.5 million to settle civil and criminal federal allegations of timecard fraud in billing for years of inflated overtime, the Justice Department said.

HEADLINE: Evil Banker Syndrome

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
London
I was talking the other day to a U.S. banker who works in the City for a British bank. He was complaining about a decision-making process that was cumbersome by American standards. But his main issue was a feeling that bankers in Europe are seen as the enemy -- overpaid profiteers. It was a relief to get to New York, he said, where the economic mood was more upbeat and post-meltdown fury fading.
The banker's words came back to me on my return this week to Europe from the United States. The headlines were all about bankers' bonuses and executive pay curbs. European Union finance ministers have approved, over British objections, the capping of bankers' bonuses at twice their salary -- and a bonus that big will require the approval of two-thirds of shareholders. The normal cap will be a 1:1 ratio of bonus-to-salary. 
The Swiss -- no less -- have approved in a referendum a series of executive pay curbs, including banning golden hellos and goodbyes and giving shareholders a binding say on executive pay.
When the Swiss get riled over the rich and their money, some big shift is afoot. Europe is doubling down on solidarity.
I understand the anger. A 200 percent bonus should be sufficient for anyone. The recklessness of executives at too-big-to-fail banks in the run-up to the 2008 meltdown cost just about everyone -- except themselves. Huge bonuses tend to encourage the taking of short-term risks. The masters of the universe have had their moment: the 1,701 people applying for 8 low-paid jobs as ''baristas'' in a new Costa Coffee branch in Nottingham should not have to read about multimillion-dollar golden handshakes.
All true -- but beware the feel-good retribution that returns to haunt you. City jobs will disappear (Boris Johnson, the conservative mayor of London, called the measures ''moronic''). Fixed salaries may rise to offset the loss; they are harder to claw back.
At a more fundamental level, John Authers has argued persuasively in the Financial Times that the real problem is not bonuses but corporate governance. As he writes: ''Limit the leverage that banks can use, and require them to hold more capital, and bonuses will be less variable. Tell them that they cannot trade with depositors' funds, or split the biggest banks, and compensation will be less variable.'' What is needed is a ''a banking system that can sensibly allocate savers' capital to productive investment opportunities. The compensation issue, to the extent that there is one, is dealt with in the process.''
But when Europe sees an opportunity to control or regulate free markets it still has a hard time resisting. These measures are good politics for European politicians. They would not fly in the United States, for all the anti-Wall Street anger engendered by the Great Recession.
The essential difference between the United States and Europe endures. It is over risk and reward. The American experience begins with risk, that of immigrants who went there in the first place. The European experience ends with solidarity, the insurance policy an old and war-scarred Continent has taken out against the worst. America yearns to be free, Europe to be free of want: politicians must pitch their appeals accordingly. These are core characteristics, written into the respective DNAs on each side of the Atlantic.
Where America enshrines the individual, Europe ennobles the collective. As to which approach is preferable, that seems to me a matter of personal choice. Capitalist churn can be cruel. On the other hand social democratic solidarity can be stultifying. It may be easier to get ahead in America. It is certainly far better to be left behind in Europe. Which is more important to you?
We may dream of Eumerica, some transcontinental fusion where the can-do attitude is American and the healthcare French. But in the end a choice must be made: Do you want your capitalism raw or remedied?
Some say this is a time of transAtlantic convergence. When President Obama calls for a trans-Atlantic free-trade agreement in his State of the Union address and all the talk in Washington is of avoiding war and saving money, it may indeed seem that this is a time of U.S.-European coming together and that the days of inhabiting Mars and Venus (in Robert Kagan's phrase) are over.
I do not believe it. Mark Leonard had an interesting Reuters column the other day called ''The Europeanization of America,'' which noted the points of apparent convergence and quoted Michele Flournoy, a former undersecretary of defense, saying (with caveats): ''We don't want to be the world's policemen.''
It is true that the U.S. wars without victory in Iraq and Afghanistan have sapped the fires of Mars. America's new God is the Drone. There is a touch of Europe's Venus in the U.S. pivot away from Bush-era bellicosity.
The rise of the rest has left Europe and the United States with shared anxieties over insolvency. The convergence, such as it is, has about it something of a desire to dilute misery by sharing it.
But Americans will still take the bonus and run while Europeans strive worthily to redistribute it.

HEADLINE: The Latest Front in a Long War

BYLINE: By CHESTER A. CROCKER and ELLEN LAIPSON

 BODY:
HISTORY has often shown that military victories do not automatically translate into political success. This is true in the recent military victory of French and government of Mali forces in their fight against radical Islamist insurgents who tried to seize power in the North African nation. The small victory in Mali is just the beginning of what will likely be a very long struggle for control of the Sahel -- the trans-Saharan badlands that stretch from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea.
We all know now that President George W. Bush was premature when he said in 2003 that ''major combat operations in Iraq have ended'' as he stood in front of a banner reading ''Mission Accomplished.'' It would be equally premature today to say that success in Mali signals the defeat of jihadist forces in the Sahel. 
The Sahel divides the Sahara desert from the grasslands to the south. The unstable region stretches 3,400 miles west to east across parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Algeria, Niger, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan and Eritrea. Militias roam the region trafficking in drugs and arms, seizing hostages for ransom, and trading livestock.
The turmoil in the Sahel is shaping up to be a long-playing conflict that will end well only with the help of African regional organizations, Western nations, nongovernmental groups, and the United Nations providing a mix of military, diplomatic and economic assistance. Collective conflict management carried out by improvised, case-specific networks operating in informal cooperation is urgently needed.
While it draws scant attention from the Western media, the Sahel-North Africa region is actually more important than Afghanistan to the vital interests of Western powers. North Africa provides energy security for Europe with its vast oil and natural gas deposits, along with maritime security in the Mediterranean. Governments in the region have the potential to foster democratic change in post-authoritarian states. But the Sahel is unlikely to ever see large-scale troop deployments from NATO countries that are war-weary and financially tapped out from fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Unfortunately, an over-reliance on counterterrorism as the driver of policy risks distorting the true nature of the conflict in Mali and the broader Sahel, even if the fight against terrorism serves as an effective argument for rallying resources and support in Western capitals. Combating jihadists will require a light touch of coercive power, a finely tuned awareness of complex micro-politics, and a seasoned grasp of the interplay of regional currents.
A year ago we convened African, Middle Eastern and strategic experts for discussions in Washington to contemplate the causes, consequences and possible responses to the zone of instability in the Sahel. We looked at the unforeseen effects of the fall of Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya -- from the movement of fighters and weapons across vast, unmarked borders, to the loss of a wealthy and sometimes helpful patron of African clients across large swaths of the Sahara.
In the unplanned flow of people, ideas, money and goods between the Mediterranean rim countries and their southern neighbors after the Libyan revolution we saw few net winners, lots of losers, and a compelling need to build new partnerships for security and peace-building.
For example, we concluded a year ago that France and Algeria needed to up their game to address the rising tensions in Mali, driven in part by demands by members of the Tuareg ethnic group and by the growing assertiveness of Al Qaeda in the Maghreb .
We did not see any easy solutions or early endpoints. Instead, we anticipated a multiyear requirement to build knowledge and relationships to prevent the post-Qaddafi turbulence from destabilizing an entire region or -- if mishandled -- from turning the region into a dangerous magnet for jihadist terrorists.
If the Malian government reaches out to rebuild the political fabric of the vast nation, it could isolate the jihadist element and reverse the negative dynamics in Mali itself. If not, a contagious and deadly interplay of people and violence could cross borders in many directions.
North African states need to help their southern neighbors, and vice versa, to prevent lawlessness from spreading north or southeast across the Sahel into Niger, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Nigeria. Tunisia, Libya and Egypt -- where governments were overthrown in the ''Arab Spring'' -- also remain vulnerable to violence and instability.
Today Mali needs the sustained support of African and Western partners. The victory there must be carefully sustained using all the political, diplomatic and economic tools available. A counterterrorism strategy will not succeed in a political vacuum.
Chester A. Crocker is professor of strategic studies at Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service and served as assistant secretary of state for African Affairs from 1981 to 1989. Ellen Laipson is president of the Stimson Center.

HEADLINE: Pressure Mounts on France to Overhaul Labor Rules

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- The French unemployment rate ended last year at its highest level since 1999, the national statistics institute reported Thursday, underscoring the urgency of President François Hollande's task as he pushes for a far-reaching labor law overhaul intended to encourage new hiring.
The jobless rate rose to 10.6 percent in the October-December period, up 0.4 percentage point from the previous quarter, the statistics agency, Insee, said, as gross domestic product shrank 0.3 percent amid government austerity measures. Almost 26 percent of young people were classified as jobless, Insee said. 
The unemployment rate has risen for six consecutive quarters, putting pressure on public finances and turning an uncomfortable spotlight on the Socialist president's campaign promise to get the labor market moving in the right direction by the end of this year.
The answer, the government hopes, lies in a ''flexicurity'' agreement signed Jan. 11 by employers and unions that would give companies more freedom to hire and fire. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault's cabinet endorsed the deal, and said it would present it to Parliament for approval this spring.
''This is a win-win deal for businesses that get into trouble, that have to reorganize,'' Mr. Ayrault said, adding that the accord gives companies a tool other than layoffs for addressing their problems.
The agreement, which draws on ideas pioneered in Denmark, a country with one of the world's most flexible labor markets, would probably not have been possible a generation ago, or even under Mr. Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. But several years of crisis and economic stagnation have led to an acknowledgement across most of the political spectrum that relatively high labor costs are making it harder for French workers to compete when jobs can easily be outsourced to low-wage countries.
Those concerns have been magnified by a recent diatribe against French workers by an American tire company executive, Maurice Taylor Jr., who said he would be ''stupid'' to invest in a French factory, and a call for a ''competitiveness shock'' from a former top aerospace executive, Louis Gallois.
Stefano Scarpetta, head of the labor division at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the French appeared to be learning from the example set by Germany, where companies faced with a less rigid labor code have better weathered the recent crises and where unemployment, at 5.3 percent, is half the level in France.
''The lesson we learned from the German model is that by promoting internal adjustment in the firm you can reduce the impact of a shock,'' he said. ''The French agreement promotes that kind of adjustment.''
The Jan. 11 proposal would allow companies facing serious problems to negotiate with unions to cut working hours and wages for up to two years, reducing the incentive to lay off employees. That is particularly important, Mr. Scarpetta said, because tools like flex-time arrangements have allowed German employers to retain most of their employees by reducing the overall hours worked.
The proposal would make it easier for employees to be reassigned and would cap the amount that laid-off workers could be awarded by labor courts. Another area of major change would be the way in which layoffs are managed. Currently, companies announcing a major restructuring open themselves to time-consuming and expensive legal maneuvering. But in cases where unions oppose restructuring plans, the new accord would give companies the right to seek approval directly from government labor administrators, reducing the judiciary's role in the process.
In exchange, employers would have to pay more of the health care costs for about 3.5 million, mostly lower-wage, workers. Companies would be discouraged from short-term hiring by a payroll tax surcharge, graduated downward as the term of contracts increased. Workers would gain seats on the boards of major enterprises. And those who were laid off would not lose their accumulated unemployment benefits as soon as they returned to work, as currently, giving them more incentive to get off the dole.
Despite the additional costs, the deal is widely backed by the corporate sector. Laurence Parisot, president of Medef, the main business lobby, on Wednesday hailed the plan as one that would help end ''the divisions that for 40 years have limited France's capacity to transform itself, to evolve, to rise to the challenges with which it is confronted.''
The question now, Mr. Scarpetta said, is how well it survives its trip through Parliament.
The principal opposition party, the center-right U.M.P., argues that the measures do not go far enough to unfetter employers, but many members are expected to support the plan provided it remains largely intact.
That support would be unnecessary if Mr. Hollande's own parliamentary bloc were solidly behind the proposal, but there is unease among some of the government's allies. The far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon this week described the accord as ''villainous'' and accused Mr. Hollande of carrying through Mr. Sarkozy's work. Perhaps more glaringly, two of France's most militant unions -- the Confédération Générale du Travail and Force Ouvrière -- have refused to sign on, weakening the claim that it was made with the backing of workers.
Still, the unions have shown that they are prepared to give ground in the face of economic necessity. Force Ouvrière said Wednesday that it had agreed to restructuring plans at Renault that would allow the automaker to increase working hours, freeze wages and lay off workers.
In any case, Mr. Scarpetta said, ''It's already a good sign'' that unions and employers have come this far. ''It's a step in the right direction.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Looking to Tap Countrymen's Demand Abroad

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Malaysian casino operator Genting envisions red-and-gold pagodas and a panda exhibit on the 87 acres of Las Vegas land it bought this week, a new gambling playground for rich Chinese moving their money overseas.
A 90-minute flight away from those 35 hectares, in San Francisco, China's biggest property developer has formed a joint venture to develop two high-rise condominium towers that are likely to draw wealthy Chinese buyers. It is the first foray by the company, China Vanke, into the U.S. market, and probably not its last. 
Combined, the two deals are worth about $1 billion, which could rise to at least $3 billion as Genting completes its resort, which is due to open in 2016. That is just a fraction of the $102 billion in investment abroad from companies in the Asia-Pacific region in 2012, according to Thomson Reuters data.
But it signals a strategic shift.
Instead of hunting for natural resources, the driving force behind many of Asia's biggest foreign acquisitions over the past year, these companies are investing in the United States to cater to Chinese consumers abroad.
Beijing bars individuals from moving more than the equivalent of about $50,000 a year out of the country. Yet vast sums leak out illegally. Estimates vary widely on just how much, but the research group Global Financial Integrity said the total in 2011 alone could have been as much as $472 billion.
The money goes to places like Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, London and San Francisco, where a heavy flow of Chinese buyers has driven up property prices. But until the Genting and Vanke deals, there was little evidence that large Asian companies were chasing the cash to the United States.
''You have Chinese money sitting in U.S. houses and Chinese money sitting in U.S. banks. If you're smart, you start setting up places for Chinese people to stay and things for them to buy,'' said Derek Scissors, an economist who tracks Chinese foreign investment for the Heritage Foundation, a research organization in Washington.
Mr. Scissors said the Genting and Vanke deals represented another step in the progression of Chinese investment in the United States since the global financial crisis.
First, individual Chinese investors started pouring money into U.S. property in late 2009. Then, a couple of years later, Chinese property developers began searching for deals, largely unsuccessfully. The Genting and Vanke transactions are early signs that Asian companies see ways to tap Chinese demand beyond China, something few U.S. companies seem to have recognized.
The property that Genting bought had been abandoned since 2008, and the deal is the biggest new investment on the Las Vegas Strip since then. In that time, China's gambling capital, Macau, has opened four new casinos -- two of them built by the U.S. company Las Vegas Sands.
Genting has casinos in cities like Singapore, which is popular with Chinese visitors, but not in Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub. The company is not guaranteed success in Las Vegas, a market with tougher competition and thinner margins than those in Genting's power base in Singapore, where it operates one of only two casinos.
Its arrival could spell trouble for casino rivals, too.
The ratings agency Fitch warned that Genting's arrival was a ''risk'' for U.S. operators because its project would add 3,500 hotel rooms in a city where occupancy was flat last year and the average daily rate a tepid 2.8 percent higher.
''We believe the property will target high-end Asian customers, which has been the principal catalyst for gaming revenue growth on the Strip since 2010,'' Fitch said, adding that high-end properties run by Sands, Wynn Resorts and others were ''especially vulnerable to the increased competition from Genting.''
For Vanke, venturing into the United States makes sense now because Beijing is clamping down on property speculation at home. New restrictions announced March 1 may speed the flow of Chinese property investment abroad.
Vanke ''will go anywhere mainland Chinese want to go,'' said Jinsong Du, a property analyst at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. ''Their target customer is not overseas Chinese. Their target customer is mainland Chinese who want to migrate to overseas, or have a home outside the country.''
Vanke's president, Yu Liang, however, said the company had no intention of building a Chinese community overseas.
''What we are looking for is overseas resources and market, not Chinese immigrants. We place emphasis on the concept of harmony,'' he said.
Other Asian companies might learn from the example set by Vanke and Genting.
Jonathan Galaviz, managing director at Galaviz & Co., a California-based research and strategic advisory company, said real estate and hotel companies like CapitaLand in Singapore and Sun Hung Kai Properties in Hong Kong were running the risk of losing global relevance, as they lacked a U.S. presence.
In an e-mailed statement, Sun Hung Kai said it aimed for a balance between steady cash flow and fast asset turnover.
''Geographically, Hong Kong remains our focus. The Group is also positive about the long-term outlook for the mainland and will continue to expand its business there,'' it said.
A spokeswoman for CapitaLand declined to comment.
''Companies like these, and others in Asia, need to also recognize they are investing in potentially overheated markets in mainland China -- and elsewhere in Asia -- and diversifying some asset holdings in America would be something smart to do,'' Mr. Galaviz said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate For City Back Above 9%, New Data Say

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate rose back above 9 percent at the start of 2013, even though the city started the year with more jobs than it had ever had, according to reports released on Thursday. 
The reports, including a revised view of the job markets in the city and state in 2012, pared down some of the mystery of the city's stubbornly high unemployment rate. They also indicated that the city has been adding jobs at a faster pace than previously estimated.
With the final revisions for the year complete, the State Labor Department said that the private sector in the city added nearly 85,000 jobs in 2012. That brought the total number of jobs in the city to 3.94 million, the highest on record, said Barbara Byrne Denham, a private economist who analyzes the Labor Department figures each month.
''This suggests that employment could easily top four million in 2013,'' said Ms. Denham, of Eastern Consolidated, a real estate services firm in Manhattan.
The new calculations also chopped back the unemployment rates for 2012. During the year, the city's unemployment rate shot up to a high of 10 percent, even though a separate survey of employers indicated that they were steadily adding jobs.
The results of the monthly surveys of employers and city residents do not always line up neatly, but rarely do they produce as wide a discrepancy as they did last year. Their divergence confounded economists and irritated Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other elected officials as it persisted month after month.
Upon further review, the Labor Department has concluded that the city's unemployment rate rose no higher than 9.5 percent last year and fell back to 8.8 percent by the end of the year. The official statistics also show more city residents were employed than in previous reports, shrinking the discrepancy some more.
''These revisions certainly help straighten out the confusion that existed before,'' said James A. Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute.
That recovery still looks spotty, though. In January, the city's unemployment rate rose again, to a four-month high of 9.1 percent from 8.8 percent in December. That rise came despite a gain of about 19,000 jobs, after adjusting for the usual seasonal fluctuations in hiring and firing, Ms. Denham said.
The increase more than made up for the city's loss of more than 11,000 jobs after Hurricane Sandy struck in late October, Ms. Denham said.
James P. Brown, principal economist for the Labor Department, noted that the rise in the unemployment rate was caused by an increase in people looking for jobs, rather than a lot of job losses. It left the city's unemployment rate significantly higher than the national rate for January, which was 7.9 percent.
The statewide unemployment rate also rose in January, to 8.4 percent, from 8.2 percent in December.

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Puts More Sanctions On North Korea

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE and DAVID E. SANGER; Rick Gladstone reported from New York, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.

 BODY:
Ignoring threats of retaliation, the United Nations Security Council ordered new economic sanctions against North Korea on Thursday for its third nuclear test last month, unanimously approving a resolution that the United States negotiated with China, the North's greatest protector.
In an angry response, North Korea said Friday that it was nullifying all agreements of nonaggression and denuclearization with South Korea and was cutting off the North-South hot line. But beyond those steps, it was unclear how, if at all, North Korea's young and untested leader, Kim Jong-un, would react to the rebuke. His government has threatened to terminate the 60-year-old armistice that brought a halt to the Korean War and that has kept a cold peace on the peninsula since, and South Korean officials said they were on the alert for any possible attack by the North.
Any military action, or response, could end up involving the American forces that have remained in South Korea as it has turned from war-ravaged ruin into one of the most advanced industrialized powerhouses. 
The 15-to-0 Security Council vote places potentially painful new constraints on North Korean banking, trade and travel, pressures countries to search suspect North Korean cargo and includes new enforcement language absent from previous measures. But the provisions are in some ways less important than China's participation in writing them, suggesting that the country has lost patience with the neighbor it supported in the Korean War. While China's enforcement of sanctions on North Korea remains to be seen, it may now be more assertive.
''This is not about the words, it is about the music,'' said Christopher R. Hill, the former American diplomat who negotiated a deal with the North during the George W. Bush administration to dismantle its nuclear facilities -- an accord that quickly collapsed. China's co-sponsorship of the resolution ''suggests that after many years, the screws are beginning to turn,'' said Mr. Hill, now the dean of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver.
The United Nations vote came hours after North Korea, infuriated by the combination of the proposed resolution and annual joint military exercises by South Korea and the United States, threatened for the first time to carry out ''a pre-emptive nuclear strike'' on its enemies, of which the United States ranks first.
Military experts regarded that threat as bluster: While the North has conducted three underground nuclear tests, it is far from clear it knows how to deploy a nuclear weapon or make one small enough to fit atop a missile. But the threat still prompted the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, to respond that the United States was ''fully capable'' of defending itself.
Another nuclear test is possible, as is another ballistic missile launching or perhaps an armed provocation aimed at South Korea, where a new president, Park Geun-hye, the daughter of a former South Korean dictator who was known for taking a hard stand with the North, could be forced to respond. Some regarded the North's dire warnings as a signal that some military response was looming.
''The higher decibel of invective is a bit worrisome,'' said Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico and presidential candidate, who has traveled to North Korea eight times, most recently in January. ''It's the highest negative level I've ever seen, and it probably means that the hard-line elements, particularly the military and not the Foreign Ministry, are in control.''
On the other hand, Mr. Richardson said, ''China is part of a significant sanctions effort, and this may cool the North Koreans down, may temper their response.''
It is also possible that the new and isolated North Korean government may have misjudged the reaction to talk of a pre-emptive nuclear attack, wording rarely heard since the cold war ended. It could be another way in which the North is demanding talks with President Obama -- only last week Mr. Kim told Dennis Rodman, the visiting former basketball star, that he wanted Mr. Obama to call him. But it could also be a way of saying that North Korea now expected to be treated the way Pakistan is: as an established, if formally unrecognized, nuclear power.
''This is a tactic they have employed when they don't get their way, when the international community brings more sanctions to bear,'' said Suzanne DiMaggio, vice president of global policy programs at the Asia Society in New York. ''Whether that will happen this time is unclear, given the level of hostile rhetoric,'' she said. ''I'm not sure Pyongyang recognizes that fact.''
The United Nations vote and North Korea's threat come at a time when, internally, the Obama administration is debating the wisdom of its policy of essentially ignoring the North for the past four years, and responding to any provocations with new sanctions.
According to current and former administration officials, there is a growing discussion within the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon over whether Mr. Kim is using each new test of rockets and nuclear devices to solidify his position with the military, his most important single constituency. "Under that theory,'' one official who has dealt with North Korea often said recently, ''even a firefight with the South Koreans might help him, as long as it doesn't escalate into something that threatens the regime.''
In testimony on Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Glyn T. Davies, the administration's special representative for North Korea policy, argued that the best course was to continue with Mr. Obama's current policy of using tests and provocations to tighten sanctions, and try to starve development of the North's long-range missiles and its effort to design nuclear weapons small enough for those missiles.
Mr. Davies insisted that ''it is still the goal of U.S. policy to achieve a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons.''
Mr. Davies's prescription was challenged by Robert Joseph, who dealt with North Korea issues for the Bush administration, and left the State Department partly in protest over a North Korean deal approved by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. ''North Korea will only agree to abandon its missile and nuclear programs if it is judged essential for regime survival,'' he told the committee. The North, he said, considers these programs a deterrent against attack.
The new resolution instructs North Korea to cease all nuclear and missile testing and contains restrictions that will block financial transactions, impound cash, further empower countries to inspect suspicious North Korean cargo, and expand a blacklist of items that the North is prohibited from importing. The sanctions also place new constraints on North Korean diplomats, raising their risk of expulsion. But they do not allow countries to stop and inspect North Korean shipments on the high seas or force down aircraft suspected of moving contraband, acts that could set off a violent confrontation.
''The strength, breadth and severity of these sanctions will raise the cost to North Korea of its illicit nuclear program and further constrain its ability to finance and source materials and technology for its ballistic missile, conventional and nuclear weapons programs,'' the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, told reporters after the vote.
Li Baodong, the Chinese envoy, appeared to signal China's frustration with North Korea, which ignored its entreaties not to carry out the test last month. ''China is a country of principle,'' he told reporters. ''We are formally committed to safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.''
It remained unclear whether China would be willing to go beyond the scope of the sanctions, cutting off fuel shipments and commercial trade that have in the past helped to keep the impoverished country functioning.
Ms. Rice dismissed the North's threats saying, ''North Korea will achieve nothing by continued threats and provocations.''
In recent days, with the resolution set to pass, North Korea characterized the sanctions as part of an ''act of war'' in its escalating criticism of the United States and its allies. Earlier this week it declared the 1953 armistice null and void as of next Monday and threatened to turn Washington and Seoul into ''a sea in flames'' with ''lighter and smaller nukes.''

HEADLINE: The Market Speaks

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Four years ago, as a newly elected president began his efforts to rescue the economy and strengthen the social safety net, conservative economic pundits -- people who claimed to understand markets and know how to satisfy them -- warned of imminent financial disaster. Stocks, they declared, would plunge, while interest rates would soar.
Even a casual trawl through the headlines of the time turns up one dire pronouncement after another. ''Obama's radicalism is killing the Dow,'' warned an op-ed article by Michael Boskin, an economic adviser to both Presidents Bush. ''The disciplinarians of U.S. policy makers return,'' declared The Wall Street Journal, warning that the ''bond vigilantes'' would soon push Treasury yields to destructive heights. 
Sure enough, this week the Dow Jones industrial average has been hitting all-time highs, while the current yield on 10-year U.S. government bonds is roughly half what it was when The Journal published that screed.
O.K., everyone makes a bad prediction now and then. But these predictions have special significance, and not just because the people who made them have had such a remarkable track record of error these past several years.
No, the important point about these particular bad predictions is that they came from people who constantly invoke the potential wrath of the markets as a reason we must follow their policy advice. Don't try to cover America's uninsured, they told us; if you do, you will undermine business confidence and the stock market will tank. Don't try to reform Wall Street, or even criticize its abuses; you'll hurt the plutocrats' feelings, and that will lead to plunging markets. Don't try to fight unemployment with higher government spending; if you do, interest rates will skyrocket.
And, of course, do slash Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid right away, or the markets will punish you for your presumption.
By the way, I'm not just talking about the hard right; a fair number of self-proclaimed centrists play the same game. For example, two years ago, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson warned us to expect an attack of the bond vigilantes within, um, two years unless we adopted, you guessed it, Simpson-Bowles.
So what the bad predictions tell us is that we are, in effect, dealing with priests who demand human sacrifices to appease their angry gods -- but who actually have no insight whatsoever into what those gods actually want, and are simply projecting their own preferences onto the alleged mind of the market.
What, then, are the markets actually telling us?
I wish I could say that it's all good news, but it isn't. Those low interest rates are the sign of an economy that is nowhere near to a full recovery from the financial crisis of 2008, while the high level of stock prices shouldn't be cause for celebration; it is, in large part, a reflection of the growing disconnect between productivity and wages.
The interest-rate story is fairly simple. As some of us have been trying to explain for four years and more, the financial crisis and the bursting of the housing bubble created a situation in which almost all of the economy's major players are simultaneously trying to pay down debt by spending less than their income. Since my spending is your income and your spending is my income, this means a deeply depressed economy. It also means low interest rates, because another way to look at our situation is, to put it loosely, that right now everyone wants to save and nobody wants to invest. So we're awash in desired savings with no place to go, and those excess savings are driving down borrowing costs.
Under these conditions, of course, the government should ignore its short-run deficit and ramp up spending to support the economy. Unfortunately, policy makers have been intimidated by those false priests, who have convinced them that they must pursue austerity or face the wrath of the invisible market gods.
Meanwhile, about the stock market: Stocks are high, in part, because bond yields are so low, and investors have to put their money somewhere. It's also true, however, that while the economy remains deeply depressed, corporate profits have staged a strong recovery. And that's a bad thing! Not only are workers failing to share in the fruits of their own rising productivity, hundreds of billions of dollars are piling up in the treasuries of corporations that, facing weak consumer demand, see no reason to put those dollars to work.
So the message from the markets is by no means a happy one. What the markets are clearly saying, however, is that the fears and prejudices that have dominated Washington discussion for years are entirely misguided. And they're also telling us that the people who have been feeding those fears and peddling those prejudices don't have a clue about how the economy actually works.

HEADLINE: Democrat Says He Won't Run For Re-election To the Senate

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Carl Levin, a liberal fixture in the Senate and in Michigan, which he has served since 1979, said Thursday that he planned to retire, saying he would spend the next two years focusing on legislative business and not campaigning. 
''This decision was extremely difficult,'' he said in a statement, ''because I love representing the people of Michigan in the U.S. Senate and fighting for the things that I believe are important to them.''
Mr. Levin, a Democrat, is the state's longest-serving senator.
In speaking with his wife, Mr. Levin added, ''we decided that I can best serve my state and nation by concentrating in the next two years on the challenging issues before us that I am in a position to help address; in other words, by doing my job without the distraction of campaigning for re-election.''
Mr. Levin, 78, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is one of a growing list of senior Democrats who will not seek re-election in 2014, leaving Republicans more opportunities in their attempt to take back the Senate. Several other Democratic incumbents are defending their seats in tough states.
Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa, Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia have said they will not seek re-election. Two Republicans, Senators Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Mike Johanns of Nebraska, have also said they will not run.
While Michigan is fair game for both parties, Republicans have not fared well there recently. Mitt Romney lost the state last year in the presidential election, and Republican efforts to replace Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, failed badly in the same election.
''I am confident that we will recruit a great Democratic leader who will continue to fight for the values and priorities Senator Levin advocated for all these years,'' said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
Mr. Levin was instrumental in helping lift the ban on gays in the military, and was a sponsor of measures including a paycheck fairness act, an assault weapons ban and the Violence Against Women Act.
Mr. Levin said he would also spend much of his final term focused on ensuring the continued recovery of manufacturing in his state.
''I want to ensure that the manufacturing renaissance that has led Michigan's economic comeback continues,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Dow Hits 3rd New High, Helped by Jobless Report

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market rose slightly on Thursday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to a new nominal high after it surpassed its previous peak two days ago. The gains came after a new report provided evidence that hiring was picking up.
The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell by 7,000 last week, driving the four-week average to its lowest point in five years. The drop in new jobless claims is a positive sign ahead of Friday's employment report. 
The Dow industrials rose 33.25 points, or 0.2 percent, to 14,329.49. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.80 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,544.26. Both indexes rose for the fifth consecutive day.
The S.& P. 500 is closing in on its own high close of 1,565.15, which was reached on Oct. 9, 2007, the same day as the Dow's previous peak. The S.& P. 500 would need to rise 20.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to set a nominal record, though both indexes are still far below their peaks if inflation is taken into account.
Investors have been buying stocks on optimism that employers are slowly starting to hire again and that the housing market is recovering. Growing company earnings are also encouraging investors to enter the market. The Dow is 9.4 percent higher so far this year and the S.& P. 500 is up 8.3 percent.
''If you have a multiyear time horizon, equities are an attractive asset, but don't be surprised to see some volatility, especially after the big run we've had,'' said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at the RDM Financial Group.
The Nasdaq composite index advanced 9.72 points, or 0.3 percent, to 3,232.09. It is up 7 percent this year, but it is well below its high of more than 5,000, reached during the dot-com boom in 2000.
Boeing helped lead the Dow higher on Thursday, advancing $1.97, or 2.5 percent, to $81.05 after reports that American regulators were poised to approve a plan within days to permit the company to begin test flights of its 787 Dreamliner jet. The 787 fleet has been grounded since Jan. 16 because of safety concerns about the plane's batteries.
Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, predicted that any sell-off in stocks might be short-lived as investors who have missed out on the rally since the start of the year jump into the market.
''The rally is going to go higher than most people think,'' Mr. Saut said. ''This thing has caught most money managers flat-footed.''
The stock market's rally this year has been helped in no small part by continuing economic stimulus from the Federal Reserve, which is buying $85 billion each month in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. That has kept interest rates near historical lows, reducing borrowing costs and encouraging investors to move money out of conservative investments like bonds and into stocks.
On Thursday, however, interest rates moved higher in the bond market. The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 16/32, to 100 2/32, while its yield rose to 2 percent from 1.94 percent late on Wednesday.
Among the stocks making big moves, PetSmart fell $4.37, or 6.6 percent, to $62.18 after the company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Profits for the pet store chain rose, but its forecast for this year disappointed investors.
Pier 1 Imports fell 96 cents to $22.28 after the company issued an earnings forecast that was below Wall Street analysts' estimates.
The supermarket chain Kroger rose 89 cents, or 3 percent, to $30.25 after the company's fourth-quarter profit handily beat Wall Street expectations.
Gap rose $1.41, or 4.1 percent, to $35.87 after it said a crucial revenue measure rose more than expected in February, helped by sales at its Gap and Old Navy stores.

HEADLINE: Insurer's Maneuver Wins a Pass In Court

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Some people are inherently more deserving of sympathy than others.
Imagine, for a moment, what a court might say if state regulators allowed an insurance company, facing huge losses because of Hurricane Sandy, to separate itself into two companies. One, thinly capitalized and in clear danger of not being able to pay all claims, would insure the areas hit by the hurricane, like the beach towns of New Jersey and the Rockaway area of Queens. The other, with plenty of capital, would carry all the policies that were not likely to have large claims.
Of course, no regulator would do that. And any court confronted with such an act would search for reasons to overturn it.
Now imagine an insurance company split up with the clear purpose of discriminating against a set of policyholders who were the subject of overwhelming public scorn rather than public sympathy -- perhaps the people who had caused the catastrophe that led to the losses. 
Just such a case was decided this week. And the state regulator's decision was upheld by a judge who concluded that the regulator was entitled to the widest possible latitude in making its decisions. If the regulator had not bothered to verify calculations in the insurance company's financial projections, and those calculations turned out to be wildly inaccurate, that was fine with the judge.
That case did not concern a hurricane, of course. It instead concerned the financial storm that sent the world into recession and led countries to bail out the banks that had made bad loans that led to the disaster.
The insurance company was MBIA, a company that prospered insuring municipal bonds, almost all of which were safe anyway. It then made the huge mistake of deciding to also insure structured financial products, like collateralized debt obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities. It did little investigation of what actually backed those securities, explaining later that its low fees made such investigations too expensive. Instead it relied on the ratings agencies and on the banks that had put the securities together.
That reliance was misplaced, and MBIA is now in danger of being unable to pay claims on those securities.
In 2009, with the blessing of its regulator, the New York State Insurance Department, MBIA decided to split in two. On one side, fully protected, were the insurance policies issued to muni bond investors in the United States. On the other side were the structured finance policies, which would mostly benefit the banks that had bought such products. A group of banks sued to overturn the breakup.
Justice Barbara R. Kapnick of the New York State Supreme Court -- a trial court despite the lofty title -- listened to lawyers argue for 13 days over whether the case should proceed to trial. She decided there was no reason for a trial. The insurance department had wide latitude to approve the split with or without much investigation, and she would not second-guess it.
Anyone from the Securities and Exchange Commission who might read Justice Kapnick's opinion will be envious. The S.E.C. has to contend with a court -- the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit -- that instinctively throws up roadblocks to any rule the commission passes. The S.E.C. jumps through whatever hoops the court established in its last decision but, somehow, it never quite manages to live up to what the D.C. circuit requires in its next ruling.
Justice Kapnick, on the other hand, is not bothered by the fact that the state insurance department relied on MBIA financial filings that turned out to be very inaccurate -- not just later but at the time that the filings were made.
The banks, she said, ''fail to provide any legal authority to support their argument that this court can annul the department's decision based on claims that MBIA concealed or withheld potentially damaging information'' from the department.
She quotes from a deposition by Michael Moriarty, the deputy superintendent of the department and the man who signed the letter approving the split. When considering MBIA's request, he said, ''the department did not, nor do they usually, verify the financial condition of a company.'' Since that was the policy, the judge concluded she had no authority to question it.
The New York Insurance Department has since been combined with the state banking regulator in a new body, called the Department of Financial Services, and that body seems to be very worried about MBIA's ability to meet its obligations in the structured finance unit.
An interest payment that MBIA owed on a junior security it had sold to investors was not paid in January, because the department would not allow it.
MBIA's structured finance arm has been able to make large payments to policyholders only by borrowing $1.6 billion from its municipal insurance unit, but the regulator is now refusing to approve more loans. That meant that MBIA could not complete an arrangement it made with an unnamed bank. That would have allowed the insurer to settle all future claims that bank might have for an upfront payment. For the bank, as for others that reached similar deals earlier that were approved, the lure was the promise of getting something before the unit went broke.
In its annual report filed last week, MBIA said that the regulator might commence a ''rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding.'' Jay Brown, MBIA's chief executive, told investors in a conference call that he did not think such a move was probable, but he said it largely depended on the company's ability to cut a deal with Bank of America.
That relationship is more than a little complicated. MBIA claims that Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America acquired in what may be the worst merger ever, owes it as much as $5 billion for deceiving it about structured finance products it was insuring. But Bank of America, largely through its Merrill Lynch unit, also is a major holder of MBIA insurance policies, and MBIA expects that claims will arrive soon from the bank, which is a principal plaintiff in the case Justice Kapnick ruled on.
If MBIA gets such a global settlement with the bank, it should send a letter of gratitude to Kenneth D. Lewis, the former Bank of America chief executive and the man who decided to rescue Countrywide. Had that firm been allowed to fail, MBIA would have had no hope of collecting from it, but it still would have owed the insurance payments to Merrill Lynch. It is hard to see how MBIA could have avoided collapsing.
In announcing the insurance department approval of the split in 2009, Eric Dinallo, then superintendent, stated, ''This deal is fair to all policyholders -- the bank counterparties and other policyholders of the structured financings and the owners and issuers of municipal bonds.'' He said it was aimed at assuring that muni bond insurance would continue to be available.
The news release added, ''Consistent with New York State insurance law, the New York State Insurance Department only approved the transaction after deciding that both companies would have sufficient statutory capital to meet the letter and spirit of the insurance law.''
It turns out that was wrong. The structured finance unit would have no capital on its books now if it did not assume that Bank of America will pay billions to it.
Wall Street seems to think that MBIA's strategy will work, and that the muni bond business will keep operating even if the structured finance part goes into liquidation. The stock leapt to its highest level in a year on news of the court ruling.
The lawyer for the banks says an appeal of Justice Kapnick's ruling will be filed, but it is at least conceivable that there will be a settlement before any appeal is decided, leaving her opinion as the final one on the case. And next time, if some other insurance company fails to be completely forthcoming when getting approval for a transaction that turns out to be disastrous for some other group of policyholders, there will be a precedent saying such conduct is just fine.

HEADLINE: Weather And Taxes Hurt Sales In February

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Americans cut back on spending in February as cold weather and economic strain chilled their appetite for spring merchandise, retailers reported on Thursday.
The nation's retailers said sales slowed in February, when most stores get rid of winter merchandise and bring in swimsuits, ankle-length pants and other spring fashions. Americans are dealing with a payroll-tax increase of two percentage points, income tax refunds that came later than usual and high gas prices. Widespread winter storms may also have made spring merchandise less appealing to them. 
''February was a difficult month,'' said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, a research firm. ''Retailers faced significant headwinds.''
The numbers reflect a drop in sales growth from January. Over all, 14 retailers reported that revenue at stores open at least a year -- an indicator of retail health -- rose an average of 4.1 percent, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, an industry trade group. That compares with increases of 5.1 percent in January and 6.7 percent last February.
But the latest results were affected by a drop in the number of stores reporting monthly sales, including the loss of big names like Target and Macy's.
With the shrinking list, Costco, which posted a 6 percent gain in February, now accounts for about two-thirds of the tally. The retailers that report monthly data represent only about 6 percent of the $2.4 trillion in annual United States retail industry sales.
Among the companies that reported monthly results, the ones that cater to poor and middle-class shoppers said that Americans were still grappling with economic challenges. Many retailers resorted to steep discounts to attract shoppers.
''February sales reflect the continuing difficult economic environment,'' said John Cato, chief executive of Cato, a women's clothing chain. ''We did see some beneficial impact from the delay in tax refunds from January.''
Limited Brands Inc., which operates Victoria's Secret and has been on a winning streak, said that it had to discount more heavily than usual to bring in shoppers in February. Still, it reported a 3 percent increase in revenue, above the 2.6 percent rise analysts had expected.
Gap Inc., which started to gain momentum early last year, had a mixed performance. The retailer, which operates Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores, posted a 3 percent increase, higher than the 2 percent gain analysts had projected. Revenue rose 2 percent at Gap and 6 percent at Old Navy, but sales at Banana Republic stores open at least a year fell 5 percent.

Previews and Openings
'Breakfast at Tiffany's' (in previews; opens on March 20) No, you will not get to hear ''Moon River.'' And more important, no, this is not the infamous 1966 musical version that counted Edward Albee and Mary Tyler Moore among the casualties. This latest incarnation of the beloved film, itself based on a Truman Capote novella, features a script by Richard Greenberg (''Take Me Out'') and the ''Game of Thrones'' star Emilia Clarke as the gold-digging gamine Holly Golightly. Featuring Cory Michael Smith (''The Whale'') as Fred and George Wendt (''Cheers'') as Joe Bell. Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Eric Grode) 
'Cirque du Soleil: Totem' (opens on Thursday) Entertainment value has been on fairly short supply of late at Citi Field, the newish home of the Mets. Leave it to Cirque du Soleil to remedy that, as the troupe brings its 11th show to New York City by setting up its tent in the stadium's parking lot. This one has taken evolution as a (loose) theme, but the real draw remains the 52 supremely talented acrobats, daredevils, clowns, etc. Directed by Robert Lepage, whose bruising experience with the Metropolitan Opera's new ''Ring'' cycle presumably taught him a few things about circuses. Lot C, Citi Field, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, cirquedusoleil.com/totem. (Grode)
'Detroit '67' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) The Public Theater's smaller-scale Public Lab series has teamed up with the always intriguing Classical Theater of Harlem to present this world premiere by Dominique Morisseau. Motown released more than 100 singles in 1967 -- and just about every one made the charts -- but reality would soon interrupt in the form of one of the worst riots in American history. Ms. Morisseau's play contains both of these threads and much more. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Grode)
'Easter' (previews start on Friday; opens on Thursday) A curious company sprouted to life in 2012, dedicated to using all-black casts to perform the works of August Strindberg. The August Strindberg Repertory Theater got off to a decent start with ''Playing With Fire,'' and now it returns with this 1901 drama, a prequel of sorts to that initial offering. The action has been updated to 1958 Harlem. Gene Frankel Theater, 24 Bond Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Grode)
'The Flick' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Underpaid young workers in small-town New England certainly paid off for Annie Baker and her frequent director, Sam Gold, in 2010 with their critical smash ''The Aliens.'' Now the formidable duo, who also collaborated on ''Circle Mirror Transformation'' and Ms. Baker's ''Uncle Vanya'' translation, have turned their attention to three undermotivated employees of a rundown Massachusetts movie theater. The news release promises ''tiny battles and not-so-tiny heartbreaks.'' The track record promises a good bit more than that. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Hands on a Hardbody' (in previews; opens on March 21) Despite a megaplex's worth of movies making their way to Broadway as musicals, one genre that rarely makes the jump is documentaries. ''Grey Gardens'' was a rare example, and that musical's book writer, Doug Wright, is handling the same task on this project, based on a 1997 film about (ready for this?) an endurance competition to see who can keep his or her hand on a pickup truck the longest. The music was composed by Amanda Green (''Bring It On'') and a curious newcomer to Broadway: Trey Anastasio of the jam band Phish. The cast includes Keith Carradine, Hunter Foster, Allison Case and Keala Settle. Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Grode)
'Happy Birthday' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 21) Did you know that Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II wrote a song for none other than Helen Hayes? It was for this 1947 Anita Loos play, about a meek librarian who decides to live it up one night in a Newark cocktail lounge. Here's your chance to see the piece that won Hayes the first Tony Award for best actress in a play. This new production, courtesy of the enterprising Actors Company Theater, features the Tony Award-winning actress Karen Ziemba. Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Hit the Wall' (in previews; opens on Sunday) The West Village is rich with cultural milestones, and one of the biggest came on June 28, 1969. That's when a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, exploded into a riot that would serve as a catalyst for the gay rights movement. Ike Holter's new play, which made its debut last year as part of Steppenwolf's Garage Rep series, blends history and mythology as it puts audiences on the periphery of that epochal conflict. Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Grode)
'Honky' (previews start on Friday; opens on Thursday) ''If you think you don't need it, you're probably a racist.'' How's that for a new pharmaceutical ad slogan? Welcome to the playwright Greg Kalleres's world, one built on the (not so terribly improbable, sadly) scenario of sneakers tripling in value among white teenagers after the shoes become an impetus for violence in an African-American neighborhood. That's where the anti-racism pill comes into play. It should be mentioned that this is a comedy. Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, urbanstages.org. (Grode)
'The (*) Inn, *Empty, Vacant, Abandoned; Usually Translated as ''Haunted'' ' (in previews; opens on Monday) When Target Margin Theater dives into a topic, it doesn't bother with the shallow end. Its two-year exploration of Yiddish theater continues with this curiosity by Peretz Hirschbein (1880-1948), who founded a theater company in Odessa but also found time to do some farming in Argentina and the Catskills. Look for chicken plucking, an arranged marriage, S&M lust, body-snatching wedding guests and David Greenspan. Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, abronsartscenter.org. (Grode)
'Kinky Boots' (in previews; opens on April 4) Cyndi Lauper has been a fixture in the New York theater community for so long that it's hard to believe that she's never written for Broadway. (She has performed there, in the 2006 revival of ''The Threepenny Opera.'') Here she collaborates with two men who have more than two dozen Broadway credits between them, the book writer Harvey Fierstein and the director-choreographer Jerry Mitchell. Here they take on the feel-good 2005 film about a drag queen (played onstage by Billy Porter) who takes on the task of saving a failing shoe factory. Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'The Last Five Years' (in previews; opens on April 2) This two-character 2002 musical by Jason Robert Brown has become a juggernaut in terms of regional productions (more than 500) and audition songs (seemingly limitless). It also went a long way toward cementing the careers of its original New York stars, Norbert Leo Butz and Sherie Rene Scott, so theater buffs may be curious to see what the new cast -- Adam Kantor (''Rent'') and Betsy Wolfe (''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'') -- will do with this show, which uses a curious narrative structure to chart a disintegrating marriage. Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Grode)
'The Little Flower' (opens on Monday) In case the recent Encores! staging of ''Fiorello!'' didn't drum up interest in the former three-time mayor Fiorello La Guardia, this one-man show -- which Tony Lo Bianco has been performing off and on for more than a quarter century -- brings Hizzoner back to his old stamping ground. The playwright, Paul Shyre, died in 1989, but Mr. Lo Bianco has been developing the piece ever since, showing a perseverance that La Guardia may have recognized. Dicapo Opera Theater, St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Grode)
'Lucky Guy' (in previews; opens on April 1) In New York City in the mid-1980s, the sight of Mike McAlary, the squinty-eyed, thick-mustached Irishman, looking out from a newsstand was a sign that he had unearthed yet another scandalous tidbit from the police beat. Nora Ephron, who worked at The New York Post before McAlary did, was there to see it all; so was George C. Wolfe, then just beginning his ascent in the New York theater world. Ephron finished this sprawling play about the muckraking columnist before she died last year, leaving it in the hands of Mr. Wolfe, who directs, and a cast led by Tom Hanks (making his Broadway debut). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'The Lying Lesson' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Craig Lucas likes to play with shifting identities, as he did via the chat-room shenanigans in ''The Dying Gaul'' and the body swapping of ''Prelude to a Kiss.'' Here the playwright looks at one of the more fixed personas in Hollywood history: Bette Davis (played by Carol Kane). Her seemingly clueless young assistant is quickly embroiled in a series of cat-and-mouse games -- a form of theatrical combat in which the director, Pam MacKinnon (''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''), has become an expert. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'Matilda the Musical' (in previews; opens on April 11) This musical take on Roald Dahl's beloved 1988 children's novel features four young actresses each having a go at Matilda, the telekinetic little girl with beastly parents and an even worse headmistress, Miss Trunchbull (Bertie Carvel, in his Broadway debut, repeating his best actor Olivier Award-winning London performance). A draw for the parents may be Tim Minchin, an Australian musician and comedian who wrote the music and lyrics. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Motown: the Musical' (previews start on Monday; opens on April 14) He has been a boxer, a record store owner and perhaps the greatest hit-making producer of all time, so why shouldn't Berry Gordy add ''Broadway book writer'' to his résumé? He has a decent safety net in the form of the peerless Motown song catalog, which includes several tunes he had a part in writing. Expect to see and hear Smokey, Diana, Marvin and many, many, many others, all directed by Charles Randolph-Wright and supported by a relatively luxurious 18-piece orchestra. Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Grode)
'The Mound Builders' (in previews; opens on March 17) A highlight of the Signature Theater's longstanding relationship with Lanford Wilson was the 2003 revival of ''Fifth of July.'' That was directed by Jo Bonney, who returns a decade later to stage Wilson's 1975 drama about a vexed archaeological dig in the Midwest. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'Neva' (in previews; opens on Monday) One advantage of having the Public Theater host the annual Under the Radar Festival is seeing some of those global artists find subsequent employment at the Public. Such is the case with the Chilean provocateur Guillermo Calderón, whose beguiling ''Diciembre'' turned heads at the 2011 festival. He's back with the English-language premiere of ''Neva,'' which depicts Olga Knipper, Chekhov's widow, preparing to rehearse ''The Cherry Orchard'' in 1905 amid violent unrest on the streets. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Grode)
'Saga' (in previews; opens on Saturday) What would a 3-inch puppet and a 10-foot puppet, along with more than two dozen others, find to talk about? The Icelandic financial crisis, of course. The downtown troupe Wakka Wakka Productions has earned a reputation for employing baroque visual means to tell vibrant, moving stories, and this modern-day Icelandic tale by Kirjan Waage and Gwendolyn Warnock appears to be no exception. Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (866) 811-4111, wakkawakka.org. (Grode)
'Shaheed: the Dream and Death of Benazir Bhutto' (previews start on Friday; opens on Monday) Transfers from the New York International Fringe Festival tend to be brash and more than a little campy. This monodrama by Anna Khaja, which earned strong notices at the 2010 festival, is totally different: a collection of eight monologues that all take place in the final minutes of the life of Benazir Bhutto, the former Pakistani prime minister who was assassinated in 2007. Among the characters Ms. Khaja plays are former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Bhutto herself. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org. (Grode)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' (in previews; opens on Thursday) The longtime Christopher Durang collaborators Sigourney Weaver, Kristine Nielsen and David Hyde Pierce have taken Mr. Durang's modern-day, curiously chipper riffs on Chekhov (complete with Maggie Smith impersonations, Snow White costumes and anti-technology screeds) to Broadway. John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' A four-alarm urgency infuses Scarlett Johansson's performance in Rob Ashford's oxygen-starved revival of Tennessee Williams's 1955 drama of sex and lies. If Ms. Johansson is oddly un-feline as Maggie the Cat, she sure has presence. The rest of the cast, including Benjamin Walker and Ciaran Hinds, gets lost in the heavy atmospherics (2:40). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
&#x2605; 'All in the Timing' One of the zestier plates of theatrical tapas to be had. This 20th-anniversary production of David Ives's popular anthology of mini-plays, directed by John Rando, leaves you feeling lighter, but not emptier. There's nutrition in these sketches about (gulp!) relativity and randomness, and surprising substance in their silliness.

&#x2605; 'Belleville' Amy Herzog's sensationally good new drama is both a nail-biting psychological thriller and a keenly observed -- and ultimately heart-rending -- portrait of a young couple (the terrific Maria Dizzia and Greg Keller) whose marriage suddenly begins to unravel under the pressure of secrets and lies. Anne Kauffman directs the flawless production (1:35). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale of Musical Mystery' Charles Busch livens up this fun adaptation of the kid's novel about a family enduring some turmoil after adopting a rabbit that may be a vampire (1:05). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, dr2theatre.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'The Dance and the Railroad' The Signature Theater Company's David Henry Hwang season continues with this modest, somewhat soporific two-hander about two Chinese immigrants (Yuekun Wu and Ruy Iskandar) laboring on the transcontinental railroad in 1867 (1:10). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Donnybrook!' This revival of Johnny Burke and Robert E. McEnroe's 1961 musical (itself an adaptation of ''The Quiet Man,'' the 1952 St. Patrick's Day perennial about an Irish-American boxer's fraught courtship of a redheaded spitfire), jettisons the most dated, disturbing and indulgent elements of the movie but retains the essential sentimental blarney. With a fine cast and crisp direction by Charlotte Moore, the result is as fresh as a morning after rain in the west of Ireland (2:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (David Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
'Fuenteovejuna' Sometimes, when your boss starts raping and pillaging in the office, the grunts just have to beat him to death with a calculator. If that premise is confusing, so is the rest of a new adaptation of this 17th-century classic play, about a gallant Spanish town that rose up and killed its tyrannical overlord but refused to implicate anyone in his death. The production retains its original Spanish (with English captions) but has been poorly grafted onto a modern-day office setting (1:20). In Spanish with English subtitles. Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9999, repertorio.org. (Catherine Rampell)
'Hamlet' The Bedlam company presents a four-person, stripped-down production that is modest and sensitive to the sound of the poetry of the play (3:30). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, theatrebedlam.org. (Zinoman)
'Katie Roche' The Mint Theater Company's commitment to re-examine the works of the Irish playwright Teresa Deevy reaches its third year, and third play, with this production, in which Wrenn Schmidt stars as a young woman who marries a staid older man and then must come to grips with that decision. It's not as compelling as the two earlier productions, though it's an interesting addition to the overall picture (1:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Last Man Club' Randy Sharp's atmospheric, expertly structured one-act drama does almost too good a job of making the audience feel as if it is living through the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. This production, about people who stay behind in their devastated hometowns and the men who try to fool them, can be hypnotic; that's a compliment and a problem (1:25). Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, off Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 352-2101, axiscompany.org. (Gates)
'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by José Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novel is pleasing but lightweight. A production cannot live on romance alone. In Spanish with subtitles (2:00). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 889-2850, repertorio.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
'The Madrid' Edie Falco, whose face usually seems like an open window, pulls down the blinds in Liz Flahive's muted, murky play about a runaway kindergarten teacher, directed by Leigh Silverman. Ms. Flahive has a poet's hand for echoing imagery. But this production often feels paralyzed in its contemplation of the mystery of everyday lives (2:10). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Brantley)
'Much Ado About Nothing' The splendid Jonathan Cake is an exuberant, witty Benedick opposite Maggie Siff's Beatrice in an otherwise mostly zest-free production of Shakespeare's romantic comedy, directed by Arin Arbus for Theater for a New Audience (2:40).

'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'Old Hats' Bill Irwin and David Shiner, the peerless neo-vaudevillian jesters behind the long-running hit ''Fool Moon,'' have concocted a winning new compendium of nifty clown routines. The pixie-ish singer-songwriter Nellie McKay makes for a perfect musical foil in this ebullient, thoroughly charming variety show (1:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Passion' Staged by John Doyle, a minimalist with a scalpel, this hypnotic revival of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's musical study of love beyond reason comes across as a pulsing collective fever dream, while reminding us that startling clarity can come from such dreams. Ryan Silverman, Judy Kuhn and Melissa Errico expertly embody the show's compelling central triangle (1:45). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Brantley)
'Really Really' The young playwright Paul Downs Colaizzo shows an assured appreciation of the addictive power of ambiguity in this merciless state-of-a-generation play, set on a college campus. Yet because of its blanket bleakness, nothing in it surprises us. Zosia Mamet is excellent as an upwardly mobile college student who becomes both victim and predator. The talented David Cromer directs (2:10). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Revisionist' As a Polish Holocaust survivor in Jesse Eisenberg's somewhat implausible new play, Vanessa Redgrave reminds us why she's considered the greatest actress of her generation. She inhabits her character with precision and authority, making us feel like humble, privileged trespassers in an exotic world. Mr. Eisenberg almost holds his own portraying her graceless young American cousin (1:45). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Saint Joan' With just four actors playing 24 characters, Bedlam's wonderfully high-spirited production of Shaw's 1920 semi-tragedy leads its audience into, out of and all over the space. Eric Taylor's inventive direction and the four superb performers make it well worth the schlep. Running in repertory with the Bedlam company's ''Hamlet'' (3:00).

&#x2605; 'Talley's Folly' Danny Burstein and Sarah Paulson give performances of translucent feeling in this loving Roundabout Theater Company revival of Lanford Wilson's 1979 romantic pas de deux about two misfits in 1944 Missouri trying to find a mutual rhythm.

(Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'The Wild Bride' The latest dance-theater work from the British director Emma Rice (''Brief Encounter''), based on a folktale about a young woman whose hands are chopped off (by her father, no less), is enlivened by fresh, funny performances (Andrew Durand's impish Devil in particular) and a wonderful bluegrass-based original score (2:00).

'Women of Will' Mixing casually delivered scholarly exposition with intensely rendered performance, this impassioned exploration of Shakespeare's heroines by Tina Packer traces their evolution through their language. When Ms. Packer and her co-star, Nigel Gore, get down to the business of acting, it's not just poetry in motion, it's thought made flesh. Eric Tucker directs (2:30).

Off Off Broadway
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Wednesdays only. Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended.

'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rampell)

Last Chance
&#x2605; 'As You Like It' (closes on Sunday) This comedy about Rosalind, Orlando (the boy she likes) and her best friend in the Forest of Arden is excellent introductory, PG-13 Shakespeare. And for younger audiences (12 and up), this sweet, sophisticated production has just the right combination of elements, including silliness, action, sports, music, adolescent anxiety, gender issues and some actors in big, cute animal heads. Wild about the boar (1:30). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org. (Gates)
'Clive' (closes on Saturday) Jonathan Marc Sherman's adaptation of ''Baal,'' an early Brecht play about a poète maudit, has the potential to electrify. But the current that flows through this version, directed by and starring Ethan Hawke, is oddly sluggish. Brecht's tale of a degenerate society assumes the air of a wearily confirmed prophecy. Vincent D'Onofrio, a great wild-card actor, provides some electricity (1:45). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'From White Plains' (closes on Saturday) Tracing the ramifications of homophobic bullying, Michael Perlman's tightly devised, terrifically acted play delves into thorny emotional and psychological issues.

'Isaac's Eye' (closes on Sunday) A young Isaac Newton, played by Haskell King, stirs it up with a senior physicist, Robert Hooke (Michael Louis Serafin-Wells), in Lucas Hnath's quirky take on scientific history and male rivalry. The figures may be ye olde, but the language is strictly contemporary and stylized (2:10). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Jesus in India' (closes on Sunday) Lloyd Suh's playful but thin coming-of-age tale features a teenage Jesus who's a runaway and a stoner. In India, he joins a band. Mr. Suh's jokey irreverence gets old after a while, mostly because Jesus never seems like Jesus -- he's just another teenage rebel. Like its hero, this play, a Ma-Yi Theater Company production, still seems to be searching for meaning (1:35).

'Luck of the Irish' (closes on Sunday) Kirsten Greenidge's play, about race, class and real estate, is set in the 1950s and the 2000s.

&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' (closes on Sunday) A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35).

HEADLINE: Bailout Official Is Leaving Post At the Treasury

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
After more than two years of long train rides and selling off more than $120 billion in assets, the chief investment officer of the Treasury Department's bailout program is stepping down. 
The official, Matt Pendo, will serve his last day on Friday. He will be succeeded by Charmian Uy, who joined the department last summer from Sunoco, where she was treasurer.
Leaving Treasury will mean the end of commuting to Washington from Connecticut, where Mr. Pendo's wife and four children remained. Mr. Pendo, 49, took the 5:30 a.m. train from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan every Monday, returning late in the week.
''The body and family can take only so much of that,'' he said in an interview. He has no immediate plans, other than spending time with his family.
During his two-year tenure as chief investment officer, Mr. Pendo oversaw a substantial unwinding of financial lifelines given during the financial crisis, notably the complete sell-off of the Treasury's holdings in the insurance giant American International Group.
''Matt is an exceptionally talented individual and served the taxpayers extraordinarily well,'' Timothy G. Massad, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement.
A former investment banker who spent 25 years at Merrill Lynch and then Barclays, Mr. Pendo began working at Treasury in November of 2010, serving as deputy to his predecessor, David N. Miller. He was immediately thrust into the work of getting the government out of the many investments it had acquired in various rescue programs.
During his time as chief investment officer, Mr. Pendo oversaw the sale of the federal government's 92 percent stake in A.I.G. over 19 months. The process yielded a profit of $22.7 billion to taxpayers.
Mr. Pendo also helped navigate Treasury's exit from its investment in Chrysler, as well as setting up a way for the government to auction off its preferred stock holdings in the nation's banks. Several of those exits yielded more than $1 billion in profit.
The government has begun to sell its shares in General Motors, and will completely unwind its stake by early next year. That will most likely generate a billion-dollar loss to taxpayers.
But Mr. Pendo said that he remained proud of his team's work. ''We had to figure out a balance between the speed of an exit and the return to taxpayers,'' he said. ''We tried to do the right thing.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Fracking Increases, So Do Fears About Water Supply

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
CARRIZO SPRINGS, Tex. -- In this South Texas stretch of mesquite trees and cactus, where the land is sometimes too dry to grow crops, the local aquifer is being strained in the search for oil. The reason is hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a drilling process that requires massive amounts of water.
''We just can't sustain it,'' Hugh Fitzsimons, a Dimmit County bison rancher who serves on the board of his local groundwater district, said last month as he drove his pickup down a dusty road.
From 2009 to 2012, water production from one well on his ranch fell by two-thirds, a problem Mr. Fitzsimons linked to nearby wells pumping water for fracking operations. A study commissioned by his groundwater district found that in a five-county area that includes Dimmit, fracking reduces the amount of water in the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer by the equivalent of one-third of the aquifer's recharge. Recharge means the amount of water an aquifer regains from precipitation and other factors. 
The amount of water used in hydraulic fracturing -- roughly 4 million to 6 million gallons per oil or gas well -- has stirred concerns around Texas as the drought wears on and the drilling boom continues.
Studies say that fracking consumes less than 1 percent of the total water used statewide, far less than agriculture or even watering lawns. But in some drilling hotbeds like Dimmit County, the proportion of water used for fracking has reached the double digits and is growing along with the oil boom. Companies are springing up to offer recycling, and some drillers are able to use brackish water, but those technologies are often not cost-effective.
Oil and gas companies are ''in the spotlight right now,'' said Representative James L. Keffer, Republican of Eastland, the chairman of the Texas House Energy Resources Committee. Because drillers have increased their water use only recently, he said, ''they have to prove themselves a little harder than others at this point in time.''
Two state legislative committees, including Mr. Keffer's, convened a hearing last month on fracking and water use. Industry representatives testified about emerging water-saving technologies like recycling.
In 2011, only about one-fifth of the water used in fracking came from recycled or brackish water, according to a recent study prepared by the University of Texas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology and financed by the Texas Oil and Gas Association. (The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)
The industry is ''absolutely not doing enough'' to reduce water use, said Luke Metzger, the director of the group Environment Texas.
In a typical fracking job, water blended with lesser volumes of sand and chemicals is pumped down a well to release oil or gas trapped in the pores of hard rock. The use of chemicals has stirred fears of spills and contamination, especially because companies keep some of the chemicals secret.
Increasingly, the spotlight is also on water supply problems. Some of the most oil-rich parts of Texas, including the Eagle Ford Shale and the Permian Basin, are also some of the state's driest areas. Carrizo Springs, in the heart of the fast-developing Eagle Ford, averages 21 inches of rainfall a year.
In 2011, Texas used a greater number of barrels of water for oil and natural gas fracking (about 632 million) than the number of barrels of oil it produced (about 441 million), according to figures from the Texas Water Development Board and the Railroad Commission of Texas, the state's oil and gas regulator.
The U.T. study, published in January, found that the amount of water used statewide for fracking more than doubled between 2008 and 2011. The amount is expected to increase before leveling off in the 2020s.
The study's lead author, Jean-Philippe Nicot of the University of Texas, has calculated that in 2011, nearly a quarter of the water used in Dimmit County went toward fracking. He projects that the figure will rise to about a third in a few years.
Often landowners sell groundwater to frackers. Water for fracking may sell for 35 to 50 cents a barrel, according to the Texas Water Recycling Association, a new nonprofit advocating for the water recycling industry.
Because of ambiguities in state law, local groundwater authorities differ in whether they require companies to get permits for water wells drilled to supply frackers. Legislation filed this session, Senate Bill 873, would fix the ambiguities and most likely result in increased requirements for permits.
The water demands of hydraulic fracturing contribute to another problem in oil country: wear and tear on roads. Each fracking job may need hundreds of trips by trucks bringing water to the site. The trucks also carry water away from the site. That is because roughly a quarter of the water used in fracking comes back up along with the oil or gas.
Additional water, found underground near the oil, also comes up. That ''produced water'' must also be hauled away.
The chemical and mineral-laced water left over after a fracking job normally goes to a disposal well, where it is injected thousands of feet into the earth. But disposal wells are controversial because people living near them often object to the truck traffic and fear that the wells could contaminate the water supply.
The Railroad Commission appears likely to tighten its rules on disposal well construction.
More companies are experimenting with the use of brackish water, an abundant underground resource in Texas. The water contains more salts than fresh water does. It may also contain other elements like boron, which can harm the drilling process, and the reservoirs may be deeper and more expensive to tap.
In testimony last month, Stephen Jester, an engineer with ConocoPhillips, told lawmakers that drilling a deep well in the Eagle Ford Shale region could cost $1 million, versus perhaps $70,000 or $80,000 for a shallower well.
A few companies have branched into water-free fracking. Gasfrac, a Canadian company that uses propane rather than water in fracking, drilled a well last month on a Dimmit County property adjacent to Mr. Fitzsimons' land.
Another alternative that has drawn increasing interest is recycling. One initiative involves recycling city sewage water for use in oil fields. Alpha Reclaim Technology, a year-old company based in Bryan, is buying treated effluent from Karnes City and other municipalities in the Eagle Ford Shale. Last week Alpha Reclaim Technology made its first effluent sale to an oil fracker, said Jeremy Osborne, its general counsel.
Other companies are creating mobile recycling units to clean water that comes from oil and gas wells and reuse it for fracking. The Railroad Commission is working on rules aimed at making it easier for companies to do this type of recycling. The commission is expected to take a final vote on the changes this month.
Some have big dreams for technology.
''Sometime in the future, the oil and gas industry could even be a net producer of water rather than a net user,'' David Porter, a commissioner, said in an interview in January.

HEADLINE: After Chávez, a Chance to Rethink Relations With Cuba

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. WHITE. 
Robert E. White, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, was the United States ambassador to Paraguay from 1977 to 1979 and to El Salvador from 1980 to 1981.

 BODY:
ALEXANDRIA, Va.
FOR most of our history, the United States assumed that its security was inextricably linked to a partnership with Latin America. This legacy dates from the Monroe Doctrine, articulated in 1823, through the Rio pact, the postwar treaty that pledged the United States to come to the defense of its allies in Central and South America.
Yet for a half-century, our policies toward our southern neighbors have alternated between intervention and neglect, inappropriate meddling and missed opportunities. The death this week of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela -- who along with Fidel Castro of Cuba was perhaps the most vociferous critic of the United States among the political leaders of the Western Hemisphere in recent decades -- offers an opportunity to restore bonds with potential allies who share the American goal of prosperity.
Throughout his career, the autocratic Mr. Chávez used our embargo as a wedge with which to antagonize the United States and alienate its supporters. His fuel helped prop up the rule of Mr. Castro and his brother Raúl, Cuba's current president. The embargo no longer serves any useful purpose (if it ever did at all); President Obama should end it, though it would mean overcoming powerful opposition from Cuban-American lawmakers in Congress. 
An end to the Cuba embargo would send a powerful signal to all of Latin America that the United States wants a new, warmer relationship with democratic forces seeking social change throughout the Americas.
I joined the State Department as a Foreign Service officer in the 1950s and chose to serve in Latin America in the 1960s. I was inspired by President John F. Kennedy's creative response to the revolutionary fervor then sweeping Latin America. The 1959 Cuban revolution, led by the charismatic Fidel Castro, had inspired revolts against the cruel dictatorships and corrupt pseudodemocracies that had dominated the region since the end of Spanish and Portuguese rule in the 19th century.
Kennedy had a charisma of his own, and it captured the imaginations of leaders who wanted democratic change, not violent revolution. Kennedy reacted to the threat of continental insurrection by creating the Alliance for Progress, a kind of Marshall Plan for the hemisphere that was calculated to achieve the same kind of results that saved Western Europe from Communism. He pledged billions of dollars to this effort. In hindsight, it may have been overly ambitious, even naïve, but Kennedy's focus on Latin America rekindled the promise of the Good Neighbor Policy of Franklin D. Roosevelt and transformed the whole concept of inter-American relations.
Tragically, after Kennedy's assassination in 1963, the ideal of the Alliance for Progress crumbled and ''la noche mas larga'' -- ''the longest night'' -- began for the proponents of Latin American democracy. Military regimes flourished, democratic governments withered, moderate political and civil leaders were labeled Communists, rights of free speech and assembly were curtailed and human dignity crushed, largely because the United States abandoned all standards save that of anti-Communism.
During my Foreign Service career, I did what I could to oppose policies that supported dictators and closed off democratic alternatives. In 1981, as the ambassador to El Salvador, I refused a demand by the secretary of state, Alexander M. Haig Jr., that I use official channels to cover up the Salvadoran military's responsibility for the murders of four American churchwomen. I was fired and forced out of the Foreign Service.
The Reagan administration, under the illusion that Cuba was the power driving the Salvadoran revolution, turned its policy over to the Pentagon and C.I.A., with predictable results. During the 1980s the United States helped expand the Salvadoran military, which was dominated by uniformed assassins. We armed them, trained them and covered up their crimes.
After our counterrevolutionary efforts failed to end the Salvadoran conflict, the Defense Department asked its research institute, the RAND Corporation, what had gone wrong. RAND analysts found that United States policy makers had refused to accept the obvious truth that the insurgents were rebelling against social injustice and state terror. As a result, ''we pursued a policy unsettling to ourselves, for ends humiliating to the Salvadorans and at a cost disproportionate to any conventional conception of the national interest.''
Over the subsequent quarter-century, a series of profound political, social and economic changes have undermined the traditional power bases in Latin America and, with them, longstanding regional institutions like the Organization of American States. The organization, which is headquartered in Washington and which excluded Cuba in 1962, was seen as irrelevant by Mr. Chávez. He promoted the creation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States -- which excludes the United States and Canada -- as an alternative.
At a regional meeting that included Cuba and excluded the United States, Mr. Chávez said that ''the most positive thing for the independence of our continent is that we meet alone without the hegemony of empire.''
Mr. Chávez was masterful at manipulating America's antagonism toward Fidel Castro as a rhetorical stick with which to attack the United States as an imperialist aggressor, an enemy of progressive change, interested mainly in treating Latin America as a vassal continent, a source of cheap commodities and labor.
Like its predecessors, the Obama administration has given few signs that it has grasped the magnitude of these changes or cares about their consequences. After President Obama took office in 2009, Latin America's leading statesman at the time, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, then the president of Brazil, urged Mr. Obama to normalize relations with Cuba.
Lula, as he is universally known, correctly identified our Cuba policy as the chief stumbling block to renewed ties with Latin America, as it had been since the very early years of the Castro regime.
After the failure of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, Washington set out to accomplish by stealth and economic strangulation what it had failed to do by frontal attack. But the clumsy mix of covert action and porous boycott succeeded primarily in bringing shame on the United States and turning Mr. Castro into a folk hero.
And even now, despite the relaxing of travel restrictions and Raúl Castro's announcement that he will retire in 2018, the implacable hatred of many within the Cuban exile community continues. The fact that two of the three Cuban-American members of the Senate -- Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas -- are rising stars in the Republican Party complicates further the potential for a recalibration of Cuban-American relations. (The third member, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, is the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but his power has been weakened by a continuing ethics controversy.)
Are there any other examples in the history of diplomacy where the leaders of a small, weak nation can prevent a great power from acting in its own best interest merely by staying alive?
The re-election of President Obama, and the death of Mr. Chávez, give America a chance to reassess the irrational hold on our imaginations that Fidel Castro has exerted for five decades. The president and his new secretary of state, John Kerry, should quietly reach out to Latin American leaders like President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and José Miguel Insulza, secretary general of the Organization of American States. The message should be simple: The president is prepared to show some flexibility on Cuba and asks your help.
Such a simple request could transform the Cuban issue from a bilateral problem into a multilateral challenge. It would then be up to Latin Americans to devise a policy that would help Cuba achieve a sufficient measure of democratic change to justify its reintegration into a hemisphere composed entirely of elected governments.
If, however, our present policy paralysis continues, we will soon see the emergence of two rival camps, the United States versus Latin America. While Washington would continue to enjoy friendly relations with individual countries like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, the vision of Roosevelt and Kennedy of a hemisphere of partners cooperating in matters of common concern would be reduced to a historical footnote.

HEADLINE: The Next Pope and the Future Church

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''U.S. Catholics in Poll See a Church Out of Touch'' (front page, March 6):
The poll's findings with respect to how Catholics feel toward their local priests and the sermons they deliver reflect my experience.
The issue of married priests and the ordination of women into the priesthood will resolve itself out of necessity in order for the church to continue to play a vital role in the lives of Catholics. There just aren't enough men coming into the priesthood to do otherwise, and the church hierarchy must accept the reality of the changed lifestyles and problems that people of all faiths confront today. 
The fact that lay people are permitted to distribute the Eucharist, do spiritual readings from the altar and deliver homilies are recognitions of this fact.
JOHN A. VITERITTI Southold, N.Y., March 6, 2013
To the Editor:
Re ''Cardinals Signal Careful Pace Toward Vote on Pope'' (news article, March 6):
Cardinals gathering in Rome this week are said to be spending time getting to know one another before what is perhaps the most important job of their careers, electing a new pope. That they need to spend this time before the conclave examining one another is one major reason Vatican reorganization is imperative.
These men are responsible for electing the leader of Catholicism from their midst, and yet they do not know one another. How can an organization function if its executives are strangers?
In the United States, the bishops have the advantage of meeting twice a year. The College of Cardinals would do well to follow this example to stay tuned to the pulse of the world's Catholics. Future papal elections would benefit. And it might be a first step in cracking the stranglehold of secrecy that has crippled a church bureaucracy badly in need of retooling.
MARY LOUISE HARTMAN Bonita Springs, Fla., March 6, 2013
The writer is a member of the board of trustees of Future Church, an international group working for changes in the church.
To the Editor:
My wish for the conclave is very practicable and would not require any adjustments to canon law. Have the cardinals declare a six-month interregnum and return home and ask their bishops to hold open diocesan synods and public periods of just listening -- not responding -- to the concerns of the faithful.
After intermittent periods of silent retreats, bring the continental episcopacies together and listen to them. Then, in September, agree to meet and begin their process of electing a pope.
This is not a radical reform or a total reform, but it would allow time for much to surface. There would be the inevitable politicking, but it is better than the alternative.
DAVID E. PASINSKI Syracuse, March 6, 2013
The writer is a former priest.
To the Editor:
Paul Elie's distorted view of Catholicism (''Give Up Your Pew for Lent,'' Op-Ed, March 1) is aptly demonstrated in his assessment of Benedict XVI's papacy as ''all bad news, all the time.'' Such a biased view makes one wonder what papacy Mr. Elie was experiencing these last eight years.
It seems difficult to imagine that someone who has been in a Catholic pew since 2005 could have missed the beauty of Benedict's first encyclical, ''Deus Caritas Est'' (''God Is Love''); his intelligent articulation of the dangers of relativism in our lives today; his underscoring of the importance of social justice and the shortcomings of our economic system in ''Caritas in Veritate'' (''Charity in Truth''); and his innovative engagement of the secular world.
Nor is it easy to understand Mr. Elie's silence on the pope's tough stand on the sexual abuse crisis, which included his bringing to heel the powerful founder of the Legion of Christ.
Perhaps rather than abandon the pews because of periodic disappointments in the human frailty of the church, we would do well to reflect upon the pope's parting words: ''Dear friends, God guides his church, maintains her always, and especially in difficult times.''
RICHARD J. WOLFF Weehawken, N.J., March 2, 2013
The writer is a member of the board of directors of the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University.
To the Editor:
Paul Elie suggests that readers should give up Catholicism for Lent. I'm sorry he feels that way, and wonder what faith really means to him.
My faith has enabled me to live a very rich and happy life, to forgive people who have hurt me, to ask for forgiveness when I have hurt others, to trust in God when life gets hard. My faith isn't something that I can leave any more than I can leave anything or anyone I love.
I am a happily married mother of eight who has gone through some trials in life. Yet I thank God every day for the gifts he has given me.
I hope that Mr. Elie will realize that true faith in God cannot be left so easily. We have lots of sinners in our church, including me. That's why I need God's love and forgiveness.
REBECCA O'HERRON Newburgh, N.Y., March 1, 2013
To the Editor:
Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan is quoted as saying the ''very nature of the papacy is to hand on ... tradition, with a capital T'' (''Saying Mass at Vatican, Dolan Urges Catholics to Look Beyond the Papal Conclave,'' news article, March 4).
The cardinals, guided by the Holy Spirit, will choose someone who will reignite the flame of hope that was sparked by Pope John XXIII and his Second Vatican Council. Fifty years ago, that council reclaimed tradition with a capital T, the tradition of the apostles and the apostolic church.
Unfortunately, the last two popes did all they could to snuff that flame. It still smolders in the pews around the world, however, and we the faithful are waiting for the flame to be rekindled.

HEADLINE: To Place Graduates, Law Schools Are Opening Firms

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
TEMPE, Ariz. -- When Douglas J. Sylvester, dean of the law school at Arizona State University, was visiting the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota a couple of years ago he mentioned the shifting job market for his students -- far fewer offers and a new demand for graduates already able to draft documents and interact with clients.
The Mayo dean responded that his medical students and graduates gained clinical experience in hospital rounds closely supervised by attending physicians.
''I realized that was what we needed,'' Mr. Sylvester recalled. ''A teaching hospital for law school graduates.'' 
The result is a nonprofit law firm that Arizona State is setting up this summer for some of its graduates. Over the next few years, 30 graduates will work under seasoned lawyers and be paid for a wide range of services provided at relatively low cost to the people of Phoenix.
The plan is one of a dozen efforts across the country to address two acute -- and seemingly contradictory -- problems: heavily indebted law graduates with no clients and a vast number of Americans unable to afford a lawyer.
This paradox, fed by the growth of Internet-based legal research and services, is at the heart of a crisis looming over the legal profession after decades of relentless growth and accumulated wealth. It is evident in the sharp drop in law school applications and the increasing numbers of Americans showing up in court without a lawyer.
''It's a perfect storm,'' said Stacy Caplow, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who focuses on clinical education. ''The longstanding concerns over access to justice for most Americans and a lack of skills among law graduates are now combined with the problems faced by all law schools. It's creating conditions for change.''
A pilot program at the University of California Hastings College of the Law will place some third-year students into offices like the public defender's for full-time training on the understanding that the next year those students will be employed there for small salaries. The program is called Lawyers for America, a conscious echo of Teach for America, in which high-achieving college graduates work in low-income neighborhood schools. The hope, said Prof. Marsha Cohen of Hastings, is that other law schools will follow the model. Professor Caplow of Brooklyn Law said her school planned to be one of the first.
A dozen law schools, including City University of New York and Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, have set up incubators to train future solo practitioners in their first year out of school, offering office space and mentors. Pace Law School in White Plains, opened what it calls a community law practice last fall with four graduates serving the region.
''You can't just hang out a shingle and expect clients to show up in droves,'' said Jennifer C. Friedman, executive director of the Pace Community Law Practice. ''We want to provide our graduates with the tools of success while serving low- and moderate-income clients.''
And the incoming president of the American Bar Association, James R. Silkenat, of New York, said his top priority next fall would be to establish a ''legal job corps'' to match lawyers who need jobs with clients who need legal assistance.
''We have these two issues running in opposite directions,'' Mr. Silkenat said in an interview. ''There are unmet legal needs because of money and geography that seem to be growing, and the question of how to make use of unemployed recent graduates.''
All law schools, including the elites, are increasing skills training by adding clinics and externships. Starting this fall, the University of Virginia will allow students to earn a semester of credit while working full time for nonprofit or government employers anywhere in the world. Law students at the University of Pennsylvania, starting in September, can earn a certificate of management from its Wharton School to improve management skills and accounting literacy. Many of the schools and plans mention medical education as their model.
The Arizona State approach, called the Alumni Law Group, appears to be the most ambitious because of the number of lawyers it will employ (30), its projected cost (a commercial firm of comparable size would cost $5 million a year to run, according to the school's projections) and its hope to be self-sufficient in a couple of years by charging for its services and gathering donations.
The plan is to have four to five groups of lawyers each overseen by a full-time, salaried supervising lawyer serving a range of clients. The firm will do legal work for other parts of the university, including its high-tech innovation center. The aim is to charge $125 an hour in an area where the going hourly rate is $250. The school also says it wants to reach out to veterans, Hispanics and American Indians whose legal needs are not well met.
Other changes may help the program along. Arizona has just become the first state to allow law students to take the bar exam in their third year rather than after graduation. The school has announced the creation of the North American Law Degree, a three-year J.D. aimed at licensure in both Canada and the United States. Dean Sylvester, who is Canadian, said a big need for lawyers in Canada remained as well as for cross-border practice. The number of Canadians applying to Arizona State for law studies has just risen, as a result.
Arizona's plan, mooted at bar meetings and within law school circles, is producing envy -- but also skepticism. Some see a naked attempt to improve the school's ratings in U.S. News and World Report by increasing the percentage of its graduates who find work while doing little to address the access-to-justice problem.
Critics say that $125 an hour is too high to serve those in need and too low to break even. Others say that Phoenix, a city of intense growth and few law students, could support such an operation but that others could not and that local law firms would resent the competition.
''We charge $50 an hour, and I don't take any pay,'' said Dennis A. Gladwell, who runs a smaller firm at the University of Utah with a staff of five graduates started 16 months ago. ''If you are going to charge $125, you are not going to serve an underserved population.'' Mr. Gladwell, who retired as a partner from the big firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, also said that despite having asked top local firms to send along cases they considered too small for themselves, none responded.
There are other obstacles. Teaching hospitals have a federal tax dispensation. For nonprofit law firms to qualify for an exemption, legislation is probably required. That seems unlikely at the moment. Arizona State is attaching its firm to its nonprofit alumni association to get around the problem for now.
Still, postgraduate training programs appear to be the way of the future for many of the nation's 200 law schools. The law dean of Rutgers University just announced plans for a nonprofit law firm for some of his graduates.
''I would love to blink and wake up in 10 years and see where all this ends,'' said Ms. Friedman of Pace Law School. ''We know about 10 to 15 programs opening in the coming years. That means there are 30 more behind them. Every faculty is talking about this.''

HEADLINE: The Sequester and Fiscal Policy

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: The sequester and the across-the-board spending cuts it brings are almost the exact opposite of what the economy needs to grow and create jobs, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. 
The sequester - the large, across-the-board cuts in federal government spending that began to take effect on March 1 and are scheduled to persist through the next decade - is a product of political stalemate and ideology cloaked in the language of fiscal responsibility. Despite what some of its champions proclaim, there is no economic justification for the sequester. It is the wrong medicine for what ails the economy now and the wrong cure for its future budgetary challenges. 
As a result of a deep and lingering deficiency in aggregate demand, the United States economy is operating far below its potential. Real gross domestic product fell by 8 percent relative to its non-inflationary potential level in 2008 and has remained about 8 percent below the level consistent with its pre-recession growth rate ever since. 
The gap between the actual and potential level of output means about $900 billion of forgone goods and services this year alone. This tremendous waste of productive potential is reflected in an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent, a higher rate than at any point in the 24 years before the depths of the 2008 recession, and a poverty rate of 15 percent, significantly above the average of the last 30 years.

High levels of unemployment impose substantial costs not only in terms of human suffering and forgone output now but also in terms of the economy's productive potential in the future. The longer the economy operates below its current capacity, the slower the growth of its future capacity as a result of diminished risk-taking, forgone investment and the erosion of skills. 
Besides its sheer size, what's remarkable about the gap between actual and potential output is its persistence, despite a sustained and unprecedented effort by the Federal Reserve to boost demand and hasten the recovery. For more than five years, the Fed has held the nominal short-term interest rate near zero - its effective lower bound - with a promise to keep it there at least until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent. The Fed has also been purchasing about $1 trillion of long-term government bonds annually. As a result of these actions, the nominal yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a measure of the borrowing costs of the federal government, hovers around 2 percent, less than a third of its 40-year average, and both short-term and long-term interest rates are less than the rate of inflation.
In a speech earlier this week to the National Association of Business Economists, the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet Yellen, reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to its bold accommodative policies until there is a "substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market." 
Under current economic conditions, with significant unutilized resources, low inflation and highly accommodative monetary policy, contractionary fiscal policy has contractionary effects: spending cuts and tax increases reduce aggregate demand, choke job creation and dampen growth. In these circumstances, more deficit reduction is neither necessary nor wise; it is counterproductive. A more anemic recovery means less deficit reduction for any given set of fiscal policies. 
Spending cuts at the local, state and federal levels have been powerful headwinds constraining growth during the last three years. And the headwinds are intensifying this year. 
Taken together, the caps on discretionary spending imposed in 2011, the tax increases in the 2013 tax deal - especially the increase in payroll taxes that will trim household incomes by about $125 billion - and the sequester will cut about 1.5 percentage points from 2013 growth, consigning the economy to yet another year of tepid recovery and elevated unemployment. The sequester cuts alone will result in a loss of at least 700,000 jobs. And these arbitrary across-the-board cuts will inflict more damage on the economy than sensibly targeted cuts of the same magnitude. 
Mr. Bernanke admonished Congress in his recent statement that monetary policy "cannot carry the entire burden of ensuring a speedier return to economic health." Discretionary fiscal policy in the form of more debt-financed government spending is warranted and would be effective. Recent research finds that the multiplier for discretionary fiscal policy - the change in output caused by a change in discretionary government spending - is larger when interest rates are low and underutilized resources are available. 
Indeed, under these conditions it is possible that increases in government spending will end up paying for themselves in the long run by speeding the recovery and stemming unnecessary losses in the economy's future capacity. This possibility is the greatest for government spending in investment areas like research, education and infrastructure that generate sizable returns over time.

Mr. Bernanke also advised Congress that "not all tax and spending programs are created equal with respect to their effects on the economy," and emphasized the importance of investments in work-force skills, research and development and infrastructure. Unfortunately, as a result of the caps on discretionary spending and the sequester, these areas will fall victim to significant cuts over the next decade. 
If these policies are enforced, the Congressional Budget Office projects that discretionary spending will fall to 5.5 percent of G.D.P. by 2023, more than three percentage points below its 1973-2012 average, with nonmilitary outlays falling to 2.7 percent of G.D.P. compared with a 40-year average of 4 percent. 
The economy needs less rather than more deficit reduction in the near term. But less deficit reduction also means more debt accumulation over time. Even with the sequester and the discretionary caps, federal debt held by the public is projected to recent Congressional testimony remain around 75 percent of G.D.P. during the next decade, compared with an average of about 40 percent between 1960 and the 2008 recession. 
A large and growing government debt relative to the size of the economy has several negative potential consequences. Most important, when the economy is operating at capacity, it crowds out private saving and investment, reducing the capital stock, productivity and wage growth. It puts upward pressure on long-term interest rates and increases the cost of servicing the debt. It weakens investor confidence in the debt, heightens the risk of a financial crisis and reduces the government's budgetary flexibility to address future, unexpected shocks. 
The economy needs a long-run plan of revenue increases and spending cuts to put the federal budget on a sustainable path that will stabilize and reduce gradually the debt- to-G.D.P. ratio. Congress should jettison the sharp, front-loaded and arbitrary sequester cuts that will harm the recovery and work on such a plan. 
Unfortunately, the political stalemate and ideology that produced the sequester appear to rule out this approach at least for now. Perhaps when the sequester's costs become apparent, Congress will be forced back to the negotiating table.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times and around the Web, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
The 13-hour filibuster led by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has exposed a deep divide among Republicans over the president's drone policy. Richard W. Stevenson and Ashley Parker write that "by the time the Senate adjourned for the weekend, a Republican Party that had long assailed Mr. Obama as a leader who would turn a war on terrorism into a police action with Miranda rights for suspects had shown itself to be sharply divided over whether the president had instead grabbed too much power and was risking violating the Constitution in his efforts to keep the nation safe."
Osama bin Laden's son-in-law is set to go on trial in New York after he was charged with conspiracy to kill Americans. Discussing the case, Mark Mazzetti and William K. Rashbaum write that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a former spokesman for Al Qaeda who is married to one of Bin Laden's daughters, could spend the rest of his life in prison. 
Sheryl Gay Stolberg profiles an emerging guard of Latino leaders who are using their wealth, education and fame to tap the Latino electorate for campaign cash and political clout.
President Obama is waging a campaign to woo Republicans into a productive partnership, but Jeremy W. Peters writes that wining and dining with lawmakers might not help to overcome stark ideological differences about what the size and scope of government should be.
After a series of protracted fiscal fights, President Obama is late submitting his 2014 budget proposal to Congress just as President Ronald Reagan was under similar circumstances in 1988. But Jackie Calmes writes that whereas Democrats were sympathetic to Mr. Reagan, Republicans are decidedly impatient with Mr. Obama.
A Senate race in Michigan will be an open contest after Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat, announced that he would not seek re-election in 2014 for a seventh term. Jennifer Steinhauer writes that while Mr. Levin's decision leaves Republicans more areas of attack in their effort to take back the Senate, they do not do so well in Michigan's statewide races.
 Around the Web: 
In an opinion article for The Washington Post, former President Bill Clinton says it is time for the Supreme Court to overturn the federal Defense of Marriage Act that he signed into law.
The State Department is rethinking whether to give the International Women of Courage Award to an Egyptian activist amid a row over messages sent from her Twitter account that were deemed anti-Semitic and supportive of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to The Associated Press.
 Happening in Washington: 
Economic reports expected Friday include employment data for February at 8:30 a.m., followed by wholesale trade inventories for January at 10:00 a.m.
Also at 10, a Federal District Court in Washington will hear oral arguments in Al Shimari v. CACI. The lawsuit was brought by four Iraqi torture victims against a private government contractor whom the victims accuse of participating in interrogations at Abu Ghraib.
The remains of sailors who died when the warship Monitor sank in 1862 will be interred at Arlington National Cemetery in a ceremony that begins at 11 a.m.
At 11:15 a.m., Mr. Obama will meet with religious leaders to discuss immigration reform.
Michelle Obama will deliver keynote remarks at a conference focused on childhood obesity at 1:30 p.m. At 3 p.m., she will join Secretary of State John F. Kerry to honor the nine recipients of the International Women of Courage Award.

HEADLINE: Easy 'A' on Bank Stress Tests?

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The big question raised by some analysts was whether the Fed was too lenient in the so-called stress tests of banks. | Dell&#8217;s directors face an increasing challenge as they prepare to defend the proposed buyout of the computer maker. | The chief executive of Pandora Media said on Thursday that he would be leaving the Internet radio company. | Lawyers gathered in Las Vegas for the American Bar Association&#8217;s three-day White Collar Crime National Institute. 

 BODY:
EASY 'A' ON BANK STRESS TESTS? | Federal regulators found that banks, four years after the financial crisis, are better prepared to weather future financial shocks, according to the results of the so-called stress tests that the Federal Reserve released on Thursday. But the big question raised by some analysts was whether the Fed was too lenient in the tests, which now pave the way for the healthiest institutions to return money to shareholders, DealBook's Peter Eavis and Ben Protess write.
The tests, some argue, underestimate potential losses and what might happen if major financial firms collapsed. "The stress tests were just not very stressful," said Rebel A. Cole, a professor of finance at DePaul University. Still, the stress tests "are a tool to gauge the resiliency of the financial sector," a Federal Reserve governor, Daniel K. Tarullo, said in a statement. 
Some of the successes were a bit unexpected. Just a year after poor performance in the tests thwarted its plans, Citigroup did better than its rivals this year. And the bank didn't wait long to celebrate, announcing that it hoped to carry out $1.2 billion in stock buybacks through the first quarter of 2014. Other banks, like Ally Financial, didn't do as well. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase had some of the lowest capital results among the Wall Street firms. It turned out that Goldman Sachs would take $25 billion in trading losses under the test.
"In another sign of friction, the banks had to run the same test as the Fed - and in some cases produced rosier results," Mr. Eavis and Mr. Protess write. "Wells Fargo reported a projected 9.2 percent Tier 1 common ratio, the primary measure of financial strength tracked by regulators, by the end of 2014. That was far higher than the 7 percent calculated by the Fed."
ICAHN'S CHALLENGE TO DELL DEAL | Dell's directors face an increasing challenge as they prepare to defend the proposed buyout of the computer maker, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes. Carl C. Icahn, recently joining the fray, is pushing for a special dividend for investors of $9 a share, echoing similar plans by Southeastern Asset Management, another investor opposed to the current deal. Directors can begin pushing back on March 22, the end of the period when bankers for a special committee of Dell's board were meant to seek alternatives to the going-private plan by Michael S. Dell, the founder, and the private equity firm Silver Lake.
If Dell rejects Mr. Icahn's plan, the billionaire said he would legally challenge the company's board, including nominating his own group of directors. "We anticipate years of litigation will follow challenging the transaction and the actions of those directors that participated in it," Mr. Icahn wrote in a letter sent to the special committee. He is demanding that Dell borrow $8.25 billion to help finance the proposed dividend. "We see no reason that the future value of Dell should not accrue to all the existing Dell shareholders - not just Michael Dell," he said in the letter.
But Mr. Icahn's pronouncements may amount to a game of chicken, Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "In the end, Mr. Icahn probably does not want to run the company, and Mr. Dell does not want that either. Ultimately, Mr. Icahn - with his announcement - is just pressuring the board to sweeten the deal for shareholders. This is all about bobbing and weaving, and that is what Mr. Icahn is doing with his proposals."
PANDORA CHIEF TO STEP DOWN | Joseph J. Kennedy, who has been the chief executive of Pandora Media since 2004, said on Thursday that he would be leaving the Internet radio company. The announcement came as Pandora reported growth and better-than-expected earnings, Ben Sisario reports in the Media Decoder blog. Mr. Kennedy informed the board of his decision on Tuesday and, in the earnings call on Thursday, gave no reason other than hinting at the toll of running the company for nearly a decade. He plans to remain in place until a successor is found.
"As I approach the start of my 10th year," Mr. Kennedy said, "my head is telling me it's time to get to a recharging station sooner rather than later."
"Mr. Kennedy's tenure illustrates how much Pandora - and streaming music in general - has changed," Mr. Sisario writes. "Pandora dominates the Internet radio market, and has begun to challenge terrestrial radio stations for advertising. But its financial results, released after the close of trading on Thursday, show the challenges the company faces."
ON THE AGENDA | The South by Southwest festival, where in years past new technology products have been introduced, gets going in Austin. The unemployment report for February is out at 8:30 a.m. Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs's chief economist, is on CNBC at 10:30 a.m. 
 WHITE-COLLAR DEFENSE BAR GOES TO VEGAS | "This week more than 1,200 lawyers from across the country convened at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas for the American Bar Association's three-day White Collar Crime National Institute," DealBook's Peter Lattman writes. "Numerous federal prosecutors and securities regulators attended this year's event, including Robert S. Khuzami, the outgoing director of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, who spoke at a session on insider trading. While the lawyers were ostensibly there to attend panels and discussion groups on hot topics in white-collar litigation, the event is largely a schmooze-fest."
"Over the last 20 years, there has been an explosion in white-collar criminal defense work at the country's largest law firms. Representing businessmen and political officials in hot water was once considered déclassé, but today every large corporate law firm has a substantial practice focused on the lucrative work."

HEADLINE: The Risks of Expanding Into Australia

BYLINE: TOM SZAKY


HIGHLIGHT: Opening in a new country presents an opportunity for growth and revenue, but it is also an opportunity to lose ours shirts. 

 BODY:
In 2012, TerraCycle had $15 million in sales with operations in 22 countries, primarily in North and South America as well as in Europe and a little bit of the Middle East. A few months ago, we embarked on opening in our 23rd market, Australia.
While opening in a new country presents an opportunity for growth and revenue, it is also an opportunity to lose ours shirts - through unexpected issues and complications. As such, it is important for small businesses that don't have gobs of cash to manage each opening carefully. 
That said, we now live in a world where opening abroad is much easier than it used to be. With Internet phone service, long-distance calls are cheaper than ever and flying to Australia from New York can cost little more than flying to Fayetteville, Ark. Most important, while there are certainly cultural differences among foreign markets, they are far less problematic than many presume. TerraCycle, for example, is basically operated the same way in every country where we have operations, from Brazil to Turkey. We do adjust for each location, but we try as much as possible to avoid making adjustments in order to maintain coherence in a small organization of just more than 110 employees. 
For TerraCycle, the first step in choosing a new market is to evaluate the legal, financial and language issues to make sure we have a good fit. The next step is to look at the market opportunity. Will our business model - in our case, recycling waste that has been considered nonrecyclable - work in that market, and is the market big enough to make the effort worthwhile?
These issues are connected. Big markets - Britain, Canada, Australia, Germany - tend to have relatively simple legal and financial requirements, and they tend to use English as a primary (or, worst case, secondary) business language. This is not as true in Asian markets like Japan or South Korea, which are immense but handle business very differently (and not in English).
Countries like Turkey, Puerto Rico and Argentina are more challenging for us, with smaller economies, bigger language barriers, and complicated (meaning expensive) processes to set up a business. For example, incorporating in Argentina cost considerably more than incorporating in Canada, and the market size opportunity is smaller. This goes not just for setup but also for maintenance. And then you have the idiosyncratic human resources rules in each of these markets, which tend to favor the employee over the corporation.
For us, opening in a new country usually begins with landing a deal with a company to create a waste-collection system for nonrecyclable waste. In Brazil, it was Pepsico that wanted to start a national chip-bag collection. In Japan, it was a major cigarette company that wanted to start recycling cigarette butts. And in Canada, it was Mondelez International that wanted to recycle juice pouches. The benefit of having a client up front, before incurring costs, is that the revenue from the deal can help finance the investment.
Now, this doesn't always work. We thought we had a deal in Colombia, and it fell through. We had already incorporated and opened bank accounts, which means filing taxes - even if the income is zero. It also means paying lawyers and accountants $5,000 to $10,000 a year to keep the entity alive. It will cost us money even if we dissolve the entity, and we cannot just walk away if we ever want to operate there in the future. As a result, we are working very hard to land a deal in Colombia as soon as possible.
About a year ago, to get started in Australia, I led a one-week business development mission to Melbourne and Sydney. Even though we knew interest was high among potential clients, our United States-based business development team had not been able to convert that interest into a deal.
This is rare, but it does happen in markets that prefer to work with locals. We have seen this in Mexico, Brazil, Israel and a few other places. When it happens, we look to find a local person who is willing to take the lead - without pay - until a deal is signed and starts invoicing. We spend resources on training and support, but we align incentives by making the general manager's job tentative, pending the landing of a deal. Once that occurs, we open a local office, and put the general manager on the payroll. This is how we opened in both Argentina and Israel, where we have had great success.
For Australia, we brought on a fantastic new addition to our team, Anna Minns, who joined TerraCycle a few months ago and worked initially from our Trenton headquarters as a G.M. trainee. Anna was able to embrace our culture and business model, and she recently got back from a trip to Australia where she had terrific meetings with more than a dozen potential clients.
It didn't hurt that the Agence France-Presse happened to run a positive story about TerraCycle that was picked up by The Sydney Morning Herald on the first day of her trip. Last year, we finished working with local lawyers and accountants to incorporate and set up bank accounts in Australia. Just as with Colombia, we thought we had a deal ready to go after my business-development mission to Melbourne and Sydney.
But it fell through. So even with our low-risk approach, there is always risk. The process of setting up the entity typically costs $10,000 to $25,000 in year one and then $5,000 to $10,000 a year thereafter. Naturally, this depends on the market, and is generally the only major investment we have to make in a local market because the rest of the investment is generally financed through the partnerships - once they start coming in.
For the next few months, Anna will work from Trenton as she attempts to finalize a deal with the goal of opening a Sydney office this summer. The next question we will face is how we will manage an office that is literally halfway around the world. And will Anna prove to be as great a G.M. as we expect?
The key challenge with G.M.'s is that the job changes quickly. Initially, these new offices are one-person shops, and the G.M.'s have to do everything - get the deals, manage them, handle the accounting, and provide customer service. It's highly entrepreneurial and highly stressful. Then, as the office expands and more staffers are hired, the job evolves into a managerial function.
For example, in Britain, our London office opened in September 2009 with one person, Chris Baker. Today, it employs around 25 people. Chris's job has evolved, and while Chris has been a fantastic G.M., not all of our hiring choices have been able to handle this evolution. I'll talk more about that in my next post.
 Tom Szaky is the chief executive of TerraCycle, which is based in Trenton.

HEADLINE: The Rise of Part-Time Work

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The economy is nowhere near recovering the jobs lost in the recession, and the record looks even worse because so many jobs lost were full time, while so many of those gained have been part time. 

 BODY:
One of the more unsettling trends in this recovery has been the rise of part-time work. 
We are nowhere near recovering the jobs lost in the recession, and the track record looks even worse when you consider that so many of the jobs lost were full time, whereas so many of those gained have been part time. 
Compared with December 2007, when the recession officially began, there are 5.8 million fewer Americans working full time. In that same period, there has been an increase of 2.8 million working part time. Part-time workers - defined as people who usually work fewer than 35 hours a week - are still a minority of the work force, but their share is growing.
When the recession began, 16.9 percent of those working usually worked part time. That share rose sharply in 2008 and 2009 and has not fallen much since then. Today the share of workers with part-time jobs is 19.2 percent. 
This would not be so troubling if people were electing to work fewer hours. But that is not the case.
Basically all of the growth in part-time workers has been among people reluctantly working few hours because of either slack business conditions or an inability to find a full-time job. Together these people are considered to be working part time "for economic reasons." Their numbers have grown by 3.4 million since the downturn began. 
The number of people working part time "for noneconomic reasons," on the other hand, has fallen by 639,000 since the recession began.
These trends are part of the reason that many people believe the standard unemployment rate of 7.7 percent understates the extent of underemployment. If you include both part-time workers who want full-time work and people who have stopped looking for jobs but still want to work, the unemployment rate is actually 14.3 percent.
It's not clear what's behind the growth in part-time work. It probably has to do mostly with companies' not having as much need for labor today as they did when the economy was strong. The Affordable Care Act also has incentives for employers to keep their count of full-time workers below 50, but that has probably affected only a few companies at the margin at this point.

HIGHLIGHT: How the military draft worked &#8211; and didn&#8217;t &#8211; for each side in the Civil War. 

 BODY:
What if you threw a war and no one came?
That problem confronted both the Confederate States of America and the United States during the Civil War, and it eventually forced each to resort to conscription to fill the ranks. In both cases, the draft led to denunciations of the conflict as "a rich man's war but a poor man's fight." Where raising troops had been a job left to the states before the Civil War, conscription, North and South, was Exhibit A of the increasing centralization and power of both federal governments.
With a considerably smaller population of 9 million (about 4 million of them slaves) to the North's 22 million, the Confederates were the first to resort to a draft. That came in April 1862, and it targeted men between 18 and 35 years old. A change in October 1862 raised the age limit to 45 and another in February 1864 expanded the pool further, to boys of 17 and men as old as 50. 
In devising its conscription law, the Confederacy took a modern approach, assessing the nation's needs and manpower holistically and taking critical occupations into account. Railroad workers, telegraph operators, teachers and druggists were among those exempt from the draft. Only sons and men with physical disabilities were also excused, as were men who owned or worked as an overseer for 20 slaves or more. Not surprisingly, the South experienced a sudden burst of new schools and drugstores when the law passed, but otherwise the Confederates instituted a full mobilization of its manpower.
Still, many Southerners resented what they believed was an infringement on individual freedoms, and the governors of Georgia and North Carolina resisted the Davis administration's efforts. Georgia Gov. Joseph E. Brown said that nothing the United States had done to his state was as damaging to liberty as the draft. Suddenly both states were bursting with militiamen and civil servants, jobs that were among those protected by the draft law.
It was the classist aspects of the laws that most offended poor and yeoman Southerners. The original law allowed men to hire a substitute, an option plainly available only to people with means. That part of the law was overturned in December 1863. But the more offensive 20-slave exemption never was. 
The law was a response to the pleas of slave mistresses whose men were at war. Letters poured into politicians' offices with accounts from women who were afraid of slave uprisings or whose chattel would not follow their instructions. Poor whites screamed at the unfairness of the 20-slave rule, but their objections went unheeded.
Although its conception of the draft was modern, the Confederacy's administration of conscription was positively byzantine. In some parts of the South the Davis administration ran the program. In others, the states were responsible for raising the men. And in yet other places the Confederate Army administered the job. Nevertheless, the South's universal approach to the draft was highly effective. About 80 percent of military-age white men in the Confederacy served in the Army.
The Union didn't institute a draft until Congress passed the Enrollment Act in March 1863, the first ever in the nation's history. Despite superior organization and resources, the North had in many ways a much harder task. Unlike the Confederacy, the North hoped that its system would induce more men to volunteer rather than lose face as a draftee. Like the South, the North had categories of exemptions, but because the North had so many more people, Congress did not have to consider the full management of the economy and society as closely as the Confederates did.
The result was a Napoleonic approach to the draft. Every state had a quota of men to fill, and those quotas were broken down to the township level. If an area met its quota through volunteers, there would be no draft. If a draft had to take place, a trustworthy resident - preferably a blind man - would draw the names of 20- to 45-year-old single men from a large drum or a hat. Draftees had time to hire a substitute, buy their way out of the service through a $300 commutation fee (legal until mid-1864) or go into the service voluntarily. 
If the modus operandi was old-fashioned, the administration was modern. A new agency, the Provost Marshal General's Bureau, was built from scratch in an astonishingly short time. With little direction from Congress, the provost marshal general, James B. Fry, created a series of protocols for his men, hired a staff, selected the three members of each local draft board, conducted a nationwide census of military-age men and had his agency conscripting within three months. 
By law, the provost marshal had to have at least one office in every congressional district in the Union, though it often had satellite offices. Each office employed clerks and other functionaries, but many also had spies or agents on the payroll, since the law charged the bureau with tracking down deserters and draft dodgers. 
Very quickly, Fry interpreted part of his mission as rooting out any real or potential threats to conscription. All over the country, his underlings kept close tabs on the disaffected and dissidents, worried that they would impinge on the government's ability to raise men for the Army. The reports from the men in the field streamed steadily into Fry's headquarters in Washington. The level of surveillance was such that the Provost Marshal General's Bureau was, functionally, the first domestic intelligence agency in American history.
Fry's men had legitimate reason for concern. In communities across the North, enrolling officers were targets for men who opposed the draft. Agents were shot at, sometimes killed; their houses or barns torched; their livestock killed. Enlisted men deserted at the urgings of antiwar Democrats. Draftees were known to maim themselves so they would fail the army's physical, and many fled to the West or to Canada to avoid service. Draft riots broke out in a number of cities and towns, the most notable taking place in New York in July 1863, just days after the Battle of Gettysburg. The mob action in New York remains the largest civil disturbance the nation has ever known.
Those were not the only complications that the bureau faced. The federal government offered a bounty, or cash bonus, to induce men to enlist voluntarily. As the war ground on and the death toll mounted, state and local governments offered their own bounties to fill quotas, often hoping to attract outsiders to serve in place of their own men. 
The sums of money involved could amount to $1,000 or more, and this, not surprisingly, led to rampant fraud. For a percentage, brokers would link potential soldiers with communities offering high bounties, then bolt with the entire sum. Bounty jumping - where men would enlist, take the money, run to another community and then repeat the process - was an uncontrolled and seemingly uncontrollable problem.
The success of the Union draft is debatable. Only about 2 percent of the 2.1 million federal soldiers were drafted into the service, and they had a terrible reputation for their performance in the field. About 6 percent of the Army was composed of substitutes. Most historians regard the draft as a success only in that it seems to have stirred thousands of men to enlist rather than be tarred as conscripts.
As for the legality of conscription, Pennsylvania's Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1863, but the case had little impact outside of legal circles and never made its way to the United States Supreme Court. That happened only after World War I, in 1919, when the federal justices unanimously ruled against Joseph Arver and other Minnesota draft resisters. One of Arver's arguments was that conscription was a form of involuntary servitude and therefore violated the 13th Amendment, which had formally freed all slaves in 1865.
The Provost Marshal General's Bureau witnessed the end of the Civil War with its powers intact. Over Fry's strenuous objections, the end of the war marked the end of the agency. It was shuttered and out of business by the middle of 1866, and the country would not undergo another draft until the Woodrow Wilson administration.

HEADLINE: Energy and Climate on the White House Agenda

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama hosted a casual off-the-record meeting with a diverse group of energy and climate change experts at the White House on Thursday evening, officials and participants said. 

 BODY:
President Obama hosted a casual off-the-record meeting with a diverse group of energy and climate change experts at the White House on Thursday evening, officials and participants said Friday. 
The session appeared to mark an early stage of the "national conversation" on how to deal with climate change that Mr. Obama promised to lead shortly after he was re-elected in November.
Among the participants were top oil and gas and utility executives, academic experts on energy, former government officials and a half-dozen White House staff members. Bill Ritter Jr., the former governor of Colorado and an outspoken advocate for clean energy, was there, as was Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a former chairwoman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Cass R. Sunstein, the Harvard Law School professor who served as overseer of federal regulation in Mr. Obama's first term, was also at the table. 
Here is the White House description of the gathering: "During the meeting, the president reiterated his commitment to a cleaner and more secure energy future. The discussion covered a variety of topics including the important role of natural gas in our domestic energy portfolio, new opportunities for renewables like wind, solar and advanced biofuels, the importance of clean energy research and development, as well as the promise and potential of increased energy efficiency in our homes and businesses."
The White House added that Mr. Obama said he would use his executive branch authority during his second term to advance his goals for clean energy and climate change, repeating a vow from his recent State of the Union address.
The attendees were asked not to discuss the specifics of the conversation. 
Officials said that Mr. Obama would visit the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago next Friday to discuss energy. 
Here is a full list of the participants in Thursday's meeting, as provided by the White House:
 James T. Hackett, executive chairman, Anadarko
 Lew Hay, executive chairman, NextEra; chairman, Edison Electric Institute
Walter Isaacson, president and chief executive, Aspen Institute

HEADLINE: Cuomo Voices Mixed Optimism for Chances of Campaign Finance Proposals

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said he was &#8220;cautiously optimistic&#8221; of winning an overhaul, but he sounded uncertain about legislative support for establishing a financing system for state candidates. 

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Friday that he was "cautiously optimistic" that he could push through the Legislature this spring an overhaul of the state's campaign finance laws, one of the top priorities in Albany for government reformers and progressive groups.
At the same time, he struck an uncertain note about the centerpiece of what advocates are proposing: putting in place a financing system for state elections, modeled after the one used in New York City, which matches small donations with public money. In exchange, candidates must agree to strict spending limits. 
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said the rise of independent groups' spending enormous sums of money in campaigns has "made it more complicated" to devise such a system.
"The juxtaposition between an independent expenditure committee and public financing is truly difficult to explain," Mr. Cuomo said. "The politicians feel a public financing system will handcuff them, and if an independent expenditure committee then parachutes into the race, they'll be defenseless." 
The governor's speech at a luncheon on Friday provided a preview for one of the top policy debates that is likely to come up in Albany after the state budget is completed this month. The luncheon was sponsored by the Committee for Economic Development, a business-backed policy group, and the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. Mr. Cuomo will also hold a conference call on Monday with supporters of overhauling the campaign finance system.
In his State of the State address in January, he pledged to push for a broad package of campaign finance changes, including the creation of a system of public financing for state elections, lower limits on political contributions and a requirement that contributions be disclosed in almost real time.
But some advocates of overhauling the state's campaign fund-raising laws have been skeptical of how far the governor will be willing to push lawmakers, especially Republicans in the State Senate, who have opposed using public money to pay for political campaigns. Mr. Cuomo has also been extraordinarily successful raising money under the existing lax fund-raising rules.
In a 23-minute speech on Friday at the Midtown Manhattan offices of the law firm Covington & Burling, Mr. Cuomo said the good news, for advocates of campaign finance changes, was that the presidential election had raised public awareness of the flood of money in politics. He said New York State could set an example for the rest of the country in moving to combat it.
The bad news, the governor said, is that the measures he is proposing are "not a prophylactic to the basic vulnerability of Citizens United," the Supreme Court case in 2010 that led to a surge in outside spending.
"Yes, you could come up with a very restrictive system with very restrictive limits," he said, "and then have an independent expenditure committee come in and totally violate the spirit of what we were trying to accomplish." 
Mr. Cuomo said, politically, this year was an ideal one to try to push for changes in Albany, given that lawmakers were not up for re-election. But he warned that it would be a challenging area in which to make progress, because "this is not about changing policy that will affect someone else; this is changing a policy that affects them in their livelihood."
In his remarks, Mr. Cuomo was particularly critical of outside groups that spend lavishly to support political candidates, saying "these ties now are so close that it really begs credibility that they're truly independent."
Mr. Cuomo has drawn criticism over his ties to an outside group, the Committee to Save New York, that has spent millions of dollars supporting his legislative agenda. Asked after his speech about the Committee to Save New York, Mr. Cuomo did not respond directly, but observed, "The independence line, in some cases, has been blurred."
Speaking to reporters, he added that his primary concern was with independent groups that spend enormous sums in political campaigns "and obliterate a candidacy."
"An independent expenditure committee comes in - 'Americas for America' - and spends $10 million, and nobody knows who it is or where it came from, and that, to me, distorts the system," Mr. Cuomo said. "And when you're trying to say to the politicians, you should have this public financing system, but there's this alternative that could distort everything, it's very difficult."
Mr. Cuomo, who faces re-election next year, also discussed why he has continued to raise a large amount of money using the lax fund-raising rules that he wants to change. In January, he reported more than $22 million in his campaign account.
"The least favorite part of my job is the fund-raising part," Mr. Cuomo said. "But until the rules are changed, I don't have an alternative. I happen not to be independently wealthy, which would have solved a lot of problems on a lot of levels." He added, "A rich multimillionaire says, 'I want to be governor,' and they're going to spend a lot of their own money - that could be formidable."
Mr. Cuomo said that from his point of view, lawmakers would be acting in their self-interest if they moved to overhaul the state's campaign fund-raising system.
"Raising money is very hard," he said. "It's very unpleasant on a personal level. It takes a lot of time. And most politicians who have to deal with the system would be the first ones to say they want to change it."

HEADLINE: Common Core Practice | Environmental Issues in the Humanities Classroom

BYLINE: SARAH GROSS, JONATHAN OLSEN and KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: This week: wildlife smuggling, the North Korean crab business, and the fossilized remains of a giant camel &#8212; along with an invitation to find environmental stories that compel you. 

 BODY:
As regular readers know, our partner for this series is a ninth-grade humanities class at a high school in New Jersey recognized as one of the top S.T.E.M. schools in the nation. 
Sarah Gross and Jonathan Olsen, teachers there, are always working to integrate S.T.E.M. topics - science, technology, engineering and math - into their English and history classes, and this week they devoted all three prompts to showing some ways that might be done. 
Below, exercises that ask students to read and write about wildlife smuggling, the North Korean crab business and the fossilized remains of a giant camel - along with an invitation to find environmental stories that compel you.
 Informative Writing 
Asia Pacific: "In Trafficking of Wildlife, Out of Reach of the Law"
Common Core Standards: RI2, RI3, RI10, W2, W4, RH5
 In this article, the Times reporter Thomas Fuller introduces us to one of the world's most notorious wildlife smugglers, Vixay Keosavang. 
Mr. Vixay is notorious among investigators and government officials in several countries fighting to cut off syndicates operating a thriving trade in endangered animals. This trade spans continents and has led to the slaughter of elephants in Africa, the illegal killings of rhinoceroses and the decimation of other species living in Asia's jungles. Despite voluminous evidence against Mr. Vixay, he has not yet been prosecuted.
 Your Task: This article ends with a typical newspaper "kicker," or final paragraph - a quote about an aspect of the story from someone involved in it. Instead, compose an alternate ending that that reads more like a traditional essay conclusion and briefly summarizes the main points. As part of your conclusion, ask a rhetorical question.
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Highlight five or six main ideas in the text that you want to mention in your conclusion.
        
Come up with a rhetorical question that can be used in your conclusion. Your rhetorical question should be used as a way to generate thought or conversation around your writing.
        
Make sure you don't introduce new ideas in your conclusion - stick to information from the article.
 Extension Activity 

        
Poaching and smuggling of animals are problems the world must deal with, but there are other issues at hand, too. Take a look at this Room for Debate forum which investigates the question of whether there is a way to meet consumer demand for quality seafood and protect threatened marine life at the same time. To what extent do you think about issues of sustainability when you choose what to eat?
 Argumentative Writing 
International: "Caught in North Korea, Sold in China, Crabs Knit Two Economies"
Common Core Standards: RI1, RI3, RI5, RI10, W1, W4, W9, W10, RH1, RH4, RH5
 In the icy Sea of Japan, North Korean fishermen scoop prized crabs from 3,000 feet below the water's surface. These crabs are a lucrative business for the Korean fishermen and Chinese traders who buy the crabs in the Korean port city of Rason and then sell them in their home country. Some of these North Korean crabs are even eventually sold in the United States by way of these Chinese merchants. 
In the wake of a third nuclear test by the North Korean government, the United Nations is trying to impose sanctions against this small communist country. China, however, is resisting these attempts to slow North Korea's expanding nuclear weapons capacity. 
 Your Task: Should countries like China and the United States support North Korea by purchasing crabs taken from their waters? In a brief essay, use evidence from the text to support your assertion.
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Focus on the question being asked and note that you have to address both China and the United States in your response.
        
Highlight reasons why China might not want to stop trading with North Korea.
        
Determine how the United States obtains crabs from North Korea. Is their relationship to this crab trade the same as the Chinese? Does it make a difference in your argument?

Watch this 2013 TED talk from biologist Allan Savory who has spent his life working to stop the desertification of the world's grasslands. While watching the lecture, take visual notes (using pictures and words). This means your notes will be based on pictures, sketches, and connectors rather than just text. Here are some examples from our students who sketched while watching the talk.
        
Visual notes, or sketchnotes, are frequently shared at TED conferences and you can view many of them on the organization's Pinterest page.
 Narrative Writing 
International: "Canada's North, Home to Bears, and Once, Camels"
Common Core Standards: RI1, RI10, W3, W4, W10, RST2, WHST4
 While camels are usually associated with the searing heat of the desert, a group of scientists reported on Tuesday that they had found fossilized remains of a giant camel, with a shoulder height of perhaps nine feet, in Canada's frigid high Arctic. 
 Natalia Rybczynski, a paleontologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, discovered the bone fragments in 2006. It was a surprising find because the remains were found about 750 miles north of what was previously the northernmost known camel fossil, a giant found in Canada's Yukon Territory in 1913.
 Your Task: You are an archeologist separated from your team on a dig in the Canadian Arctic when you come across the bones of what you think is a giant camel. Write a diary entry about your experience.
 We have included snippets from some students to get you going: 
From Alisha Z.:
There I was. Lost. Without a team. Without a first aid kit. Shouldn't I have folded into a fetal position and started crying for my mommy? But I didn't. I couldn't simply just die in the Canadian Arctic in the middle of nowhere. I willed myself to get up and move on. I mean paleontologists are strong, right?....I cried for help, hoping for one of my team members to hear me but anything I said was muffled by the thick branches of the trees covering the sky. I was walking backwards when I tripped on something and fell. "Stupid tree roots", I thought. But when I looked on the ground I saw....white? Tree roots are not white! I pulled out my emergency paleontology kit and and started to brush away the dirt and sift....
From Caroline K.:
Adjusting the bug net that sat awkwardly over my head to avoid the eternally pesky mosquitoes, I kneeled down again on my aching hands and knees. I had lost my group hours ago, but since we had been given tracker chips in case something like this happened, I knew help would be coming soon. In the meantime, I decided it wouldn't hurt to search for fossils right here, since that's what the trip was for anyway...What I found next, though, was not what I expected to find in the Canadian Arctic...
And we had to include this from our student Joey D., who got the whole class laughing.
I was wandering alone. I had separated from the rest of the dig team after I went to scout up ahead. I must have made a wrong turn because soon I was all alone. In the distance I saw something moving towards me. "Guys," I yelled, hoping it was them and not a polar bear or worse, a frost troll...I looked up. It was huge and it was a camel. Man was this thing huge. I gave it a big hug and climbed on its back. It started galloping and I knew I had a decision to make, my life back home or this beautiful beast ... 
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Be sure to include descriptive language and scientific terms gleaned from the article in your entry.
        
Think about what the conditions in the Canadian Arctic might be like for an archeologist on a dig there.
        
Creativity is key when writing a narrative. How might you express yourself through the prompt?

Our ninth graders are participating in the Slice of Lifechallenge, a month-long blogging challenge hosted by Stacey Shubitz and Ruth Ayres of Twowritingteachers, which asks participants to write an entry each day about their everyday lives. During the challenge, students can either write about a part of their day or create a character for the challenge and write about their fictional day. Think about writing your own slices of life and sharing them with the challenge! You can read some of our students' entries on our blog.
 Any Day's Times: Using Our 'Cause and Effect' Organizer
 Common Core Standards: WHST 9, RI 10
 Directions: Many articles in any daily newspaper chart the ripple effects of big news events or societal trends. For instance, if you challenged yourself to find articles in this week's paper in some way related to the effects of the Great Recession, you would quickly find articles like this one,this one or even this one, a review of a book about the financial crisis headlined "Cause(s) and Effect(s)."
Try the exercise by reading the paper through the lens of environmental issues, and looking for causes and effects related to wildlife, climate, the food supply, energy demands and other issues. For instance, how might you create a cause-and-effect map or web with information and questions related to these recent articles?

        
Global Temperatures Highest in 4,000 Years

HEADLINE: A Dangerous 'New Normal' in College Debt

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW. 
Joe Nocera will appear in Sunday Review this weekend.

 BODY:
We are reaching a crisis point in this country's higher education system.
As college tuitions rise and state and local funding for higher education falls -- along with median household incomes -- students are taking on staggering levels of debt. And many can't find jobs that pay well enough to quickly pay off the debt. This has long-term implications for our society and our economy, as that debt begins to affect when and if young people start families or enter the housing market.
The student debt crisis may become a dangerous ''new normal,'' according to a report this week by the nonprofit State Higher Education Executive Officers Association: 
''In the 'new normal,' retirement and health care costs simultaneously drive up the cost of higher education, and compete with education for limited public resources. The 'new normal' no longer expects to see a recovery of state support for higher education such as occurred repeatedly in the last half of the 20th century. The 'new normal' expects students and their families to continue to make increasingly greater financial sacrifices in order to complete a postsecondary education. The 'new normal' expects schools and colleges to find ways of increasing productivity and absorb ever-larger budget cuts, while increasing degree production without, we hope, compromising quality.''
In constant dollars, state and local educational appropriations per full-time student reached their high in 2001, at $8,670. In 2012, those appropriations fell by nearly one third, to just $5,896.
The cost of tuition, on the other hand, has increased dramatically. According to a September report by CNN Money: ''Over the past decade, average annual tuition for a year of community college has risen 40 percent to $3,122, according to the College Board, a nonprofit group that runs the SAT exam. At four-year public universities, the cost has risen 68 percent to $7,692 a year.''
Meanwhile, a September Census report shows, median household incomes fell by nearly 7 percent from 2001 to 2011. And there are now more Americans living in poverty than at any time since record-keeping began more than half a century ago.
This confluence of trends has led to higher borrowing by students.
An analysis last month by Donghoon Lee, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, found that ''student debt is the only kind of household debt that continued to rise through the Great Recession'' and is now the ''second largest balance after mortgage debt.''
According to Mr. Lee, student loan debt is fast approaching a trillion dollars, up from less than $400 billion in 2004, and both the number of borrowers and the average balance per borrower have ''increased by 70 percent between 2004 and 2012 (7 percent per year).''A September Pew Research Center report found that ''a record one-in-five households now owe student loan debt.''
That report also found that student loan debt as a share of household income was 24 percent for families in the lowest income quintile. That was at least twice the share of any other quintile.
As the report put it, ''The relative burden of student loan debt is greatest for households in the bottom fifth of the income spectrum, even though members of such households are less likely than those in other groups to attend college in the first place.''
And many of those graduates can't find work or are underemployed, and they struggle to pay back their own personal mountain of debt.
A January report from the Center for College Affordability and Productivity found that ''about 48 percent of employed U.S. college graduates are in jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests requires less than a four-year college education.'' That number included 37 percent in occupations requiring no more than a high school diploma.
For example, the report pointed out that ''in 1970, fewer than 1 percent of taxi drivers and 2 percent of firefighters had college degrees, while now more than 15 percent do in both jobs.''
And yet, this country needs a more knowledgeable work force to be competitive. While the number of college graduates in America is increasing, that number is growing even faster in some other countries. And, as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development noted in 2011, ''The U.S. is the only country where attainment levels among those just entering the labor market (25- to 34-year-olds) do not exceed those about to leave the labor market (55- to 64-year-olds).''
Our national educational aspirations and the debt crisis that they're creating are colliding. We are on an unsustainable track. This will not end well.

HEADLINE: A Long Road Back for the Dow Industrials

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
MORE than five years after the stock market began to slide in the fall of 2007, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered all of the ground lost in the recession and rose to new highs this week.
The Dow, the American market barometer with the longest history, has recorded only four longer periods in which the market was unable to set a new high. It came nowhere near, of course, the quarter-century it took the market to recover all of the ground lost in the Great Depression, but in magnitude it was second only to that fall among long-lasting declines.
At the worst, almost exactly four years ago, the Dow was down 54 percent from its closing price on Oct. 9, 2007. While that was nowhere near the 89 percent disaster seen during the Depression, it exceeded the 47 percent fall after the 1919 peak and the 46 percent plunge after the 1973 high. 
All of those figures are in nominal dollars, excluding the effect of inflation. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the Dow remains nearly 10 percent below its 2007 level when adjusted for changes in consumer prices. That peak, too, was a little lower than the 2000 high when adjusted for prices. So on an inflation-adjusted basis, the market is still below where it was 13 years ago.
The Dow contains 30 stocks at any given time, but S&P Dow Jones Indexes, which now manages the index, periodically removes companies and replaces them with others. The accompanying charts list the performance of the 36 stocks that were in the Dow over some part of the period since 2007.
The one that many readers will not recognize is Mondelez. It was known as Kraft Foods when it replaced the American International Group, the disgraced and bailed-out insurance company, in the index in 2008. But last year, Kraft split up and was taken out of the index. There is still a company called Kraft, which sells products in North American grocery stores, but Mondelez is the larger part, selling snack foods around the globe.
Mondelez, by whatever name, is one of seven Dow companies that outperformed the index both on the way down -- from Oct. 9, 2007, through March 9, 2009 -- and on the way back, through Tuesday, when the index first closed over its 2007 peak. The charts end on that day. The others are Altria, I.B.M., Home Depot, Travelers, Pfizer and United Technologies.
Altria, the tobacco company, was kicked out of the index in 2008. Had it stayed, it would have been the best-performing Dow company from peak to peak, gaining 117 percent. Among the companies now in the index, Home Depot was the best performer, with a 108 percent gain.
The charts show the large benefits, and large risks, available to those who speculate in stocks that have lost nearly all their value. Four of the companies -- Bank of America, General Motors, Citigroup and A.I.G. -- were off more than 90 percent when the market hit bottom. Three of them have since tripled or better. The fourth, General Motors, continued to fall, and the old shares became worthless after the company went through bankruptcy. The current G.M. shares went to creditors of the old company, not to shareholders.
Percentage gains from very low levels can be deceptive, however. A.I.G. is up more than 500 percent over the last four years, but it is still 97 percent lower than it was when the market peaked in 2007. Similarly, Citigroup is down 90 percent, and Bank of America is off 78 percent.
Four Dow stocks did worse than the index on the way down and also on the way up. Besides General Motors, they are Alcoa, Cisco and Merck.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: A Dow Record, if You Ignore Inflation: The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks rose to a new record this week, but is still below its 2000 and 2007 highs when adjusted for inflation. The chart at top left shows the percentage change in the index since the 2007 high, on Oct. 9. The charts end on Tuesday, when the index first closed over the 2007 high. The decline after 2007 was one of the longest, and one of the deepest, the Dow has experienced.

HEADLINE: Are We Standing at the End of Times or Before an Intoxicating Dawn?

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

 BODY:
LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA -- This foolish, callous world of ours is en route to hell. Or this is the best the world has ever been.
One of the stranger features of our time is the jousting and mingling of these two rhetorics. You hear them so often that you can forget how extreme and contradictory they are.
Europe and the United States as we know them -- and, ergo, civilization itself -- are toast. The ecosystem is falling apart. Your texting children will grow up illiterate. China's sky will soon be rotating among 50 shades of black. The middle class? Finished. 
Oh, but: We live in glorious new times in which an illiterate, malnourished African child can text-message her way to democracy; upload her version of the ''Harlem Shake'' to YouTube on that smartphone she hopefully owns and become a viral star; and perhaps even avail of that 3-D printer in her refugee camp and finally make those toys her parents never could buy her.
Each of these rhetorics must be taken with a truckload of salt. But it is true that this is simultaneously a time of real fecundity and real withering, of astonishing innovation and unbelievable breakdown, of great gains that so often fail to make ordinary lives less grinding and bleak.
To spend a few days ricocheting between these rhetorics, attend the annual TED conference -- it stands for technology, entertainment and design -- which this year served up a heady stew of claims that the world either is going to the dogs or is awesome squared.
It began, aptly enough, with a debate between two men about whether human progress was over or perhaps just getting started. The scary thing was, both made a compelling case.
Robert J. Gordon, an economist, depressed everyone with a ''progress is over'' sermon. His bottom line: The kinds of things we innovate and celebrate today, like apps and thinner phones, cannot compete with previous generations of innovations for their capacity to improve human living: the discovery of electric lights, for instance, or of refrigeration, elevators, cars and washing machines. Thus, genuine progress is leveling off and, with it, growth.
Erik Brynjolfsson quickly marched onstage to inform us that Mr. Gordon was all wrong. The next wave of inventions will make the last waves seem childish. It's a new dawn in which we can measure almost anything, in which ideas can be shared for free, in which people around the world can self-organize and solve problems without the help of big institutions. Progress!
If you came suspecting that this technology thing was ruining the world, there was much fodder for you. A technologist named Danny Hillis warned that the very smart Internet was never designed to power very dumb things like your light bulbs and your thermostats -- and that using it for more and more such things exposes us all to the risk of catastrophic system meltdowns. Others argued that technology was privileging headwork over other labor and would leave all but the most brilliant behind. That the new corporate-built, technology-greased cities we are creating will lack soul. That we're all going to be badly hacked unless we wake up. That technology once seemed poised to take us all on regular moon trips, and instead all we got was Facebook.
And then, just as you were about to get sad, you would hear that 3-D printing is going to revolutionize the revolution, turning all of us into makers. That blind people can now get shoes installed with GPS and a haptic feedback system, so that their shoes can navigate them. That there is a new way to create credit scores for the world's millions of unbanked people. That robots, rather than displacing workers, will soon work alongside them, turning humans into robot trainers. That paper posters can somehow be turned into electronic touch screens. That someone has figured out how to make cheap, Ikea-like kits for the assembly of whole houses. That we're at the outset of a new solar energy boom. That underground fission will make solar seem like amateur hour.
Sometimes, the utopians at TED grow so removed from the doom crowd that they propose solutions to problems that aren't really problems, like how the Internet is presently confined to human beings.
''We should not restrict this network to one species,'' Vinton G. Cerf, one of the pioneers of the Internet, said in introducing a new initiative -- the Interspecies Internet.
And so it went. An age of ''technological unemployment'' awaits, but -- Bono informed us -- extreme poverty could soon be behind us. The music business as we know it could end, but so could global health pandemics. Corrupt money is strangling U.S. politics, but never fear: We can bypass the U.S. government, raise virtuous money and incent states to make reforms with private, rather than public, cash.
What makes this time of ours so peculiar is that both of these visions contain truth. It's hard to think of a comparable period in history in which the rhetoric of end times so effortlessly danced with the rhetoric of an intoxicating dawn. So which will it be?

HEADLINE: China Posts Surprising 22% Surge in Exports

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Chinese exports soared beyond forecasts to rise by a fifth in February from the level of a year ago, data from China's General Administration of Customs showed Friday, a sign that the country's modest economic revival is intact and a suggestion that global demand might also be on the mend. 
Chinese imports, however, were surprisingly weak, falling 15.2 percent from a year earlier to a 13-month low, the customs data showed.
Exports rose 21.8 percent in February from a year earlier. A Reuters poll of 22 economists had forecast that February exports would grow 10.1 percent, while imports would fall 8.8 percent. Export growth to the United States was the strongest in a year, and export growth to the euro zone the strongest in 18 months.
The strength in China's exports is apparent when the January and February performances are combined, to remove distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday -- which came in January this year but was in February last year -- when many factories are shut. Customs data on the two months combined showed exports rising 23.6 percent from the same period last year, while imports increased 5 percent. Analysts expected a 17.6 percent increase in exports and 10 percent growth in imports.
Chen Deming, the Chinese commerce minister, said Friday that he was hopeful that the country's export sales would improve this year. ''I myself am optimistic that trade growth will exceed last year's 6.2 percent,'' he said, without giving a forecast. He was speaking on the sidelines of China's legislative session.
The buoyant Chinese exports contrast with sluggish growth in South Korea and Taiwan, two other trade bellwethers, casting doubt on the strength of any pickup in global demand. South Korean exports fell 8.6 percent last month, and shipments from Taiwan dropped by 15.8 percent.
Zhang Zhiwei, an economist at Nomura, said the inconsistency might be explained by capital inflows. Chinese exporters might be overstating export revenues, while importers might be underreporting their trade to try to get around strict Chinese capital controls and bring money into the country. ''Reported exports may be higher than they actually are,'' Mr. Zhang said.
Still, on balance, most analysts were upbeat about the trade data, suggesting the figures indicated that a modest pickup in growth during the fourth quarter of 2012 had extended into 2013.
The stronger export figures were also supported by comments from Ningbo Port Group, one of the largest port operators in China. It is based in the Yangtze River Delta manufacturing hub.
''Our data in the first two months shows the foreign trade situation is improving,'' Ningbo's chairman, Li Linghong, said before the trade data's release. Ningbo Port's container volumes rose 13.6 percent in January and February from a year earlier, while cargo volumes increased 12.4 percent, Mr. Li said. ''Usually the first two months are a peak season for companies to deliver orders, but it still shows the demand from the international market,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Dips To Four-Year Low; 236,000 Jobs Added

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
The economy picked up speed in February, creating jobs at a pace that would substantially lower the unemployment rate. But Washington could put a stop to that.
Even as analysts hailed a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday that pointed to an acceleration in growth, they warned that stronger employment gains are being put at risk by sequestration, the automatic spending cuts being imposed by the federal government.
''They're doing their best to get in the way,'' Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, said of lawmakers and other officials. ''But the good news is that the economy is carrying plenty of momentum going into sequestration.''
The Labor Department reported that the economy added 236,000 jobs in February as the unemployment rate sank to 7.7 percent, down from 7.9 percent in January and the lowest level since December 2008. 
Wall Street expected no more than 165,000 additional jobs in February, and the surprise helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average to another new nominal record, its fourth for the week. It closed at 14,397.07.
But many experts said if it were not for political gridlock in Washington, which led to the automatic spending reductions on March 1, the performance of the job market and the broader economy would be even more robust in the months ahead.
''It does suggest a bit more cushion heading into the spring, when we will see the bulk of the impact from the sequester and fiscal pullback,'' said Michelle Meyer, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''This was a good report. It's hard to poke holes in it. But we think we'll see some slowdown in April and May because of the sequester.''
Mr. Gault estimated that the economy would achieve a 1.5 percent growth rate in the first half of 2013. Without the spending cuts and a rise in Social Security taxes that went into effect in January, he said, the economy would probably advance at double that pace.
As a result, he and other economists expected that the pace of job creation would slow, leaving the unemployment rate not much lower than where it is now. If jobs were added at February's pace for the rest of 2013, the unemployment rate would crack the closely watched 7 percent level by the end of the year. Instead, Ms. Meyer predicted that unemployment would remain near 7.5 percent.
Macroeconomic Advisers, an independent forecasting firm, predicted that the federal spending cuts would cost about 700,000 jobs this year, with most of the damage occurring in the second and third quarters.
While the economy is expected to continue to add enough jobs to keep the jobless rate from rising significantly, estimates like these suggest that without the drag from Washington the labor market might have added, on average, a robust 300,000 jobs a month or so.
The data for February, adjusted for normal seasonal variations, do not reflect the federal cuts, which are expected to affect not just government jobs but also industries that rely on public spending.
Public sector employment continued a long decline, with the number of state and local government workers falling by 10,000 in February. Over all, there are now 366,000 fewer government workers in the United States than there were two years ago.
On Friday, the White House was quick to point to the new data as a sign that the economy is strengthening even as it warned of the impact from the squeeze on spending.
''The recovery is gaining traction,'' said Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. But the sequestration, he said, ''is an unnecessary headwind. It's something that will slow the expansion. We're poised for stronger growth if we don't get in the way with misguided fiscal policy.''
In some respects, the rest of the year is shaping up as a tug of war between a strengthening private sector and federal austerity.
Private hiring last month was broad-based, with healthy job gains in several areas, including business services and manufacturing.
The increase in construction was especially strong, with 48,000 more jobs, a sign that the recovery in the housing market was beginning to translate into new jobs. Hours worked were up and wages advanced as well.
Not everything in the picture was brighter, however. One cause for concern was the continued shrinkage of the labor force, which had 130,000 fewer workers in February.
Some of that was because of retirements, but another factor was discouraged workers who dropped out of the work force.
The labor participation rate sank to 63.5 percent, a low for the current economic cycle.
Republicans said Friday's report was a welcome development but noted that the unemployment rate remained high by modern standards.
''Today's jobs report brings good news for those who have returned to the work force, and we celebrate that,'' said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
''But we must recognize that America must do better than 7.7 percent unemployment. There is still more work to be done.''
John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, echoed Mr. Priebus, and said that the government's large budget deficits posed economic risks of their own.
''Any job creation is positive news, but the fact is unemployment in America is still way above the levels the Obama White House projected when the trillion-dollar stimulus spending bill was enacted,'' he said. ''And the federal government's ongoing spending binge has resulted in a debt that exceeds the size of our entire economy.''
At 7.7 percent, unemployment is still more than a percentage point above the level at which the Federal Reserve said it would reconsider efforts to stimulate the economy by keeping interest rates ultralow and buying up tens of billions in financial assets each month.
''The report is not a game-changer for the Fed,'' said Julia Coronado, chief North American economist at BNP Paribas. ''The labor market is clearly moving in the right direction, although it is a slow improvement.''
Still, Friday's report gave Dan Haney a shot in the arm.
''I was all psyched this morning,'' said Mr. Haney, a Philadelphia resident who lost his job as a customer service representative for Express Scripts two years ago.
Later this month, Mr. Haney has a job interview for a position as a union organizer, and he said he felt encouraged by signs employers were beginning to hire again.
''At this point, I have to take what comes down the pike,'' said Mr. Haney, who is 54. ''I'm on the computer every day looking for jobs.''
A high school graduate, Mr. Haney has some computer training but lacks a college degree, which has made finding a job all the more difficult. ''Some of these entry-level jobs say college is preferred,'' Mr. Haney said. ''Why do you need a college degree to answer a phone?''
The gulf between workers with a bachelor's degree and the rest of the population remains vast: unemployment among college graduates was 3.8 percent, half the overall rate.
But in an encouraging sign for people like Mr. Haney, the jobless rate for high school graduates dropped to 7.9 percent from 8.1 percent.
''This was definitely a strong report,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs.
''But we've had strong unemployment reports before in this recovery that weren't sustained.''

HEADLINE: Dwindling Production Has Led to Lesser Role for Venezuela as Major Oil Power

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- President Hugo Chávez relished using Venezuela's oil wealth to project power internationally, nudging OPEC to raise oil prices when he could, showering allies like Cuba and Nicaragua with subsidized oil shipments, and mocking the United States while selling it his crude.
But Mr. Chávez's death on Tuesday has had surprisingly little impact on global oil markets, highlighting how Venezuela's dwindling crude production and exports have undercut its global power in recent years. 
International oil prices have barely moved since Mr. Chávez died. OPEC has decided to increase shipments to the United States and Europe this month, using oil from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Oil company executives, long frustrated by Mr. Chávez's nationalizations, are voicing only tepid hopes that they could possibly return in full force to what was once one of their crown jewels.
Venezuela's annual oil production has declined since Mr. Chávez took office in 1999 by roughly a quarter, and oil exports have dropped by nearly a half, a major economic threat to a country that depends on oil for 95 percent of its exports and 45 percent of its federal budget revenues.
''Venezuela's clout on OPEC and on world oil prices has been greatly diminished because of its inability to exploit its enormous resources,'' said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consultancy. ''In the 1990s, their production was booming and they could thumb their nose at Saudi Arabia and get away with it, but now they have become OPEC's poor cousin.''
In a fundamental geopolitical turn, Venezuela now relies far more on the United States than the United States relies on Venezuela.
Venezuela depends on the United States to buy 40 percent of its exports because Gulf of Mexico refineries were designed to process low-quality Venezuelan and Mexican crudes that most refineries around the world cannot easily handle. But in recent years, the United States has been replacing its imports of Latin American crudes with oil from Canadian oil sands fields, which is similarly heavy.
American imports of Venezuelan oil have declined to just under a million barrels a day, from 1.7 million barrels a day in 1997, according to the Energy Department. And while Venezuelan exports of oil are in decline, its dependency on American refineries for refined petroleum products has grown to nearly 200,000 barrels a day because of several recent Venezuelan refinery accidents.
Experts expect Venezuela to send barrels no longer needed in the United States to China, as payments in kind under oil-for-loans contracts. Venezuela's broken refinery sector has left shortages of gasoline and diesel in parts of Latin America, opening the door for valuable markets to American refiners.
Over his 14 years in power, Mr. Chávez relied heavily on oil revenues to finance his social programs. Energy experts say his gasoline subsidies doubled domestic consumption, cutting deeply into exports, but that his hostility to foreign investment and mismanagement of the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela were the primary reasons for the steep decline in production.
A strike and the firing of management talent and 20,000 workers at the oil company in 2002 led to a steep decline in the company, which has been underscored by the refinery accidents.
''Venezuela is a fraction of what it used to be,'' said Sadad Ibrahim al-Husseini, a former head of Saudi Aramco's exploration and production division, ''and that's really because Venezuela's technocrats have scattered over the world and are no longer active in Venezuela.''
Mr. Chávez further overhauled oil exploration and production with a nationalization program in 2006 that ordered a renegotiation of contracts with foreign companies, mandating that Venezuela's oil company get a minimum 60 percent share in all production projects. Sixteen foreign companies, including Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron, went along with the new rules, while Exxon Mobil, Conoco Philips and other companies resisted, and their holdings were nationalized.
Venezuela has huge reserves, including its Orinoco heavy oil belt, which the United States Geological Survey estimates to have 513 billion barrels of recoverable oil -- enough potentially to make Venezuela one of the top three world producers. But foreign oil companies have been wary of investing.
Jose Valera, a Houston energy lawyer, said that if Nicolás Maduro, Mr. Chávez's vice president until he was sworn in as president on Friday, or another member of the Mr. Chávez's movement was elected president in a special election ''it is reasonable to expect continuity of a substantial portion of the policies.'' But as for Venezuela's economy, he argued, ''the situation right now is not sustainable and it's only a matter of time before some significant changes will have to be instituted.''

HEADLINE: Rational Decisions And Heartbreak On School Closings

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and JON HURDLE

 BODY:
When it comes to school closings, the arguments may make sense on paper, but the reality is much messier.
At University City High in Philadelphia on Friday, staff members and students were trying to absorb the decision by a state commission to close the school along with 22 others in the city.
At an often-heated and sometimes tearful hearing on Thursday night where 19 protesters, including Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, were arrested, school district officials said they needed to shut down schools to close a gaping budget hole. 
''In my heart, I didn't want to accept it,'' said Glen Casey, 18, a senior, at the end of the school day Friday. ''It broke my heart, it hit me hard.''
Wrenching though the decision was, William R. Hite Jr., the superintendent, said it was simply a matter of math in a district where more than a quarter of the schools' 195,000 seats are now empty.
Dr. Hite said in an interview that at University City, with low academic performance and only 20 percent of its seats filled, ''it's just not a sound fiscal decision to have those students remain in that program.'' Over all, the district said the school closings in Philadelphia would ease a budget deficit of $1.35 billion over five years.
Around the country, districts including Chicago, Newark and Washington have been echoing that rationale, with officials citing budget gaps as they draw up lists of schools to close at the end of the school year. District officials also say they need to close underperforming schools so that students can move to schools where they have a better chance of succeeding.
But critics say that while the spreadsheets or test scores might say one thing, even lower-performing, underused schools can serve as refuges in communities that have little else.
''The school is one of the foundations of the community,'' said Rosemarie Hatcher, president of the Philadelphia Home and School Council, which represents local home and school associations. ''It's like a village. The schools know our kids and they look out for our kids.''
In emotional speeches on Thursday night to Philadelphia's School Reform Commission, more than 30 teachers, students and parents said that children at schools scheduled for closing would have to walk long distances through dangerous neighborhoods to reach their new schools, some of which have poor records on academics, discipline and safety.
''There is no need to penalize the families in Germantown,'' said Dr. George Schuler, a 1963 graduate of Germantown High School in northwest Philadelphia. ''Students need to be able to attend a local school.'' The commission voted 4-to-1 to close the school.
School closings fall disproportionately on poor and minority neighborhoods. ''These school closings have been happening in communities that were already destabilized by the dismantling of public housing, by gentrification and effects of the economic crisis,'' said Pauline Lipman, professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
In Chicago, where about 100 schools have been closed since 2001, Professor Lipman said that all but two were in low-income communities, and that 88 percent of the students affected were African-American.
Advocacy groups in a number of cities have made similar complaints. According to Daren Briscoe, a spokesman for the Department of Education, the department's Office of Civil Rights is investigating 33 complaints related to school closings in 29 districts across 22 states. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, districts closed 1,929 schools in 2010-11, the last year for which data is available.
Mr. Briscoe said that since October 2010, when the Office of Civil Rights first started tracking school-closing cases separately, the department has completed 27 investigations without finding any violations.
In Chicago, a commission set up to evaluate school closings said this week that the district could close or overhaul up to 80 schools next year. Becky Carroll, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Public Schools, said that even without a projected $1 billion deficit for the 2013-14 school year, ''we can no longer afford to keep throwing money at half-empty dilapidated buildings as it's stretching our resources too thin.''
Underused schools ''are often deprived of the resources they need to provide children with a high-quality education,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''By combining schools we can redirect resources to all schools so they can use the dollars to invest in supports that can help children thrive in the classroom: computer labs, libraries, specialized individual support, art and music,'' she said.
At Willa Cather Elementary School in the Garfield Park neighborhood of Chicago, the principal, Hattie B. King, said that the school's second floor was now empty and that 250 students filled about half of the school's available seats.
''We have to focus all of our dollars on the bare necessities,'' Ms. King said. ''Whereas if we had additional dollars coming in we could pick up some of the things like after-school programs that focus on the arts and music.''
But Ms. King said that part of the reason enrollment had declined at the half-century-old school was that charter schools had been sprouting up in the neighborhood and siphoning students away, even though Willa Cather is a school where more than 80 percent of students achieved an above-proficient level on end-of-year state tests in reading, math and science last year.
Competition from charter schools is part of the story in many cities. In Philadelphia, for example, 23 percent of students were attending charter schools in the 2011-12 school year, up from 12 percent in 2004-5, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Nathan Saunders, president of the teachers' union in Washington, where the district has announced plans to close 15 schools by the end of the 2013-14 year, said, ''What appears to be lack of interest in traditional neighborhood public education is in fact the result of new options being offered.'' He said there was little evidence that charter schools performed better than traditional schools.
And when students from closed schools are transferred to others, they may face violence at receiving schools, said Jitu Brown, education organizer for the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization in Chicago.
There is also little evidence that students are actually moved to better schools. In Chicago, one study of school closings from 2001 to 2006 found that 40 percent of the students simply re-enrolled in schools that were academically weak, and only 6 percent of displaced students moved to high-performing schools.

HEADLINE: A Small Stable's Bridge to the Derby

BYLINE: By KATIE LAMB

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- The bloodlines that are part of the Kentucky Derby contender Verrazano's story run deep, and not just with the horses.
As brothers-in-law and managing partners of the racing syndicate Let's Go Stable, Kevin Scatuorchio and Bryan Sullivan are co-owners of Verrazano, one of the most respected horses on the Derby trail.
Verrazano won his racing debut on Jan. 1 at Gulfstream Park in Florida by seven and three-quarter lengths, then followed with a jaw-dropping 16 ¼-length romp at the track on Feb. 2. 
His wins have left horseplayers and reporters in awe, but his connections, who include the leading trainer Todd Pletcher, had seen what Scatuorchio calls ''brilliancy'' during many morning workouts, so the performances came as no surprise.
''When he tells you that they're really, really good, you can take it to the bank that they must have some sort of talent because he's just surrounded by it,'' Sullivan said of Pletcher. ''But when he started using some of the superlatives to describe this horse, Kevin and I were like, 'Did he just say that?' ''
Verrazano also caught the eye of Coolmore, Ireland's most influential horse owner and breeder group, which also owns farms in Kentucky and Australia. With an eye on his future as a stallion, Coolmore bought a share of the colt after his second victory.
Verrazano will make his stakes debut in Saturday's mile-and-a-sixteenth Tampa Bay Derby, the next step toward earning one of 20 spots in the starting gate at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May.
Sullivan is married to Scatuorchio's sister, Courtney, and Verrazano's half-brother, El Padrino, finished 13th in last year's Derby for the stable. El Padrino and Verrazano, both bred by Emory Hamilton in Kentucky, were born to the same dam, Enchanted Rock. Verrazano's sire is the speedy More Than Ready.
Pletcher also helps the Let's Go team select prospects, but he did not immediately fall in love with Verrazano, who was purchased for $250,000 at the 2011 Keeneland September yearling sale and named after the bridge that connects Staten Island and Brooklyn. He was larger than most More Than Ready yearlings, and the colt's laid-back attitude did not impress Pletcher, who looks for horses with competitive instincts and swagger.
But after a second look, Pletcher saw potential and a pedigree that he had faith in.
''He's a big, imposing, good-looking horse,'' Pletcher said. ''He's a son of More Than Ready, and we've had a lot of success with him and his offspring. And the fact that's he's a half-brother to El Padrino, it became a no-brainer at that point.''
More Than Ready, also trained by Pletcher, had an impressive juvenile season in 1999, winning his first five starts. He ran in the 2000 Kentucky Derby, finishing fourth, and won the Grade I King's Bishop that year in Saratoga. His success has carried over to the breeding shed, where he has produced more than 20 graded-stakes winners.
''It's very exciting the sort of promise he's had in the first couple of starts, when it's a horse that you're involved in the process of picking out at the yearling sale, by a sire that was key in getting my career started,'' Pletcher said. ''All those things make it extra special.''
More Than Ready did not just ignite Pletcher's career; he was also instrumental in Let's Go Stable's story: he was owned by Scatuorchio's father, Jim.
The younger Scatuorchio and Sullivan, who both live in New Jersey and started Let's Go Stable in 2006, are the next generation.
''It's a full-time job, it's a family business,'' said Sullivan, who left his job dealing hedge funds on Wall Street for a career involving horses.
Let's Go Stable had some early success with the filly Glacken's Gal and a son of More Than Ready named Ready's Echo, who finished third in the 2008 Belmont Stakes and second in the 2009 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. But there have been lean years -- for example, when the market took a dip, Sullivan said.
The partnership is still small, with only seven horses, but it is still helping its investors reach racing heights that most owners can only dream about.
''It's validating for our company,'' Scatuorchio said. ''It's extremely difficult to get a horse to the Derby and to do it two years in a row, and do it the right way, with the right horses. I'm thrilled with the work that we've done.''
One of the stable's clients is Joe Castle, an investment banker in New York and family friend of Sullivan who has been a part of Let's Go since the beginning. A self-proclaimed numbers guy, he fell in love with the game as a teenager at his local track Monmouth Park.
Castle rode out the recession with Let's Go Stable, and he knows what it is like to face the fact that sometimes expensive horses just cannot run. But he also knows what it is like to reach the sport's biggest stage, with El Padrino.
''Waking up in the morning and saying you've got a shot to win the Kentucky Derby, it's a pretty good feeling when you're sitting with a bunch of your best friends,'' he said.
And Castle hopes to experience that again. Before he can, Verrazano must prove he can go two turns against stakes company on Tampa Bay Downs's grueling track Saturday.
But for as long as he is on the road to the Kentucky Derby, he is enjoying the ride.
''We're already a winner with the horse,'' he said. ''Financially we're a winner, and we're already a winner because we're talking about going to the Derby. Now, the thing is, will he take us there?''

HEADLINE: Off the Path to Recovery

 BODY:
The February employment report shows some notable improvements that, if sustained, would herald a real recovery. Partly boosted by increased employment in the construction industry, the number of new jobs jumped to 236,000 last month, continuing a gradual upward trend. 
Unfortunately, there are many reasons to believe that the improvements will not be sustained. If Congressional Republicans have their way -- insisting that all deficit reduction be achieved by spending less without any tax increases -- the automatic cuts that began on March 1 will continue. That will cost the economy an estimated 750,000 jobs by the end of this year and reduce economic growth by about half a percentage point.
To absorb those blows, the economy would have to post strong growth despite the budget cutbacks. Lately, however, economic growth has been anemic, and it is hard to see where renewed growth will come from.
Housing? Car sales? Probably not. If job growth stalls, the housing market also could stall, as its resurgence has generally followed, not led, the job market. Ditto for car sales.
The stock market? Again, probably not. The rising stock market is largely attributable to monetary stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve, which buy time for the economy to recover but are not a cure-all for slow growth. That is especially true at times, such as now, when fiscal policy, by emphasizing budget cutbacks, is working at cross purposes to the Fed.
Rising wages? Certainly not. With millions of people still out of work, employers face little pressure to give raises, even as productivity gains allow them to increase profits. The result is increasing inequality. As a percentage of national income, corporate profits recently stood at their largest share at any time since 1950, while the portion of income that flows to employees was near its lowest point in nearly 50 years.
It is true that the unemployment rate has headed down, from 8.3 percent a year ago to 7.7 percent last month. But most of the decline reflects a shrinking labor force rather than new hiring. In fact, if hiring were more robust, the unemployment rate would hold steady or even rise as an estimated four million Americans who are not working or looking for work rejoined the ranks of job seekers, where they would be counted in the official unemployment rate. Worse, the share of unemployed workers who have been out of work for more than six months actually increased last month, from 38.1 percent in January to 40.2 percent, a ruinous situation for millions of families.
Nor is unemployment confined to the unskilled and undereducated. The jobless rate of workers with college degrees is still substantially higher than before the recession. For college-educated workers under age 25, the jobless rate has averaged 8.1 percent over the past year, compared with 5.4 percent in 2007, before the recession. For for those over age 25, it was 3.8 percent in February, compared with 2 percent before the recession. That is a strong indication that unemployment is elevated not because workers are unskilled, but because there is still not enough consumer demand to make hiring worthwhile.
Without adequate demand, there will be no upsurge in business investment. The Fed cannot turn things around on its own. And the automatic budget cuts, on top of it all, will only make things worse.

HEADLINE: Congress Gets in the Way

 BODY:
If there is any hope for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear dispute with Iran, President Obama needs Congress to support negotiations. But negotiations and compromise are largely anathema in Washington, with many lawmakers insisting that any deal with Iran would be unacceptable -- a stance that would make military action by Israel and the United States far more likely. 
Last week, just as Iran and the major powers made some small progress in talks and agreed to meet again, two measures were introduced in Congress that could harm negotiations.
One is a Senate resolution sponsored by Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican. It says that if Israel ''is compelled to take military action in self-defense, the United States government should stand with Israel and provide diplomatic, military and economic support to the government of Israel in its defense of its territory, people and existence.'' No one doubts that the United States would defend Israel if it was attacked by Iran; that commitment has been made repeatedly by President Obama and his predecessors. The nonbinding resolution, promoted by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group, would not authorize any specific action, but it would increase political pressure on Mr. Obama by putting Congress on record as backing a military operation initiated by Israel at a time of Israel's choosing. It could also hamper negotiations by playing into Iranian fears that America's true intention is to promote regime change.
The second measure, a bipartisan bill, would pile on tougher sanctions just as the two sides are trying to create trust after decades of hostility. The bill would further restrict business dealings with Iran, widen the list of blacklisted Iranian companies and individuals, and potentially block Iran's access to foreign bank assets held in euros. It could unravel the international coalition against Iran by penalizing countries -- like Turkey, India, South Korea and China -- that have not done enough to enforce sanctions.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told the annual Aipac conference this week that there must be a ''credible military threat'' against Iran. Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. also assured the group that Mr. Obama would use force if needed.
The best way to avert military conflict is by negotiating a credible, verifiable agreement. It is a very long shot. But Congress needs to give the talks time to play out and not make diplomatic efforts even harder.

HEADLINE: Money Advice for People in Boom-or-Bust Fields

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
MORE financial advisers are focusing on a single clientele, say, doctors or athletes. That would seem to make sense, since concentrating on a single group of people gives advisers greater insight into the needs of those people. And if the advisers do a good job, they will get that client's colleagues as clients.
Advisers can, of course, organize their practices in other ways. Many focus on a dollar amount. They promise to give good advice to any client with more than $1 million, $5 million or more, regardless of where that money came from. By taking this tack, they are also eliminating the need to have more, less wealthy clients.
And some advisers organize a practice around a life event, like retirement or divorce. But what does a divorced woman with three young children and a deadbeat former husband have in common with Elaine Wynn, who received nearly $1 billion when she divorced Steve Wynn, the casino mogul? 
Still, is managing money for a group of lawyers, say, any different from managing money for another high earner? A dollar is a dollar, after all. Or is it just a way for advisers to market themselves?
''To the adviser, the benefit is he is not having to continue to reinvent himself,'' said Mindy Diamond, president and chief executive of Diamond Consultants, a firm that recruits advisers. ''It creates economies of scale and a more effective deployment of resources when the adviser is focused. It also creates a steady stream of clients.''
Ms. Diamond said clients benefited as well. ''You're not paying for him to figure out a situation, because he's done it before,'' she said. ''He has insights into your fears and challenges. It creates an atmosphere of customized service. Typically, they'll have superior knowledge versus the generalist because they speak the language.''
While being comfortable with an adviser is important, what ultimately matters is the quality of advice. Is it true that different professions have certain tendencies as a group, both good and bad, that could benefit from being managed? It turns out that they do.
This week, I'm going to look at some highfliers whose income can rise to unbelievable levels one year and all but disappear the next -- in this case, people in the oil and gas business and professional athletes. Next week, I'm planning to look at executives in Silicon Valley and in real estate whose wealth is predicated on a volatile asset: the company they are building and hope to sell before interest dries up. And last, I'll look at the slow but steady earners: doctors and lawyers.
In all of them, I have found behavioral tendencies that may frustrate their advisers but that the rest of us can use to make better decisions.
RIDING OUT BOOMS AND BUSTS To say wealth in West Texas and other oil and gas regions is cyclical is putting it mildly. Booms and busts go with the business.
Jay Reynolds, president and chief executive of Rod Ric Drilling in Midland, Tex., followed his father into the oil and gas business. But when he struck out on his own, he got a lesson in the fickleness of the business. He borrowed heavily to buy Rod Ric Drilling in 1980 and then watched for nearly two decades as demand for drilling equipment for oil and gas fields fell or remained below what it had been. Over that time, the bank he borrowed from failed, and he worried that his loan would be called.
''We were able to get through those years by being very careful with what we did and how we did it,'' Mr. Reynolds, 56, said. ''These recent years have been a surprise. Hydraulic fracturing has brought these fields to life.''
What he learned from the experience was the need to manage cash and the benefit of diversifying sources of income as well as investments. He said he has been buying real estate recently with an eye toward mineral rights and royalties, which could be a source of income.
Mr. Reynolds said he had balanced the high risk in this business by taking less risk in his investment portfolio -- an approach anyone with a volatile or lumpy income could benefit from.
''Our clients' businesses are so capital-intensive that they could easily sink all their net worth into their business,'' said Dane E. Crunk, co-founder and managing director of Syntal Capital Partners, which works primarily with oil and gas clients like Mr. Reynolds. ''When they're bringing capital to us, it's not for rates of return. It's seeking diversification away from their core business and preservation of capital.''
Mr. Crunk said his firm worked to keep some money safe, creating a modern rainy day fund. That idea is often overlooked in the oil and gas business and beyond.
''I learned early that things can change in a very unexpected way,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''When things get better, they get better very quickly. But there is a downside. Out here, you don't bet the farm.''
HANDLING A WINDFALL While people who go lose it all in the oil business could make it all back in the next boom, most athletes have just one windfall in their lives. There are all too many stories about athletes spending a lifetime's worth of income in just a few years and having no idea where it went.
Advisers said one of their big problems was persuading clients that they could be in that spot. ''Everyone thinks it's not going to be their problem,'' said Frank Zecca, a senior vice president at Octagon Financial Services, whose clients include the Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps and the former basketball great Moses Malone. ''I talk to them about how they're going to need the money to last a long time.''
Spending everything they make and more can be a problem. To deal with that, Mr. Zecca said, he adopted a strategy a few years ago from the mental accounting playbook. Instead of nagging clients about buying foolish things, which he did for years to no avail, he persuades them to invest a certain percentage of their income every payday and then sets goals for them.
''We allow them to spend money on things that are commensurate with the money they're making,'' Mr. Zecca said. ''When they make it out of the minors, they buy their watch. When they sign a new contract, that's when they buy their car. When they get their long-term contract, that's when they buy their parents a house.''
While this may sound like that old-fashioned concept of delaying gratification, he said it had worked incredibly well with his clients. They are goal-oriented, and spending targets give them something to aim for.
Now, he said, he no longer cares about what they are buying with the money that is left. ''What do we care if they're buying 10 $1,000 suits or one $10,000 watch?'' he asked.
Athletes also have to deal with the issue of a second career. Many want to be sports analysts or coaches, but those jobs are few, and they rarely pay as well as being a professional athlete.
''They're in a lifestyle that they'll never be able to maintain once their career is over,'' said Ron Rubin, managing principal at Bridgewater Wealth and Financial Management, whose clients include Dan Jansen, the Olympic speed skater, and Jerome Williams, a retired basketball player.
But he said his clients' big concerns were no different from most people's. Among them are what investments should they consider, how much will they pay in taxes and what should their budget be?
''Early on, most of them think they'll play forever and have all the money they'll ever need.'' Mr. Rubin said. ''That's never the case. Unless you're LeBron James or Tiger Woods, you're going to have a budget when you're finished playing.''
So the advice to athletes is much like the advice given to young workers: start saving early in your career and don't wait until you are 50.

HIGHLIGHT: Cameron is stuck, and so is Britain. 

 BODY:
"If this plan is working, what would a failing one look like?" So asks Martin Wolf in response to David Cameron's speech insisting that his austerity policy was right, is right, and is succeeding. Simon Wren-Lewis goes through Cameron's assertions in some detail, among other things catching him more or less lying about what the Office of Budget Responsibility - roughly speaking the counterpart of the CBO here - ha actually said about the impact of austerity on growth. 
I was particularly struck by the way Cameron is still claiming that Britain's low interest rates show that his policy is successful and necessary. This is a bit like the high priest sacrificing a virgin once a month to ensure that the sun keeps rising, then claiming that the fact that the sun has risen proves that the sacrifice was indeed necessary. The obvious test is to compare Britain with other countries; if Britain's 2.07 percent bond yield validates his policies, does America's 2.05 percent yield validate Obama's? Or better yet, does France's 2.10 percent yield validate Hollande's? Or is the point, perhaps, that every country that borrows in its own currency (or, in the case of France, finally has a central bank willing to do its job by providing liquidity) can now borrow cheaply?
The trouble, of course, is that Cameron's political career and his very identity are now totally bound up with his austerity crusade. He's a prisoner of his past, who can't and won't change course. Instead, his incentives are all about gambling for redemption - sticking with the policy in the hope that something turns up that will somehow make him a hero.

HIGHLIGHT: Concerns over Syria aid; Europe&#8217;s new financial sheriff; Italy&#8217;s double challenge; U.S. jobless rate drops; and plans for Mars trip. 

 BODY:
 NEWS The United States and other international donors are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on humanitarian aid for Syrians afflicted by the civil war. But here in the rebel-controlled north, where the deprivation is most acute, that money has bought mostly anger and resentment: the vast majority of aid is going to territory controlled by President Bashar al-Assad, and the small amount reaching opposition-held areas is all but invisible. David Kirkpatrick reports from Sawran, Syria. 
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup, is the new financial sheriff in the euro zone. And his disciplinarian bent could hold tremendous sway as the euro zone continues to work through a to-do list of bank bailouts, including ones now pending in Italy and Cyprus. The Dijsselbloem doctrine could mean that bondholders of failing Italian banks or - even more radically, bank depositors in Cyprus - may end up absorbing steep losses if euro zone members are called upon to prop up the institutions. Landon Thomas reports from London.
Even for Romans, who over the centuries have endured looting, pillaging and hourlong lines at the post office, these are interesting times. The unexpected resignation of Benedict XVI means there is no pope in the Vatican. And the inconclusive results from the national elections last month have left Italy's politicians bickering over how to form a government.Jim Yardley reports from Rome.
Bas Lansdorp, a Dutch engineer and entrepreneur, began dreaming more than a decade ago about establishing the first permanent human colony on Mars. Now he is going forward with his plan, but his primary focus is not overcoming the technological challenges - it is finding the money to make it happen by 2018. Nicola Clark reports from Paris.
The U.S. economy, bolstered by a healthier private sector, gained more jobs than expected in February, while the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent, its lowest level since December 2008. The gains were broad-based, with sectors from manufacturing to business services turning in healthy results. Construction was especially strong, a sign that the recovery in the housing market was beginning to translate into new jobs. Nelson D. Schwartz reports from New York.
 ARTS The 26th European Fine Art Fair will open its doors to a private viewing on Thursday in Maastricht, the Netherlands. The selling show is widely acknowledged as the most important of its kind, but the implications of its phenomenal development have yet to be realized and epitomize the profound transformation of the art market in recent decades.Souren Melikian reports.
 SPORTS As the Formula One teams set up their garages at the Albert Park circuit in Melbourne for the first Grand Prix of the season on March 17, the main question for many is whether Sebastian Vettel and his Red Bull team will write another page in the colorful 63-year history of the series by winning a fourth straight title.Brad Spurgeon reports from Paris.

HEADLINE: In the South and West, a Tax on Being Poor

BYLINE: KATHERINE S. NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Struggling Americans are worse off in regions with regressive systems for raising money. 

 BODY:
BALTIMORE
Debates over the fairness of the tax code are as old as the federal income tax itself. A cornerstone of the tax - established a century ago, by the 16th Amendment - has been the principle that those who make more should pay more, while lower tax rates help the poor to support their families and depend less on government benefits.
That social compact shifted into high gear during the Nixon administration, which tried to incentivize work by rewarding low-income households with a tax break that became the nation's most successful antipoverty tool ever: the earned-income tax credit. Politicians of both parties have embraced the credit, making it more progressive three times since it was enacted in 1975.
While the federal government has largely stuck by the principle of progressive taxation, the states have gone their own ways: tax policy is particularly regressive in the South and West, and more progressive in the Northeast and Midwest. When it comes to state and local taxation, we are not one nation under God. In 2008, the difference between a working mother in Mississippi and one in Vermont - each with two dependent children, poverty-level wages and identical spending patterns - was $2,300. 
These regional disparities go back to Reconstruction, when Southern Republicans increased property taxes on defeated white landowners and former slaveholders to pay for the first public services - education, hospitals, roads - ever provided to black citizens. After Reconstruction ended in 1877, conservative Democrats - popularly labeled "the Redeemers" - rolled taxes back to their prewar levels and inserted supermajority clauses into state constitutions to ensure it could never happen again. Property taxes were frozen; income taxes were held down; corporate taxes were almost nonexistent.
Practically the only tax that could rise was the one that hurt the poor the most: the sales tax. And rise it did, throughout the Deep South in the late 19th century, then spreading into the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and the rest of the region in the 1960s and 1970s. Even liberal politicians weren't able to buck the tide - just ask Bill Clinton, who as governor of Arkansas urgently sought new revenue to improve his state's ailing schools and found the sales tax was the only politically viable option.
If this were just a history lesson, we could set it aside. It isn't. In the last 30 years, these trends have only gotten worse. Southern states have steadily increased the tax burden on their poorest citizens by shifting the support of the public sector to sales taxes and fees for public services. After California voters passed Proposition 13, which capped property-tax increases, in 1978, Western states began to move in a similar direction. Sales taxes on clothing and school supplies and fees for bus fare and car registration take up, of course, a far bigger slice of a poor household's budget than they do from the rich.
Over the same 30-year period, some Northeastern and Midwestern states moved in the opposite direction. They mimicked the federal government by passing their own earned-income tax credits (and making them refundable, as the federal government has done, so that very low-income earners get a check after filing their returns), preserved progressive state income-tax rates, and either exempted food and other basics from sales taxes or gave sales-tax rebates to low-income households. No Southern state provides refunds to its poor citizens through the tax code, no matter how little they earn.
There are many reasons to worry about the growing regional divide. But even leaving aside basic fairness - why should a poor child in the Northeast have greater life chances than one in the South? - the divergence exacerbates poverty itself, driving households deeper into distress and lowering social mobility.
For a book published in 2011, my colleague Rourke L. O'Brien and I analyzed the combined burden of sales tax, state and local income taxes on poor households in 49 states, based on consumer expenditures, from 1982 to 2008. (We omitted Alaska because it offers oil-revenue-related rebates to every household). We looked at the relationship between the total tax burden on a poor family of three and state-level figures for mortality, morbidity, teenage childbearing, dropping out of high school, property crime and violent crime.
It turns out that after factoring out all other explanations - like racial composition, poverty rates, the amount spent on education or health care, the size of the state's economy, existing inequality levels, and differences in the cost of living - the relationship between taxing the poor and negative outcomes like premature death persisted. For every $100 increase on taxes at the poverty line, we saw an additional 7 deaths and 78 property crimes per 100,000 people, and a quarter of a percentage point decrease in high school completion.
Southern states have far higher rates of strokes, heart disease and infant mortality than the rest of the country. Students drop out of high school in larger numbers. These outcomes are not just a consequence of a love of fried food or higher poverty levels. Holding all those conditions constant, the poor of the South - and increasingly the West - do worse because their states tax them more heavily. They have less money to buy medication, so their health problems get worse. High sales taxes make meals more expensive, so they shift to cheaper, unhealthy food. If people can't make ends meet, they may turn to the underground economy or to crime.
This self-defeating pattern has plagued the citizens of the "meaner states," the ones that tax poor people at a higher rate, for a long time. But it is about to get worse. Governors in fiscally strapped states are hoping to roll back state earned-income tax credits. Some - like Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma - are aiming to cut or even eliminate state income and corporate taxes and raise sales taxes. North Carolina lawmakers are considering the same thing.
Proponents say these moves will make their states more economically competitive, bring back jobs, and attract high-income residents. But economists who have studied the impact of raising taxes on residential choices have found that tax rates don't make much of a difference. Employers represent a different story: they are attracted to low-tax states, particularly if they don't need high-skilled labor. Accordingly, low-wage job opportunities have grown in the Cotton Belt and the Sun Belt, and shrunk in the Rust Belt. There is something to be said for this, if the goal is to replace the nonworking poor with the working poor. But this is hardly a strategy for eradicating poverty itself.
The fact is, the more the poor are taxed, the worse off they are, whether they are working or not. We all pay a huge price for this shortsightedness. Medicaid payments, food stamps, disability benefits - all of these federal programs swoop in to try to patch up a frayed safety net. Consequently, the Southern states reap more dollars in federal benefits than they pay in taxes (like Mississippi, which saw a net gain of $240 billion between 1990 and 2009), while the wealthier states - which do more to take care of their own - lose out for every dollar they pay (like New Jersey, which handed over a net of $706 billion over that same period). As noble as the federal effort to rescue the poor in the "mean states" may be, it is not enough to reverse the impact of regressive taxation.
There is a better way: increasing taxes on luxury goods; exempting necessities like food, medicine and children's clothing from sales taxes; and perhaps most important, issuing tax rebates and preserving refundable earned-income tax credits, which put more money in the hands of low-income households. Since poor families tend to spend all of what they take in, these protections would stimulate the economy and preserve, or even expand, the job base.
The states headed in the opposite direction are not only damaging the most vulnerable of their citizens, but exacting a significant toll on Americans in states with more progressive tax policies. We all pay for the damage done when states try to solve their fiscal problems, or score ideological points, on the backs of the poor.
Katherine S. Newman, a professor of sociology and the dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University, is the author, with Rourke L. O'Brien, of "Taxing the Poor: Doing Damage to the Truly Disadvantaged."

HEADLINE: The Leading Liberal Against Affirmative Action

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Perhaps the most prominent self-described progressive with doubts about the current version of affirmative action is Richard D. Kahlenberg. He argues that the current race-focused version of affirmative action can be unfair, is inconsistent with many of the program&#8217;s original goals and has lost the support of the public. 

 BODY:
My Capital Ideas column this week looks at liberals who would see some upsides if the Supreme Court made substantial changes to affirmative-action programs. The justices heard arguments in such a case in October - Fisher v. the University of Texas - and are expected to issue their decision between March 18 and late June.
Perhaps the most prominent self-described progressive with doubts about the current version of affirmative action is Richard D. Kahlenberg, of the Century Foundation. Mr. Kahlenberg argues that a race-focused version of affirmative action can be unfair, is inconsistent with many of the program's original goals and has lost the support of the public. Today's affirmative action, he says, helps perpetuate privilege, by helping to fill elite-college campuses with an ethnically diverse mix of affluent students. 
In its place, he has suggested that selective public and private colleges adopt a class-based affirmative action. Done right - by taking into account not only household income but also wealth, family status and geographic concentration of poverty - such a program could enroll similar numbers of minority students as the current version, Mr. Kahlenberg says.
As he writes:
Recruiting fairly privileged students of color is far less expensive than including low-income and working-class kids of all races. While higher education's vigorous defense of affirmative action on one level represents a sincere desire for greater racial equality, it has another less virtuous side to it, as racial preferences avoid the hard work of addressing deeply rooted inequalities and instead provide what Stephen Carter has called "racial justice on the cheap."
Mr. Kahlenberg does not question the continued presence of racism. Its existence is one reason that some other higher-education experts who share some of Mr. Kahlenberg's views would rather see colleges move toward a combination of race- and class-based affirmative action.
When I asked him if he agreed, he said he had spent a long time thinking about that issue and ultimately decided he favored only class-based preferences. They can be structured in a way to recruit a racially diverse class, he believes - and college administrators have come to care so much more about racial diversity than about economic diversity that the two programs would not coexist easily. "My reluctant conclusion is that the only way to get universities to focus on class is if they can't first use race," he said.
Why do they care less about class? That's a complex question that deserves a separate blog post. My guess is that the answer is a combination of a sincere focus on overcoming centuries of racial discrimination; a desire to save money on financial aid; a discomfort with class as a subject that permeates much of American society; and a lingering gentility on some elite university campuses.
For a different from than Mr. Kahlenberg's, you can read the legal brief filed by the University of Texas or several other briefs - listed under "Briefs in Support of Respondent" - filed by universities, civil-rights groups and others.
Whether you agree with Mr. Kahlenberg's solutions, his report, "A Better Affirmative Action," provides a detailed overview of the program, from Martin Luther King Jr. to today. The final section, written by Halley Potter, also of the Century Foundation, profiles several states that have banned race-based affirmative action and looks at how universities have responded.
Those states may offer a preview of what will happen if the Supreme Court rules against the University of Texas.

HIGHLIGHT: A round-up of news from across India. 

 BODY:
 Punjab: Ram Singh, a national level boxer, has told the police that he and Vijender Singh, a 2008 Olympics bronze medal-winning boxer, bought heroin from a drug dealer who was arrested near Chandigarh, Punjab, last week, NDTV reported. The interrogation was part of the drug bust that led to the seizure of 26-kilograms of drugs worth 1.3 billion rupees, or $23 million. 
 West Bengal: Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced a new cash incentive scheme for female children on Wednesday, The Economic Times reported. The state government has offered a one-time payment of 25,000 rupees, or $460, to girls belonging to families with an annual income of less than 50,000 rupees, or $920, the report noted. The scheme encourages girls to continue their education and not to get married before the age of 18 years. 
 Northeast: The Delhi police has trained 32 people from the northeastern states of India, in an attempt of curb violence against people from the northeast who are living in Delhi, according to a Press Trust of India report in The Assam Tribune. These representatives will act as liaisons between the members of their community and the police in case of any emergency, the report said.
 Rajasthan: More than 5,000 lawyers in Jaipur have been on a strike since Wednesday demanding higher salaries, cheaper homes and a quicker allotment of government accommodation, IBNLive reported. On Wednesday and Thursday, the group of advocates clashed with the police, resulting in police authorities using tear gas on the crowd. The Rajasthan Bar Association says that 30 lawyers were injured in the clash on Wednesday.
 Uttar Pradesh: A local court in the Ghaziabad region on Friday sentenced four men to 10 years in prison for raping a woman, according to The Press Trust of India. The crime was committed in Aug. 2011.
 Andhra Pradesh: The chief of a political party that calls for a separate state of Telangana, Chandrasekhara Rao, said that women from the Telangana region would "grind" the governing Indian National Congress party "into paste, just as the way they make dosa pindi (batter)," The New Indian Express reported. Mr. Rao was reacting to minister Vayalar Ravi's comment, that the creation of Telangana state is not as easy as the preparation of dosa, a popular southern Indian food.

Young and Working Round-the-Clock
To the Editor:
Re ''The No-Limits Job'' (Sunday Styles, March 3): As the parent of three people in their 20s, this article hit hard. It's a familiar predicament among my children's friends. This generation of graduates, many of whom are loaded with student loan debt from formerly affordable four-year colleges, is experiencing a terrible lack of access to entry level jobs that would allow them to become familiar with the workplace, make good career and advanced education choices, and begin to get established in life. This problem exists across a broad spectrum of fields, many of which formerly offered decent starting jobs, and is far from limited to entertainment or fashion. It is callous and shortsighted exploitation that goes well beyond traditions of getting your foot in the door and working your way up. 
Young people and their families need to organize and stand up to this mushrooming trend. Regulators need to enforce existing laws and address these exploitive and sometimes unsafe conditions. ''Employers'' who mooch off these young people's efforts need to be exposed. It's time for this practice to change. Let's hope this article becomes part of the tipping point.
Paulis Waber, Washington
To the Editor:
After 30 years of working infinite hours on a finite salary to make deadlines in my publishing jobs (in newspapers, magazines and books), I was kicked to the curb at 58, along with most of my colleagues over 50. The younger workers left behind are working even longer hours, and now have social-media responsibilities added to their workday. How did we allow this to happen to us? How did we begin to accept that the workweek wasn't necessarily 5 days, 40 hours; that it would stretch to 6 and 7 days, and not just for special projects, but all the time? How did it come to pass that each of us internalized the notion that we would be the special one who would be singled out and rewarded if we just gave up one more weekend? My union machinist father would be appalled.
Jean Nicolazzo, Providence, R.I.
To the Editor:
I'm sorry to see this degree of exploitation. But the entertainment industry has always demanded extra time of those who want to advance. It certainly did when I entered it in the late '70s. I don't think anyone should enter it unless they genuinely love the job. If they're after money, they should work on Wall Street. If they're after glamour, well, they shouldn't waste their time. Working with celebrities is no more rewarding than working with anybody else.
Josh Hill, New London, Conn.
To the Editor:
The simple fact is, life is hard, the economy is rough and getting ahead takes a great deal of hard work. This has been my experience in my decades of work in the economies of the '80s until now. Now that I'm unemployed again, $12 an hour would look good to me.
Kathleen M. Kelly, Plymouth, Mich.

HEADLINE: Eye Candy, Structural and Natural

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
Architectural grandeur lines one side, 1.32 square miles of natural splendor the other; in these you have the virtues that validate Central Park West's pride of place among city attractions. It certainly isn't the shopping -- there is no sidewalk-level retail on the entire 51-block stretch, beyond a dry cleaner, a tax preparer and a deli (unless you count doctors' offices).
The avenue is strung like a necklace between clasps: Columbus Circle to the south, Frederick Douglass Circle to the north. Some of its apartment buildings, which went up relatively soon after the city renamed this part of Eighth Avenue in 1883, swallow up whole blocks, calling ''Look at me,'' in a distinctive way at least partly defined by their views.
''You can watch the sun rise in the east, turn your head, and watch it set in the west,'' said Ranan Lurie, a cartoonist and painter, describing what he can see from a particular chair at his home at 15 Central Park West, a 43-story condominium whose limestone walls loom at West 61st Street. And Mr. Lurie has done what he can to enhance those perspectives. 
In 2005, after he bought his 36th-floor three-bedroom for $13 million, he replaced plaster walls with glass. He also relocated a washer and dryer so the foyer could be made wide enough to display his colorful swirling canvasses.
So enamored is he of the way this part of New York looks from several hundred feet up that he has his studio in a two-bedroom nearby at the Time Warner Center. That $3 million purchase, too, took place in 2005, after Mr. Lurie and his wife, Tamar, decided to sell their main Connecticut home.
Though less than a block separates the apartments, navigating between them can be tricky: throngs of tourists mill about, many clutching shopping bags that brush against Mr. Lurie's knees.
''It's like crossing a finish line when I get home,'' he said.
The many sightseers in the area aren't bashful: that was John Lennon's building, said a man to a boy recently by the Dakota, at 1 West 72nd Street, with its mansion-like gabled roof. Performers like Denzel Washington, Conan O'Brien and Moby have also called the street home at various times.
Not that you have to be a boldface name to live along this side of the park. There are pockets of affordability, like Park West Village, a seven-building enclave at West 97th Street that rose from a 1950s slum-clearance project. In the early 1970s, after receiving a degree in social work, Gloria Kurant rented a one-bedroom there for $265 a month, while working for a hospital nearby.
A decade later Ms. Kurant's building, whose name is the Vaux, for Calvert Vaux, Central Park's co-designer, went condo. And because her paychecks were bigger after she took a job with A T & T, she could afford to buy, which she did, several times, but always under the same roof.
Today, home is a combined pair of one-bedrooms, which cost $875,000 in 2000 but would, she guesses, bring $1 million today.
''We're nothing fancy,'' she said of the Central Park West she knows. But she is aware that outside New York, the address can instantly evoke the good life. ''You tell them where you live,'' she said, ''and their eyebrows go up.''
What You'll Find
Developers have transformed Columbus Circle in the last decade; what used to be a sleepy jog in the road is today a bustling crossroads. On a brisk afternoon there in late February, a four-piece ragtime band with a washboard was entertaining a crowd.
Frederick Douglass Circle, which in 2011 acquired an eight-foot statue of its namesake, is quieter, though that seems as if it could change. The city is trying to sell the site of a BP gas station -- providing it resolves a dispute with the station owner about who has rights to the land.
Judging by fame, exclusivity and high prices, Central Park West can be viewed as a mirror image of Fifth Avenue along the park's eastern flank. But it has for much of its history been considered scruffier -- the kind of New York street where subway announcements waft through sidewalk grates -- even if bohemians may be hard-pressed to afford it.
The architecture is different as well. Few town houses survive. Instead the avenue favors the exuberant designs that prevailed from around the time of the park's completion, in 1873, till the Great Depression. Art Deco may be the most prominent, as seen for instance at the Majestic Apartments, at No. 115, with its creamy, grooved brick. But the San Remo, a 1930 co-op designed by Emery Roth, at Nos. 145 and 146, pays homage to the Beaux-Arts look, with a pair of shields the size of wading pools hovering over each front door.
Both buildings have twin towers, in a response to a part of the Multiple Dwelling Law restricting such buildings to 19 stories but allowing higher floors in towers if the bases were extra-wide.
Another Beaux-Arts gem dazzles at No. 285: the 52-unit St. Urban, whose facade bears a cherub gazing at the low wall of the park. Ada Louise Huxtable, the late architecture critic, grew up inside.
Though the avenue is heavy co-op territory, condos do turn up, like the ziggurat-topped No. 279, at 88th Street, which went up in 1988, and Towers on the Park, a 600-unit complex of one- to three-bedrooms, of similar vintage, clustered around Douglass Circle.
Aside from those two, there isn't much in the way of modern high-rises. Most of the avenue received landmark designation in 1990. Rentals are similarly scarce and can be hard to distinguish, since they too have uniformed doormen; one is No. 295, at 90th Street, with 136 units.
What You'll Pay
At the end of last month there were 123 listings for sale at an average of $5.5 million, according to Streeteasy.com. They ranged from $265,000, for a 400-square-foot studio in need of renovation at the Alden, another Roth-designed co-op, to $95 million, for a five-bedroom combination at No. 15 with three exposures. Even though activity trailed off after the recession, prices have stabilized. In 2012, 238 apartments sold, at an average of $3.6 million, according to Streeteasy. In 2008, by contrast, there were 361 sales, at an average of $5.7 million -- though that was the year No. 15 opened, so its robust sales might have skewed the numbers.
A better comparison might be made to 2007, when 353 deals closed, at an average of $3.3 million, closer to the 2012 figure.
What to Do
Stores are mostly absent from the avenue, but there is retail tucked along some side streets. West 100th Street has an Associated Market, and a popular Whole Foods Market anchors the Time Warner Center, which has dozens of shops.
Beyond celebrity stargazing, there is the heavenly kind, beckoning through the tall windows of the Hayden Planetarium in the American Museum of Natural History, at 79th Street. And there are sky views on offer across the street, by the Central Park wall, through the curlicue branches of an old elm shading a bench.
The Schools
Among area schools is the highly regarded Public School 87 which runs through fifth grade. On state tests last year, 84 percent of third graders met standards in English, 89 percent in math, versus 49 percent and 57 percent citywide. The Center School, at 100 West 84th Street, goes through Grade 8. And at LaGuardia High School, on Amsterdam Avenue, SAT averages in 2012 were 566 in reading, 564 in math and 577 in writing, versus 377, 371 and 360 statewide.
Private schools include Ethical Culture, Columbia Prep, Trevor Day and Dwight.
The Commute
The B and C make frequent stops. Columbus Circle offers the A, B, C, D and 1 trains. The M10 bus runs the length of the avenue; crosstown service is also available.
The History
The breaks in Central Park's wall that serve as entrances have names inscribed in brownstone: Mariner's Gate, at 85th Street; Strangers Gate, at 106th. Though they appear old and were chosen to honor the variety of New York's citizens, the signs weren't actually made until 1999.

HEADLINE: Those Who Nailed It for Fall 2013

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
IT'S OVER. You can rest now. No more volleys of pencil skirts and models in static-fuzz wigs (easily the hottest accessory during the four-week run of fall fashion shows).
Actually, for as much as people complain about the terrible pace -- and the pressures on designers to create at a high level -- there should be more seasons like this one. Marc Jacobs clapped and made the sun appear, and then, for Louis Vuitton, mustered the supermodels to look as if they had no strength left to wear anything more than a slip and an overcoat, as they tumbled into their hotel rooms. Pleasure seemed to be the defining mood of the fall collections, whether it was in the sensual textures, the cocooning coats and the unfittedness of the clothes. Some of the more elegant designs may look retro, but they are not predictable.
Despite the number of shows, it's easy to pick out the winners. These are the ones that, more than being modern and wearable, looked beautifully resolved, like Dior and Hermès. There are the collections that stand out for being restrained, or, in the case of Lanvin, for refusing to take the rules of a fashion show seriously. Certainly in the instance of Miuccia Prada's show, the clothes slyly get under your skin. 
You could love a lot about the New York collections, like Phillip Lim's shaggy coats and Derek Lam's cool sportswear. But Narciso Rodriguez is that rare kind of designer in that you could happily spend an hour staring at the fused folds of a T-shirt hem or the shoulder line of a coat, because he's so good at what he does. This season he got a lot out of his minimalist shapes, largely by asymmetry and an unexpectedly hearty blend of warm colors.
That soft roundness in Mr. Rodriguez's clothes anticipated a big fall trend. Though some Proenza Schouler clothes recalled the reductive modernity of early Givenchy, the collection of Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez was a step up. For once their novel fabrics were in harmony with the designs. Four weeks after they showed rounded jackets and nip-waist coats in compacted bouclé over modest, side-buttoned dresses, they are hard to forget.
Louise Goldin, a transplanted British designer, also makes the final cut in New York, for her solid bundle of technical skills that yielded distinctive clothes, especially the great coats.
After years of being the playground of fashion hotheads, London now plays host to new talent conditioned by post-recession austerity. Well, they're a smart, unpretentious bunch. Christopher Kane, who recently sold 51 percent of his company to the French luxury group PPR, remains the leader, with a super-appealing collection that combined kilts and camouflage, and finished off with a riff on elegant velvet.
Despite the sugary lift of Simone Rocha's clothes, they are grounded in common sense. This stuff has to sell. That's the delicate balance displayed among London's new revolutionaries, who include J. W. Anderson and Thomas Tait. Is it an accident that these three designers, as well as Mr. Kane, live and work in the same East London neighborhood?
In Milan, Ms. Prada hooked her audience within the first few outfits: dark tweed sheaths or black beaded chiffon dresses worn with indifference over drab knits. O.K., we can go home now. Ms. Prada's designs stem from an inner vision of herself, and plainly it's filled with images from Italian films and conflicts involving beauty. But the upshot is a tangled, what-a-woman sexiness.
As often happens, the Paris collections were in another class. Paris fashion gets its weight from ideas, whether from the past or the street, and its authority from the way designers like Raf Simons of Dior can reorient your thinking about notions like modernity and good taste. That's especially true this season.
Alexander Wang surprised many observers this season (including me) with a Balenciaga debut that seemed attuned to those values. Although he called the mostly black and white collection ''a prelude,'' he and his team clearly understood that Balenciaga's volumes look better when minimized. And though the label has been a cult of the young, as Mr. Wang's own fashion is, these clothes could easily be worn by women of any age.
Such open-mindedness also set apart Alber Elbaz's collection for Lanvin. In its energized mix of styles, the show felt almost old-fashioned, or insurrectionary.
With so many designers dipping into Dior's midcentury silhouette, Mr. Simons shrewdly showed how in command he is of the shapes even as he redefines them. In this dazzling collection of new suits and streamlined evening dresses with Surrealist embroidery, the clothes were in sync with the movement of the body. That's less common than you might think. His asymmetrical skirts, in silk or wool denim, could be almost Japanese in simplicity, yet they are buoyantly Parisian.
At Céline, Phoebe Philo also made a powerful statement with skirts. Shown with oversize sweaters in cream-to-pink tones, or a lanky version of a Mary Poppins jacket, the flirty skirts made a great silhouette. And, surprisingly, they were knits -- extremely compacted silk, rayon or wool bouclé and without waistbands or fasteners. Ms. Philo's clothes may be eminently beautiful, but they also have slob appeal (at least for unreformed slobs).
Finally, there is Hermès. Even if you are not in that price league, this was an inspired lesson in good taste, a worldly femininity, and, maybe, how not to run with the fashion pack.

HEADLINE: A Fee-For-Health Model

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Overcoming Obstacles to Better Health Care'' (Economic View, Feb. 24), in which Richard H. Thaler argued that ''doctors and hospitals should be paid for keeping their patients well'': 
I'm growing weary of the suggestion that a fee-for-health model of care is viable. Is Professor Thaler willing to pay for a doctor to follow each patient home and make sure she has taken her meds? Exercised 30 minutes a day? Refrained from smoking?
Still, a new paradigm in health care is ''patient satisfaction'' surveys. Let's say a doctor truthfully tells a patient, ''Gee, you're overweight and you should exercise and cut out the carbs, lose 50 pounds and your back probably will stop hurting you and your blood sugar may indeed stabilize.'' The patient, however, may find that kind of guidance annoying at best and insulting at worst. Then, guess what? The doctor receives awful patient satisfaction scores, which are gaining importance in potential insurance reimbursements.
It's up to each of us to exercise personal responsibility for our health care when we can, and up to the medical community to intervene when we cannot.

HEADLINE: The Minimum Wage and the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Business of the Minimum Wage'' (Economic View, March 3), Christina D. Romer argued that if the minimum wage were increased, the amount of money redistributed to and spent by low-wage workers would be minuscule in comparison with the overall economy. 
That misses the point. At the heart of redistributive policies like that for a minimum wage is a belief championed by President Obama: that we're all in this together, connected as one people. If the proposal to raise the annual income of a minimum-wage worker by $3,500 means that she doesn't have to go hungry, or doesn't have to choose between health care and the rent, then my life is richer for it, too -- even if I do not directly benefit from her augmented purchasing power.
MATTHEW AITKEN

To the Editor:
The column was enlightening. People are constantly arguing about whether to raise or lower the minimum wage -- saying either that an increase would greatly improve the economy, or that the current minimum wage is already ruining it.
I am 18, in high school, and work at a movie theater. When there are complaints about the minimum wage, I bite my tongue through most of them, but people do not understand how the economy works. People fail to realize that if the minimum wage was much higher, employers would cut down on their number of employees to offset the costs.
CLEORA REBER
Roseville, Calif., March 4

To the Editor:
In the column, Professor Romer says that many of her students ''assume that government protection is the only thing ensuring decent wages for most American workers.'' But, she adds, ''basic economics shows that competition between employers for workers can be very effective at preventing businesses from misbehaving.''
Unfortunately, many employers don't compete for employees; they don't have to. They just import lower-wage workers, even for skilled positions. Nothing is forcing such employers to offer benefits and fair wages, so they see no sense in doing so. Where are strong unions when we need them?
Perhaps Professor Romer should listen to her students a bit more.
SUSAN NIAL
Charleston, S.C., March 3

To the Editor:
The column looked at how much a higher minimum wage would redistribute income. Well, I've got a much better example of redistribution, but in the opposite direction: the bloated executive salaries and big bonuses paid at companies even partially owned by investors.
Huge excessive pay for management siphons off profits that should either go to shareholders or be reinvested in the company to improve productivity and future profits. Not doing so is truly a redistribution of wealth -- taking from the many and giving to the few. Besides, as Henry Ford showed a century ago, a living wage is money well spent. Not only does a company operate more efficiently -- attracting and keeping the best workers -- but the extra investment in wages is immediately redistributed back into the economy, benefiting the employer (through increased sales) and all of society.

HEADLINE: China Says It Won't Forsake North Korea, Despite Support for U.N. Sanctions

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's foreign minister said Saturday that Beijing would not abandon North Korea, reiterating China's longstanding position that dialogue, not sanctions, is the best way to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear weapons.
At a news conference during the National People's Congress, the foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, suggested that Chinese support for tougher United Nations sanctions against North Korea should not be interpreted as a basic change in China's attitude. 
''We always believe that sanctions are not the end of the Security Council actions, nor are sanctions the fundamental way to resolve the relevant issues,'' said Mr. Yang, who addressed foreign policy questions from Chinese and foreign reporters.
But the careful remarks masked the unparalleled plain-spoken discussions among China's officials and analysts about the value of supporting North Korea even as it continues to develop nuclear weapons and unleashes new threats to attack the United States and South Korea.
In the aftermath of North Korea's third nuclear test in February, China last week joined the United States to push for tougher United Nations sanctions against the North. Although it remained to be seen whether China would actually enforce the sanctions, its decision to support them also raised the possibility that it might take even bolder steps against its recalcitrant ally.
The clearest sign of China's exasperation with North Korea came Thursday at a side session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory group to the government that was open to the news media.
Delegates to the conference, according to a senior Communist Party official, Qiu Yuanping, talked about whether to ''keep or dump'' North Korea and debated whether China, as a major power, should ''fight or talk'' with the North.
In the annals of Communist Party decorum, Ms. Qiu's description of the spirited debate was quite extraordinary. She made the remarks in the presence of reporters at a session titled ''Friendship with Foreign Countries'' that was attended by several Chinese ambassadors who were visiting Beijing from their posts abroad.
As deputy director of the Communist Party's Central Foreign Affairs Office, a secretive body that gives foreign policy advice to top leaders, Ms. Qiu usually opts for discretion. The admission by a senior Communist Party official that North Korea is a nettlesome neighbor is especially striking because China conducts its relations with North Korea chiefly through the comradely auspices of the party, rather than the Foreign Ministry.
Just days before Ms. Qiu's remarks, a prominent Communist Party analyst, Deng Yuwen, a deputy editor of Study Times, the journal of the Central Party School of the Communist Party, wrote that China should ''give up'' on North Korea.
Writing in The Financial Times late last month, Mr. Deng asked what would happen if the United States launched a pre-emptive attack on North Korea: ''Would China not be obliged to help North Korea based on our 'alliance.' Would that not be drawing fire upon ourselves?''
Moreover, Mr. Deng wrote, there was no hope that North Korea would overhaul its economy and become a normal country, a path urged in the past several years by the Chinese government. Even if the North's new ruler, Kim Jong-un, wanted reform, the entrenched ruling elite ''would absolutely not allow him to do so,'' because they know change would result in the overthrow of the government, Mr. Deng said.
Mr. Deng's analysis was widely read, in part, because he has a habit of expressing provocative views that meld into the mainstream. Last year, he wrote an article that appeared in the online version of Caijing, a business magazine, that said failures had outweighed achievements in the decade-long rule of President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. After the article appeared, the era of Mr. Hu and Mr. Wen was often referred to as the ''lost decade.''
For all the concern about North Korea since the nuclear test in mid-February, there have been no concrete signs that China plans to take any action against the North beyond the United Nations sanctions.
Traders in Jilin Province, which abuts North Korea in northeastern China, said there was not a noticeable slowdown of goods passing across the border. It is possible that there will be a crackdown on smugglers, but that has not happened yet, said an official in the Yanbian Prefecture in Jilin Province, where much of the smuggling takes place.
It is doubtful that China will reinforce the United Nations sanctions by imposing penalties of its own, said Cai Jian, the deputy director of the Center for Korean Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.
The biggest element of China's trade with North Korea is the export of oil that keeps the North Korean military going and its creaky industrial base more or less functioning. ''Oil will not be cut,'' Mr. Cai said. Chinese companies buy North Korean coal and iron ore, a trade that the Chinese government has encouraged and that helps North Korea by generating hard currency. Those imports are unlikely to be curbed.
The extent to which China will enforce the new United Nations sanctions remains unclear, an expert on the North Korean economy, Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, wrote in a blog post. There are plenty of loopholes for China to exploit if it wanted to, he noted.
The new restrictions against the North, including efforts to block the opening of North Korean banks abroad if they support weapons purchases, are limited by a ''credible information'' clause, Mr. Noland wrote, which allows a government to say that it lacks the information needed to assess the situation or apply the sanctions.
The support of the sanctions at the United Nations are a fine balancing act by China, said Jia Qingguo, the associate dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University.
China backed the new sanctions in the hope that they would be sufficient to encourage North Korea to return to the negotiating table to discuss denuclearization, but not so harsh that they would cause the North's collapse.
If that were to occur, American troops stationed in South Korea could move north and help unite the Korean Peninsula under an American umbrella, the last thing China would want, Mr. Jia said.
For now, China's position on North Korea will remain the same. ''If China's policy changes, it would be because of a North Korean provocative act,'' he said, ''like another nuclear test, closer to China's borders.''

HEADLINE: Billionaires' Club Is Set To Grow

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
Watching a ballet, you cannot help but marvel at the power of the movement, and the ability of the dancers to soar through the air, time and again, as if there were no limits to their stamina.
And so it is --well, almost -- with the market for high-end properties, where the intensity of sales, at heights never seen before, defied gravity in 2012, whether it was in New York, London, Miami, Los Angeles or Hong Kong.
Is there a day of reckoning on the horizon? Just how many more buyers will be willing to pay $88 million for an apartment in Manhattan, or $121 million for a 10,000-square-foot Chelsea house like the one the developers Nick and Christian Candy bought in London in September? Or $117.5 million for a nearly nine-acre estate in Woodside, Calif., in Silicon Valley, the highest price ever paid for a residence in the United States?
The short answer is a lot. New reports out this week suggest that the residential luxury-buying ballet is very likely poised for a sustained performance. 
The buying seems to draw traction from the fact that there will be so many more newly minted rich people hunting for properties. Over the next 10 years, some 95,000 more people around the world are expected to see their wealth grow to at least $30 million, according to a forecast by Knight Frank, a London-based real estate company, which puts the current number of such people at 189,835.
Then there are the global billionaires, a crowd with an almost insatiable appetite for trophy properties, like the penthouse at 15 Central Park West that the daughter of Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian potash fertilizer billionaire, bought last year for $88 million, or $13,000 per square foot.
The number of billionaires will grow by 85 percent over the next decade, to 4,076, Knight Frank forecasts.
Europe and Asia, which have more billionaires than anywhere else, will still lead the way. New York City is emerging as a favorite. ''There was a stage three to five years ago where London was quite clearly the main market for Russian and European super-wealthy buyers, but New York is becoming so much more on the radar of these buyers," said Liam Bailey, head of research for Knight Frank. "Latin American wealth really isn't coming to London, it is going to Miami and New York.''
The buyers of luxurious penthouses, town houses and country estates are increasingly coming from the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- where people are becoming very rich at a stunning rate. Even with inflation concerns in some of those countries, the combined annual G.N.P. growth of those four countries is equivalent to the creation of a new economy the size of Italy.
Knight Frank said that through 2022 China would see its pool of billionaires grow by 214 percent, to 483; Brazil by 157 percent, to 136; and India by 84 percent, to 225.
Consider, too, what is happening in Brazil, a country that has driven high-end sales in Miami, and to some extent New York, more than any other of late. The number of Brazilians with at least $30 million in assets is expected to climb by nearly 140 percent over the next decade, according to Knight Frank. A growing middle class and production of natural resources are at the heart of the wealth creation.
The Brazilians aren't focused on buying fancier properties at home, although they are doing that as well. They want second and third homes abroad, and they want them now. Knight Frank found that Web searches by South Americans in 2012 for luxury residential properties surged by 82 percent, although they tend to focus on the lower end of that market. It was the region of the world with the biggest uptick. (Africa was second, with 48 percent, followed by Europe.)
Whether they know it or not, the global wealthy are facing stiffer competition from one another. Russians seemed to be everywhere scouring for trophy properties in 2012. They are facing increasing competition from Asian buyers, especially from China and Hong Kong, as well as from Latin America, Knight Frank said.
The buyer of the $117.5 million home in Woodside, for example, was Japan's second-richest man, Masayoshi Son, according to The Los Angeles Times. Forbes has estimated his wealth at $8.6 billion.
Last year I seemed to trip almost unintentionally over the trail of a few Russian oligarchs and their real estate. Mr. Rybolovlev, who bought a $100 million home in Palm Beach, Fla., and the $88 million apartment in New York (bought by his eldest daughter, Ekaterina, through a trust), also has homes in Geneva and Monaco, and was once on the hunt in Los Angeles for a trophy home (he didn't find it, brokers there say).
Vladislav Doronin, the Moscow-based real estate developer who dates the model Naomi Campbell, has spent more than $20 million to renovate a home on Star Island in Miami. He also has homes on the Spanish island of Ibiza, at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, and at One Hyde Park in London; the latter two have become billionaire dens.
London, Miami and New York came to epitomize the so-called safe-haven market in 2012. Even with burgeoning demand from the wealthy for property -- as a safer and potentially more profitable investment than stock markets and other financial instruments -- the number of ''desirable locations remains virtually static,'' Knight Frank said. So buyers continue to focus on these few ''key hubs.'' But Knight Frank predicted that wealthy people this year would expand their searches to include European cities previously thought to be too economically distressed: Milan, Madrid, Barcelona and Dublin, which will join Munich, Berlin, Zurich, Geneva and Vienna as ''core European targets.''
Some governments, concerned about affordability, are challenging the buying spree, through efforts to tinker with the luxury property markets. Last March the British government, seeking to crack down on tax avoidance, bolstered its ''stamp duty'' by 40 percent on properties valued over £2 million. Last month the Hong Kong government, concerned about a property bubble, raised stamp duties and tightened mortgage lending. But while the changes imposed in the United Kingdom have added revenue to government coffers, they have done little to slow the buying, Knight Frank said. Singapore also raised its stamp duty and made it tougher for foreigners to buy.
In the end, the global luxury property market is functioning in its own universe, seemingly removed from general real estate trends. It ''remains relatively impervious to these trends and more closely follows the luxury goods market,'' Christie's International Real Estate said in a study released this week.
Cash is king. Buyers paid cash in every deal over $20 million brokered last year by Hilton & Hyland Real Estate in Beverly Hills, Calif., which saw a 64 percent increase in year-on-year sales volume, to $1.8 billion, from $1.1 billion in 2011, said Jeffrey Hyland, a co-owner.
Banks in New York, at least, have begun to lend more for construction financing. But credit for home purchases remains tight in the broader United States real estate market.
''Lenders are still afraid of their own shadow,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, a New York appraisal company. ''Credit standards are just as tight'' as they were after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Yet credit remains an afterthought in the world's most expensive property markets, which continue to soar and show no signs of tiring.

HEADLINE: No to Keystone. Yes to Crazy.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I HOPE the president turns down the Keystone XL oil pipeline. (Who wants the U.S. to facilitate the dirtiest extraction of the dirtiest crude from tar sands in Canada's far north?) But I don't think he will. So I hope that Bill McKibben and his 350.org coalition go crazy. I'm talking chain-themselves-to-the-White-House-fence-stop-traffic-at-the-Capitol kind of crazy, because I think if we all make enough noise about this, we might be able to trade a lousy Keystone pipeline for some really good systemic responses to climate change. We don't get such an opportunity often -- namely, a second-term Democratic president who is under heavy pressure to approve a pipeline to create some jobs but who also has a green base that he can't ignore. So cue up the protests, and pay no attention to people counseling rational and mature behavior. We need the president to be able to say to the G.O.P. oil lobby, ''I'm going to approve this, but it will kill me with my base. Sasha and Malia won't even be talking to me, so I've got to get something really big in return.'' 
Face it: The last four years have been a net setback for the green movement. While President Obama deserves real praise for passing a historic increase in vehicle mileage efficiency and limits on the emissions of new coal-fired power plants, the president also chose to remove the term ''climate change'' from his public discourse and kept his talented team of environmentalists in a witness-protection program, banning them from the climate debate. This silence coincided with record numbers of extreme weather events -- droughts and floods -- and with a huge structural change in the energy marketplace.
What was that change? Put simply, all of us who had hoped that scientific research and new technologies would find cheaper ways to provide carbon-free energy at scale -- wind, solar, bio, nuclear -- to supplant fossil fuels failed to anticipate that new technologies (particularly hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling at much greater distances) would produce new, vastly cheaper ways to tap natural gas trapped in shale as well as crude oil previously thought unreachable, making cleaner energy alternatives much less competitive.
It's great that shale gas is replacing coal as a source of electricity, since it generates less than half the carbon dioxide. As the oil economist Philip Verleger Jr. notes in the latest edition of the journal International Economy, these breakthroughs will also lead to much more oil and gas at lower prices, which will help American consumers, manufacturers and jobs. But, he adds, ''it will be harder and harder to push for renewable energy programs as hydrocarbon prices fall,'' and ''the new technologies that allow us to tap shale oil and shale gas could release vast quantities of methane'' if not done properly. Methane released in the atmosphere contributes much more to climate change than CO2.
If Keystone gets approved, environmentalists should have a long shopping list ready, starting with a price signal that discourages the use of carbon-intensive fuels in favor of low-carbon energy. Nothing would do more to clean our air, drive clean-tech innovation, weaken petro-dictators and reduce the deficit than a carbon tax. One prays this will become part of the budget debate. Also, the president can use his authority under the Clean Air Act to order reductions in CO2 emissions from existing coal power plants and refiners by, say, 25 percent. He could then do with the power companies what he did with autos: negotiate with them over the fairest way to achieve that reduction in different parts of the country. We also need to keep the president's feet to the fire on the vow in his State of the Union address to foster policies that could ''cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years.'' About 30 percent of energy in buildings is wasted.
Finally, the president could make up for Keystone by introducing into the public discourse the concept of ''natural infrastructure,'' argues Mark Tercek, the president and chief executive of The Nature Conservancy, and the co-author of ''Nature's Fortune: How Business and Society Thrive by Investing in Nature.''
''Forests, wetlands and other ecosystems are nature's infrastructure for controlling floods, supplying water, and doing other things we need to adapt to climate change,'' Tercek wrote in an e-mail. ''Before Hurricane Sandy, Cape May, N.J., had the foresight to restore its dunes and wetlands to provide storm protection and wildlife habitat. When Sandy struck, Cape May was spared the damage that neighboring towns suffered.''
Since the president is rightly calling for infrastructure investment, which makes sense at a time of high unemployment, added Tercek, ''he should emphasize natural infrastructure as well. Federal programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Farm Bill can be expanded to make communities more resilient; changes in the tax code and other federal rules can incentivize private investment.''
So, sure, we need to be realistic about our near-term dependence on fossil fuels, or we will pay a big price. But we also need to be realistic about the need to keep building a bridge to a different energy future, or we will pay an even bigger price. Let's make sure we don't forget the latter in the Keystone debate.

HEADLINE: In the South and West, a Tax on Being Poor

BYLINE: By KATHERINE S. NEWMAN. 
Katherine S. Newman, a professor of sociology and the dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University, is the author, with Rourke L. O'Brien, of ''Taxing the Poor: Doing Damage to the Truly Disadvantaged.''

 BODY:
Debates over the fairness of the tax code are as old as the federal income tax itself. A cornerstone of the tax -- established a century ago, by the 16th Amendment -- has been the principle that those who make more should pay more, while lower tax rates help the poor support their families and depend less on government benefits.
That social compact shifted into high gear during the Nixon administration, which tried to incentivize work by rewarding low-income households with a tax break that became the nation's most successful antipoverty tool ever: the earned-income tax credit. Politicians of both parties have embraced the credit, making it more progressive three times since it was enacted in 1975. 
While the federal government has largely stuck by the principle of progressive taxation, the states have gone their own ways: tax policy is particularly regressive in the South and West, and more progressive in the Northeast and Midwest. In 2008, the difference between a working mother in Mississippi and one in Vermont -- each with two dependent children, poverty-level wages and identical spending patterns -- was $2,300.
These regional disparities go back to Reconstruction, when Southern Republicans increased property taxes on defeated white landowners and former slaveholders to pay for the first public services -- education, hospitals, roads -- ever provided to black citizens. After Reconstruction, conservative Democrats rolled taxes back to prewar levels. Property taxes were frozen; income taxes held down; corporate taxes almost nonexistent. Practically the only tax that could rise was the one that hurt the poor the most: the sales tax. And rise it did, in the Deep South core in the late 19th century, then in the rest of the region in the 1960s and 1970s.
In the last 30 years, these trends have only gotten worse. Southern states have steadily increased the tax burden on their poorest citizens by shifting the support of the public sector to sales taxes and fees for public services. After California voters passed Proposition 13, which capped property-tax increases, in 1978, Western states began to move in a similar direction.
Over the same 30-year period, some Northeastern and Midwestern states moved in the opposite direction. They mimicked the federal government by passing their own earned-income tax credits (and making them refundable, as the federal government has done, so that very low-income earners get a check after filing their returns), preserved progressive state income-tax rates, and exempted food and other basics from sales taxes or gave sales-tax rebates to low-income households. No Southern state provides refunds to its poor citizens through the tax code, no matter how little they earn.
My colleague Rourke L. O'Brien and I analyzed the combined burden of sales tax, state and local income taxes on poor households in 49 states, based on consumer expenditures, from 1982 to 2008. (We omitted Alaska; it offers oil-revenue-related rebates to every household).
After factoring out all other explanations -- like racial composition, poverty rates, the amount spent on education or health care, the size of the state's economy, existing inequality levels and differences in the cost of living -- the relationship between taxing the poor and negative outcomes like crime and teen childbearing persisted. For every $100 increase on taxes on the poor, we saw an additional 7 deaths and 78 property crimes per 100,000 people, and a quarter of a percentage point decrease in high school completion.
Southern states have far higher rates of strokes, heart disease and infant mortality than the rest of the country. Students drop out of high school in larger numbers. Poor Southerners have less money to buy medication, so their health problems get worse. High sales taxes make meals more expensive, so they buy cheaper, unhealthy food. If they can't make ends meet, they turn to the underground economy or to crime.
This self-defeating pattern has plagued the citizens of the ''meaner states,'' the ones that tax poor people at a higher rate, for a long time. But it is about to get worse. Governors in fiscally strapped states are hoping to roll back state earned-income tax credits. Governors in Louisiana, Nebraska and Oklahoma are aiming to cut or even eliminate state income and corporate taxes and raise sales taxes. So are lawmakers in North Carolina.
PROPONENTS say these moves will make their states more economically competitive, bring back jobs, and attract high-income residents. But economists have found that tax rates don't make much of a difference on the choice of where to live. Employers are a different story: they are attracted to low-tax states, particularly if they don't need high-skilled labor. Accordingly, low-wage job opportunities have grown in the Cotton Belt and the Sun Belt and have shrunk in the Rust Belt. There is something to be said for this, if the goal is to replace the nonworking poor with the working poor. But this is hardly a strategy for eradicating poverty itself.
The fact is, the more the poor are taxed, the worse off they are, whether they are working or not. We all pay a huge price for this shortsightedness. Medicaid payments, food stamps, disability benefits -- all of these federal programs swoop in to try to patch up a frayed safety net. Consequently, the Southern states reap more dollars in federal benefits for every dollar they pay in taxes (like Mississippi, which saw a net gain of $240 billion between 1990 and 2009), while the wealthier states -- which do more to take care of their own -- lose out for every dollar they pay (like New Jersey, which handed over a net $706 billion during that same period).
There is a better way: increasing taxes on luxury goods; exempting necessities like food, medicine and children's clothing from sales taxes; and issuing tax rebates and preserving refundable earned-income tax credits, which put more money in the hands of low-income households. Since poor families tend to spend all of what they take in, these protections would stimulate the economy and preserve, or even expand, the job base.
The states headed in the opposite direction are not only damaging the most vulnerable of their citizens, but exacting a significant toll on Americans in states with more progressive tax policies. We all pay for the damage done when states try to solve their fiscal problems, or score ideological points, on the backs of the poor.

HEADLINE: Too Young to Retire, but These Deals Can't Wait

BYLINE: By HOWARD GOODMAN and MICHAEL WINERIP; Howard Goodman reported from Boca Raton, Fla., and Michael Winerip from New York.

 BODY:
BOCA RATON, Fla. -- Susan Shapira, who is 58, recently moved into a condominium in Century Village, a gated retirement community here where most residents are almost as old as the name.
In the nine months she has lived here, she has learned some of the drawbacks of being a baby boomer among the very old.
''I don't see anyone after dark,'' she said. There is zero night life. The bus is often delayed -- walkers slow people getting on and off. And her building's resident representative had been hard to find after going into rehab for a back injury.
But Ms. Shapira says she has no regrets. She bought her two-bedroom condo for cash -- $26,900. 
''It's like a car,'' she said.
Sometimes it is like a used car.
Last year a condo here sold for $7,000, according to the real estate industry's Multiple Listing Service. One in Kings Point, a similar retirement community in nearby Delray Beach, sold for $3,000, according to the listings.
The prices in these large retirement communities are not low because the properties have deteriorated since they were built in the 1970s and '80s. In fact, they are mostly well kept.
But they hold little appeal to most baby boomers, who never imagined hanging out in the same sprawling retirement complexes that attracted their parents to come here.
With that World War II generation dying off and the collapse of the Florida real estate market during the recession, condominium prices in many cases are lower than they were when the units were new.
According to Palm Beach County property assessment records, Ms. Shapira's condo originally sold for $40,800 in 1980. In 1990 it resold for $65,000.
And that is not an anomaly. In 2012, the average price of a condo in Century Village of Boca Raton was $35,436. For Kings Point in Delray Beach, it was $24,436.
In 2006, at the height of the real estate boom here, the average Century Village of Boca Raton condo sold for $114,000, according to multiple listings data.
Ms. Shapira, who was recently laid off from her job in the credit card industry, believes that over time she will look smart for having bought early on. ''It's a nice standard of living,'' she said. ''That's how I look at it.''
She raised her son as a single mother, and this is the first time she has owned a home.
Her annual property taxes are just $632.
For the older generation, the men and women who came of age during the Depression and World War II, these senior communities -- populated in large part by middle-class Northeasterners, often Jewish -- were the Levittowns of retirement life, with thousands of condos in identical low-rise town houses offering comfortable living at affordable prices.
For a while now, the thinking in the real estate business has been that they were a thing of the past.
If baby boomers did not follow their parents to the Catskills for vacations, it did not seem likely that they would retire to the same places.
But Barry Fogel, who sells real estate in Kings Point, says that business has picked up and that many buyers are older boomers, in their late 50s to mid-60s. ''A lot of them are not thrilled about it, to be honest, but they have no choice,'' Mr. Fogel said. ''It's all they can afford.''
The vacancy rate among the 7,200 units, he says, is under 2 percent.
And there are signs that as demand picks up, prices will start to climb. In the last few months, sellers in Century Village have raised the average asking price to $50,000, up about $10,000 from last year.
Ben G. Schachter, the president of the on-site real estate company that handles South Florida's six largest 55-and-older communities, said the units were not going to speculators.
''These are being bought by people who expect to live in them,'' Mr. Schachter said. ''They're mostly buying for cash. It relieves them of having a mortgage payment as they get by on Social Security and fixed incomes.''
The communities offer a warm-weather routine of golf, shuffleboard, swimming, nightly shows, lectures, pottery classes and exercise groups.
Century Village in Boca has two synagogues, though no churches.
It is one of four Century Villages (the others are in Deerfield Beach, Pembroke Pines and West Palm Beach). Along with Kings Point and Wynmoor Village in Coconut Creek, these retirement communities -- the largest in South Florida -- help cushion the aging process with bus service to shopping malls and doctors' offices, as well as round-the-clock security.
One night, Ms. Shapira attended an event at the clubhouse, which includes a 1,250-seat theater, and watched as women stood on the dance floor wiggling their wrists back and forth to the music.
''I guess those were the only parts that worked,'' she said.
She has taken advantage of the clubhouse's fitness center, lifting weights and using a stationary bike.
George Handy, a 58-year-old retired state worker from New York, and his wife, Colleen, 57, a manager of a CVS drugstore, moved in three years ago, liked it and persuaded a friend to buy a unit in a nearby building.
The Handys have made friends with some of their elderly neighbors. When Anne Landau recently fell in her condo at 3 a.m. and could not get up, Mr. Handy went over and helped. And when Mr. Handy's car broke down, Ms. Landau's husband, Stanley, lent him theirs.
Ronny Solomon, 61, is an insurance agent from Toronto. For more than 30 years, his father, Morris, 88, has lived in Century Village in Deerfield Beach -- first part time and now full time.
About a year ago, Ronny Solomon asked his father to scout properties, and last spring he bought a two-bedroom, two-bath unit in the same building.
Ronny Solomon is not ready to retire. But a strong Canadian dollar made the deal too good to resist. ''You can have a property there and not worry about how you're going to spend your retirement,'' he said from Toronto.
Mr. Solomon and his wife, Susan, a salon executive, plan to spend ''Yom Kippur through Passover'' at their Florida condo.
''Eight or 10 years ago, I said I could never live there,'' he said. ''But you see it changing in the people on the sidewalks, on bikes, in the swimming pool -- it's in transition.''

HEADLINE: Joining the Bandwagon? Don't Lose Your Balance

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
STOCKS are back. And that could be dangerous.
''This is one of those moments,''said Louis S. Harvey, the president of Dalbar, a research firm in Boston. ''It's one of those times we warn about year after year.''
Mr. Harvey has been documenting inconsistencies in investor behavior for more than two decades, and he was one of the first people I called last week for some expert perspective on the exuberant stock market.
The Dow Jones industrial average set a new closing record on Tuesday -- and climbed even higher the next day, and the next day, and again the next. The Dow has risen nearly 10 percent in this young year alone. In the four years since stocks hit bottom in March 2009, their prices, on average, have more than doubled.
Already, fund flow data suggest that people who were frightened away from stocks after the catastrophe of 2008 have begun buying again this year. And no wonder. The stock market has been a marvel to behold. 
What would Mr. Harvey tell someone who wants to start buying now, after sitting on the sidelines for the last four years?
''I'd say, if you can reliably predict where the market's going, then jump in feet first -- just buy, buy, buy,'' he said. ''But if you don't know what the future will be,'' he added, caution is the wiser course. Before plunging into the market, he said, ''make sure that you select a reasonably defensive asset allocation strategy first.''
If stocks are irresistible to you, set up a balanced and diversified portfolio containing many different stocks and bonds, he continued. ''The most important thing, once you have a strategy,'' he said, ''is to find a way to actually stick with it.''
He has seen soaring stock markets before, and, for the typical mutual fund investor, they have often gone badly. When the market is already high, Dalbar has found, many people start to buy. When it's already fallen, they sell.
The dismal truth is that over the long run, the average person is a woeful investor, regularly losing money to more skillful traders. Dalbar performs an annual survey of actual investor returns in mutual funds, and compares them to the return of the overall market. He shared the latest, still unpublished figures with me. They tell a sorry story.
Over the last 20 years through December, the average return of all investors in United States stock mutual funds was 4.25 percent, annualized. Over the same period, the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned an annualized 8.21 percent. That's a huge gap -- nearly four percentage points a year over two decades.
I ran the numbers. A $10,000 investment at 4.25 percent would be worth $22,989 in 20 years. An investment in the S.& P. 500, at 8.21 percent, would be worth $48,456. The difference is a sobering $25,467.
Why is the gap so wide? One reason is that after fees and expenses, the average mutual fund manager doesn't beat the overall stock market, as many studies have shown. But that explains only part of the problem. The rest of it, Mr. Harvey said, is that investors themselves ''move their money in and out of the market at the wrong times.''
''They get excited or they panic,'' he added. ''And they hurt themselves.''
It's not that stocks are a bad idea in themselves. Holding a diversified group of stocks -- along with a broad collection of bonds -- has paid off for most long-term investors, Mr. Harvey and a large majority of strategists say. Stocks have outperformed bonds over the long term, while bonds have provided steady income and more reliable day-to-day returns.
Combining stocks and bonds, maybe with other assets, can create a less volatile portfolio, letting an investor sleep more peacefully. The question for most people isn't whether to own stocks. It's how to allocate them intelligently, as well as when to buy.
I asked Ed Yardeni, an independent economist and market strategist who has been bullish on stocks for four years, whether it makes sense to start buying now. ''Obviously, it would've been better to buy them in March 2009,'' he said. ''But buying now still makes sense if you believe we're in a secular bull market'' -- a market that will keep rising for a long time.
Mr. Yardeni assigned what he called ''a subjective probability'' of about 60 percent to that optimistic outcome. He said factors like growing energy independence in the United States and a ''technological revolution that has never stopped'' could help propel the domestic economy forward, bolstering corporate earnings growth and providing fundamental support for stocks. For the short term, he said, the expansive monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and other central banks is acting as a tonic for the stock market, and fear of disaster in Europe has abated.
But there is still a sizable risk that the economy and the market could unravel, he said. ''You want to be diversified,'' he said. ''You don't want to just hold stocks. Even so, he said: ''You do want to hold some stocks. You're getting nothing for cash, and at some point bond yields will rise and there will be big losses in the bond market.''
Individual investors may be buying stocks, but they are generally not irrationally euphoric, said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management. Schwab clients bailed out of stocks in such large numbers in the financial crisis, Mr. Aguilar said, that they still have ''about a 5 or 10 percent lower allocation to stocks'' now than they did in 2007, even though they have been net buyers since Jan. 1. New stock purchases have come from cash that was sitting idly, he said, not from bonds, implying that much more stock-buying may be ahead. While he urged caution, he said he remained bullish.
''There's still room for more purchases, within a sensible allocation strategy,'' he said.
AT Fidelity and Vanguard, the perspectives were quite similar.
Dirk Hofschire, senior vice president for asset allocation research at Fidelity Investments, says his firm believes that the economy is expanding and that stock returns over the next 5 to 20 years should be reasonably good. ''I don't want to give the impression that the market is off to the races,'' he said. ''But we think it makes sense to be holding stocks over the long term -- as long as they are in a diversified portfolio.''
Joseph H. Davis, head of the investment strategy group at Vanguard, said that ''chasing stock returns when the market is setting records is obviously not a smart strategy.'' He would urge anyone tempted to do that ''to consider what their risk tolerance really is -- and how they'd feel about their portfolio if we have another year like 2008 -- because even if it won't be exactly the same, something like it will eventually happen again.''
Mr. Harvey of Dalbar also suggested that investors try to keep the bad years in mind before committing heavily to stocks. ''It's easy to feel euphoric about new records,'' he said, ''but you don't want the regret of getting into the market at a time that appears to be less than optimal.''

HEADLINE: Student Debt and the Economy

 BODY:
The student loan debt crisis has become a drag on the economy. Younger Americans who are saddled with bankrupting payments -- or credit ratings damaged by delinquency -- are in no position to buy homes, save for retirement or start businesses. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently released a study showing just why many young people are being strangled by student loans. It found that 43 percent of 25-year-olds had student debt in 2012, an increase from 27 percent in 2004.
Unemployment and the collapse of household income in the recession only made the borrowing problem worse.
According to the new study, student debt almost tripled between 2004 and 2012, and is approaching $1 trillion, while the percentage of borrowers who were more than 90 days delinquent had risen to 17 percent, from 10 percent in 2004. In addition, student loan debt was the only kind of household debt that continued to rise through the Great Recession, and it is now the second largest after mortgage debt.
The student debt crisis has its roots in state cuts to higher education that began in the 1980s. By savaging support to the public colleges and universities that educate about 70 percent of the nation's students, the states forced up tuition, causing students to borrow steadily more. The Federal Reserve study estimates that nearly 18 percent of borrowers now have student loan debts of $25,000 to $50,000, and nearly 4 percent have balances greater than $100,000.
Distressed borrowers who financed their educations with federal student loans can get relief through the federal Income-Based Repayment program, which allows them to reduce their monthly payments based on their income. Another program, called Pay As You Earn, is limited to people who started borrowing during the recession. It also allows for lower payments, and borrowers who adhere to the payment arrangement can have their loans forgiven after 20 years -- or 10 years if they hold public service jobs.
But students who have taken out private loans from banks or other institutions are often stuck with high interest rates, high payments and few consumer protections. For example, one federal analysis of student payments in 2009 found that 10 percent of borrowers with private loans were spending more than 25 percent of their incomes in monthly payments.
Because private loans offer little flexibility, borrowers in bad straits have few options except default, which makes it difficult for them to get jobs or credit, or even to rent apartments. Refinancing a private student loan at a lower rate is rarely possible.
To get a handle on the student debt problem, the federal government needs to provide relief programs for private loan borrowers too. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced last month that it was soliciting ideas from policy makers and others for a plan that would give private loan borrowers some relief. Such a plan, which would most likely involve a public-private partnership that freed up capital for refinancing, would have to be part of any solution to the student debt crisis.

HEADLINE: Putting Corporate Cash to Work

 BODY:
What should successful companies do with their growing piles of cash? Apple, which has $140 billion on hand, is being forced to address this question by one of its prominent shareholders. 
David Einhorn, a well-known hedge fund manager, wants the company to return some of its cash to shareholders by issuing preferred shares that would pay guaranteed dividends. He sued the company and won a small victory recently but has not been able to force the company to adopt his specific proposal on how it should use its cash. Nonetheless, Apple's top executive, Tim Cook, has said the company is considering options, which could include raising its dividend or buying more shares.
Companies across America have the same problem -- if having too much money can be called a problem. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that publicly listed companies held an estimated $4.75 trillion in cash in 2012, up from just $1.2 trillion in 1995. Cash as a percentage of corporate assets has more than doubled to more than 12 percent, from less than 6 percent in the 1990s.
The size of corporate cash, which dipped briefly during the recent recession but is growing again, suggests that companies could be doing much more with their money -- especially since they are earning little by parking it in bank accounts or government bonds, given the historically low interest rates.
Some companies need to maintain substantial cash reserves to balance liabilities, like pension obligations. But for others, the reluctance to invest is less explicable. The growing cash pile is partly a testament to the profitability of companies like Apple, Google and General Electric that sell products and services to consumers and businesses around the world. But it is also the result of creative but legal tax strategies that allow companies to sell their goods and services from low-tax countries like Ireland and Luxembourg to avoid paying taxes in places like America and Britain.
The United States levies taxes on foreign profits of American companies, but only when the money is brought home. Companies can avoid paying taxes on their earnings for years by simply keeping the money in offshore bank accounts. By contrast, Americans working abroad have to pay taxes on their incomes even if they hold the money abroad.
Last year, President Obama proposed a minimum tax on American companies' foreign earnings as part of a broad overhaul of the corporate tax code that would have lowered the top rate to 28 percent from 35 percent. The proposal went nowhere, but analysts expect changes to corporate taxes to be on the table again this year as part of broader budget negotiations.
Some businesses have brazenly proposed that Congress temporarily lower the rate on repatriated profits in exchange for a promise to spend some of that cash on plants and equipment or in dividend payouts. It should not take a tax break for companies to get on with investing for the future. That is what they are supposed to be in business to do.

HEADLINE: Yes, We're Confident, But Who Knows Why

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller, professor of economics and finance at Yale, has collaborated with Barclays Bank on a family of indexes and investment products.

 BODY:
THE recovery in housing, the stock market and the overall economy has finally gained sustainable momentum -- or so it is said.
That opinion seems to be based on several salient facts. Unemployment has been declining, from 10.0 percent in October 2009 to 7.7 percent last month. More spectacularly, the stock market has more than doubled since 2009 and has been especially strong for the last six months, with the Dow Jones industrial average reaching record closing highs last week and the S.& P. 500 flirting with superlatives, too.
And the housing market, seasonally adjusted, has been rising. The S.& P./Case-Shiller 20-city home price index gained 7 percent in 2012.
These vital signs make many people believe that we've turned the corner on the economy, that we've started a healing process. And their discussions often note one particular sign of systemic recovery: confidence. There is considerable hope that the markets are heralding a major development: that Americans have lost the fears and foreboding that have made the financial crisis of 2008 so enduring in its effects. 
Hope is a wonderful thing. But we also need to remember that changes in the stock market, the housing market and the overall economy have relatively little to do with one another over years or decades. (We economists would say that they are only slightly correlated.) Furthermore, all three are subject to sharp turns. The economy is a complicated system, with many moving parts.
So, amid all those complications, there are other possibilities: Could we be approaching another major stock market peak? Will the housing market's takeoff be short-lived? And could we dip into another recession?
There are certainly risks. Congress is mired in struggles over the budget crisis and the national debt. The government is questioning the risk to taxpayers in its huge support of housing through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration and the Federal Reserve. Problems in Europe, Asia and the Middle East could easily shift people's confidence. There have been abrupt and significant changes in confidence in European markets since 2009. Is there any reason to think that the United States is immune to similar swings?
For years, I've been troubled by the problem of understanding the social psychology and economic impact of confidence. There hasn't been much research into the emotional factors and the shifts in worldview that drive major turning points. The much-quoted consumer sentiment and confidence indexes don't yet seem able to offer insight into what's behind the changes they quantify. It also isn't clear which factors of confidence drive the separate parts of the economy.
Along with colleagues, I have been conducting surveys about aspects of stock market confidence. For example, since 1989, with the help of some colleagues at Yale, I have been collecting data on the opinions and ideas of institutional investors and private individuals. These data, and indexes constructed from them, can be found on the Web site of the Yale School of Management.
I have called one of these indexes ''valuation confidence.'' It is the percentage of respondents who think that the stock market is not overvalued. Using the six-month moving average ended in February, it was running at 72 percent for institutional investors and 62 percent for individuals. That may sound like a ton of confidence, but it isn't as high as the roughly 80 percent recorded in both categories just before the market peak of 2007.
HOW do the these figures relate to other stock market measures? I rely on the measure of stock market valuation that Prof. John Campbell of Harvard and I developed more than 20 years ago. Called the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, or CAPE, this measure is the real, or inflation-adjusted, Standard & Poor's 500 index divided by a 10-year average of real S.& P. earnings. The CAPE has been high of late: it stands at 23, compared with a historical average of around 15. This suggests that the market is somewhat overpriced and might show below-average returns in the future. (The use of the 10-year average reduces the impact of short-run, or cyclical, components of earnings.)
For perspective, compare today's valuation, confidence and CAPE figures to those of other important recent periods in the stock market. In the spring of 2000, a sharp market peak, only 33 percent of institutional investors and 28 percent of individual investors thought that the market was not overvalued. The CAPE reached 46, a record high based on data going back to 1871. (For the period before 1926, we rely on data from Alfred Cowles 3rd & Associates.) Yet most respondents in 2000 thought that the market would go up in the next year, so they hung in for the time being. That suggests that the 1990s boom was indeed a bubble, with investors suspecting that they might have to beat a hasty exit. They ended up trying to do just that, and brought the market down.
But then consider the valuation confidence in October 2007, another major peak, after which the stock market fell by more than 50 percent in real terms. At that peak, the CAPE was at 27 -- a little higher than it is now, though not extraordinarily lofty. In 2007, valuation confidence was 82 percent for institutional investors and 74 percent for individual investors, or not far from today's levels. Investors at the time didn't think that they were floating on a bubble, and they saw the probability of a stock market crash as unusually low. Yet a plunge soon occurred. The cause appears not to have been so much the bursting of an overextended bubble but the subprime mortgage crisis and a string of financial failures that most investors couldn't have known about.
Clearly, confidence can change awfully fast, and people can suddenly start worrying about a stock market crash, just as they did after 2007.
Today, the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory changes may help prevent another crisis. Even so, regulators can't do much about some of the questionable thinking that seems to drive changes in confidence.
For example, why is a record high in the United States stock market a reason for optimism? Nothing is remarkable about reaching a market record: the S.& P. Composite Index has done it 1,007 times, based on daily closes, since the beginning of 1928. That's about once every 23 trading days, on average, though the new records tend to come in bunches.
The important fact is that we haven't set a nominal stock-market record in six years. And we haven't set one in 13 years if we use the inflation-corrected S.& P. Composite total-return index. That this index may be about to set a record means only that we haven't made any real money in the stock market in 13 years, which hardly seems a reason for confidence.
But public thinking is inscrutable. We can keep trying to understand it, but we'll be puzzled again the next time the markets or the economy make major moves.

 BODY:
THE MAN WITHIN MY HEAD, by Pico Iyer. (Vintage, $15.) This is a deeply felt meditation on the dual influences Iyer's father and Graham Greene exerted upon him. Iyer, a novelist, essayist and travel writer, follows Greene's trail from his first novel, ''The Man Within,'' to classics like ''The Quiet American,'' exploring ideas of love, faith and divided identity.
WISH YOU WERE HERE, by Graham Swift. (Vintage International, $15.95.) In Swift's searching, compassionate novel, a couple on the Isle of Wight are haunted by memories of a brother killed in Iraq. 
THE GREAT DIVERGENCE: America's Growing Inequality Crisis and What We Can Do About It, by Timothy Noah. (Bloomsbury Press, $16.) Over the past four decades, Noah writes, America has steadily become a land of haves and have-nots. This lucid, fair-minded book examines the principal influences on inequality -- including the decline of labor unions and rising competition with China, India and other low-wage countries -- and what it means for American society. In END THIS DEPRESSION NOW! (Norton, $15.95), Paul Krugman, the Princeton economist, New York Times columnist and Nobel laureate, offers a classical Keynesian remedy for our woes: a burst of government spending to compensate for the lack of private investment.
NO ONE IS HERE EXCEPT ALL OF US, by Ramona Ausubel. (Riverhead, $16.) Ausubel's fantastical first novel tells the story of a Jewish village in Romania in 1939. With war closing in, the community decides to ''start over'': in chapters echoing Genesis, time and history are forgotten as villagers conjure an alternate reality in which the world begins anew.
HONOR IN THE DUST: Theodore Roosevelt, War in the Philippines, and the Rise and Fall of America's Imperial Dream, by Gregg Jones. (New American Library, $16.) Jones provides a fascinating history of America's bloody attempt to annex the Philippines in the early 20th century. From Adm. George Dewey's naval victory in Manila Bay to Roosevelt's ascent to the presidency, '' 'Honor in the Dust' is less about the freedom of the Philippines than the soul of the United States,'' Candice Millard wrote here.
THE STARBOARD SEA, by Amber Dermont. (St. Martin's Griffin, $14.99.) Jason Prosper, a troubled young sailor and the narrator of Dermont's engrossing first novel, endures a harrowing year at a New England boarding school that specializes in second chances. ''The steady, restrained unmasking of Jason's history . . . is one of the novel's many achievements,'' our reviewer, Eleanor Henderson, said.
QUIET: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, by Susan Cain. (Broadway, $16.) Far from being ''a second-class personality trait,'' Cain argues in this intriguing work of social science and reportage, introversion is conducive to creativity, innovation, even leadership (see, for example, Rosa Parks, Dr. Seuss and Steve Wozniak).
EDGE OF DARK WATER, by Joe R. Lansdale. (Mulholland/Little, Brown, $14.99.) Set in East Texas during the Depression, Lansdale's Gothic tale concerns a feisty girl, her two best friends and her drug-addled mother, who push off down the river on a raft with stolen money -- and a posse of evil men at their backs.

LEAN INWomen, Work, and the Will to Lead
By Sheryl Sandberg with Nell Scovell228 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.95.
When I was an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School in the early '90s, I tried to explain to a prominent senior colleague why I had not yet managed to write one of the 10 or so articles required to get tenure in three years. He listened to me, then said, ''Journals don't publish excuses.'' 
It's a lesson that comes through loud and clear in Sheryl Sandberg's new book, ''Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.'' Her point, in a nutshell, is that notwithstanding the many gender biases that still operate all over the workplace, excuses and justifications won't get women anywhere. Instead, believe in yourself, give it your all, ''lean in'' and ''don't leave before you leave'' -- which is to say, don't doubt your ability to combine work and family and thus edge yourself out of plum assignments before you even have a baby. Leaning in can promote a virtuous circle: you assume you can juggle work and family, you step forward, you succeed professionally, and then you're in a better position to ask for what you need and to make changes that could benefit others.
No one who reads this book will ever doubt that Sandberg herself has the will to lead, not to mention the requisite commitment, intelligence and ferocious work ethic. Sandberg has been the chief operating officer of Facebook since 2008. At 43, she has already had a storied career: research assistant to Lawrence Summers at the World Bank; management consultant at McKinsey; chief of staff to Summers at the Treasury Department; and six and a half years at Google, where she rose to the post of vice president of global online sales and operations. She has also made it to the top of the notoriously male-dominated world of Silicon Valley, where the paucity of women among the ranks of computer scientists and engineers is still all too visible.
Sandberg is not just tough, however. She also comes across as compassionate, funny, honest and likable. Indeed, although she refers early on in the book to a study showing that for men success and likability are positively correlated, whereas for women they are inversely correlated, she manages to beat that bum rap. (Who can forget when Barack Obama, in one of his few slips on the 2008 campaign trail, said patronizingly to his chief rival: ''You're likable enough, Hillary''?) Sandberg's advice to young women to be more ambitious, which can sound like a finger-wagging admonishment when taken out of context, is framed here in more encouraging terms -- ''What would you do if you weren't afraid?'' -- addressing the self-doubt that still holds many women back.
Most important, Sandberg is willing to draw the curtain aside on her own insecurities. She describes the many times in her career when she was deeply unsure of herself, and the uncertainty that has never entirely gone away:
''I still face situations that I fear are beyond my capabilities. I still have days when I feel like a fraud. And I still sometimes find myself spoken over and discounted while men sitting next to me are not. But now I know how to take a deep breath and keep my hand up. I have learned to sit at the table.''
Sandberg quotes other powerful women sharing their own insecurities, including a wonderful anecdote from Virginia Rometty, the first female chief executive officer of I.B.M. As Sandberg tells the story, Rometty was offered a ''big job'' early in her career, but she worried she might not have the proper experience. So she told the recruiter she would have to think it over. When she discussed the offer with her husband, he pointed out, ''Do you think a man would ever have answered that question that way?'' It all comes down to confidence, Sandberg suggests, and it is easier to be confident if you realize that your role models have plenty of doubts of their own.
Sandberg's career as a feminist champion began with her 2010 TED talk, in which she first laid out her lean-in message. She followed up with a commencement address to the Barnard class of 2011. Both went viral. ''Lean In'' builds on the themes of these earlier talks, bolstered by extensive references to scholarly works and popular literature. She advises women to ''make your partner a real partner,'' recalling how she and her husband set patterns early on in their relationship that made them genuine equals when it came to child care. Her phrase ''It's a jungle gym, not a ladder'' describes the many different paths careers can take, sideways and even downward on their way up. She also shares Eric Schmidt's advice to her when she was considering a job offer at Google, which was a less attractive option than others she had at the time: ''Only one criterion mattered when picking a job -- fast growth.'' Sandberg connects this to the value of personal growth, even when, or especially when, you are afraid.
''Lean In'' is full of many such gems, slogans that ambitious women would do well to pin up on their wall. Figure out what you want to do before you meet with the people who can hire you. Ask yourself constantly: ''How can I do better? What am I doing that I don't know? What am I not doing that I don't see?'' ''Done is better than perfect.'' And many readers will enjoy the glimpse into the lives of the rich and famous that Sandberg affords. Head lice are an all-too-frequent and upsetting part of parenting, but when Sandberg discovered her two children had them, they were all flying to a business conference on the corporate jet of John Donahoe, the C.E.O. of eBay.
Inevitable questions of privilege aside, many parents will think, as I did, that this is a young woman's book. Indeed, I nodded in recognition at so much of what Sandberg recounts, page after page, remembering my own early professional experiences and looking back to the days when my children were 5 and 3 (the age when they complain that they don't see enough of you, rather than wanting you to get out of their face). This is also the book of someone who has never met a challenge she couldn't surmount by working harder and believing in herself. But for the 229 missing female Fortune 500 leaders, as well as the hundreds of thousands of women who should be occupying lower-level leadership positions but aren't, the problem is not leaning back but encountering a tipping point, a situation in which what was once a manageable and enjoyable work-family balance can no longer be sustained -- regardless of ambition, confidence or even an equal partner. Sandberg is right to say that it is easier to handle work-family conflicts from as high a position on the career ladder as possible, but if in fact it's the tipping points that tip women out of the work force, or at least prevent them from rising, then no amount of psychological coaching will make a difference.
That is the real debate here, and it's an important one. Sandberg puts her finger on it when she writes: ''For decades, we have focused on giving women the choice to work inside or outside the home. . . . But we have to ask ourselves if we have become so focused on supporting personal choices that we're failing to encourage women to aspire to leadership.'' This view accords with some of the findings of the Princeton Steering Committee on Undergraduate Women's Leadership, which concluded in a March 2011 report that young women at Princeton often did not put themselves forward for leadership positions and were sometimes actively discouraged by others when they did. The Princeton committee also found that ''the start counts,'' meaning that the first few weeks on campus are crucial for women: an early willingness to step forward as a leader will lay the groundwork for future opportunities.
Still, after the start comes a very long road, with lots of bumps and what the law professor Joan Williams calls ''the maternal wall'' smack in the middle of it. Sandberg's approach, as important as it is, is at best half a loaf. Moreover, given her positions first at Google and now at Facebook, it is hard not to notice that her narrative is what corporate America wants to hear. For both the women who have made it and the men who work with them, it is cheaper and more comfortable to believe that what they need to do is simply urge younger women to be more like them, to think differently and negotiate more effectively, rather than make major changes in the way their companies work. Young women might be much more willing to lean in if they saw better models and possibilities of fitting work and life together: ways of slowing down for a while but still staying on a long-term promotion track; of getting work done on their own time rather than according to a fixed schedule; of being affirmed daily in their roles both as parents and as professionals.
Some workplaces are beginning to make these changes. The Boston Consulting Group, for instance, has discovered the value of predictable time off every week, which leads team members to work much more collaboratively in ways that support one another's needs. As documented in ''Sleeping With Your Smartphone,'' by the Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow, this approach has required a deep cultural change for consultants used to a 24/7 environment, as well as a commitment from management. But the business benefits have proved their financial and psychological worth. Other examples include the adoption of a Results Only Work Environment, which grants employees complete flexibility as to when, where and how they work, as long as they get their work done.
So is the dearth of women in top jobs due to a lack of ambition or a lack of support? Both, as Sandberg herself grants, proposing that women should ''wage battles on both fronts.'' Yet she chooses to concentrate only on the ''internal obstacles,'' the ways in which women hold themselves back. This is unfortunate. As a feminist and a corporate leader, Sandberg seems ideally placed to ask the question that all too often gets lost amid the welter of talk about what women should do, what they should want and how they should behave. When it comes to ensuring that caregivers still have paths to the corner office, how can business lean in?

 BODY:
Is anti-science sentiment threatening public health policy?
To the Editor:
Thirty-five years ago I was a harried pediatric intern in a New York City emergency room. One night, I paged a neurosurgeon for an urgent consultation. He swooped in with a lighted cigarette and leaned over the child to begin his exam. I politely asked him to extinguish his cigarette; he was dripping ashes on my frightened patient.
Hard to believe, by today's standards. For almost 20 years, bans on smoking in hospitals have not only protected patients from secondhand smoke, but also inspired hospital employees to quit smoking at higher rates than in other industries. What's behind this dramatic change?
Science. Scientific knowledge, relentlessly promulgated through public health campaigns over many decades, alters behavioral norms. In 1964 Surgeon General Luther L. Terry knocked the Marlboro man off his horse when he announced that smoking causes lung and laryngeal cancer in men. Thirty-one Surgeon General's Reports on smoking later, cigarette smoking is far from eradicated; yet smokers, who once felt glamorous, are now forced to confront the health hazards of their habit. 
Similar claims of progress can be made in other spheres of public health, where robust scientific data have led to strong public policy: highway traffic safety, immunizations, H.I.V./AIDS, sudden infant death syndrome and childhood lead poisoning, to name a few.
But a disturbing trend threatens future public health initiatives. At the heart of successful public policy lies a shared, bipartisan assumption that science is trustworthy. Lately, politicians unashamedly issue proclamations tantamount to declaring, The world is flat. Climate change is a hoax. Vaccines cause autism. Intelligent design should be taught in biology class alongside evolution. The United States has the best health outcomes in the world.
In public health, knowledge is truly power. If politicians no longer agree that sound scientific knowledge is valid, our nation's health will suffer for decades -- or centuries -- to come.
ROBIN WEISS Baltimore, March 4, 2013
The writer is a psychiatrist in private practice, a pediatrician and a former senior staff member at the Institute of Medicine.
Readers React
I am as dismayed as Dr. Weiss at what seems to be a growing disrespect for science. But let's be clear about what's going on -- the rejection of science is often just a symptom of something else entirely. The surgeon general may have ''knocked the Marlboro man off his horse'' in 1964, but that didn't stop the tobacco industry from spending the next few decades lying to us to protect its profits. Not only did cigarette makers deny the data when they knew better, they were actually using the science to addict their customers more efficiently.
Likewise, the idea that ''climate change is a hoax'' didn't come from legitimate skeptics; it was oil industry propaganda, paid for by oil industry profits, which also finance the campaigns of pro-oil-industry politicians. There is no real controversy about climate change -- there is only science on the one hand, and money on the other.
There is also no real controversy about the likely outcome of purchasing a handgun. The data clearly show that it is much more likely to be used in murder, suicide or tragic accident than for self-defense, but that scientific fact has been buried under an avalanche of pro-gun propaganda disguised as Second Amendment advocacy.
So while I agree with Dr. Weiss that public health policy depends on good science, I don't think there is any serious disagreement that scientific knowledge is valid. There is, however, widespread corruption, and a willingness on the part of politicians to say anything, no matter how unscientific, to keep the money rolling in.
DAVID BERMAN New York, March 6, 2013
Dr. Weiss bemoans the anti-science declarations of politicians. In fact, the damage is far beyond mere words.
Public support for science and scientific research in the United States has declined dramatically. Our biomedical research establishment, once the most productive in the world, is on the edge of collapse because of lack of support. One major consequence of science's starvation is a disincentive for the college-educated to pursue a career in science.
The chance of getting a research grant is at an all-time low. Experienced lab directors spend enormous amounts of time that should be devoted to research in a (usually vain) attempt to find funds to support their research and trainees. Productive laboratories are going out of existence. Faculty positions in science are dwindling.
When college graduates are being offered high starting salaries in the financial world, along with the anticipation of becoming millionaires, who would go into science, with a decade or more of training and intensive study for minimal salary, with the anticipation of being unemployed or underemployed at the end?
President Obama has proposed ''mapping'' the human brain. Who is going to do the work?
DAVID A. GREENBERG Columbus, Ohio, March 6, 2013
The writer is director of neurogenetics at Battelle Center for Mathematical Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital.
Dr. Weiss makes an important point: public health and science policy will suffer at the hands of anti-science elected officials. Republicans seem to view the House Science, Space and Technology Committee as an unwelcome stepchild. Paul Broun, a Republican member, made this direct attack on science at a private (but recorded) event last September: ''All that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and the Big Bang theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of hell.''
Dr. Broun, who is a physician, added: ''You see, there are a lot of scientific data that I've found out as a scientist that actually show that this is really a young Earth. I don't believe that the earth's but about 9,000 years old. I believe it was created in six days as we know them. That's what the Bible says.''
JAMES R. COLEMAN Watertown, Mass., March 6, 2013
Dr. Weiss has correctly identified a significant problem in American society: the malignant distrust of science that prevails today among a major sector of our population. This sentiment, reminiscent of the Dark Ages, percolated to the surface during George W. Bush's administration, when antipathy toward stem-cell research and a reversion to teaching creationism in our schools to the exclusion of evolution were promoted by many Republicans.
The ascendancy of religious extremism is the source of the problem. I do not begrudge any religions the tenets and beliefs they hold sacred, but they do not have the right to impose these beliefs on me. The United States must restore separation of church and state to regain the scientific hegemony we once enjoyed but have now lost to the nations of Asia that are not beholden to the restrictions imposed by religious zealots.
BILL GOTTDENKER Mountainside, N.J., March 6, 2013
Dr. Weiss correctly notes widespread anti-knowledge views, but inadvertently perpetuates the true problem by contributing to the politicization of science. Politicians are largely a reflection of widespread scientific illiteracy among constituents.
Implicitly, Dr. Weiss advocates coercive, punitive and confiscatory actions based upon (alleged) scientific consensus. Some broadly accepted scientific conclusions have turned out to be wrong, and others have been used to justify unthinkable evil (eugenics, for example).
The commingling of science and politics has engendered as much public disaster as it has public good.
Dr. Weiss says, ''In public health, knowledge is truly power.'' Not quite. Instead, it is just power that is power. The implicit argument presented is that science is inherently moral as well as infallible. That's dangerously wrong.
CHARLES NOVINS Toms River, N.J., March 6, 2013
Threats to science-based policy and education are not a novel trend. The tobacco industry's response to the antismoking campaign was a full-scale laboratory for all the modern denialist tactics employed today by those whose industries or beliefs are threatened by science.
The industry memorably set up the Tobacco Institute, whose tame ''scientists'' produced report after report purporting to debunk the surgeon general's warnings. Those reports were perfect parodies of actual science, magnifying and exploiting small ambiguities in evidence to undermine the unwelcome conclusions that would otherwise be forced by that evidence. They were used systematically as weapons to defeat scores of liability cases against tobacco companies. This campaign was far more successful, for far longer, than one might infer from Dr. Weiss's tribute to the antismoking campaign.
In funding, organization and tactics, modern efforts by climate-change denialists to discredit peer-reviewed science on behalf of the coal and oil industries tread the path blazed by the Tobacco Institute. Unfortunately, these sorts of appeals to credulousness and self-interest have a proven record of success.
CARLO GRAZIANI Chicago, March 6, 2013
The writer is a research scientist in the department of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago.
During the late 1950s and early 1960s, our concern as a nation was Communism and the cold war. We developed technology, including that which put men on the moon, as part of our arms race with the Soviet Union. Funding such work required public enthusiasm for science. Hence, our politicians extolled scientific research and, in the name of national security and national pride, the public followed along.
Today, advances in science are funded for the most part by private investors. Research in new computer technology, for instance, promises much profit to entrepreneurs.
The takeaway is that a public commitment to science is predicated on national political and economic goals. The creationists, climate change deniers and others who reject the findings of science have always been out there -- witness the Scopes trial -- but were eclipsed in the '50s and '60s because of political realities that propelled scientific advances. Not so today.
When climate change begins to cost the public real money, we will see the influence of the deniers recede. Representative Eric Cantor will not apologize for the anti-science crowd when Virginia Beach is underwater.
We will always have a Flat Earth Society. What we need is a political society motivated by common scientific goals; unfortunately, that won't happen until the economy or concern about national security give interest in science a jump-start.
RITA C. TOBIN Chappaqua, N.Y., March 6, 2013
We would be very lucky if the problem were simply one of ignorance. In fact, however, as the history of Big Tobacco makes so clear, sustaining doubt about the known -- for example, whether cigarettes are linked to lung cancer -- was a deliberate, extremely well-financed and well-organized campaign. ''Experts'' and their institutions were paid large sums to write articles that suggested there was still a question; members of Congress were similarly recruited.
Doubt about the proven doesn't just happen. It has to be carefully taught. And bought.
HENRY GREENSPAN Ann Arbor, Mich., March 6, 2013
The Writer Responds
Mr. Berman is correct that industry has created pernicious obstacles to public health campaigns when they interfere with profits. The National Rifle Association (and its industry supporters) has been particularly savvy about the threat scientific information poses to its goals: It successfully lobbied Congress in 1996 to block funding for gun research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. President Obama lifted the ban in January.
Yet pro-industry propaganda and corruption, which have been constants for decades, are not the whole story. Mr. Gottdenker powerfully captures the mood, calling forth the Dark Ages, that has gained a stronghold in the country, and therefore among our elected officials. Mr. Coleman quotes one representative in flagrant disregard of First Amendment separation of church and state -- a trespass that is all too common among lawmakers these days.
Those are some symptoms; what's the treatment?
My own experience formulating AIDS policy at the Institute of Medicine in the 1980s convinced me that the majority of Americans are reasonable, and respond to enlightened scientific leadership.
In 1988, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, a Republican appointed by Ronald Reagan, mailed more than 100 million AIDS educational brochures -- one to each family in the United States. He had become convinced that knowledge about H.I.V. transmission could equip each citizen to avoid infection and stay alive.
We desperately need brave, visible scientific leadership now, from both political parties, to step up and correct our course.

HEADLINE: Your Personal Austerity Program . . .

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Last month, I visited the southern New Jersey plant of the Robard Corporation, a company that makes meal-replacement products for dieters. Robard's president, Robert Schwartz, took me to the factory floor, where huge vats of powders -- proteins, flavoring ingredients, vitamins -- are poured into a 450-gallon V-shaped industrial mixer. The ingredients are then spun together and turned into protein shakes that sell for around $3.50 a serving. As I watched this process, it seemed as if Robard were in the world's easiest business: take dirt-cheap raw materials, mix them together and sell them at a huge markup to America's tens of millions of desperate dieters, like me.
I have spent much of my adulthood overweight, often obese and fruitlessly following all sorts of diet programs. Last year, however, I decided to try a new approach. I purposely didn't apply the latest in nutritional science. (Over the years, many experts have told me that we still don't have enough data to know definitively which diets work best.) Instead, I used economics to pick a diet that would work best for me. More specifically, I used the game theory that economists applied during the cold war. 
The idea first came to me a few years ago when I was talking to the economist Thomas Schelling, who is best known for formalizing the logic behind the mutually-assured-destruction strategy. His work showed that combatants in a conflict can actually strengthen their position by restricting their choices. During the cold war, Schelling wrote, the United States placed a calculated number of soldiers in Western Europe -- not enough to directly repel a Soviet attack but enough to make clear that it was committed to military action if one occurred. Schelling referred to this strategy as ''commitment,'' and he told me that the idea dated back to the ancient Greek philosopher and soldier Xenophon, whose writings guided Alexander the Great in his conquests. Xenophon argued that a general can strengthen his army's position, perhaps counterintuitively, by doing battle next to a dangerous cliff. His soldiers, after all, would only have two choices: fight or die. The army farther from the cliff had a third option: to flee. This extra option, he said, made it less likely to persevere.
During our conversation, Schelling said that he eventually applied this theory to his struggle to quit smoking. He wanted to think of it as a battle with two choices -- quit or die of cancer -- but his nicotine-addled brain kept coming up with a third option: sneak one more cigarette and quit later. Of course, later never came. (''I was quitting for 20 years,'' he said.) This theory also applies to weight loss. For years, I've known that the only way to lose weight was to permanently change my diet and exercise habits. But I was awfully good at coming up with third options, like buying diet books or eating Atkins bars that made me feel as if I were on the verge of weight loss even if I never jogged or ordered salads.
As I surveyed all my dieting options this time around, I realized that many companies based their entire business models on the impulse to believe in a magical third option. (Their marketing materials usually include the words ''miracle,'' ''easy'' or ''suggested by Dr. Oz.'') I found it easy to dismiss the idea that a few capsules of capsicum powder or some green-coffee-bean extract would allow me to continue to eat my favorite poppy-seed poundcake and still lose weight, but I was susceptible to other products that marketed the same option in a different way. I ate two big cups of ''fat free'' frozen yogurt almost every day. Whenever I ate a huge beef burrito, I ordered a Diet Coke.
There is another class of products, I noticed, that have a related business model. They were not preying on my impulses to find a third way, but they still made money whether I lost weight or not. All those Slim-Fast shakes, Atkins bars and meal replacements may help some people lose weight, but much of the companies' revenue comes from people who try and fail continuously or people who only want to create the illusion they are dieting. My desk was filled with books written by experts from the Mayo Clinic and Harvard. They contained useful information, but, for me, they acted like a miracle totem. I felt good about myself for buying them, but I never lost a pound.
Similarly, Weight Watchers makes much of its money by providing good information, a supportive atmosphere and satisfying low-cal foods. But the company also makes money -- at least they did from me -- by auto-charging my credit card each month even when I wasn't going to meetings or losing weight. Like Slim-Fast shakes and big scientific books, it still caters to a broader market of people who may say that they're hoping to lose weight but are just going through the motions. Eventually, my Weight Watchers commitment was no different from paying gym dues and never working out. I kept paying because canceling would be an admission of defeat. My denial earned them $39.95 a month.
So, this time, I wanted a company that made a commitment. I couldn't find any programs that offered a money-back guarantee, but I was happy to learn about New York University's Medical Weight Loss Management Program. On my first day, my doctor, Holly F. Lofton, made clear that I would have to commit to a big program: 10 or 24 weeks on a low-calorie diet consisting primarily of Robard meal-replacement shakes. If I followed the plan, she said, I could lose three to five pounds a week. There was no third, easy option.
During my weight loss, I became fascinated by the Robard Corporation's business plan. Why would any company, I wondered, restrict its sales to a relatively few clinics rather than sell its products in every drugstore in the country? The program also put up other barriers to making money. They would sell me only enough protein powder to last to the next weigh-in, and it was a pain to trudge over to Lofton's office each week. I tried to cheat and looked online for Robard's products or a substitutable product from a competitor, but there wasn't anything comparable.
This, I realized, was the financial commitment. Unlike Atkins or Dr. Oz-approved products, Robard is not focusing on consumers who make guilt-reducing impulse buys. The company is technically a manufacturer, and its main revenue comes from its powders. Its growth, however, is predicated on persuading doctors to make long-term results-based commitments. Robard provides its medical customers with free services, from individualized training to an annual conference on developments in weight-loss science. In order to charge its large markup, Robard needs to ensure that its research services are tremendously valuable. The company's financial incentives, in other words, were in line with my own personal goals. So far, I've lost 60 pounds.
But aligning financial incentives with people who actually want to lose weight is not the best business strategy. John LaRosa, an analyst at Marketdata Enterprises, said Robard was one of a handful of companies, like Health Management Resources and the Center for Medical Weight Loss, that competed for a share of a relatively small market. Altogether, these meal-replacement clinics make around $400 million a year. Diet books and exercise videos, by contrast, make nearly three times as much. The real money, of course, is in the third, easy, magical-option category. All those diet bars, green-coffee-bean-extract capsules and other supplements earn close to $3 billion a year. Diet soda alone is a $21 billion business. Game theory suggests that if you want to truly change your behavior, commit and close off those options. But as basic marketing makes clear, the real money is still in the fantasy business.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Doctors can't tell you exactly how to lose weight.
2. Maybe economists can help.
3. The weight-loss industry pales in comparison to the one that helps people not lose weight.

HEADLINE: How My Mother Planned to Outwork Death

BYLINE: By JACOB BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
At 10 p.m. on a Friday night in a private room on the 14th Floor of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital on 68th and York Avenue, my mother was lying in her bed hallucinating, in that dream space people go on their way to being gone.
She spoke of seeing trees, possibly a forest. And she mentioned to Nick, my stepfather, that she had been to the theater where her play was showing and that the audience was full. In reality, she had not left the hospital in a month, and the play, ''Lucky Guy,'' was nearly a year away from opening.
My brother, Max, and I stood there in disbelief. Though it had been weeks since her blood count showed any sign of improvement, the gravity of the situation had crept up on us. Mom's housekeeper, Linda Diaz, who had worked for her for 25 years, was in the corner sobbing.
At some point, a team of doctors and nurses arrived to assess the situation, and Mom became slightly more lucid. 
''Can you tell me your name?'' one of them asked.
''Nora Ephron,'' she said, nodding.
''Can you tell me where you are?''
''New York Hospital.''
''Who is the president of the United States?''
At this point, my mother looked annoyed, gave a roll of the eyes and refused to answer the question, which later on was the source of some debate between Max and me about whether her sarcasm and humor remained even as her memory and focus faded or whether she was simply irritated at being treated like an infant.
A few hours later, after falling asleep for a short time, she woke up, ate ice cream with Max and me and was able to talk with some coherence about Jerry Sandusky's conviction earlier that day.
When Max said, ''Mom, I'm going to miss you so much,'' she said: ''Miss me? Well, I'm not dead yet.''
For most of the next three days, before she entered a coma and died, she was sort of herself, asking for the papers and doing the crossword. On Sunday, one of the nurses arrived to give her medication and innocently asked if she was planning on writing about what was happening to her. My mother simply said, ''No.''
I took this more or less at face value until after her death, as plans moved forward with her play ''Lucky Guy,'' and it occurred to me that part of what she was trying to do by writing about someone else's death was to understand her own.
Illness, and how a person handles it, was not the first thing on my mom's mind when she began writing ''Lucky Guy'' back in 1999. At that point, she wasn't even sick.
Based on real events, ''Lucky Guy'' is about a tabloid journalist named Mike McAlary. In the early '90s, he became one of the highest-paid newspaper columnists in the country. Crime was still rampant in New York, and the Internet had not yet destroyed the economics of the newspaper business. My mother said that she saw his career as ''the end of something,'' a bookend to a time when reporters could still believe there was power in the job; when Elaine's was still one of the city's most glamorous rooms; when much of Times Square still belonged to prostitutes and drug dealers; and when the West Village had not yet been taken over by hedge-fund magnates and Russian oligarchs.
My mother knew a lot about McAlary's world. She dreamed of being a newspaper reporter from the time she was in high school, and wound up spending much of her 20s working at The New York Post. Moreover, McAlary was what she liked to call ''a problematic human being.'' And after a decade of writing and directing romantic comedies, a lead character who wasn't entirely likable seemed like a good way to keep herself from getting boxed in.
The project, however, kept getting sidelined. There was a movie, ''Bewitched.'' And a play Off Broadway, ''Love, Loss, and What I Wore,'' which she wrote with her sister Delia. Then another movie, as well as two anthologies of her essays. Another problem she kept running into: She'd conceived ''Lucky Guy'' (then called ''Stories About McAlary'') as a film for HBO, but the structure was unconventional, relying largely on the other characters to tell their versions of what happened to him, essentially breaking the fourth wall. And everyone, including her, was unsure of how it was going to work on-screen.
Then in 2008, Colin Callender, the man guiding the development of ''Lucky Guy'' at HBO, left the network. Callender had taken a personal interest in the project because he'd known McAlary. Shortly after striking out on his own as an independent producer, he called my mother with a new idea: What if her script was not a movie but a play, where characters regularly talk to the audience?
Two weeks later, she handed him a new draft. By this time, there was something else pulling her toward McAlary as well.
McAlary got the scoop of his life just nine months after receiving a diagnosis of advanced colon cancer. In 1997, he wrote the story of a Haitian immigrant named Abner Louima who was brutally assaulted by a New York City police officer. In the spring of 1998, McAlary won the Pulitzer Prize for his work. On Christmas of that same year, he died at 41. Shortly before his death, he was quoted as saying: ''If you are a doctor or a lawyer, you take the case. If you're a reporter, you write the story. I didn't think about being sick.''
When Mom returned to working on the script in 2008, this was something she knew all about, though it was a secret confined to a tiny group of people: my stepfather, my brother, her sisters, a couple of close friends and me.
In late 2005, my mother went to see her doctor because she had been feeling, as she later told me, ''punky.'' She had always been a little anemic, but now, she appeared to be getting worse, with fevers and inexplicable infections. After years of seeing a trainer two to three times a week and being pretty fit for a woman in her mid-60s, she found herself dreading having to climb stairs.
She eventually made her way to J. Gregory Mears, a hematologist at Columbia University, who quickly gave her a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, an aggressive blood disorder that destroys the body's ability to make healthy blood cells and ward off infections. The only known cure for it is a stem-cell transplant, but stem-cell transplants are especially difficult in older patients. Among other potential complications, the body may reject the donor cells or develop graft-versus-host disease, in which the transplanted cells can attack the patient.
This is what happened to Susan Sontag, who also died of acute myeloid leukemia brought on by MDS, and had many of the same doctors as my mother. Discussing the aftermath of her unsuccessful transplant in an article for this magazine in 2005, Sontag's son, David Rieff, wrote, ''To me 'torture' is not too strong or hyperbolic a word.''
My mother had seen her closest friend, Judy Corman, go through a series of increasingly painful treatments that didn't do much but extend her suffering from the cancer that eventually killed her. Between watching this and reading about what happened to Sontag, Mom became unambiguous in her opposition to testing fate, to gambling away comfort for the remote possibility of being cured. She was determined to have a ''good death.''
I'm not sure what would have happened had a stem-cell transplant been a viable option  -- if her sisters had been a match, for instance -- but thankfully, it didn't come to that. Soon after my mother went to see Mears, Jerome Groopman, a doctor at Harvard with extensive experience in treating cancer, was called in for a second opinion. After running a series of tests, he concluded that she quite likely had an unusual variant of MDS, which could be treated with less drastic measures.
Over time, the worry I felt when she first told me about the disease began to fade. We knew the statistics, but statistics -- as Alice McAlary recounted to Mom about her husband, Mike -- get you only so far. Besides, my mother had never been ordinary.
A moderate dose of prednisone helped stabilize her blood count for a couple of years. When the prednisone stopped working, she went to see Stephen Nimer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. He put her on Vidaza, a low-dose form of chemotherapy with few side effects. Along with monthly blood transfusions, it effectively controlled the disease for two years.
Then while on a trip in the South of France in 2010, she went swimming and felt something stab her arm. She believed she had been stung by a jellyfish but was not sure. A few weeks later, she wound up in a hospital in Los Angeles with an inexplicable bacterial infection that led to a bump on her arm the size of a tangerine. Miraculously, when she got out, she was transfusion-independent. Her doctors had no idea what had happened, except to speculate that her bone marrow responded to a threat in an unusually dramatic way and was now producing healthy blood cells and platelets. My mother was not one to go in for superstition or miracles -- godlessness was for her a form of religion, a belief in self-sufficiency above all else -- but she was near certain her recovery had something to do with the jellyfish.
At various points over the years, she considered coming clean to her friends and colleagues about her illness. But she knew the effect it could have on her career. Certainly, she could continue writing books and essays. But getting a movie made would be impossible, because no insurance company would sign off on it. Arguably, she could do a play, but bringing it to Broadway would be difficult, given that the development process takes years. Beyond that, what my mother didn't want was to have her illness define her, turning every conversation into a series of ''how are you?''s.
All her life, she subscribed to the belief that ''everything is copy,'' a phrase her mother, Phoebe, used to say. In fact, when Phoebe was on her deathbed, she told my mother, ''Take notes.'' She did. What both of them believed was that writing has the power to turn the bad things that happen to you into art (although ''art'' was a word she hated). ''When you slip on a banana peel, people laugh at you; but when you tell people you slipped on a banana peel, it's your laugh,'' she wrote in her anthology ''I Feel Bad About My Neck.'' ''So you become the hero rather than the victim of the joke.''
And she applied that maxim everywhere. She wrote a magazine article about The New York Post and her former boss there, Dorothy Schiff (''It is a terrible newspaper. The reason it is, of course, is Dorothy Schiff''); her breasts (''If I had them I would have been a completely different person''); even getting fat injections in her lips (''I looked like a Ubangi, so I never did it again''). There was also an entire book and movie devoted to her divorce from my father. (But never mind that.)
The thing is, you can't really turn a fatal illness into a joke. It is almost the only disclosure that turns you into the victim rather than the hero of your story. For her, tragedy was a pit of clichés. So she stayed quiet, though clues were sprinkled through much of what she wrote during the six years she was sick.
They were there in ''I Feel Bad About My Neck'': ''Death is a sniper. It strikes people you love, people you like, people you know, it's everywhere. You could be next. But then you turn out not to be. But then again you could be.''
They were there in ''I Remember Nothing'': ''The realization that I may have only a few good years remaining has hit me with real force, and I have done a lot of thinking as a result. I would like to have come up with something profound, but I haven't. I try to figure out what I really want to do every day, I try to say to myself, If this is one of the last days of my life, am I doing exactly what I want to be doing? I am low. My idea of a perfect day is a frozen custard from Shake Shack and a walk in the park. (Followed by a Lactaid).''
And they were there in her last edits of ''Lucky Guy,'' the final piece of work she completed.
My mother didn't know Mike McAlary personally, but she was certainly familiar with his kind. And what details she didn't know were quickly filled in by his friends, colleagues and relatives, almost all of whom she interviewed.
McAlary was born in Oahu, Hawaii, and he grew up in Goffstown, N.H. After graduating from Syracuse University, he went to work at The Boston Herald American, covering sports, then eventually scored a job at New York Newsday. There, he made a name for himself as a particularly aggressive reporter, covering crime and police corruption. After that he began to bounce back and forth between The New York Daily News and The New York Post, getting bigger and better contracts each time he made a move.
In 1993, he broke his contract with The Daily News to become the highest paid reporter at The Post, with a salary of $945,750 over three years. The Daily News was granted a preliminary injunction that prevented him from making the move, and McAlary wound up with too much time on his hands. After a night out at a Yankees game, he totaled his car on the F.D.R. Drive. His injuries were so serious that he spent several days in a coma and a month in the hospital. Rupert Murdoch, who hired him at The Post, never called or came to see him. But Mort Zuckerman, who owned The News, did. So he stayed at The News.
Not long after McAlary returned to work, he made a career-killing mistake. A woman in Prospect Park had reported being raped, but McAlary's sources had doubts. He was told that the results of the rape kit had come back negative for sperm, that it was only a matter of time before she was found out. But the most crucial points in McAlary's stories turned out to be wrong. The woman had been raped. What the source didn't realize was that no sperm didn't necessarily mean no semen. McAlary had made no attempt to speak with the victim herself, an act of laziness that his supporters believed was partially attributable to his accident.
The News reduced the frequency of his column. The official explanation was that he was writing his novel. It was around this time that he began to get sick. He was jaundiced and losing weight. In conversations, he seemed dazed.
''He still had these symptoms,'' said his widow, Alice, when I went to see her last month. ''You have to remember, they put him all back together again. So when he started having issues with his colon, his stomach, all that stuff, we attributed them to the accident.''
By the time McAlary got his diagnosis of colon cancer, it had already progressed to an advanced stage.
''It was a desperate situation,'' said Ed Hayes, one of McAlary's closest friends and the man who negotiated all of his contracts. ''The nurse took one look and said: 'Forget this guy. He's a dead man. There's no hope for him.' ''
Nevertheless, he underwent surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible, then started chemotherapy in 1997. He was hooked up to the chemo drip when he received a tip that a man had been severely assaulted by a police officer. He drove from his treatment to see Abner Louima in the hospital. He was the first reporter to interview the victim. In horrifying detail, Louima told him how he'd been wrongfully arrested outside a nightclub and taken back to a police station, where one of the cops raped him with a plunger.
In a series of articles, he not only exposed a monstrous incident of police brutality but started the earliest debate about the Giuliani-era approach to law enforcement. In short order, McAlary's career was rehabilitated.
In the play my mother wrote, there's a scene toward the end, in which McAlary, sick with cancer, goes to the Poconos to visit his friend Jim Dwyer, then a columnist at The Daily News. It's a glorious summer day, and McAlary's 12-year-old son, Ryan, wants to do a flip off the diving board, but he gets scared and can't do it. So McAlary takes off his shirt, walks to the edge of the diving board and says to him: ''When you do these things, you can't be nervous. If you think about what can go wrong, if you think about the belly flop, that's what'll happen.''
And then McAlary does the flip himself and makes a perfect landing.
It's a metaphor, obviously, for his view about life. And I've come to think it might as well have been about my mother. The point is that you don't let fear invade your psyche. Because then you might as well be dead.
As she saw him, McAlary was a role model not so much in life, but in death, in the way that he used writing to maintain his sense of purpose and find release from his illness. In the six years my mother had MDS, she wrote 100 blog posts, two books and two plays and directed a movie. There was nothing she could do about her death but to keep going in the face of it. Work was its own kind of medicine, even if it could not save her when her MDS came roaring back.
''I'm having a little health crisis.''
That's how she put it when she called me shortly before Memorial Day weekend.
I dropped everything, got into a cab and headed up to see her at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. While I was en route, the phone rang; it was Max, who told me that Mom's MDS had turned into leukemia. I think I already knew, even though I hadn't asked her for specifics. For six months, Mom's blasts -- the bad guys that make it difficult for people with MDS and leukemia to produce healthy platelets and white blood cells -- had been creeping back up, indicating that she was developing a resistance to her medication. Now she would need a brutal form of chemotherapy if she hoped to survive. Max and his girlfriend, Rachel, were getting on a plane from L.A.
When I arrived in her room, my mother was crying. She cried a lot that first night, and then, the next day, she cried some more because she was certain Christopher Hitchens had done no such thing, and she was devastated at the thought that she might not be as brave as him about death.
It terrified me to see her cry like that. She loved me, showered me with gifts, e-mailed or called every time I wrote something that made her proud. But even after all the weekly meals, the shared vacations, the conversations about movies and journalism and the debt ceiling and Edith Wharton, I still viewed her with a mix of awe and intimidation. It wasn't often that I caught a glimpse of her vulnerability.
Now there she was, in her Chanel flats and her cream-colored pants and her black-and-white-striped blouse, looking so pretty and so fragile as she dabbed her eyes with a Kleenex; and I finally understood what she meant when she said she was a bird -- that she wasn't just talking about her looks but something inside as well.
As she explained it that first night, the odds of the chemo working were below 50 percent, and even if it did, it would probably not buy her more than a year and a half or so. ''I want to live to be 100,'' she said. ''I want to see how things turn out for you and Max.'' But she wasn't sure the chemo was worth doing for such a limited upside.
I told her that I hoped she would reconsider, that a year and a half is a lot of time during which something else may emerge as a viable treatment. Still, I said I would respect whatever she wished to do, that it was her body, her life, her choice. I think this is what she needed to hear, that we wanted her to live more than anything but that she was still in control. Because within minutes, she seemed resigned to the idea that she was going to be nuked, as she put it.
Forty-eight hours later, she was hooked up to an IV. Her sadness seemed to lift, and her humor returned. The side effects of the chemo wouldn't kick in for at least a week, so she spent her days with Delia powering through a TV pilot they were writing for Scott Rudin. At night, Nick brought in Shake Shack or Cuban-Chinese, and we watched episodes of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' Binky Urban (Mom's book agent and one of her closest friends) and Ken Auletta (a writer for The New Yorker) were there frequently as well. So was Richard Cohen, the Washington Post columnist and one of her oldest friends. Because of my mother's tremendous sense of will and a modest dose of steroids, the script was finished before the chemo was.
At first, there were some encouraging signs. She wasn't in remission, but the blasts were below 20 percent, which is considered the threshold for being fully leukemic. Then, about a week and a half later, she got pneumonia. As her doctors explained it, the body often takes three weeks or so to begin producing neutrophils after chemotherapy of this type. And neutrophils are the good guys that defend the body from infections. One day, she would seem to be getting better; the next, worse. At night she was experiencing heart palpitations. It was confusing to all of us, including my mother.
So we waited.
We waited as she went on and off oxygen. We waited as her appetite left her. We waited as she lost her hair, and this I remember vividly, because I did not see her cry at all. Crying, I believe, is a sign that there's still hope. Instead, she seemed sort of numb.
My mother loved looking good. She had her hair blown out weekly. She wore makeup. She had a closet filled with Prada and Armani. When she realized that she might be too old to wear a very expensive dress by Azzedine Alaïa that she bought in Paris, it was like a little arrow to the heart.
She had fallen in love with and married a man who was as fastidious about presentation as she was. Even in the hospital, day after day, Nick arrived looking impeccable in his fancy slacks and his beautiful loafers, because getting dressed up was a way to say to her that things were still normal, that he hadn't lost hope. All sorts of men had rejected her when she was younger as cute but not beautiful. She wrote about it, turned it into a comic riff -- everything is copy -- but privately, it was heartbreaking for her until this noble man came along and made her feel that she was as fabulous to look at as she was to talk to.
And now, here she was without her hair, confined to a bed, using a nurse to help her go to the bathroom. It was the beginning of her losing her dignity. It was the beginning of a bad death.
In the days that followed, conversation became harder, and the silences grew longer. People who live thousands of miles from their parents often express regret at not being able to say goodbye, or about having spent too little time with them during their final days. But being there every day, as I was, produced its own kind of sorrow. It wasn't just the big things we were avoiding saying (although there were certainly some of those). It was the sadness of having run out of news to deliver, gossip to report, new books and movies to discuss. I actually believe that had Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes announced their separation a week earlier, we might have kept her smiling one more night.
On June 18, four weeks after my mother went into the hospital, the Public Theater held its annual benefit to raise money for Shakespeare in the Park. For more than a decade, my mother attended the gala every year, considering it the unofficial beginning of summer. Often it would start to rain in the middle of the show, and everyone would pull out their umbrellas and wait for it to pass. But it didn't matter. It was an evening when her favorite park in her favorite city turned into an enchanted forest.
The night before the benefit, my mother was able to get out of her hospital bed, but she couldn't really speak. She wrote down the names of all the people she had invited to sit at her table that year and organized the seating arrangement for me. When I got to Central Park the next evening, it was a mess: two of her guests had canceled; others knew she was in the hospital but not why; some appeared not to have been told anything at all and looked puzzled when I informed them that she and Nick weren't going to make it.
I was too discombobulated to ask a waiter to please remove the two empty chairs from the table. I just sat there helplessly, hands clasped underneath the table, trying to avoid the concerned looks of nearly a dozen people who suddenly knew that something was rotten in the state of Denmark but were too polite to say it.
After I got home, this admittedly trivial detail gnawed at me. How useless I was, how incompetent. I spent nearly 34 years at the foot of one of New York's best hostesses and I could not even figure out how to ask a waiter to take away two chairs. I had failed to pay adequate attention all those years, and could not even be trusted to do this one small thing for my mother as she neared the end.
Did she know she was dying that final week, that she was not ever going to leave the hospital?
Richard Cohen, who spent much of the final weeks in the hospital with us, says: ''She knew. There wasn't a moment of confusion. I'm certain of that.''
I go back and forth.
Absolutely, she planned for it. She redid her will earlier in the spring when her blood counts were going the wrong way, typed an exit letter on her computer, spelling out what she wanted after she died: a party in the apartment with Champagne and cucumber sandwiches from William Poll; a memorial held days after. ''Get it over with'' was the gist of her instructions. She even supplied the speaker list.
Nevertheless, as she ran out of time, she chose not to acknowledge, at least explicitly, what was happening to her. One of the last e-mails she sent went out five days before she died. It was addressed to her film agent, Bryan Lourd. ''I am as sad as you can imagine to report that I have leukemia. Early reports are not particularly hopeful but not hopeless either.''
The weekend before she went into a coma, Jerry Groopman called her from Boston. If she wanted to know, he was prepared to tell her that she had entered the terminal phase of her illness. She chose not to call him back.
And then there was that conversation with Max, the one in which she said, ''I'm not dead yet.''
In ''I Feel Bad About My Neck,'' my mother wrote of turning 60: ''Denial has been a way of life for me for many years. I actually believe in denial. It seemed to me that the only way to deal with a birthday of this sort was to do everything possible to push it from my mind.''
Some part of me would like to believe this is what she was doing at the end as well, because it would indicate that her hope remained as she left the world. But it's just as likely that she felt too sad to have this conversation with me. Or that I was too sad to have it with her.
Sunday, June 24, was a pretty good day. The sun was shining, and Mom spent most of the afternoon on a couch in the front of her room, doing the crossword puzzle with Max. Binky was there, as was Richard Cohen and his companion, Mona. Amy stopped by with her husband, Alan. ''We're going to the Guggenheim,'' Amy said. ''Do you want anything from the outside world?''
''Sure,'' my mother said. ''A de Kooning.''
Another thing she requested was a pineapple milkshake, so Max brought one from Emack and Bolio's, made from fresh pineapple. But as far as my mother was concerned, a milkshake is one thing that's actually better with crushed pineapple. Dole.
''When I get out of the hospital, I'm going to go home and I'm going to make a pineapple milkshake with crushed pineapple, pineapple juice and vanilla ice cream, and I'm going to drink it and I'm going to die,'' she said, savoring the last word. ''It's going to be great.''
On this day, I told her some things. After she moved to her bed, I said that sometimes, I thought of the possibility of her not being around and wondered if I'd ever be able to write again. If I'd even want to. And she told me that I would, that I would find it within me, and that whatever happened, she hoped my brother and I would lead the kind of lives where we did stuff big enough to occasionally say, ''Wow, I wish Mom was around for this.''
We stared out at the 59th Street Bridge and tried to remember all the others that connect Manhattan to the rest of the world. The Brooklyn Bridge. The Williamsburg Bridge, the Queensboro Bridge, the Triboro Bridge. We got about halfway before she began to doze off.
On Monday, Nick called to say she'd had another tough night. I got to the hospital, and there was more blood work, none of it good. The blasts were everywhere. She didn't have a single neutrophil.
Hours later, she began to drift in and out of consciousness. We took turns holding her hand. Delia would come, then Max, then me, then Amy, then Binky, then Richard. Nick sat beside her and wept.
''In, out, in, out,'' she said, waving her hands at the windows. Also: ''This is it,'' which she said in a tone that seemed to be half-question, half-declaration. It occurred to me later that it might have been the first uncertain moment she'd had in her entire life.
I started calling her friends to explain what was going on, that she was shutting down, that we were sorry for not having told them sooner. They were startled and confused, but gracious.
I told several of them that they would be speaking at her memorial, that she actually requested it in writing and that she'd also requested that they try to keep it to under five minutes.
Over and over again, they said to me, ''This must be so hard for you.'' But making those calls wasn't. It was strangely beautiful. The people I called told me stories about great advice she'd given them; e-mails she'd sent that they'd loved; and occasionally, what a total pain she could be. Those were funny to hear. They were real.
While I did phone duty, Max relaxed and took off his button-down shirt. Two sleeves of tattoos ran down his arms. Mom had seen one of them years before and had not reacted favorably, so when he went in to get the other arm done, he decided that she would never see it. Never again did he wear a short-sleeve shirt in her presence.
''Wow, Max, look at those tattoos,'' Binky said.
''Shh!'' he said, flashing her a smile.
My mother's eyes popped open.
''Mom, I'm so sorry about my tattoos.''
''You. Aren't. Really,'' she said, her eyebrows raised in a kind of resigned indignation. And then she fell back asleep.

HEADLINE: Young Poets Society

BYLINE: By MEGHAN O'ROURKE

 BODY:
Each year, the Lilly fellowships offer five young poets prestige, publicity and -- most elusive of all -- money. The latest crop of winners represents how important, and how controversial, these awards have become.
There are a lot of things poets have to worry about these days, but selling out isn't one of them. Poetry is so marginal (at least economically) that there's probably more money in needlepoint, thanks to Etsy. A poet's working life is one of scrapping and scraping to get by, while scavenging free moments in the day to inscribe a tiny number of words onto the page. Grants like the Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowship -- $15,000 handed out by the Poetry Foundation to five emerging talents every year -- are among the prestigious ways that poets can be rewarded for their work, and encouraged to make more of it. 
The announcement of the most recent Lilly fellowships caused a small uproar on the Internet because all five winners were men. It didn't help that the foundation is a controversial institution in the world of poetry -- a well-financed behemoth whose president has complained that today's poetry isn't ''entertaining'' enough, urging poets to engage with a general audience, quit teaching and take up a life like Hemingway's -- full of marlin fishing and such. The foundation was created in 2003 after Ruth Lilly, the reclusive and eccentric heir to the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical fortune, shocked the literary world by donating nearly $200 million to Poetry magazine, which had once been an avant-garde journal famous for championing modernist poets like T. S. Eliot. The newly flush foundation was meant not only to revitalize the magazine, which had grown stuffier over the years, but also to drum up a broader audience for poetry in America. Yet critics argue that the foundation, led by an investment banker and poet named John Barr, hasn't spent its money wisely or aggressively enough. Among its most visible projects to date are a Web site that draws some 12 million unique visitors a year; a high-school recitation program; a redesign for Poetry magazine; and, most contentiously, an eyebrow-raising $21.5 million headquarters in Chicago. Barr is leaving the Poetry Foundation in July and will be replaced by the respected poet and critic Robert Polito, who currently directs the writing program at the New School; his appointment may be a sign that the foundation has heard its critics' voices.
Unlike the foundation's other projects, the Lilly fellowships directly support poets. (The fellowships actually predate the larger gift -- they were established by Lilly and Poetry in 1989.) While one may wish that the XX chromosome had been represented in this year's crop of winners, it's not hard to see why the editors at Poetry chose them. Though stylistically diverse, each poet here has an assured, distinctive voice. Their poems are musical, socially engaged, in one case a little mythic; in another case, rueful about America's racial struggles; in a third, wry about making a choice between the power of street violence and the thrill of writing. They deal frontally with crime and race, with the chaotic hardships of the underclass and the rich pockets of nonwhite culture in America. These are not avant-garde poems; they aren't elliptical or faddishly whimsical. They evince a love for language analogous to a designer's love for pattern and texture; the best poems shimmer on the page, and also push against our assumptions about what kind of language is ''poetic language.'' Which is to say that they manage to be beautiful while also using what Wordsworth called ''the real language of men.'' Make that ''people.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

''Two poets changed how I saw the world: Robert Hayden and Etheridge Knight,'' he says. These days, Betts, a father of two, teaches at Emerson and other colleges around Boston. He recently wrote an introduction to a forthcoming edition of Hayden's collected poems. Betts wears a J. Crew jacket, $328, and sweater, $65

HEADLINE: Test of Leadership at N.Y.U.

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
Embarking on an ambitious expansion at home, constructing a network of new campuses around the globe, wooing intellectual superstars and raising vast amounts of money, John Sexton of New York University is the very model of a modern university president -- the leader of a large corporation, pushing for growth on every front.
To some within N.Y.U., Dr. Sexton is a hero who has transformed the university. The trustees have thanked him by elevating his salary to nearly $1.5 million from $773,000 and guaranteeing him retirement benefits of $800,000 a year.
But to others, he is an autocrat who treats all but a few anointed professors as hired help, ignoring their concerns, informing them of policies after the fact and otherwise running roughshod over American academic tradition, in which faculty members are partners in charting a university's course. 
''He has a very evangelical sense of purpose,'' said Andrew Ross, a professor of social and cultural analysis, ''that does not extend beyond the concept that the university should be an entity of his own making.''
''I think,'' he added, ''when other administrations see that they say, Well that's what leadership should be. And when faculty see that they say, That is not what university leadership should be. It's the style of a maverick C.E.O.''
The debate over Dr. Sexton's presidency will come to a head this week. The faculty of the university's largest school, Arts and Science, has scheduled a five-day vote of no confidence. Given Dr. Sexton's international stature, the vote may serve as the most important referendum yet on the direction of American higher education.
The job description for university presidents has changed significantly in recent years. In a time of shrinking resources and rising costs, leaders must, of course, raise money; N.Y.U.'s recent $3 billion campaign set a national record. But they must also raise their institutions' profiles, forge strategic and business alliances, and plot digital strategy. Dr. Sexton, who declined to be interviewed for this article but later took part in an on-camera interview, has charged ahead on all those fronts, both in New York City and around the world.
The Global Network University that he established -- with 12 international study centers in places like Accra, Ghana; Buenos Aires; and Paris, as well as a full degree-granting campus in Abu Dhabi and another one set to open next year in Shanghai -- has turned N.Y.U. into a worldwide brand and broadened its students' horizons. At a State Department reception in 2011, Hillary Rodham Clinton, then secretary of state, praised his ''vision to expand his university internationally while maintaining its reputation for excellence and academic freedom.''
On a purely practical level, that global network has also allowed N.Y.U. to add students, including foreigners who pay full tuition, without having to find room for them in Greenwich Village. That is significant given N.Y.U.'s relatively small per-student endowment, which makes the university more dependent on tuition checks than other institutions in its academic league. (Students pay much less to attend N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi, thanks to subsidies from the local government, but that campus yields revenue for N.Y.U. in other ways, including an initial gift of $50 million from the government of Abu Dhabi.)
Back at home, Dr. Sexton won city approval for N.Y.U. 2031, a plan to build six million square feet of facilities in New York City, including almost two million on the two superblocks where 40 percent of the faculty members live, steps from Washington Square Park.
To a passionate, but as yet unquantified, segment of N.Y.U., each of those initiatives -- and Dr. Sexton's willingness to go forward despite major faculty objections -- shows he has placed his own ambition ahead of the best interests of the university.
Dr. Sexton expanded the faculty, bringing on celebrated thinkers and raising lackluster departments up to the top tier. But reflecting a nationwide trend, the majority of that growth has been in nontenure-track positions, including adjunct professors who earn just a few thousand dollars per course, and who might stay for one semester.
Adjunct professors do an especially large portion of the teaching at N.Y.U.'s 12 international centers, one of the reasons -- along with the lack of academic freedom in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai -- that critics describe the Global Network University as a cynical undertaking. Rebecca Karl, a history professor and a faculty senator, said she would support the idea of global education ''if it weren't just about people paying an N.Y.U. New York tuition, then being shipped off to Prague where you can house and educate the kids for a fraction of the cost that it takes in New York and then N.Y.U. pockets the difference.''
J. Anthony Movshon, the director of the Center for Neural Science, said he supported of Dr. Sexton and was generally optimistic about the global push. But he said it ''has created burdens for departments and individual faculty who are asked to cover the needs of those campuses as they grow.''
''It's been complicated,'' he added, ''and disruptive.''
Without question the most controversial of Dr. Sexton's policies has been N.Y.U. 2031, the plan for expansion in New York City. Though everyone agrees that the university is squeezed for space, in a survey last year, 716 faculty members, out of 1,126 responding, disapproved of the plan. The Stern Business School and the economics department jointly expressed concerns that its cost would crush the university, forcing tuition increases and lower teacher-student ratios.
Faculty opponents have joined neighborhood groups in a lawsuit to block the plan; last week, Henry J. Stern, the former New York City parks commissioner, signed on, saying the plan unlawfully appropriated public park space.
Those who favor N.Y.U. 2031 tend to describe the opposition as a wishful -- and belated -- attempt to move the construction to someone else's backyard. But even some supporters concede that the administration's approach made the conflict worse. In testimony in April before the City Planning Commission, Dalton Conley, then the dean of social sciences, strongly endorsed the plan, but added, ''Had more faculty been involved in the process itself and had it been less driven by administration officials, you would see few if any professors testifying against it here today.''
In person, Dr. Sexton comes across as folksy. A former debating champion, he has mastered the gentler rhetorical skill of conveying his thoughts through personal anecdotes. Like the hugs with which he greets even strangers, these stories can disarm opponents, either by setting a jovial tone for a conversation by deftly guiding it away from any minefields or simply by running out the clock. But with a vote of no confidence on the schedule, the conversation, at least for the moment, seems to have gotten away from him.
But according to B. Robert Kreiser of the American Association of University Professors, no-confidence votes are often unsuccessful, and can even backfire ''because boards rally around the president, often extending their contracts for years.''
If that happens at N.Y.U., said Andrew Delbanco, a professor at Columbia University and the author of ''College: What It Was, Is, and Should Be,'' it ''will embolden other presidents to disregard, or at least discount, the faculty as a merely retrograde force.''
Regardless, Dr. Sexton has begun adjusting his approach to the faculty -- as a means of learning from experience, say supporters like Martin Lipton, chairman of N.Y.U.'s board of trustees, or of buying off dissent, his critics say. The e-mail Dr. Sexton sent his faculty shortly before Christmas struck an uncharacteristically somber and humble tone.
''We have taken some steps to provide for improved faculty input and critique,'' he wrote. ''I know more must be done, and during the winter recess I will be reflecting on how I can help to achieve that.''
For Professor Karl, however, no such adjustments can alter the fundamental questions. ''Who and what is the university for?'' she asks. ''And in which ways should that get shaped? We all recognize that we're in a brave new world.''

HEADLINE: Packing 123 Horsepower Into 3 Cylinders

BYLINE: By LINDSAY BROOKE

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Craig Daitch needed to fly to Los Angeles on short notice, and he had more than the usual amount of baggage.
In addition to a laptop and extra clothes, Mr. Daitch, manager for car communications at Ford Motor, was bringing an item for display at last fall's auto show: the largest part of a new Ford engine.
Typically, that cylinder block would be crated and shipped as cargo, with loading handled by forklift drivers. But this time Mr. Daitch stuffed the engine block into his suitcase and checked it onto the flight after passing through airport security. 
At 52 pounds, the cast-iron block of Ford's new 1-liter EcoBoost engine is a bantamweight among automobile power plants. (Mr. Daitch didn't even incur an overweight bag fee.) With the total capacity of its three cylinders equal to the volume of a large soft-drink bottle, it's also tiny: placed upright on a desk, the block fits easily within the edges of a file folder.
The compact dimensions of 3-cylinder engines, together with fuel efficiency and reasonably good performance, have pushed Ford and a growing list of competitors -- including Audi, BMW, Citroën, Mini, Peugeot and Volkswagen -- to introduce a new generation of triples, as they are often called.
''Turbocharged 3s are now replacing nonturbo 4-cylinder engines, just as fours have been replacing 6s,'' said Eric Fedewa, an IHS Automotive analyst who tracks powertrain trends. He explained that in the new 3-cylinder engines, the combination of a turbocharger and features like direct fuel injection and variable cam timing ''effectively serves as a fourth cylinder.''
The overall effect is to transform the 3-cylinder Davids into aspiring Goliaths. Ford's diminutive and technically sophisticated triple will be offered in the 2014 Fiesta in the United States. Its performance -- 123 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque -- is the highest power output for its displacement of any Ford production engine, the company says.
While offering the triple in the 2,600-pound Fiesta subcompact was a logical move, Ford surprised the industry by announcing it would make the engine available next year in the 3,350-pound Mondeo, the European version of the Fusion. (It is already offered in the European C-Max.)
In the five-passenger Mondeo sedan, the 1-liter triple stretches the limits of how small an engine will adequately power a vehicle. The combination works, Ford engineers say, because the EcoBoost engine produces 90 percent of its maximum torque at a relatively low 1,500 r.p.m.
Of course, small engines in larger cars are more common in Europe, where a gallon of gasoline costs up to $8 and Fiat even sells a 2-cylinder version of its 500 model. Ford aims to achieve best-in-class fuel economy, the equivalent of about 43.5 miles per gallon, when the Mondeo equipped with the 1-liter triple and a 6-speed manual transmission goes on sale, probably next year.
Ford's success with the Mondeo could help influence similarly radical combinations across the industry, Mr. Fedewa said, even in the United States.
Worldwide, 3-cylinder engines are best known from their wide use in motorcycles since the late 1960s by BMW, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Triumph, among others. In bikes, the triples fit neatly between 2- and 4-cylinder models.
Their revered performance in the bike world contrasts with the buzzy, underwhelming triples that soured many buyers of econoboxes sold by Daihatsu, Subaru and Suzuki in the 1980s.
Indeed, as automakers downsize their engines and coax more power from fewer cylinders, they're also challenged with making them run as smoothly and quietly as the engines they are replacing. The natural up-and-down shaking forces are more pronounced in engines with fewer cylinders.
Another problem is so-called second-order vibration, according to Joe Bakaj, Ford's vice president for powertrain engineering, caused by the constantly changing angle of the connecting rods as the crankshaft rotates.
The trick for designers is to minimize the natural vibrations occurring at different engine speeds by achieving balance, as much as possible, among the rotating and reciprocating parts.
The task of making a triple with a high level of refinement is not simple, Mr. Bakaj said.
''We calculated that to replace the 1.6-liter engine required just 1 liter with the EcoBoost, but to do a 1-liter with 4 cylinders meant 250 cc per cylinder,'' he said. ''With that size, the ratio of cylinder volume to surface area is too big, so we'd lose much of the combustion energy to heat. We'd lose efficiency.''
Ford engineers settled on 300 cc for each cylinder, with a long piston stroke, which helps to minimize the engine's overall length. The short cylinder block helps to reduce what engineers call a rocking couple, which Mr. Bakaj described as the engine's tendency to rock end-to-end along its longitudinal axis as the crankshaft rotates.
Ford's clever use of an unbalanced flywheel and pulley at opposite ends of the crankshaft smooth out shaking, so it does not require a balance shaft, a solution often used in small automotive engines. BMW's new 1.5-liter triple has a balance shaft, which consumes power and adds weight.
The rise of smaller turbocharged engines does not necessarily mean that meeting future fuel-economy standards will be a simple matter for automakers.
In February, Consumer Reports said that its tests of a number of recent models, including the 2013 Ford Fusion equipped with the 1.6-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder, failed to deliver better mileage and performance than the same models with larger, nonturbocharged engines.
Ford engineers pledge that won't be the case when the 1-liter Fiesta arrives next year. In a test drive of that engine installed in a Focus at the company's Dearborn, Mich., proving grounds, I felt barely any vibration through the steering wheel or pedals when the car idled. There was still no objectionable buzz when I accelerated hard through the gears to 70 m.p.h.
The limited peak power may raise questions about how the 3-cylinder will perform in the much heftier Mondeo, but its noise and vibration levels are, subjectively, equal to or perhaps slightly better than those of the 1.6-liter it replaces.
And the 4-cylinder engine block will not so easily fit in a suitcase.

HEADLINE: Toyota's Bottom Feeder Finally Makes Some Waves

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
Considering Toyota's expertise in democratic, affordable transportation -- Corolla, Camry, Prius -- you'd think it would rule the realm of entry-price cars.
Instead, with global-style subcompacts finally leaving their petite tire prints on American soil, the Honda Fit has established itself as the roomy, sporty benchmark. Chevrolet, of all brands, has a high-mileage hit with the peppy Sonic. The smart Hyundai Accent and Euro-sleek Ford Fiesta are firmly in the mix.
Toyota, for its part, had been laying weirdly shaped eggs like the Echo and its even paler echo, the depressingly chintzy Yaris. But with a surprisingly sharp-handling Yaris, which was redesigned for 2012, most of Toyota's subcompact sins are forgiven.
Again, that's ''most'' of its sins: with just 106 horsepower and 103 pound-feet of torque, Toyota's hatchback is among the slowpokes of its class. Strapped to either two- or four-door models, the carry-over 1.5-liter 4-cylinder buzzes its way from 0 to 60 miles per hour in about nine seconds. Compared with, say, the 140-horsepower Sonic Turbo, you can hear and feel the Toyota working hard to overtake, or just climb to highway speeds. 
The other remaining weirdness is a barstool-high seating position -- think of the Fiat 500 -- that's exacerbated by the lack of a telescoping steering wheel. I sit closer to the wheel than many drivers, but even I had to slide uncomfortably close to get the arms-to-wheel relationship right.
But the little Toyota gets nearly everything else right. The Yaris is affordable. The scrunched proportions remain odd from some angles, despite a two-inch stretch of the wheelbase and four inches in overall length. Yet like many of the current crop of subcompact hatchbacks, the Yaris is cheek-pinching cute. (The former Yaris sedan, that vacation buzz kill at the nation's rental counters, is history).
The Toyota remains the smallest car in its class, a significant eight inches shorter than the Honda. (It's only about seven inches longer than a Mini Cooper.) Despite that, the remade Toyota carves out a surprisingly decent back seat for two adults. A formerly cramped cargo area is nearly six inches longer and 2.1 inches wider, increasing overall capacity by a remarkable 68 percent for the four-door, Toyota says.
True to its name, the larger Honda Fit remains the clown car of this segment, packing in bigger people and more gear than seems possible.
The Yaris's bite-size body lets the car glide into Manhattan curbside spots with enough room left over for a Smart car. At the curb, the Lagoon Blue paint was striking enough to draw unsolicited compliments, a turquoise-y shade that really fit the car's personality.
That personality is spartan but stylish. The cabin's well-bolstered, pattern-cloth seats; leather-wrapped three-point steering wheel; simple but useful audio unit; and rice paper-inspired material on the doors and dashboard left a low-key impression of quality.
The windshield fluid sprays ahead of the single wiper from the arm itself, just as in some luxury cars, rather than blasting hither and yon from the base of the glass.
The Yaris doesn't officially reach the 40 m.p.g. bragging zone, with a rating of 30 m.p.g. in the city and 38 on the highway with its 5-speed manual transmission. An automatic with a mere four speeds is an $800 option, but it lowers the highway rating by 3 m.p.g. Given that Chevy, Ford and Hyundai offer thriftier 6-speed automatics, Toyota had better get with the program.
But as I tell small-car shoppers who ask my opinion: don't get distracted by the industry's rampant oneupmanship on fuel economy. The 40 m.p.g. claims of several small cars are proving dubious. Most notoriously, several of the Hyundai and Kia small fry have been caught with their knee pants down -- the companies agreed to reimburse customers for overstating mileage claims, in the case of the Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio, by 3 to 4 m.p.g.
Consumers should also realize the penny-wise, pound-foolish nature of focusing on slight m.p.g. gains among cars that already enjoy low fuel costs. The Chevy Spark, a microscopic 84-horsepower city car, squeezes out a combined city-highway rating of 34 m.p.g., which is 1 m.p.g. better than the Yaris or the most frugal versions of the Sonic and Fiesta. Congratulations: You just saved $1 a week, based on the Environmental Protection Agency's calculation of an annual fuel cost of $1,500 versus $1,550 for the other cars. Buy yourself a cup of coffee with that buck, though at a cheaper place than Starbucks.
The Yaris, the lightest car in its league at less than 2,400 pounds, did show excellent mileage where it counts. I managed 34 m.p.g. over all through the course of a week and 40 m.p.g. at highway cruising speed, beating the E.P.A. estimate.
I've saved the best for last. I'll swear on a stack of Toyota owner's manuals that the Yaris is actually fun to drive. As such, it's the antithesis of the comatose conveyance pod we've come to expect from Toyota.
Despite its underdog power, the endearing Yaris is a grippy little monster on curving roads. The steering is lively and connected, and the chassis is composed, especially for the SE model, which has quicker steering and attractive 16-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, fog lamps, other body additions and secure-feeling disc brakes at all four wheels.
The Yaris is also competitively priced, at $15,165 for the basic L two-door. My four-door SE started at $17,275 and, with options, totaled $17,504.
While the Yaris doesn't offer the optional navigation system of some higher-price subcompacts, it is well stocked. All models get nine air bags, including side curtains and a driver's knee bag; stability and traction controls with antilock brakes and brake assist; and Bluetooth and USB connections. Satellite radio is available.
The ride can get a bit choppy on chewed-up surfaces, a function of the short wheelbase and a torsion-beam rear suspension that's par for budget-price cars.
But slap a set of stickier performance tires on this Toyota, and it would keep up with the average Volkswagen GTI on winding back roads, where cars like the GTI can't take advantage of their superior acceleration.
Toyota is rightly known for popularizing the hybrid. A redesigned 2014 Corolla is on the way, aiming to regain an edge against an onslaught of compact competitors.
But with this improved Yaris, Toyota seems to recognize that an ultra-affordable car can play a small but important supporting role. Buyers should expect nothing less from a company that helped revolutionize mainstream cars in America.

HEADLINE: For One Night, Sequester Becomes a Punch Line

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Perhaps only at the Gridiron Club dinner could President Obama warm up a crowd by starting with jokes about the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect this month. 

 BODY:
President Obama has indeed brought change to Washington: in exchange for his white-tied presence on Saturday night, he successfully pressured the journalistic elite at the 128-year-old Gridiron Club to shorten its often interminably long annual dinner roast.
Yet he still got his licks in, even as he took his share of them.
"As you know, I last attended the Gridiron dinner two years ago," Mr. Obama said. "Back then, I addressed a number of topics - a dysfunctional Congress, a looming budget crisis, complaints that I don't spend enough time with the press. It's funny, it seems like it was just yesterday."
Perhaps only in the capital could he warm up a crowd by starting with jokes about the sequester, the indiscriminate across-the-board spending cuts that took effect this month after Mr. Obama and Republican lawmakers could not agree on a deficit-reducing alternative. (By day, the Obama team is not laughing, given the widespread criticism of the Secret Service's decision to suspend White House tours for the summer because of the budget cuts.) 
"I know some of you have noticed that I'm dressed a little differently from the other gentlemen," Mr. Obama said to the roughly 650 journalists, members of Congress, cabinet members, governors, ambassadors and military brass. "Because of sequester, they cut my tails. My joke writers have been placed on furlough. I know a lot of you reported that no one will feel any immediate impact because of the sequester. Well, you're about to find out how wrong you are."
Predictably, given his audience, he also poked fun at one of the town's most famous journalists, Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, for his recent spat with the White House over sequestration - in particular for Mr. Woodward's public suggestion that Gene Sperling, Mr. Obama's top economic adviser, had threatened him if Mr. Woodward continued his criticism. (E-mails between the two show a friendly, if disagreeable, exchange of ideas.)
"Who knew Gene could be so intimidating?" Mr. Obama said to the knowing laughter of those familiar with Mr. Sperling, who, starting in the Clinton administration, developed a reputation for being earnest and conciliatory. (Mr. Sperling was at the dinner; Mr. Woodward was not.)
"Now I know that some folks think we responded to Woodward too aggressively," Mr. Obama said about the man who first gained fame for his work as a reporter that helped bring down President Richard M. Nixon over the Watergate scandal. Since then, he has been criticized for his books, which have skewered public figures who do not cooperate with him and favored those who do.
"But hey," the president said, "when has - can anybody tell me when an administration has ever regretted picking a fight with Bob Woodward? What's the worst that could happen?"
"As you may have heard, Bob invited Gene over to his place," Mr. Obama added. "And Bob says he actually thinks that I should make it too. And I might take him up on the offer. I mean, nothing says 'not a threat' like showing up at somebody's house with guys with machine guns."
The best-received Gridiron speeches mix jabs with self-deprecation, and Mr. Obama offered just a little. Alluding to tough decisions that were looming, he said, "I have my top advisers working around the clock. After all, my March Madness bracket isn't going to fill itself out. And don't worry - there is an entire team in the Situation Room as we speak, planning my next golf outing."
The president combined a reference to his recent outreach to Senate Republicans with a dig at them for opposing Chuck Hagel, a former Senate Republican himself, as defense secretary.
"I'm also doing what I can to smooth things over with Republicans in Congress. In fact, these days John McCain and I are spending so much time together that he told me we were becoming friends. I said, 'John, stop. Chuck Hagel warned me how this ends up.' "
Mr. Obama also tweaked his 70-year-old vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., who also was absent, over speculation about his ambitions.
"Look, it's no secret that my vice president is still ambitious," he said. "But let's face it, his age is an issue. Just the other day, I had to take Joe aside and say, 'Joe, you are way too young to be the pope. You can't do it. You got to mature a little bit.' "
Before the president's speech closed the evening - which lasted just over three hours instead of the usual four-plus - he sat on the dais in the ballroom of the Renaissance Hotel for the usual teasing skits from Gridiron Club members and dueling speeches from a representative of each party. Just as then-Senator Obama was the Democratic speaker at the club's 2006 dinner, this year's picks were two politicians seen as potential presidential contenders: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat, and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a Republican.
After four years, Mr. Jindal could still get laughs making fun of his Republican response to Mr. Obama's 2009 State of the Union address - a widely panned performance in his debut before a national television audience.
"Even though the president is sitting up here looking calm and relaxed, he's actually up here quaking in his boots. He is terrified that I'll upstage him again, just like I did in that State of the Union response," Mr. Jindal said.
The son of immigrants from India, Mr. Jindal joked about the talk of his 2016 ambitions in a way that drew one of Mr. Obama's heartiest laughs.
"My answer is I have no plans to run. I've made that clear over and over again - in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina," Mr. Jindal said. "I mean, come on," he added. "What chance does a skinny guy with a dark complexion and a funny name have?"
Both he and Ms. Klobuchar made much of the diversity among the evening's main speakers - an Indian-American governor, a woman senator and the first African-American president.
"I know the governor, the president and I agree on one thing," Ms. Klobuchar said, teeing up one of the most applauded lines. "One day soon, maybe not this year, maybe not even in our children's lifetime, but one day you will once again have a white male politician speaking at the Gridiron."

HEADLINE: 2 Awards Given to Promote Multicultural Children's Books

BYLINE: LESLIE KAUFMAN


HIGHLIGHT: First Book, a nonprofit that promotes literacy among children in low-income communities, will give two awards through its Stories for All project to publishers offering multicultural books. 

 BODY:
A month ago a nonprofit called First Book, which promotes literacy among children in low-income communities, announced the Stories for All project, a program intended to prod publishers to print more multicultural books. Kyle Zimmer, First Book's chief executive, says that part of the motivation was the "chasm" between the number of people who want such books and what is available. 
On Wednesday, First Book will announce that awards of $500,000 will go to two publishers for their proposals for the project: HarperCollins, the big publishing house owned by News Corporation, and Lee & Low, a minority-owned independent publisher.
In a 2012 study, the Cooperative Children's Book Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison evaluated some 3,600 books, looking for multicultural content. Of the books examined, 3.3 percent were found to be about African-Americans, 2.1 percent were about Asian-Pacific Americans, 1.5 percent were about Latinos and 0.6 percent were about American Indians.
Some 24 publishers responded to the competition, Ms. Zimmer said, and First Book felt that the submissions were so good that it decided to give two awards, instead of one. As part of the arrangement, First Book will add nearly 500 new books to an online store for purchase at a low cost by its member organizations, which all serve children in low-income communities.

Money for the grants comes from donations and the proceeds of sales by First Book to its members.
Ms. Zimmer said that because of the short lead time for the competition, not all of the books submitted were by new or minority authors. She said those would follow as the award and related market became better known, likening this phase to the first step in a marathon.
First Book serves people whose incomes are in the bottom third of Americans. It says that while there is great interest within low-income communities for high-quality books featuring diverse characters and cultures, publishers have not served them well because they are unsure of the market. Ms. Zimmer said that in challenging economic times, publishers "make very conservative decisions and revert to market strategies that have served them historically, but the problem is that they are missing the larger market."
First Book argues that it is in a position to cater to that larger market and make it a force. In the last year, it has grown from roughly 23,000 member organizations, including schools, churches and shelters, to more than 50,000.

HEADLINE: Two Sides to a Deodorant Campaign

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
THE deodorant aisle was once more like the toothpaste aisle, with products mostly unisex rather than marketed strictly to men or women. But today, unisex deodorants account for only 12 percent of the market, according to the research firm Mintel, down from about 35 percent in 1990.
Degree, which was introduced as a unisex brand in 1990, divided into Degree Men and Degree Women in 2005, and the two lines have taken divergent advertising approaches. The ads for women's products in recent years have tended to emphasize that they leave no marks on clothing, and to show women whose antiperspirant holds up as they work and socialize. The ads for men's products, by contrast, have focused more on users taxing their deodorant with such physical feats as riding mountain bikes or snowboarding down precipices. 
But now, Degree Men and Degree Women are being placed under the same creative umbrella, with a single campaign and a shared strategy and tag line.
The brand's new commercials feature famous athletes -- two men and two women -- training in a sport other than their primary one, for both endurance and relaxation.
''My dream didn't end in London,'' says Lolo Jones, the Olympic track star, at the beginning of one of the new spots, as she is shown flying over hurdles on an indoor track. ''I'm a competitor -- I mean, I'm racing people when I'm walking next to them.''
The spot then shows Ms. Jones riding a bobsled -- which, considering that she recently completed her first season as a member of the United States national bobsledding team, is not just recreational. It closes with a voice-over promising, ''Degree -- it won't let you down,'' and the tag line for the campaign: ''Do:More.''
In another spot, Alex Morgan, the Olympic women's soccer team gold medalist, is shown first kicking a ball around, then carrying a surfboard and oar to the beach for stand-up paddleboarding.
In the other ads, Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks goes from the basketball court to the boxing ring, and Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder goes from the court to cycling.
The campaign, by Davie Brown Entertainment, part of the Omnicom Group, will be introduced on Monday. While the creative approach in all four ads is similar, the spots end by featuring a men's or women's product in alignment with the athlete's gender. Another ''Do:More'' commercial that does not feature celebrities shows both men and women working up a sweat.
Degree, which declined to reveal how much it intended to spend on the campaign, spent $30.6 million in 2011 and $18.2 million in the first nine months of 2012 to advertise Degree Men, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP. Degree Women spent $17.5 million in 2011 and $9 million in the first nine months of 2012.
When it was introduced 23 years ago by Helene Curtis Industries, Degree trumpeted what it called body-heat technology, which releases ingredients as body temperature rises. Degree, which was acquired by Unilever in 1996, introduced another technology across its product line in 2011: MotionSense, which activates ingredients in response to friction.
Gaston Vaneri, senior marketing director for deodorants at Unilever North America, said that because Degree was promoting the motion-activated formula in all of its products, it chose an overarching campaign that featured male and female athletes being active beyond their primary sports.
Such an approach will resonate with consumers who are increasingly cross-training, as evidenced by the popularity of triathlons and Tough Mudder, an extreme obstacle course competition, Mr. Vaneri said.
''The fact that people want to go and do more is an insight that is true for men and for women,'' he said.
Because consumers worry about deodorant failing in professional and romantic situations, brands tend to highlight such anxieties in advertising, but Mr. Vaneri said the new campaign suggested efficacy in an inspirational way.
''Sweating because you're stressed is functionally true and relevant,'' he said of the typical advertising approach. ''But sweating because you choose to do more with your life is also functionally true, and also feels great and is more positive, inspirational and more emotionally relevant for our consumers.''
Degree products accounted for 16.3 percent of the $2.5 billion United States deodorant market in the 52 weeks that ended Jan. 27, according to SymphonyIRI Group, a market data firm. Over that period, Degree's revenue rose 2 percent as its unit sales fell 2.3 percent, thanks to the popularity of so-called clinical protection products, which contain more active ingredient and can cost more than double what baseline products do.
With 91 percent of Americans using deodorant, according to Mintel, there are few nonusers to win over, so charging more for more effective and innovative products has enabled Degree and other brands to grow steadily through the economic downturn.
''People are not going to grow a third arm,'' Mr. Vaneri said. ''This is a category that has been growing very healthily because we keep delivering better and better products.''
David Vinjamuri, author of ''Accidental Branding'' and an adjunct professor of marketing at New York University, said Degree's dual-gender approach made sense.
''The more important thing than whether you're a man or a woman is if you sweat honestly, if you earn your sweat by exercising,'' he said of the campaign's message.
While many consumers do not exercise enough, a far cry from the athletes in the commercials who cannot keep still, Mr. Vinjamuri said the ads might still resonate with the sedentary.
''They're only going to succeed as a brand if they appeal to people who don't do these activities themselves, but know that Degree is the brand that their friend who does ultramarathons or Ironman triathlons uses,'' he said.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. in Arizona Is Pushed to Expand Medicaid

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- In the battle to get the Medicaid expansion being championed by Gov. Jan Brewer approved by the state's legislators, her closest advisers are hanging their hopes on the number eight. That is how many of the 17 Republicans in the State Senate they believe they can get on their side.
They were working on an equally modest tally in the State House of Representatives, an unusual state of affairs for a staunchly conservative governor: her most reliable supporters on this issue are on the other side of the aisle, in the Legislature's usually powerless Democratic minority.
''It is not often we agree with her,'' said Representative Bruce Wheeler, the minority whip, ''but we certainly do on this issue.'' 
Indeed, the governor has won respect in conservative circles for her outspoken criticism of President Obama and for her support of Arizona's strict immigration legislation.
Last week, Ms. Brewer took her fight from conference rooms and the halls of the Senate and House to the steps of the State Capitol, surrounding herself with health care professionals in a public show of force before the Legislature, where the Medicaid bill she endorses will be unveiled on Tuesday.
In the meantime, a coalition of business leaders began running television advertisements promoting Ms. Brewer's plan as a lifeline to hospitals, particularly in rural areas, where the number of Medicaid recipients is large, as is the number of uninsured seeking care in emergency rooms.
But in their push to win over Republicans, the governor's advisers have found that they have no single persuasive argument, and at times, no chance at all for persuasion.
To make their case, they are pressing the idea that expanding Medicaid, the federal and state program that provides health care to poor and disabled people, is the best way to stabilize the state's health care system, already buckling under the weight of caring for uninsured patients. They invoke the burden borne by the insured, whose high premiums cover, in part, the cost of treatment that goes unpaid. They remind legislators that to back the plan is to honor the choice of voters, who overwhelmingly passed ballot measures, in 1996 and 2000, expanding coverage for childless adults with incomes up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level.
For good measure, they warn of the perils of bad press just as the 2014 campaign season is getting started. If the state got hammered in 2010 for cutting Medicaid coverage for certain organ transplants, affecting 94 patients, the thinking goes, imagine the reaction if the expansion does not go through and thousands of childless adults are dropped from the rolls just days after Christmas. (The waiver that has allowed for their coverage expires on Jan. 1.)
''The legislative dance is just getting started,'' said Chuck Coughlin, the governor's former campaign manager and one of the lobbyists leading the effort.
It is a choreography that has fostered unlikely alliances and uncertain behind-closed-doors deals, in Arizona and in other states where Republican governors' embrace of Medicaid expansion set off a backlash from Republican legislative majorities.
Committees are exploring other options in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott faces increasing uncertainty over whether the expansion there will pass. In Ohio, Gov. John R. Kasich invoked dollars and God during his State of the State address, telling conservative legislators that the vulnerable should not be left behind.
For Ms. Brewer, getting the expansion approved has become a matter of personal pride, even if it has gone against her strong opposition to the Obama administration's health care overhaul. She has thrown all of her political capital behind the effort, traveling across the state to sell her message and encouraging a Republican lawmaker, State Representative Heather Carter, who has generally been in line with the governor's health policies, to nudge her colleagues in the Legislature.
''One of the things she has demonstrated is that she generally gets what she wants,'' said her spokesman, Matthew Benson.
The battle has sometimes boiled down to semantics. For example, the state's Medicaid director, Thomas Betlach, refuses to use the word expansion. ''Restoration,'' he said assertively during an interview, referring to the fact that the under the governor's plan, the program would again apply to people who lost coverage when the recession hit and the state froze enrollment. (The expansion would stretch the coverage beyond the state's income threshold to 133 percent of the poverty level, or $30,675 for a family of four.)
Ms. Brewer and her supporters call a fee that would be levied against hospitals to help offset the state's share of the costs a ''hospital assessment.'' Opponents call it a ''bed tax.''
Recently, 40 lobbyists, representing at least 110 groups pushing for the expansion, among them hospitals, health care associations and business organizations, huddled in the executive wing of the State Capitol to update the governor's advisers on their progress and hone strategies. One of them reminded colleagues not to encourage enthusiastic Democrats to interfere; later, he said that in Arizona, using Democrats to win over Republicans can be disastrous.
The lobbyists have trained their focus on the Senate, whose president, Andy Biggs, a conservative Republican from a conservative district southeast of Phoenix, they hope to sway.
If enough Senate Republicans get behind the expansion, their thinking goes, House Republicans will follow. The House speaker, Andy Tobin, a Republican, has been carrying on his own offensive, meeting with freshman Democrats to try to dissuade them from voting for the expansion. And in an interview, State Representative John Kavanagh, chairman of the Appropriations Committee and a vociferous opponent of the governor's plan, said that if the measure were to get a vote in the coming days, ''it wouldn't pass.''
''As more facts are revealed about the way it's being funded, the bed tax and all,'' he added, ''more members of our caucus fall off.''
The Medicaid expansion is, by all accounts, the most contentious element of Ms. Brewer's proposed budget, and the proposed hospital fee its sharpest thorn. In private, conservative groups like the Phoenix-based Goldwater Institute have been weighing whether to sue the state, arguing that the assessment is a tax, which would require approval by a two-thirds vote in the Legislature, as prescribed in a ballot measure passed in 1992.
''They'll never get two-thirds out of this chamber,'' Mr. Kavanagh said.
The governor's advisers seemed certain that the vote would not be necessary.
John Arnold, the state's budget director, said the fee would be equal to the difference between what Arizona gets each year from the 1998 settlement with tobacco companies, which was struck as a means for most states to recover health care costs linked to tobacco use, and the state's share of the Medicaid program. The amount is not fixed, he added, as settlement payments, federal contribution to the program and enrollment fluctuate.
Ms. Brewer has argued that expanding Medicaid would provide the state about $1.7 billion in federal financing, and that the state would be able to stop offering benefits to childless adults if federal reimbursement dropped below 80 percent.
In an interview, Darcy A. Olsen, the Goldwater Institute's president, said: ''This money doesn't come free from Washington. Arizona taxpayers pay federal taxes, too.''
The governor has also emphasized Medicaid's current cost (its cost per participant is $680 lower than the national average, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation) and managed-care system (it functions like an H.M.O.), which has helped reduce the number of emergency room visits and the length of hospital stays among participants. And Ms. Brewer has showed no signs of backing off.
''The governor is committed,'' Mr. Benson, her spokesman, said. ''People who follow politics in this state know that when she makes a decision, she digs in her heels.''

HEADLINE: After Rough Patch, 'The Bachelor' Wins Back Viewers

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK and BILL CARTER

 BODY:
No matter which contestant Sean Lowe, the chiseled, strawberry blond, chooses as his fantasy fiancée on the three-hour season finale of ABC's ''The Bachelor'' on Monday -- will it be Catherine Giudici, 26, a quirky graphic designer from Seattle, or Lindsay Yenter, 25, a petite substitute teacher from Fort Bragg, N.C.? -- the network has rekindled the romance between the reality series and its viewers.
After several seasons in decline, ''The Bachelor'' has had a resurgence rare among network reality shows. The glossy dating show, which pairs one hunky (often shirtless) man with dozens of spray-tanned (often bikini-clad) women until he proposes to the ultimate survivor, has also become the unlikely exception in a television season when almost every other show on ABC and its competing networks has declined.
The audience for ''The Bachelor'' has increased by 3 percent this season to 8.8 million in total viewers and by 7 percent to 3.3 million viewers 18 to 49 years old, the group that attracts the most advertisers. The average audience for that group among ABC's regularly scheduled shows is only 2.4 million viewers. 
''It just takes the right gal or guy to all of a sudden regalvanize the audience,'' said Mike Fleiss, the creator and an executive producer of the show.
But the show's recent success has also been a result of a push by the producers to attract younger viewers, to use social media to promote ''live'' viewing and, by tinkering with the casting and format, to encourage viewers to return for subsequent seasons after the bloom is off the previous season's rose.
So after 11 years on television and 17 separate rose-covered editions, ''The Bachelor'' is on the upswing. The show posts the best results in network television on Monday nights with younger women -- those 18 to 34. The viewers' median age is 51.1, young in broadcast television terms. ABC's other hit reality series, ''Dancing With the Stars,'' which has featured former bachelors and bachelorettes, has an average viewer age of 61.6.
ABC emphasizes that the show, far from having the economically downscale profile of some reality shows, is especially strong with women of financial means. In homes with more than $100,000 in income, it scores 34 percent above the television average.
''It really plays right into that sweet spot of upscale women,'' said John Saade, the executive vice president for alternative programs at ABC.
''The Bachelor'' did not always look so promising. The series took an inevitable dive in ratings around its 12th season. Its abysmal record in relationships did not help. None of the final ''rose ceremonies,'' in which the bachelor gives his future fiancée a rose and a Neil Lane diamond engagement ring, had ended in marital bliss. (''The Bachelorette,'' a spinoff, has resulted in two marriages.)
''The show was fading,'' said Mr. Saade, who has worked in ABC's reality department since before the premiere of ''The Bachelor'' in 2002.
The turning point, the producers say, came in the form of Jason Mesnick, the earnest divorced father who starred in season 13. He proposed in the finale only to change his mind and dump the ostensible female ''winner'' (on air) and end up married to Molly Malaney, the runner-up. Mr. Mesnick and Ms. Malaney are expecting their first child together any day now.
''I remember the moment when I let Molly go, and I was uncontrollably crying,'' Mr. Mesnick said from his home in Seattle. ''A producer said, 'Are you sure you made the right call?' '' (In ''Bachelor'' lingo crying over a balcony became known as ''a Mesnick.'')
Mr. Mesnick, who had competed on ''The Bachelorette,'' represented a turning point for the franchise. Mr. Fleiss decided that rather than tapping a mystery man as the bachelor each season, the show should feature the fan favorites whose hearts had been broken on ''The Bachelorette.'' The continuing characters make the series -- and the drama among the heavily made-up women who share a 7,590-square foot house in Agoura Hills, Calif., as they compete for Mr. Lowe's attention -- more like the traditional soap operas once on ABC's daytime schedule.
The shift allowed two audiences for the show to coexist: the traditional fans who still get carried away by the romantic promise every season and the viewers who typically get together to watch, whether in person or online, to enjoy the comedy and follow favorite characters.
Mr. Lowe seems to have struck a chord with the first category, possibly because he describes himself as a devoted Christian. The series features plenty of necking in exotic locales, but Mr. Lowe, who calls himself a ''born-again virgin'' (which probably deserves its own show), kept this season PG-rated.
But ''The Bachelor'' is also watched by groups of young women, over wine and Twitter in sororities on college campuses and in other meeting places. Tabloid magazines, which once had cooled on ''Bachelor'' gossip, are back to stoking the furor, luring female readers by putting a shirtless Mr. Lowe on their covers.
Cameron Ross, a 29-year-old client services manager for an Internet radio company, summed up the appeal as: ''hunky guy, pretty girls, lots of tears and drama.'' She said she usually watched with some friends, tweeting with others. ''It's not the same to watch it alone,'' she said.
Mr. Saade, who said the show was both ''extremely primal'' and ''goofy,'' likens ''The Bachelor'' to a kind of National Football League for women in that it is a collective live television event -- and a sport of sorts.
To encourage live viewing, ABC began embedding viewers' (74 percent of whom are women) commentary on Twitter into the series, encouraging them to forgo the DVR. Last Monday, there were 248,782 tweets about ''The Bachelor,'' making it the biggest show on social media that night, the network said.
The show has made small steps to be more inclusive by casting several African-American contestants and Catherine, an Asian-American finalist, but it still faces persistent criticism for its heavily white casts. In October, a United States District Judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit against ''The Bachelor'' producers for not casting minorities in lead roles.
When the suit was filed, Warner Horizon, the division of Warner Brothers Television that produces ''The Bachelor,'' said the accusations were ''baseless and without merit'' and that the show's producers ''have been consistently -- and publicly -- vocal about seeking diverse candidates for both programs.''
For all the guilty-pleasure viewers, there is also a clear subset of fans who find themselves hate-watching ''The Bachelor'' -- not because they hate the show as much as they hate themselves for getting sucked in to it and its silliness time and again.
''There are those who watch it ironically and those who watch it as the most romanticized wish fulfillment imaginable,'' said Peter Roth, president of Warner Brothers Television. ''All of those brokenhearted cynics are really rooting for this to work.''
Corey Ann Haydu, an author from Brooklyn, is one of the cynics. A fan almost from the beginning of the show's run, she finds herself exasperated by its corniness, even as she will not miss a week. ''I can't stop myself,'' Ms. Haydu, 30, said. ''It's a classic love-hate thing.''
She wrote on Twitter with a friend while watching the show recently, using the hashtag #IHateMyself. ''When it blows up? That's my favorite part,'' Ms. Haydu said of the typically failed engagements.
But Mr. Fleiss defended ''The Bachelor'' for its romantic batting average, saying, ''There's never been a 'Bachelor' divorce.''
He also argues that, despite the decline of ratings for reality programming on networks, some viewers still want the spectacle of unscripted drama.
''The show is a magnifying glass,'' he said. ''If you're a solid person, it will make you seem that much more so. But if you're a little crazy, you'll seem completely insane.''
He cited one of the most-discussed moments this season -- when Tierra LiCausi, a leasing consultant from Las Vegas, was sent home after multiple blowups with the other contestants. As she left, sobbing, Ms. LiCausi, 25, told the camera that she had a ''sparkle'' that intimidates others.
''Nobody wrote that or told her to talk about her dad saying 'You have a sparkle, baby,' '' Mr. Fleiss said. Then referring to the Oscar-winning screenwriter of ''The Social Network,'' he added, ''Aaron Sorkin couldn't come up with that, and he's a genius.''

HEADLINE: Obama Seeks to Bridge Partisan Divide in Search of a Budget Deal

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will go to Capitol Hill this week to try to salvage a big deficit-reduction deal, battling not only Republican resistance but also complaints from Democrats that he mishandled his last attempt.
The president's outreach to rank-and-file lawmakers, like the discontent of liberal Democrats, is the result of Republicans' refusal to accept any additional tax increases to avert the automatic spending cuts that are beginning to affect the government and the economy. It could meet the same failure as Mr. Obama's earlier bids to work privately through Congressional leaders and then to apply public pressure.
Hopes now rest on finding a narrow path through the ideological and political imperatives of both parties. White House aides have not ruled out some money-saving structural reforms to Medicare that Republicans favor, notably an idea promoted by the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, to combine the program's doctor and hospital components with a single deductible for beneficiaries. Using savings from entitlement shifts like that to replace sequestration, as the automatic cuts are called, would meet Republicans' demands not to use tax increases for that purpose. 
At the same time, some Republican senators and aides, publicly and privately, have expressed an openness to accepting revenue increases as part of a loophole-closing overhaul of the tax code. Rolling together budget and tax agreements along those lines would allow Mr. Obama to complete the ''grand bargain'' that he has sought to tackle the nation's long-term budget imbalances as the baby boom generation retires.
He plans to meet separately this week with Senate Democrats, Senate Republicans, House Democrats and House Republicans. White House officials said the consideration of budget plans by the House and Senate in coming weeks would provide a natural forum to explore what deal might be possible this year.
''Hopefully there's an opportunity to work things out through regular order in the House and Senate,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. ''How likely is that? I can't say very likely -- there are strong structural forces in the Republican Party working against it. But if you try and fail you still have an opportunity to build bonds of trust that could be helpful on other issues.''
Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, will introduce a budget blueprint this week that would reduce projected federal spending by $5 trillion over the next decade, repeal Mr. Obama's health care law, substantially remake Medicare and cut $770 billion from the growth of Medicaid over the next 10 years. But Mr. Ryan suggested that he is open to negotiations with the White House, which is opposed to nearly every element of his plan.
''I think there are things that we can do that don't offend either party's philosophy,'' Mr. Ryan said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
Mr. Obama has signaled a willingness to reduce cost-of-living increases for Social Security by using a less-generous measure of inflation. He has indicated openness to imposing means-testing on Medicare beneficiaries so that high-income retirees would pay more for their medical care, and he has put on the table $400 billion of cuts in Medicare over the next decade.
Republicans say they are looking for more, including two elements they discussed with the White House during failed talks in 2011: raising the eligibility age for Medicare and cutting federal costs for Medicaid.
White House officials said that those proposals were deeply flawed as a matter of policy and that they did not intend to submit any more offers until Republicans expressed some willingness to make tax revenue part of the equation.
But Mr. Cantor raised an idea last month that had been endorsed by the Bowles-Simpson deficit-reduction commission: merging Medicare's hospital and doctor coverage into one program in a way that could generate savings. Some Democrats also see that kind of proposal -- in which Medicare is left fundamentally intact but is overhauled to become more efficient and which could potentially charge the affluent elderly more -- as the basis for negotiation.
With all the familiar obstacles looming, however, Democrats are increasingly looking at the previous round of negotiations -- at the end of 2012, as the Bush-era tax cuts were scheduled to expire -- and concluding that Mr. Obama flinched, leaving tax revenue on the table that would have ended the budget standoff on more favorable terms to Democrats.
''There's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
The second-guessing extends to virtually every aspect of the deal: its failure to postpone the automatic budget cuts for more than two months, its failure to raise the federal debt limit and its yield of $600 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years out of $4 trillion of new taxes that would have taken effect had the Bush tax cuts been allowed to expire.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said the White House should have negotiated after the election with the bipartisan group of senators that he is courting now, rather than resuming the talks with Speaker John A. Boehner that failed in 2011. In the agreement that concluded that 2011 standoff, said John D. Podesta, a former White House chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, the administration committed a ''fundamental miscalculation'' by believing Republican opposition to automatic Pentagon cuts would compel them to accept tax increases.
Other Democratic critics say the president should have ratcheted up pressure on Republicans by allowing all the Bush-era tax cuts to expire, even at the risk of saddling middle-class families with tax increases and inflicting harm on the economy.
''Thinking they'd have a second bite of the apple was a real mistake,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
White House aides said the deal was a good one. Not only did they crack Republican resistance to income tax rate increases, they said, but they did it without committing to any major cuts to Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries.
They said that the president was not willing to risk the economy's health by forcing showdowns when he could get much of what he wants through negotiation, and that the president had been able to make progress on changes to immigration policy and gun control thanks in part to the deal.
Moreover, White House officials said their negotiating position had been undercut by calls at earlier points from prominent Democrats like Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, and Senator Charles E. Schumer, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, for tax increases that would affect only families with incomes of at least $500,000, rather than Mr. Obama's preferred $250,000 threshold. (The deal raised the top rate on income over $450,000 for couples and $400,000 for single people). And had they failed to reach a quick deal, White House officials said, they could have lost the opportunity for progress on the rest of the president's second-term agenda.
Some former members of Mr. Obama's economic team said the White House could have gotten more. Jared Bernstein, a former adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., faulted the administration for agreeing to extend the bulk of the Bush-era tax cuts rather than raising more tax revenue that could be used to pay for other priorities.
Peter R. Orszag, who was Mr. Obama's first budget director, said, ''By making the middle-class tax cuts permanent, we've unfortunately locked into a revenue base that is inadequate.''

HEADLINE: 2 Awards for Multicultural Books

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
A month ago a nonprofit called First Book, which promotes literacy among children in low-income communities, announced the Stories for All project, a program intended to prod publishers to print more multicultural books. Kyle Zimmer, First Book's chief executive, says that part of the motivation was the ''chasm'' between the number of people who want such books and what is available. 
On Wednesday, First Book will announce that awards of $500,000 will go to two publishers for their proposals for the project: HarperCollins, the big publishing house owned by News Corporation, and Lee & Low, a minority-owned independent publisher.
In a 2012 study, the Cooperative Children's Book Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison evaluated some 3,600 books, looking for multicultural content. Of the books examined, 3.3 percent were found to be about African-Americans, 2.1 percent were about Asian-Pacific Americans, 1.5 percent were about Latinos and 0.6 percent were about American Indians.
Some 24 publishers responded to the competition, Ms. Zimmer said, and First Book felt that the submissions were so good that it decided to give two awards, instead of one. As part of the arrangement, First Book will add nearly 500 new books to an online store for purchase at a low cost by its member organizations, which all serve children in low-income communities.Money for the grants comes from donations and the proceeds of sales by First Book to its members.
Ms. Zimmer said that because of the short lead time for the competition, not all of the books submitted were by new or minority authors. She said those would follow as the award and related market became better known, likening this phase to the first step in a marathon.
First Book serves people whose incomes are in the bottom third of Americans. It says that while there is great interest within low-income communities for high-quality books featuring diverse characters and cultures, publishers have not served them well because they are unsure of the market. Ms. Zimmer said that in challenging economic times, publishers ''make very conservative decisions and revert to market strategies that have served them historically, but the problem is that they are missing the larger market.''
First Book argues that it is in a position to cater to that larger market and make it a force. In the last year, it has grown from roughly 23,000 member organizations, including schools, churches and shelters, to more than 50,000.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: To at Least One Earthling, Siberia Meteor Proved That Science Is Vital

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
Twice on a recent Friday, the cosmos intruded rudely on us earthlings. A meteor exploded over western Siberia, shattering windows, injuring hundreds and scaring pretty much everyone else. That same day, an asteroid passed within 18,000 miles of us, close enough to arch many an eyebrow among astronomers.
One earthling, at least, looked on the bright side.
''It allows me, when I talk about asteroids, to reference an actual event where people got hurt,'' said Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan for going on two decades. Not that Dr. Tyson was glad that people had been injured. Far from it. All the same, he said over drinks in Lower Manhattan, this cosmic activity ''gives punctuation to my sentence that the human race is at risk.''
''Think of it,'' he said, ''as a shot across our bow.'' 
A warning that the planet could be imperiled has a way of focusing the mind wondrously. So we asked about a huge asteroid called Apophis, whose name alone ought to give one pause.
''It's from the Egyptian god of death and destruction,'' Dr. Tyson said. ''It was named knowing that it crosses Earth's orbit.'' Otherwise, he said, ''we would have named it something less threatening, like Tiffany or Bambi.''
Scientists say it will fly uncomfortably close to us in 2029 and again in 2036 and yet again in 2068. Luck, Dr. Tyson is convinced, will not be forever on our side. ''What is a certainty is that one day Apophis and Earth will collide,'' he said. ''So our goal should be, if the survival of our civilization is a concern and a priority, to find a way to deflect it.''
''We know how to do it,'' he said, but he added this disheartened postscript: ''There's no funded plan to do so anywhere in the world.''
The possibility of planetary cataclysm was not on our agenda when we invited Dr. Tyson to break bread. The original question was simpler: Could the latest brushes with asteroids get people thinking about the universe more, well, cosmically?
Because his schedule is forever tight, a proposed meal turned into late-afternoon drinks at the Beekman Pub, around the corner from City Hall and a short walk from his home. (Memo to accounting: you will be happy to hear that all he had to drink was a Diet Pepsi, with lime. His tablemate splurged on a beer.)
Dr. Tyson -- Bronx-reared and, as he likes to point out, born in the same week in 1958 as NASA -- is given to speaking not in whole sentences but, rather, in whole paragraphs. He has a gift for putting the fizz in physics and taking the sigh out of science.
Chances are he is no stranger to you. He is a television semiregular. Dr. Tyson even turned up, in illustrated form, in the January issue of Action Comics, identifying a plausible location in the real cosmos for Krypton, which had been Superman's home planet.
He theorized that Krypton could have orbited a red dwarf star in the Corvus constellation, 27 light years from Earth. That's roughly 160 trillion miles away, in case you are thinking of a trip.
The whole thing, he said, was DC Comics' idea: ''As a lifelong resident of Metropolis, the least I could do is allow my likeness to be in conversation with Superman.''
These days, Dr. Tyson is less focused on the planetarium than on creating a new iteration of ''Cosmos,'' the hit PBS series featuring Carl Sagan, which was first broadcast in 1980. This sequel, for the Fox network, is planned for early next year.
One of its producers is Seth MacFarlane. Yup, that Seth MacFarlane, the ''Family Guy'' guy and (to some viewers) the cringe-inducing host of this year's Academy Awards show. Whatever one may think of his brand of comedy, ''Seth MacFarlane is deeply committed to science literacy in this country,'' Dr. Tyson said, and the two of them share a goal: reinforcing the idea that ''science needs to be taken to people's hearts in a way that they become better citizens for it.''
Is he saying that we treat science and mathematics shabbily in this country, where many people are all too proud to admit to a fear of all sums? Actually, Dr. Tyson said, ''I don't think the country's less literate in math and science than ever before.''
''I cite, for example, how familiar people are with images from the Hubble telescope,'' he said. ''The Hubble did not require a P.R. person to become famous. It did all the P.R. on its own.''
Pop culture, too, is part of ''a positive trend line,'' given science-themed blockbuster films like ''Avatar'' and the durable ''Star Wars'' series, and popular television programs like the ''C.S.I.'' and ''NCIS'' franchises and ''The Big Bang Theory.''
''There was a day when we didn't have science at all in television programming,'' Dr. Tyson said between sips of his soda. ''Now it's there, without having to stereotype the lab-coated, wire-haired character.''
Here's the real problem, as he sees it: ''You have people who are not scientifically literate who have risen to positions of power and control,'' whether on local school boards or in Congress. He mentioned Representative Paul C. Broun, a Georgia Republican (and doctor) who sits on the House Science Committee and who says the world is 9,000 years old and was literally created in six days.
Voters, Dr. Tyson said, need to grasp the consequences of their electoral choices, especially if they produce officials who ''undermine the source of creativity for tomorrow's economy.'' Meddle with the citizenry's understanding of science and technology, he said, and people ''will emerge on the other side incapable of making the discoveries and innovations that the nation requires in order to stay economically competitive.''
When it comes to the Creation, ''if you use the Bible as your science textbook, you will go astray -- there's no question about it,'' he said, adding: ''Galileo understood this. He can be credited with drawing a line in the sand with his famous quote that the Bible tells you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.''
With all due respect to Galileo, he does not top Dr. Tyson's list of science greats. ''The first person I would meet the day a time machine gets invented'' is Isaac Newton, he said.
On this afternoon, Dr. Tyson wore a pale yellow tie emblazoned with Newton's image. It instantly caught the eye, as did a red rose tucked into the breast pocket of his jacket, a souvenir from a luncheon that day. The rose was in itself both a science lesson and a reminder of the planet's fragility.
''Flowers capture some of why we value life,'' he said. ''If a flower were permanent, it would be so much less meaningful to the person you gave it to. It's the fact that you know it will die in a matter of days that you care for it and you appreciate its beauty all the more.''

HEADLINE: In Talk Show Tour, Jeb Bush Promotes Book on Immigration and Replies to Critics

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Stoking speculation about his presidential ambitions, Jeb Bush, the Republican former governor of Florida, performed a rare Washington feat on Sunday, appearing on all the morning talk shows as part of a blitz that has become equal parts book promotion and damage control.
Mr. Bush has assumed a higher profile than at any time since he left office six years ago as he talks up his new book, ''Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution.'' But on Sunday he continued to struggle against criticism that the book reflects a reversal of his longtime position on immigration. 
Even Republicans, including those working in Congress on a bipartisan overhaul of immigration law, have complained that Mr. Bush has shifted from supporting a path to citizenship for 11 million people who are here illegally to instead calling for some legal status short of citizenship. The critics say that only a measure that provides steps toward full citizenship can become law.
Mr. Bush said Sunday that he had spoken with one Republican critic, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who favors a path to citizenship and is part of a bipartisan group working on a deal to overhaul the immigration system, and that he had given him the book and reassured him.
''I told him that I support his efforts, and I applaud what he's doing,'' Mr. Bush said on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' referring to Mr. Graham. ''And he concluded, after he heard what the thesis of the book is, that we're in sync.''
But, he added, ''The basic premise needs to be that coming to the country legally should be easier, with less cost, than coming to the country illegally.''
On the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' Mr. Bush said that his views on immigration ''absolutely'' coincided with those of Senator Marco Rubio, his former protégé in Florida. Mr. Rubio is also a member of the group involved in immigration talks, and he supports a path to citizenship. He is also considered to be a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.
Asked on the CNN program ''State of the Union'' about President Obama's recent outreach to Congressional Republicans, Mr. Bush was generally complimentary. ''I'm not a cynic about this,'' he said. ''And I think Republicans appreciate it.
Yet on ''Face the Nation,'' Mr. Bush both praised the president's 2012 campaign for its success despite a weak economy and accused him of ''dividing the country'' with ''a campaign of them and us'' because Mr. Obama has said that wealthy people were not paying their fair share of taxes.
Mr. Bush did not hesitate, however, when asked whether he would encourage Republicans to accept higher revenue to get a deficit-reduction deal with Mr. Obama. ''I wouldn't say, 'No, heck no, and that's it.' ''
By contrast, in an appearance on ''Fox News Sunday,'' Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican who chairs the House Budget Committee and is considered another potential candidate for the party's presidential nomination, reiterated his opposition to raising revenue.
''There is an impasse here,'' Mr. Ryan said.
This week, Mr. Ryan plans to start House action on his plan to balance the budget within a decade, largely by reducing spending on Medicare, Medicaid and federal pensions.
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Bush also differed in fielding questions about their respective presidential aspirations.
Mr. Ryan, the 2012 Republican nominee for vice president, seemed to welcome the idea. ''I enjoyed the experience,'' he said.
Mr. Bush, a younger brother of President George W. Bush and son of President George Bush, was more coy. ''I'm not thinking about it,'' he said on ''Face the Nation.'' ''We just had an election.''

HEADLINE: Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall

BYLINE: By MICHAEL DEAR. 
Michael Dear, a professor of city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley, is the author, most recently, of ''Why Walls Won't Work: Repairing the U.S.-Mexico Divide.''

 BODY:
BERKELEY, Calif.
NEARLY 700 miles of walls now separate the United States and Mexico. Would-be migrants still find ways over, under, through and around them. As a tool for controlling immigration to the United States, the border fortifications have been remarkably ill suited to the task. And yet these barriers are having a significant and lasting effect nonetheless: they are harming communities on both sides of the border.
We should tear them down before the damage becomes irreparable.
After Sept. 11, 2001, President George W. Bush instructed the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize the construction of fortifications along the Mexican border. The result has been an astonishing array of barriers across America's southern frontier. The number of Border Patrol agents doubled in seven years to more than 21,000. And interior enforcement was expanded to identify, detain, prosecute and deport undocumented migrants. 
From the numbers, it might seem as if such efforts have worked to stem illegal immigration. Today, Border Patrol apprehensions have fallen to levels seen in the mid-1970s.
But evidence suggests this decline has less to do with tightened enforcement than with economic factors: the reductions have been driven largely by weak job prospects in the United States and a resurgent economy in Mexico, which have kept more would-be migrants at home.
Even so, President Obama has continued most of Mr. Bush's programs -- and, in fact, increased deportations to nearly 410,000 in 2012, the highest number ever. The vast majority of these deportations were to Mexico. Two principal agencies, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, spent nearly $18 billion in 2012 -- enforcing what Janet Napolitano, the secretary of Homeland Security, calls a no-nonsense approach to immigration. Such an effort is necessary, she said, in order for voters to support comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants.
But rather than no-nonsense, America's approach to building walls has been nonsensical.
Along the river boundary, the wide meanders of the Rio Grande made it impossible to build a continuous, straight-line fence. So the barriers were constructed north of the river -- slicing off part of a nature reserve here, a few holes of a golf course there and cutting a university campus in two. United States citizens stranded on the ''Mexican side'' of the interior divide wonder if they now live in Mexico.
Barriers in Texas, moreover, are disproportionately located in poor and minority communities -- a pattern that is so clear that it sometimes becomes farcical: plans for one fence, for instance, show it ending abruptly at the edge of a billionaire's property.
Inside Arizona, checkpoints have been established on major freeways. Posted signs report the number of arrests made and kilos of narcotics seized, but many commuters are just plain irritated by the delays. Government agencies have arrived to enforce immigration law, and some Arizonans have taken to welcoming visitors to their ''police state.''
Many locals lost patience with a pilot project to build nine surveillance towers north of the borderline, complaining that the cameras were pointed at them, not toward Mexico. Members of the Tohono O'odham Nation, whose territory is bisected by the international boundary, have felt especially aggrieved by what they view as a reoccupation of their land by federal agents.
In California, during the fence-building frenzy of 2009, I met a Border Patrol agent and project engineer at Smuggler's Gulch -- a deep canyon near the Pacific Ocean where the Department of Homeland Security had dumped in an estimated 2 million cubic yards of dirt and then fenced in the landfill to prevent access from Mexico. The canyon stream still flowed across the border, so engineers built a tunnel under the landfill to permit the water's passage. The tunnel entrance and exit were gated, but the agent predicted that migrants would soon use the tunnel to cross. ''Ninety percent of this is politics,'' said the engineer.
Borderlanders have done their best to adjust to this increasingly bizarre world. Crossing times at the border first doubled, then tripled, from what they had been before the fences, but people learned to factor the holdups into their commute times. Television news programs even began reporting crossing delays along with the weather report.
Such adjustments, though, barely mitigate the outrage that many Americans feel toward the encroachment of hideous barriers into their once open land.
Nor do these daily adjustments change the fact that the border fence is harming an ancient human ecosystem. Mutual interdependence has always been a hallmark of cross-border lives. Residents on both sides of the line regard parts of Mexico and the United States as their home. For them, the border is a connective membrane, not a line of demarcation. Often describing themselves as ''transborder citizens,'' they have more in common with one another than with their host nations.
Besides sentiments of belonging and shared destiny, this ''third nation,'' as it is known, is bolstered by synergistic local economies. Border states are among the fastest-growing regions in both countries. Ciudad Juárez, once a city of 1.5 million, lost about a quarter-million inhabitants who fled from drug cartel-related violence to various destinations across Mexico. Yet the city's industries continue to add jobs, fostering some $80 billion in trade between Juárez and neighboring El Paso in 2011, a $10 billion increase from the previous year. In El Paso, the arrival of 30,000 sanctuary seekers from Juárez created a boom in real estate and restaurant businesses.
Cross-border institutions also reinforce binational ties. For more than a century, the International Boundary and Water Commission, with representatives from the United States and Mexico, has overseen water issues along the border and supported joint development projects.
The border fence, however, undermines this cooperation and cohesion, as it splinters lives and scars landscapes. Likewise, to many who live here, the border patrols, with their ever watching drones, feel more like an occupying army.
Add to this the enormous expense of maintaining the fortifications -- estimated to be $6.5 billion over the next 20 years -- and it's clear that the costs of these structures far outweigh any benefit they offer in deterring illegal immigration.
We can prevent further waste by just demolishing the Mexico-United States Barrier today.
Of course, whether we act boldly now or not, it will eventually come down, just as other barriers have fallen. The Berlin Wall was demolished virtually overnight, its fragments sold as souvenirs of a bygone cold war. When it is finally recognized for what it is -- a manifestation of a failed immigration policy -- our border fence will fall to angry residents, avid recyclers and souvenir hunters.
When that happens, someone ought to preserve a few sections for the Smithsonian, to mark the moment when America's national identity is again defined by something more durable than a strip of steel.

HEADLINE: A Senate Watchdog of Waning Significance

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats have a problem called Robert Menendez. It may mean that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which the lawmaker heads, will be unable to play an important and much-needed role of overseer.
The New Jersey Democrat became chairman of the panel when John Kerry was tapped to be secretary of state. Never a foreign policy heavyweight to begin with, Mr. Menendez is now the subject of conflict-of-interest allegations that are being looked at by the F.B.I. and the Senate Ethics Committee.
The Foreign Relations Committee has never been a driving legislative venue, keeping mostly to ratifying treaties. It can, however, serve as a valuable classroom to spotlight crucial foreign policy issues -- and as an oversight panel whose chairman can have a complementary role in shaping policies. 
None of that seems possible under Mr. Menendez, known chiefly during his single term in the Senate as a savvy, tough politician and a prodigious fund-raiser.
It is one of these big contributors, a Florida doctor, who is currently causing problems for the 59-year-old lawmaker; Mr. Menendez is accused of having improperly intervened to help his donor with contracts in the Dominican Republic.
The senator insists he has done nothing wrong. Some of the allegations, of personal rather than professional lapses, may well be phony and fueled by politics. He is presumed innocent in all cases, although the accusations are serious enough, even if there were no illegal acts, to diminish his credibility as a national figure.
Mr. Menendez is an accidental chairman. Since 2008, five more senior Democrats have left the panel, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Kerry.
At times, the Foreign Relations Committee has played a pivotal role in U.S. policy. Negatively, it was a Republican chairman, Henry Cabot Lodge, who scuttled President Woodrow Wilson's League of Nations after World War I. After World War II, another Republican chairman, Arthur H. Vandenberg, fashioned a bipartisan foreign policy with the Truman administration.
Almost a half century ago, Chairman J. William Fulbright, in a remarkable series of hearings, questioned the underlying rationale and wisdom of the war in Vietnam, which he had initially supported. The Fulbright sessions opened the door to a national dialogue and debate that ultimately led to the U.S. withdrawal.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, a Republican, in two separate stints as chairman, reinvigorated the committee, even if it was too often ignored by the president and the public.
On the eve of the invasion of Iraq, the panel heard from Gen. Anthony Zinni of the U.S. Marine Corps and other experts that the architects of the conflict were totally ill-prepared for a post-combat occupation. They ridiculed administration claims that rebuilding could be achieved within two years, that the weapons of mass destruction would be destroyed and that a vibrant new political and economic system would emerge.
Ten years later, Iraq has yet to create a viable political and economic system.
Even though they went unheeded, Mr. Lugar's efforts set the predicate for the ensuing, robust debate.
The shorter Kerry stint wasn't as productive, but the Massachusetts senator played a contributory role as an unofficial special envoy to trouble spots for the Obama administration.
As secretary of state, he will be solicitous of his former committee. In the Obama administration, however, foreign policy has been set mainly in the White House, which shows little interest in congressional prerogatives; transparency has been less than promised and the role of Congress, in matters like Libya, ignored.
There could be an important agenda for a vibrant committee: the challenges of cyberwarfare; the Arab Spring; possible confrontation with Iran; and Mr. Obama's so-called pivot to Asia.
The oversight function, so often ignored by Congress, could also be valuable, for example, on foreign aid: how it's done, where it succeeds and where it doesn't.
There are other Senate panels dealing with national security: the Armed Services Committee, which does a decent job of oversight, and the Intelligence Committee, which doesn't.
Foreign Relations seems destined for a return to the days of ineffective chairmen like Claiborne Pell, a Democrat, or polarizing ones like Jesse Helms, a Republican, even though the current senior minority member, Bob Corker of Tennessee, is willing to work with Democrats.
That's unfortunate. Although no administration believes it, it is healthy when Congress keeps its feet to the fire, not with cheap shots -- as with the Benghazi imbroglio -- but in a serious fashion, by broadening the discussion about major geopolitical concerns, certainly war and peace.
Instead, the recent warnings of former Senator Jim Webb in The National Interest will probably resonate: ''On the issues of who should decide when and where to use force and for how long, and what our country's long-term relations should consist of in the aftermath,'' he wrote in the journal, ''Congress is mostly tolerated and frequently ignored.''

HEADLINE: Dwindling Deficit Disorder

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
For three years and more, policy debate in Washington has been dominated by warnings about the dangers of budget deficits. A few lonely economists have tried from the beginning to point out that this fixation is all wrong, that deficit spending is actually appropriate in a depressed economy. But even though the deficit scolds have been wrong about everything so far -- where are the soaring interest rates we were promised? -- protests that we are having the wrong conversation have consistently fallen on deaf ears.
What's really remarkable at this point, however, is the persistence of the deficit fixation in the face of rapidly changing facts. People still talk as if the deficit were exploding, as if the United States budget were on an unsustainable path; in fact, the deficit is falling more rapidly than it has for generations, it is already down to sustainable levels, and it is too small given the state of the economy. 
Start with the raw numbers. America's budget deficit soared after the 2008 financial crisis and the recession that went with it, as revenue plunged and spending on unemployment benefits and other safety-net programs rose. And this rise in the deficit was a good thing! Federal spending helped sustain the economy at a time when the private sector was in panicked retreat; arguably, the stabilizing role of a large government was the main reason the Great Recession didn't turn into a full replay of the Great Depression.
But after peaking in 2009 at $1.4 trillion, the deficit began coming down. The Congressional Budget Office expects the deficit for fiscal 2013 (which began in October and is almost half over) to be $845 billion. That may still sound like a big number, but given the state of the economy it really isn't.
Bear in mind that the budget doesn't have to be balanced to put us on a fiscally sustainable path; all we need is a deficit small enough that debt grows more slowly than the economy. To take the classic example, America never did pay off the debt from World War II -- in fact, our debt doubled in the 30 years that followed the war. But debt as a percentage of G.D.P. fell by three-quarters over the same period.
Right now, a sustainable deficit would be around $460 billion. The actual deficit is bigger than that. But according to new estimates by the budget office, half of our current deficit reflects the effects of a still-depressed economy. The ''cyclically adjusted'' deficit -- what the deficit would be if we were near full employment -- is only about $423 billion, which puts it in the sustainable range; next year the budget office expects that number to fall to just $172 billion. And that's why budget office projections show the nation's debt position more or less stable over the next decade.
So we do not, repeat do not, face any kind of deficit crisis either now or for years to come.
There are, of course, longer-term fiscal issues: rising health costs and an aging population will put the budget under growing pressure over the course of the 2020s. But I have yet to see any coherent explanation of why these longer-run concerns should determine budget policy right now. And as I said, given the needs of the economy, the deficit is currently too small.
Put it this way: Smart fiscal policy involves having the government spend when the private sector won't, supporting the economy when it is weak and reducing debt only when it is strong. Yet the cyclically adjusted deficit as a share of G.D.P. is currently about what it was in 2006, at the height of the housing boom -- and it is headed down.
Yes, we'll want to reduce deficits once the economy recovers, and there are gratifying signs that a solid recovery is finally under way. But unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, is still unacceptably high. ''The boom, not the slump, is the time for austerity,'' John Maynard Keynes declared many years ago. He was right -- all you have to do is look at Europe to see the disastrous effects of austerity on weak economies. And this is still nothing like a boom.
Now, I'm aware that the facts about our dwindling deficit are unwelcome in many quarters. Fiscal fearmongering is a major industry inside the Beltway, especially among those looking for excuses to do what they really want, namely dismantle Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. People whose careers are heavily invested in the deficit-scold industry don't want to let evidence undermine their scare tactics; as the deficit dwindles, we're sure to encounter a blizzard of bogus numbers purporting to show that we're still in some kind of fiscal crisis.
But we aren't. The deficit is indeed dwindling, and the case for making the deficit a central policy concern, which was never very strong given low borrowing costs and high unemployment, has now completely vanished.

HEADLINE: After Cashing In on Job Cuts, Wall St. Looks to Worker Upturn

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Wall Street is hopeful that American companies, after years of gaining ground at the expense of their employees, will start to succeed because of the rising fortune of those workers.
Less than a week since the Dow Jones industrial average hit its all-time high, the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is on track to surpass its own 2007 high. The reason, in no small part, is because of investor confidence in the growing economic strength of American households.
This is a shift from the last few years, when stocks and corporate profits soared primarily because of cost-cutting and increased productivity from a shrinking or slow-growing work force. The Federal Reserve's stimulus programs helped corporate America, but they did little to help improve the lives of most American workers, whose wages declined while unemployment remained stuck at high levels.
A surprisingly good employment report on Friday was the strongest of a number of recent indicators that the benefits of the Fed's program are now starting to trickle down to ordinary Americans, who should, in turn, push up sales at American companies. In addition to brisk job growth in recent months, the February employment report gave some of the first evidence of a sustained upturn in wages, and showed that it was spread across many industries. 
The improving job market could falter, particularly if cutbacks in government spending mandated by the so-called sequester take a substantial bite out of economic growth. But even a more modest upturn comes not a moment too soon for American companies.
Growth in corporate profits has slowed in recent quarters as the earlier gains from productivity and cost-cutting reached their limits. Many strategists are now seeing signs that the slowdown in expense reduction -- the so-called bottom line -- is being made up for by top-line growth in revenues from reviving American consumers.
''You can only cut and cut and cut for so long, eventually you have to have growth,'' said Paul Hickey, a founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. ''Now we're starting to see some signs that is happening.''
In the fourth quarter, American companies experienced the biggest increase in sales per share of any quarter since the financial crisis, according to figures from RBS Securities. In announcing their most recent financial results, many executives spoke about the boost they have gotten from American customers, and the money they are putting back into the pockets of their own employees.
Daniel S. Fulton, the chief executive of Weyerhaeuser Company, a timber company, told investors in January, ''Most of the hiring that we have done in the company has been production employees that we've been putting back to work, in order to be able to ramp up and respond to the increased opportunities for wood products.'' The improving prospects for corporate revenues are encouragement to hesitant investors who have been wondering whether to get back into the stock market but worried that the current rally could already be reaching its peak. After six straight days of gains, the S.& P. 500 closed Friday just 14 points, or 0.9 percent, from the record high of 1,565.15 it hit in October 2007. Factoring in inflation, however, the index is still far from earlier peaks, as is the Dow.
The sequestration's automatic spending cuts have not yet appeared in economic data and there are fears it could exert a future drag on the economic recovery. But Friday's employment report -- showing a gain of 236,000 jobs and a dip in the jobless rate to 7.7 percent -- suggested that American businesses have largely shrugged off the 2 percentage point increase in the payroll tax that was expected to inflict more pain.
Even if corporate revenues climb further, it won't necessarily lead to rising share prices. Investors have already factored the optimistic economic signs while making their investments.
What's more, skeptical strategists say there are significant threats ahead for both consumers and corporations. The basic fear in trading circles is that the economic recovery will not be able to survive the Fed's ending its bond-buying programs. When the Fed does step back from its support for the market, it is expected to send up interest rates, which could dampen lending and the housing market.
''How do you wean an economy off of this easy money policy, which was never meant to be as protracted as it has become?'' said Edward Marrinan, the head of macro credit strategy at RBS Securities.
But the Fed has so far been adamant that it will maintain its support for the economy at least until the unemployment rate drops to 6.5 percent. The trajectory the economy has been following is what Fed officials broadly projected when they began giant purchases of bonds in 2008. The money was expected first to shore up the balance sheets of the banks and then help push up the stock portfolios of higher-income Americans. But lower interest rates were also expected eventually to lift the housing market, and then corporate investment in new employees. Data released in recent weeks suggest both are happening.
A number of Wall Street economists responded to the February jobs data by increasing their projection for economic growth this year. Goldman Sachs raised its estimate to 2.6 percent from 2.2 percent, while the bond guru William H. Gross went further and doubled his firm's previous projection to 3 percent in an interview with Bloomberg Radio.
The Ford Motor Company is one of many that came into the year facing expectations that its revenues would stagnate as a result of a recession in Europe and budget fights in Washington. The company did show declines in its European sales, but it surprised analysts by reporting a 5.5 percent increase in revenue in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. In January and February, the company's sales have continued to be better than expected. Ford executives have shown their confidence by announcing a new hiring push, including 450 jobs at a plant in Ohio.
''We are seeing housing really kick in a little bit more,'' Ford's chief economist, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, said in a March 1 call. ''I think it's encouraging to see that consumers may have a little bit of nerves of steel in light of the sequestration.''
Most Americans are still far from the income they had before the crisis, and many of the new jobs are not particularly stable or high paying. But Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said there were the foundations for a virtuous circle.
''This is how growth feeds on itself -- increased employment leads to increased spending,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said.

HEADLINE: When to Say No

 BODY:
The State Department's latest environmental assessment of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline makes no recommendation about whether President Obama should approve it. Here is ours. He should say no, and for one overriding reason: A president who has repeatedly identified climate change as one of humanity's most pressing dangers cannot in good conscience approve a project that -- even by the State Department's most cautious calculations -- can only add to the problem.
The 875-mile pipeline avoids the route of an earlier proposal that traversed the ecologically sensitive Sand Hills of Nebraska and threatened an important aquifer. It would carry 830,000 barrels a day of crude oil from the tar sands of Alberta to pipelines in the United States and then onward to refineries on the Gulf Coast. From there, most of the fuel would be sent abroad. 
To its credit, the State Department acknowledges that extracting, refining and burning the oil from the tar-laden sands is a dirtier process than it had previously stated, yielding annual greenhouse gas emissions roughly 17 percent higher than the average crude oil used in the United States. But its dry language understates the environmental damage involved: the destruction of the forests that lie atop the sands and are themselves an important storehouse for carbon, and the streams that flow through them. And by focusing on the annual figure, it fails to consider the cumulative year-after-year effect of steadily increasing production from a deposit that is estimated to hold 170 billion barrels of oil that can be recovered with today's technology and may hold 10 times that amount altogether.
It is these long-term consequences that Mr. Obama should focus on. Mainstream scientists are virtually unanimous in stating that the one sure way to avert the worst consequences of climate change is to decarbonize the world economy by finding cleaner sources of energy while leaving more fossil fuels in the ground. Given its carbon content, tar sands oil should be among the first fossil fuels we decide to leave alone.
Supporters of the pipeline have argued that this is oil from a friendly country and that Canada will sell it anyway. We hope Mr. Obama will see the flaw in this argument. Saying no to the pipeline will not stop Canada from developing the tar sands, but it will force the construction of new pipelines through Canada itself. And that will require Canadians to play a larger role in deciding whether a massive expansion of tar sands development is prudent. At the very least, saying no to the Keystone XL will slow down plans to triple tar sands production from just under two million barrels a day now to six million barrels a day by 2030.
The State Department will release a fuller review in early summer, and at some point after that the White House will decide. That decision will say a lot about whether Mr. Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry, are willing to exert global leadership on the climate change issue. Speaking of global warming in his State of the Union address, Mr. Obama pledged that ''if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.'' Mr. Kerry has since spoken of the need to safeguard for coming generations a world that is not ravaged by rising seas, deadly superstorms, devastating droughts and other destructive forces created by a changing climate.
In itself, the Keystone pipeline will not push the world into a climate apocalypse. But it will continue to fuel our appetite for oil and add to the carbon load in the atmosphere. There is no need to accept it.

HEADLINE: Confirmation Questions for Mary Jo White

 BODY:
Mary Jo White, President Obama's nominee for chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is expected to win Senate approval after her confirmation hearing on Tuesday. But unless Ms. White is aggressively questioned, neither the senators nor the public will have a clear idea of the kind of chairwoman she will be. 
Those who want a get-tough approach with the financial industry will focus on her years as a top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, from 1993 to 2002. Those who want a Wall Street ally at the S.E.C. will focus on her work in the past 10 years as a corporate attorney, representing big banks and other major corporations.The public deserves more from the hearing than a foregone conclusion. Senators should press Ms. White to give specifics on how she would handle potential conflicts as well as her approach to the job:
¶Does she believe deregulation was a major cause of the financial crisis; if so, what is still in need of fixing?
¶Government ethics rules focus on financial conflicts of interest, and Ms. White must demonstrate compliance with those rules. She must also address nonfinancial conflicts. Since her husband is also a top corporate lawyer, decisions made in the public interest at the S.E.C. will inevitably strain the couple's professional and social relationships. Why is she willing to take that risk?
¶Much of the discussion about her nomination has centered on the agency's enforcement agenda. But in fact, rule-making is likely to be her main task. Where does she stand on the biggest challenges, like the Volcker Rule, which bans proprietary trading by banks to rein in speculation? The banks argue that it is nearly impossible to distinguish between trades that would be allowed and those that would be barred. Does Ms. White share that view?
¶Banks oppose new derivatives rules that apply to their overseas subsidiaries. Does she believe strong regulation is possible without including such subsidiaries?
¶On executive pay, corporate officers have resisted the law's clear call for more disclosure. Will she quickly enforce the law?
A revolving-door career is not necessarily disqualifying. But it does require Ms. White to confront and allay justifiable concerns about her allegiances.

HEADLINE: North Korea Faces Pressure From U.N. on Human Rights

BYLINE: By NICK CUMMING-BRUCE and CHOE SANG-HUN; Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul and Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva.

 BODY:
GENEVA -- Already angry over tougher sanctions imposed last week to punish its nuclear tests, North Korea faces renewed pressure over its human rights record as the United Nations Human Rights Council meets Monday to consider calls for an international inquiry into possible crimes against humanity.
Marzuki Darusman, an investigator for the United Nations, is expected to present a report to the council urging the creation of an international commission of inquiry to follow up on the abuses recorded in the eight years that a United Nations official has monitored human rights in the North. 
''An inquiry mechanism could produce a more complete picture, quantify and qualify the violations in terms of international law, attribute responsibility to particular actors or perpetrators of these violations and suggest effective courses of international action,'' Mr. Darusman said in the report.
His recommendation will be taken up in a resolution sponsored by Japan and the European Union that the 47-member council was expected to adopt when it votes later in March. The proposal, backed by the United Nations human rights chief, Navi Pillay, as well as various human rights organizations, is expected to draw on concerns about North Korea's conduct that prompted both the council and the General Assembly to pass resolutions last year condemning Pyongyang.
''We are in effect ramping up international political pressure on this unparalleled, systemwide failure in respect to human rights,'' Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe, the American ambassador to the Human Rights Council, said by telephone. ''We're hoping that even if it doesn't crack the whole system that on some of these issues we might see some opening and some change because of this pressure.''
Japan has been a strong supporter of a human rights investigation into North Korea. Japan has accused North Korea of kidnapping some of its citizens, and the issue remains a popular human rights and political cause.
The creation of a commission of inquiry would be a victory for defectors from North Korea, including a handful of people who are said to be survivors of the isolated country's infamous prison camps. Some of them have become among the most vocal campaigners for human rights in North Korea, holding rallies, testifying about starvation and torture in gulags and arguing that foreign governments must break their silence about the people living under one of the most repressive systems in the world.
That argument has not always been popular in South Korea, where many of the defectors live. Many South Koreans believe that without an effective means of pressuring North Korea, which has defied and survived decades of international sanctions, an open challenge of its human rights record would only make it more paranoid and repressive.
South Korea used to abstain from any United Nations vote on human rights resolutions on North Korea. But after a conservative party took power five years ago, Seoul began voting for and even leading such moves. It also supports the creation of the commission of inquiry.
Coupled with the new set of United Nations sanctions, the human rights report was expected to increase the pressure on the young North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Reports of a guarded relaxation of state control of the economy in North Korea have alternated with signs of a renewed crackdown on outside influences.
Concern over its nuclear program has sharpened international attention on North Korea, but human rights activists say that the North had rebuffed criticism of its abuses and that a commission of inquiry would provide a long-overdue spotlight on them.
''Increased scrutiny by international inquiry affords a measure of protection, especially when coupled with the prospect of future criminal investigations and the deterrent effect such a prospect may have on individual perpetrators,'' according to Mr. Darusman's report.
Mr. Darusman, taking stock of the United Nations investigations to date, identifies nine patterns of human rights violations, including denial of access to food, arbitrary detention in prison camps that are estimated to hold up to 200,000 people, and abductions of foreigners. Many, if not all, of these patterns ''may amount to crimes against humanity, committed as part of systematic and/or widespread attacks against civilian populations,'' the report says.
Testimony from prisoners who have escaped the North Korean gulags appears to have played a part in the decision to take action. Ms. Pillay, in calling for an international inquiry in January, cited the ''extremely harrowing'' nature of the accounts she had received in a meeting with two of the escaped prisoners, describing a system that she called ''the very antithesis of international human rights norms.''
After eight years of inquiries, investigators had reached the point where they were forced to call for greater resources to continue their research, Mr. Darusman said in a telephone interview. Like other investigators, he has worked with a single assistant, limiting a sustained investigation. A commission of inquiry is likely to have three members, including Mr. Darusman, supported by researchers and a full-time secretariat.
Even if an inquiry is commissioned, it remains unclear how effective it will be except as political symbol. North Korea does not allow outside investigators. And other countries have few means to force Pyongyang to provide access. No outsider has ever had a glimpse of a North Korean prison camp.
North Korea rejected a critical General Assembly resolution in December as a ''political plot'' that escalated confrontation. The abuses that North Korea is accused of committing ''cannot be allowed to exist in our country, where human rights and the fundamental freedom of the people are formally guaranteed by the legal system,'' said Kim Song, the North Korean ambassador to the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Working at Home: Pros and Cons

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thank you for a balanced assessment of working at home (''Location, Location, Location,'' editorial, March 3). I have been a software developer since 1958, working in several modes: first in the office day and night; then, with a personal computer, at home nights and weekends.
In 1989, my company opened an office in Ireland, and I worked from home full time. We talked daily and exchanged floppy disks by mail, later using the Internet. Both sides were well satisfied. 
In 1996, I joined a small company that allowed me to work from home, but I did come to feel overlooked, so I returned to the office. After the company was sold, the local office closed, and working from home was my only option.
I am happy and productive in this job, by now with all of the access to computers and co-workers one could hope for. I work more hours than I did when office-based, and I'm also able to take more effective breaks.
Innovation is hard to measure, and interaction is unquestionably important, but technology provides many ways to collaborate, and small, shared cubicles foster more jangled nerves than innovation. Ironically, the push for togetherness has come just as remote interaction has become far easier, and a mounting number of studies document the advantages of working from home.
I suspect that at least part of the motivation is lack of trust or fear of loss of control. What we need is a balanced approach based on both job requirements and employee preference.
PATRICIA BRITT Port Townsend, Wash., March 3, 2013
To the Editor:
Managers who fail to appreciate that a ''wireless'' world is an ''always connected'' world -- an always communicating and collaborating world -- pose a formidable cultural barrier to telework. Similarly, uncomprehending state governments pose regulatory barriers.
Despite telework's many economic, transportation, environmental and emergency preparedness benefits, states insist on threatening nonresident telecommuters working for in-state employers with double taxation on their wages. Applying an anachronistic rule known as the ''convenience of the employer'' rule, states will tax nonresidents on the income they earn at home even though their home states can tax that income, too. The risk of owing two states taxes on the same wages makes telework unaffordable for many Americans.
Federal legislation barring states from double-taxing interstate telecommuters is long overdue. Congress should set a good example for Yahoo and encourage a nationwide water cooler -- people everywhere working together.
NICOLE BELSON GOLUBOFF Scarsdale, N.Y., March 3, 2013
The writer, a lawyer, is the author of ''The Law of Telecommuting'' and ''Telecommuting for Lawyers.''
To the Editor:
''Location, Location, Location'' cites studies on increased productivity resulting from telecommuting. It says the ''missed serendipitous encounters between employees at the office that lead to new products or strategies'' are ''hard to measure but an article of faith.''
Bell Labs, where I worked for seven years, was perhaps the most productive, innovative corporate technology institution in the 20th century. It produced solutions, including the transistor and information theory, that revolutionized communications and resulted in greatly increased productivity.
The very architecture of the buildings at Bell Labs' Murray Hill, N.J., headquarters was designed to stress the importance of employees' interactions. ''All buildings have been connected so as to avoid fixed geographical delineation between departments and to encourage free interchange and close contact among them,'' according to a Bell Labs executive quoted in Jon Gertner's book ''The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation.''
Bell Labs was the gold standard for innovation. It was designed to encourage serendipitous encounters.

HEADLINE: Smaller States Find Outsize Clout Growing in Senate

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK; Amanda Cox and Derek Willis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
RUTLAND, Vt. -- In the four years after the financial crisis struck, a great wave of federal stimulus money washed over Rutland County. It helped pay for bridges, roads, preschool programs, a community health center, buses and fire trucks, water mains and tanks, even a project to make sure fish could still swim down the river while a bridge was being rebuilt.
Just down Route 4, at the New York border, the landscape abruptly turns from spiffy to scruffy. Washington County, N.Y., which is home to about 60,000 people -- just as Rutland is -- saw only a quarter as much money.
''We didn't receive a lot,'' said Peter Aust, the president of the local chamber of commerce on the New York side. ''We never saw any of the positive impact of the stimulus funds.'' 
Vermont's 625,000 residents have two United States senators, and so do New York's 19 million. That means that a Vermonter has 30 times the voting power in the Senate of a New Yorker just over the state line -- the biggest inequality between two adjacent states. The nation's largest gap, between Wyoming and California, is more than double that.
The difference in the fortunes of Rutland and Washington Counties reflects the growing disparity in their citizens' voting power, and it is not an anomaly. The Constitution has always given residents of states with small populations a lift, but the size and importance of the gap has grown markedly in recent decades, in ways the framers probably never anticipated. It affects the political dynamic of issues as varied as gun control, immigration and campaign finance.
In response, lawmakers, lawyers and watchdog groups have begun pushing for change. A lawsuit to curb the small-state advantage in the Senate's rules is moving through the courts. The Senate has already made modest changes to rules concerning the filibuster, which has particularly benefited senators from small states. And eight states and the District of Columbia have endorsed a proposal to reduce the chances that the small-state advantage in the Electoral College will allow a loser of the popular vote to win the presidency.
To be sure, some scholars and members of Congress view the small-state advantage as a vital part of the constitutional structure and say the growth of that advantage is no cause for worry. Others say it is an authentic but insoluble problem.
What is certain is that the power of the smaller states is large and growing. Political scientists call it a striking exception to the democratic principle of ''one person, one vote.'' Indeed, they say, the Senate may be the least democratic legislative chamber in any developed nation.
Behind the growth of the advantage is an increase in population gap between large and small states, with large states adding many more people than small ones in the last half-century. There is a widening demographic split, too, with the larger states becoming more urban and liberal, and the smaller ones remaining rural and conservative, which lends a new significance to the disparity in their political power.
The threat of the filibuster in the Senate, which has become far more common than in past decades, plays a role, too. Research by two political scientists, Lauren C. Bell and L. Marvin Overby, has found that small-state senators, often in leadership positions, have amplified their power by using the filibuster more often than their large-state counterparts.
Beyond influencing government spending, these shifts generally benefit conservative causes and hurt liberal ones. When small states block or shape legislation backed by senators representing a majority of Americans, most of the senators on the winning side tend to be Republicans, because Republicans disproportionately live in small states and Democrats, especially African-Americans and Latinos, are more likely to live in large states like California, New York, Florida and Illinois. Among the nation's five smallest states, only Vermont tilts liberal, while Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas have each voted Republican in every presidential election since 1968.
Recent bills to overhaul the immigration system and increase disclosure of campaign spending have won the support of senators representing a majority of the population but have not yet passed. A sweeping climate bill, meant to raise the cost of carbon emissions, passed the House, where seats are allocated by population, but not the Senate.
Each of those bills is a major Democratic Party priority. Throughout his second term, President Obama is likely to be lining up with a majority of large-state Congress members on his biggest goals and against a majority of small-state lawmakers.
It is easiest to measure the small-state advantage in dollars. Over the past few years, as the federal government has spent hundreds of billions to respond to the financial crisis, it has done much more to assist the residents of small states than large ones. The top five per capita recipients of federal stimulus grants were states so small that they have only a single House member.
''From highway bills to homeland security,'' said Sarah A. Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, ''small states make out like bandits.''
Here in Rutland, the federal government has spent $2,500 per person since early 2009, compared with $600 per person across the state border in Washington County.
As the money started arriving, Senator Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent, took credit for having delivered a ''hefty share of the national funding.'' Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, vowed to fight for her state's ''fair share.''
As a matter of constitutional design, small states have punched above their weight politically for as long as the United States has existed. The founding of the country depended in part on the Great Compromise, which created a legislative chamber -- the Senate -- in which every state had the same political voice, regardless of population. The advantage small states enjoy in the Senate is echoed in the Electoral College, where each state is allocated votes not only for its House members (reflecting the state's population) but also for its senators (a two-vote bonus).
No one expects the small-state advantage to disappear, given its constitutional roots. But its growing importance has caused some large-state policy makers and advocates for giving all citizens an equal voice in democracy to begin exploring ways to counteract it. Those pushing for change tend to be Democrats.
One plan, enacted into law by eight states and the District of Columbia, would effectively cancel the small states' Electoral College edge. The nine jurisdictions have pledged to allocate their 132 electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote -- if they can persuade states with 138 more votes to make the same commitment. (That would represent the bare majority of the 538 electoral votes needed for a presidential candidate to prevail.)
The states that have agreed to the arrangement range in size from Vermont to California, and they are dominated by Democrats. But support for changing the Electoral College cuts across party lines. In a recent Gallup Poll, 61 percent of Republicans, 63 percent of independents and 66 percent of Democrats said they favored abolishing the system and awarding the presidency to the winner of the popular vote.
In 2000, had electoral votes been allocated by population, without the two-vote bonuses, Al Gore would have prevailed over George W. Bush. Alexander Keyssar, a historian of democracy at Harvard, said he would not be surprised if another Republican candidate won the presidency while losing the popular vote in coming decades, given the structure of the Electoral College.
Critics of the outsize power of small states have also turned to the courts. In December, four House members and the advocacy group Common Cause filed an appeal in a lawsuit challenging the Senate's filibuster rule on the ground that it ''upsets the balance in the Great Compromise'' that created the Senate.
The filibuster ''has significantly increased the underrepresentation of people living in the most populous states,'' the suit said. But for the rule, it said, the Dream Act, which would have given some immigrants who arrived illegally as children a path to legalization, and the Disclose Act, requiring greater reporting of political spending, would be law.
A federal judge in Washington dismissed the suit, saying he was ''powerless to address'' what he acknowledged was an ''important and controversial issue.'' The judge instead sided with lawyers for the Senate, who said that the challengers lacked standing to sue and that the courts lacked power to rule on the internal workings of another branch of the government.
However these individual efforts fare, the basic disparity between large and small states is wired into the constitutional framework. Some scholars say that this is as it should be and that the advantages enjoyed by small states are necessary to prevent them from becoming a voiceless minority.
''Without it, wealth and power would tend to flow to the prosperous coasts and cities and away from less-populated rural areas,'' said Stephen Macedo, a political scientist at Princeton.
Gary L. Gregg II, a political scientist who holds the Mitch McConnell Chair in Leadership at the University of Louisville, similarly argued that urban areas already have enough power, as the home of most major government agencies, news media organizations, companies and universities. ''A simple, direct democracy will centralize all power,'' he wrote recently, ''in urban areas to the detriment of the rest of the nation.''
Others say the country needs to make changes to preserve its democratic vitality. They have called for an overhaul of the Constitution, as far-fetched an idea as that may be.
''The Senate constitutes a threat to the vitality of the American political system in the 21st century,'' said Sanford Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas, ''and it warrants a constitutional convention to rectify it.''
Frances E. Lee, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, said the problem was as real as the solution elusive, adding that she and other scholars have tried without success to find a contemporary reason to exempt the Senate from the usual rules of granting citizens an equal voice in their government. ''I can't think of any way to justify it based on democratic principles,'' Professor Lee said.
The Biggest Gap of All
Fresno, Calif., is a city of a half-million people with a long list of problems, including 14 percent unemployment, the aftermath of a foreclosure crisis, homeless encampments that dot the sun-blasted landscape and worries about the safety of the surrounding county's drinking water.
A thousand miles away, a roughly comparable number of people inhabit the entire state of Wyoming. Like Fresno and its environs, Wyoming is rural, with an economy largely based on agriculture. It is also in much better shape than Fresno, with an unemployment rate around 5 percent.
Even so, Wyoming receives far more assistance from the federal government than Fresno does. The half-million residents of Wyoming also have much more sway over federal policy than the half-million residents of Fresno. The vote people in Fresno remember best was taken in 2007, when an immigration overhaul bill that included a guest worker program failed in the Senate. Both agricultural businesses and leaders of Fresno's large Hispanic population supported the bill, much as polls suggested a majority of Americans did.
But the immigration bill died in the Senate after a 53-46 vote rejecting a bid to move the bill forward to final passage. Wyoming's two senators were in the majority and California's two senators on the losing side.
Had the votes been allocated by population, the result would have been lopsided in the other direction, with 57 votes in favor and 43 against.
Even 57 votes would not have been enough to overcome a filibuster, which requires 60. In the last few years, 41 senators representing as little as a third of the nation's population have frequently blocked legislation, as the filibuster (or the threat of it) has become a routine part of Senate business.
Beyond the filibuster, senators from Wyoming and other small states regularly oppose and often thwart programs popular in states with vastly bigger populations. The 38 million people who live in the nation's 22 smallest states, including Wyoming, are represented by 44 senators. The 38 million residents of California are represented by two senators.
In one of every 10 especially consequential votes in the Senate over the two decades ending in 2010, as chosen by Congressional Quarterly, the winning side would have lost had voting been allocated by population. And in 24 of the 27 such votes, the majority of the senators on the winning side were Republicans.
David Mayhew, a political scientist at Yale, cautioned that the political benefit to Republicans is ''quite small as well as quite stable,'' adding that it is important not to lose sight of small blue states like Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Vermont. But he acknowledged that small states of both political stripes receive disproportionate federal benefits. Professor Lee, an author of ''Sizing Up the Senate: The Unequal Consequences of Equal Representation,'' argues that the partisan impact of the small-state advantage is larger. ''There is a Republican tilt in the Senate,'' she said.
''The way Republicans are distributed across the nation is more efficient,'' she added, referring to the more even allocation of Republican voters, allowing them to form majorities in small-population states. Democrats are more tightly clustered, especially in large metropolitan areas.
Born of a Compromise
Equal representation of the states in the Senate is a consequence of the Great Compromise, the 1787 deal that resolved a seemingly intractable dispute between the smaller states and a handful of large ones like Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia. But the country was very different then. The population was about four million, and the maximum disparity in voting power between states was perhaps 11 to 1. It is now six times greater than that. Even scholars who criticize how voting power is allocated in the Senate agree that parts of its design play an important role in the constitutional structure. With its longer terms and fewer members, the Senate can, in theory, be more collegial, take the long view and be insulated from passing passions.
But those qualities do not depend on unequal representation among people who live in different states. The current allocation of power in the Senate, many legal scholars and political scientists say, does not protect minorities with distinctive characteristics, much less disadvantaged ones.
To the contrary, the disproportionate voting power of small states is a sort of happenstance that has on occasion left a stain on the nation's history.
Robert A. Dahl, the Yale political scientist, who is 97 and has been studying American government for more than 70 years, has argued that slavery survived thanks to the disproportionate influence of small-population Southern states. The House passed eight antislavery measures between 1800 and 1860; all died in the Senate. The civil rights movement of the mid-20th century, he added, was slowed by senators representing small-population states.
As the population of the United States has grown a hundredfold since the founding, to more than 310 million, the Supreme Court has swept away most instances of unequal representation beyond the Senate. In a series of seminal cases in the 1960s, the court forbade states to give small-population counties or districts a larger voice than ones with more people, in both state legislatures and the House.
''The conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing -- one person, one vote,'' Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the court in 1963, referring to the amendments that extended the franchise to blacks and women and required the popular election of the Senate.
The rulings revolutionized American politics -- everywhere but in the Senate, which the Constitution protected from change and where the disparities in voting power have instead become more extreme.
A Barrier to Change
In his memoirs, Chief Justice Earl Warren described the cases from the 1960s establishing the equality of each citizen's vote as the most important achievement of the court he led for 16 years. That made them more important in his view than Brown v. Board of Education, which ordered the desegregation of public schools, and Gideon v. Wainwright, which guaranteed lawyers for poor people accused of serious crimes.
''Legislators represent people, not trees or acres,'' Chief Justice Warren wrote for the court in 1964, rejecting the argument that state senators, like federal ones, could represent geographic areas with varying populations. ''Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.''
Applying that principle to the Senate would be very hard. Even an ordinary constitutional amendment would not do the trick, as the framers of the Constitution went out of their way to require states to agree before their power is diminished. Article V of the Constitution sets out the procedure for amendments and requires a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or action by two-thirds of state legislatures to get things started. But the article makes an exception for the Senate. ''No state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate,'' the article concludes.
The United States Senate is hardly the only legislature that does not stick strictly to the principle of equal representation. Political scientists use the term ''malapportioned'' to describe the phenomenon, and it is common around the world.
But the Senate is in contention for the least democratic legislative chamber. In some other countries with federal systems, in which states or provinces have independent political power, a malapportioned upper house may have only a weak or advisory role. In the United States, the Senate is at least equal in power to the House, and it possesses some distinctive responsibilities, like treaty ratification and the approval of presidential appointments. A recent appeals court decision severely limiting the president's power to make recess appointments, if it stands, will further increase the Senate's power.
Professor Dahl has calculated the difference between the local government unit with the most voting power and that with the least. The smallest ratio, 1.5, was in Austria, while in Belgium, Spain, India, Germany, Australia and Canada the ratio was never higher than 21 to 1.
In this country, the ratio between Wyoming's representation and California's is 66 to 1. By that measure, Professor Dahl found, only Brazil, Argentina and Russia had less democratic chambers. A separate analysis, by David Samuels and Richard Snyder, similarly found that geographically large countries with federal systems tend to overrepresent sparsely populated areas.
This pattern has policy consequences, notably ones concerning the environment. ''Nations with malapportioned political systems have lower gasoline taxes (and lower pump prices) than nations with more equitable representation of urban constituencies,'' two political scientists, J. Lawrence Broz and Daniel Maliniak, wrote in a recent study. Such countries also took longer to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, if they ratified it at all. These differences were, they wrote, a consequence of the fact that ''rural voters in industrialized countries rely more heavily on fossil fuels than urban voters.''
In 2009, the House of Representatives narrowly approved a bill to address climate change, but only after months of horse-trading that granted concessions and money to rural states. That was an example, Mr. Broz and Mr. Maliniak said, of compensating rural residents for the burdens of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
But it was not enough. The bill died in the Senate.

HEADLINE: Smaller States Find Outsize Clout Growing in Senate

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK; Amanda Cox and Derek Willis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
RUTLAND, Vt. -- In the four years after the financial crisis struck, a great wave of federal stimulus money washed over Rutland County. It helped pay for bridges, roads, preschool programs, a community health center, buses and fire trucks, water mains and tanks, even a project to make sure fish could still swim down the river while a bridge was being rebuilt.
Just down Route 4, at the New York border, the landscape abruptly turns from spiffy to scruffy. Washington County, N.Y., which is home to about 60,000 people -- just as Rutland is -- saw only a quarter as much money.
''We didn't receive a lot,'' said Peter Aust, the president of the local chamber of commerce on the New York side. ''We never saw any of the positive impact of the stimulus funds.'' 
Vermont's 625,000 residents have two United States senators, and so do New York's 19 million. That means that a Vermonter has 30 times the voting power in the Senate of a New Yorker just over the state line -- the biggest inequality between two adjacent states. The nation's largest gap, between Wyoming and California, is more than double that.
The difference in the fortunes of Rutland and Washington Counties reflects the growing disparity in their citizens' voting power, and it is not an anomaly. The Constitution has always given residents of states with small populations a lift, but the size and importance of the gap has grown markedly in recent decades, in ways the framers probably never anticipated. It affects the political dynamic of issues as varied as gun control, immigration and campaign finance.
In response, lawmakers, lawyers and watchdog groups have begun pushing for change. A lawsuit to curb the small-state advantage in the Senate's rules is moving through the courts. The Senate has already made modest changes to rules concerning the filibuster, which has particularly benefited senators from small states. And eight states and the District of Columbia have endorsed a proposal to reduce the chances that the small-state advantage in the Electoral College will allow a loser of the popular vote to win the presidency.
To be sure, some scholars and members of Congress view the small-state advantage as a vital part of the constitutional structure and say the growth of that advantage is no cause for worry. Others say it is an authentic but insoluble problem.
What is certain is that the power of the smaller states is large and growing. Political scientists call it a striking exception to the democratic principle of ''one person, one vote.'' Indeed, they say, the Senate may be the least democratic legislative chamber in any developed nation.
Behind the growth of the advantage is an increase in population gap between large and small states, with large states adding many more people than small ones in the last half-century. There is a widening demographic split, too, with the larger states becoming more urban and liberal, and the smaller ones remaining rural and conservative, which lends a new significance to the disparity in their political power.
The threat of the filibuster in the Senate, which has become far more common than in past decades, plays a role, too. Research by two political scientists, Lauren C. Bell and L. Marvin Overby, has found that small-state senators, often in leadership positions, have amplified their power by using the filibuster more often than their large-state counterparts.
Beyond influencing government spending, these shifts generally benefit conservative causes and hurt liberal ones. When small states block or shape legislation backed by senators representing a majority of Americans, most of the senators on the winning side tend to be Republicans, because Republicans disproportionately live in small states and Democrats, especially African-Americans and Latinos, are more likely to live in large states like California, New York, Florida and Illinois. Among the nation's five smallest states, only Vermont tilts liberal, while Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas have each voted Republican in every presidential election since 1968.
Recent bills to overhaul the immigration system and increase disclosure of campaign spending have won the support of senators representing a majority of the population but have not yet passed. A sweeping climate bill, meant to raise the cost of carbon emissions, passed the House, where seats are allocated by population, but not the Senate.
Each of those bills is a major Democratic Party priority. Throughout his second term, President Obama is likely to be lining up with a majority of large-state Congress members on his biggest goals and against a majority of small-state lawmakers.
It is easiest to measure the small-state advantage in dollars. Over the past few years, as the federal government has spent hundreds of billions to respond to the financial crisis, it has done much more to assist the residents of small states than large ones. The top five per capita recipients of federal stimulus grants were states so small that they have only a single House member.
''From highway bills to homeland security,'' said Sarah A. Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, ''small states make out like bandits.''
Here in Rutland, the federal government has spent $2,500 per person since early 2009, compared with $600 per person across the state border in Washington County.
As the money started arriving, Senator Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent, took credit for having delivered a ''hefty share of the national funding.'' Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, vowed to fight for her state's ''fair share.''
As a matter of constitutional design, small states have punched above their weight politically for as long as the United States has existed. The founding of the country depended in part on the Great Compromise, which created a legislative chamber -- the Senate -- in which every state had the same political voice, regardless of population. The advantage small states enjoy in the Senate is echoed in the Electoral College, where each state is allocated votes not only for its House members (reflecting the state's population) but also for its senators (a two-vote bonus).
No one expects the small-state advantage to disappear, given its constitutional roots. But its growing importance has caused some large-state policy makers and advocates for giving all citizens an equal voice in democracy to begin exploring ways to counteract it. Those pushing for change tend to be Democrats.
One plan, enacted into law by eight states and the District of Columbia, would effectively cancel the small states' Electoral College edge. The nine jurisdictions have pledged to allocate their 132 electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote -- if they can persuade states with 138 more votes to make the same commitment. (That would represent the bare majority of the 538 electoral votes needed for a presidential candidate to prevail.)
The states that have agreed to the arrangement range in size from Vermont to California, and they are dominated by Democrats. But support for changing the Electoral College cuts across party lines. In a recent Gallup Poll, 61 percent of Republicans, 63 percent of independents and 66 percent of Democrats said they favored abolishing the system and awarding the presidency to the winner of the popular vote.
In 2000, had electoral votes been allocated by population, without the two-vote bonuses, Al Gore would have prevailed over George W. Bush. Alexander Keyssar, a historian of democracy at Harvard, said he would not be surprised if another Republican candidate won the presidency while losing the popular vote in coming decades, given the structure of the Electoral College.
Critics of the outsize power of small states have also turned to the courts. In December, four House members and the advocacy group Common Cause filed an appeal in a lawsuit challenging the Senate's filibuster rule on the ground that it ''upsets the balance in the Great Compromise'' that created the Senate.
The filibuster ''has significantly increased the underrepresentation of people living in the most populous states,'' the suit said. But for the rule, it said, the Dream Act, which would have given some immigrants who arrived illegally as children a path to legalization, and the Disclose Act, requiring greater reporting of political spending, would be law.
A federal judge in Washington dismissed the suit, saying he was ''powerless to address'' what he acknowledged was an ''important and controversial issue.'' The judge instead sided with lawyers for the Senate, who said that the challengers lacked standing to sue and that the courts lacked power to rule on the internal workings of another branch of the government.
However these individual efforts fare, the basic disparity between large and small states is wired into the constitutional framework. Some scholars say that this is as it should be and that the advantages enjoyed by small states are necessary to prevent them from becoming a voiceless minority.
''Without it, wealth and power would tend to flow to the prosperous coasts and cities and away from less-populated rural areas,'' said Stephen Macedo, a political scientist at Princeton.
Gary L. Gregg II, a political scientist who holds the Mitch McConnell Chair in Leadership at the University of Louisville, similarly argued that urban areas already have enough power, as the home of most major government agencies, news media organizations, companies and universities. ''A simple, direct democracy will centralize all power,'' he wrote recently, ''in urban areas to the detriment of the rest of the nation.''
Others say the country needs to make changes to preserve its democratic vitality. They have called for an overhaul of the Constitution, as far-fetched an idea as that may be.
''The Senate constitutes a threat to the vitality of the American political system in the 21st century,'' said Sanford Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas, ''and it warrants a constitutional convention to rectify it.''
Frances E. Lee, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, said the problem was as real as the solution elusive, adding that she and other scholars have tried without success to find a contemporary reason to exempt the Senate from the usual rules of granting citizens an equal voice in their government. ''I can't think of any way to justify it based on democratic principles,'' Professor Lee said.
The Biggest Gap of All
Fresno, Calif., is a city of a half-million people with a long list of problems, including 14 percent unemployment, the aftermath of a foreclosure crisis, homeless encampments that dot the sun-blasted landscape and worries about the safety of the surrounding county's drinking water.
A thousand miles away, a roughly comparable number of people inhabit the entire state of Wyoming. Like Fresno and its environs, Wyoming is rural, with an economy largely based on agriculture. It is also in much better shape than Fresno, with an unemployment rate around 5 percent.
Even so, Wyoming receives far more assistance from the federal government than Fresno does. The half-million residents of Wyoming also have much more sway over federal policy than the half-million residents of Fresno. The vote people in Fresno remember best was taken in 2007, when an immigration overhaul bill that included a guest worker program failed in the Senate. Both agricultural businesses and leaders of Fresno's large Hispanic population supported the bill, much as polls suggested a majority of Americans did.
But the immigration bill died in the Senate after a 53-46 vote rejecting a bid to move the bill forward to final passage. Wyoming's two senators were in the majority and California's two senators on the losing side.
Had the votes been allocated by population, the result would have been lopsided in the other direction, with 57 votes in favor and 43 against.
Even 57 votes would not have been enough to overcome a filibuster, which requires 60. In the last few years, 41 senators representing as little as a third of the nation's population have frequently blocked legislation, as the filibuster (or the threat of it) has become a routine part of Senate business.
Beyond the filibuster, senators from Wyoming and other small states regularly oppose and often thwart programs popular in states with vastly bigger populations. The 38 million people who live in the nation's 22 smallest states, including Wyoming, are represented by 44 senators. The 38 million residents of California are represented by two senators.
In one of every 10 especially consequential votes in the Senate over the two decades ending in 2010, as chosen by Congressional Quarterly, the winning side would have lost had voting been allocated by population. And in 24 of the 27 such votes, the majority of the senators on the winning side were Republicans.
David Mayhew, a political scientist at Yale, cautioned that the political benefit to Republicans is ''quite small as well as quite stable,'' adding that it is important not to lose sight of small blue states like Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Vermont. But he acknowledged that small states of both political stripes receive disproportionate federal benefits. Professor Lee, an author of ''Sizing Up the Senate: The Unequal Consequences of Equal Representation,'' argues that the partisan impact of the small-state advantage is larger. ''There is a Republican tilt in the Senate,'' she said.
''The way Republicans are distributed across the nation is more efficient,'' she added, referring to the more even allocation of Republican voters, allowing them to form majorities in small-population states. Democrats are more tightly clustered, especially in large metropolitan areas.
Born of a Compromise
Equal representation of the states in the Senate is a consequence of the Great Compromise, the 1787 deal that resolved a seemingly intractable dispute between the smaller states and a handful of large ones like Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia. But the country was very different then. The population was about four million, and the maximum disparity in voting power between states was perhaps 11 to 1. It is now six times greater than that. Even scholars who criticize how voting power is allocated in the Senate agree that parts of its design play an important role in the constitutional structure. With its longer terms and fewer members, the Senate can, in theory, be more collegial, take the long view and be insulated from passing passions.
But those qualities do not depend on unequal representation among people who live in different states. The current allocation of power in the Senate, many legal scholars and political scientists say, does not protect minorities with distinctive characteristics, much less disadvantaged ones.
To the contrary, the disproportionate voting power of small states is a sort of happenstance that has on occasion left a stain on the nation's history.
Robert A. Dahl, the Yale political scientist, who is 97 and has been studying American government for more than 70 years, has argued that slavery survived thanks to the disproportionate influence of small-population Southern states. The House passed eight antislavery measures between 1800 and 1860; all died in the Senate. The civil rights movement of the mid-20th century, he added, was slowed by senators representing small-population states.
As the population of the United States has grown a hundredfold since the founding, to more than 310 million, the Supreme Court has swept away most instances of unequal representation beyond the Senate. In a series of seminal cases in the 1960s, the court forbade states to give small-population counties or districts a larger voice than ones with more people, in both state legislatures and the House.
''The conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing -- one person, one vote,'' Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the court in 1963, referring to the amendments that extended the franchise to blacks and women and required the popular election of the Senate.
The rulings revolutionized American politics -- everywhere but in the Senate, which the Constitution protected from change and where the disparities in voting power have instead become more extreme.
A Barrier to Change
In his memoirs, Chief Justice Earl Warren described the cases from the 1960s establishing the equality of each citizen's vote as the most important achievement of the court he led for 16 years. That made them more important in his view than Brown v. Board of Education, which ordered the desegregation of public schools, and Gideon v. Wainwright, which guaranteed lawyers for poor people accused of serious crimes.
''Legislators represent people, not trees or acres,'' Chief Justice Warren wrote for the court in 1964, rejecting the argument that state senators, like federal ones, could represent geographic areas with varying populations. ''Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.''
Applying that principle to the Senate would be very hard. Even an ordinary constitutional amendment would not do the trick, as the framers of the Constitution went out of their way to require states to agree before their power is diminished. Article V of the Constitution sets out the procedure for amendments and requires a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or action by two-thirds of state legislatures to get things started. But the article makes an exception for the Senate. ''No state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate,'' the article concludes.
The United States Senate is hardly the only legislature that does not stick strictly to the principle of equal representation. Political scientists use the term ''malapportioned'' to describe the phenomenon, and it is common around the world.
But the Senate is in contention for the least democratic legislative chamber. In some other countries with federal systems, in which states or provinces have independent political power, a malapportioned upper house may have only a weak or advisory role. In the United States, the Senate is at least equal in power to the House, and it possesses some distinctive responsibilities, like treaty ratification and the approval of presidential appointments. A recent appeals court decision severely limiting the president's power to make recess appointments, if it stands, will further increase the Senate's power.
Professor Dahl has calculated the difference between the local government unit with the most voting power and that with the least. The smallest ratio, 1.5, was in Austria, while in Belgium, Spain, India, Germany, Australia and Canada the ratio was never higher than 21 to 1.
In this country, the ratio between Wyoming's representation and California's is 66 to 1. By that measure, Professor Dahl found, only Brazil, Argentina and Russia had less democratic chambers. A separate analysis, by David Samuels and Richard Snyder, similarly found that geographically large countries with federal systems tend to overrepresent sparsely populated areas.
This pattern has policy consequences, notably ones concerning the environment. ''Nations with malapportioned political systems have lower gasoline taxes (and lower pump prices) than nations with more equitable representation of urban constituencies,'' two political scientists, J.

HEADLINE: JOBS Act Successes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Steven Rattner asserts that ''the JOBS Act has little to do with employment'' (''A Sneaky Way to Deregulate,'' Op-Ed, March 4), but the data say otherwise. The respected Kauffman Foundation has found that start-ups and emerging growth firms less than five years old -- the very firms the JOBS Act assists -- are responsible for almost all net job growth. President Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness echoed these findings. 
Since President Obama signed the bipartisan bill in April, some very successful initial public offerings by small and midsize firms have taken advantage of the law's provisions. The online travel site Kayak and the discount retailer Five Below went public using the JOBS Act's five-year exemption from the onerous mandates of laws such as Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank. These firms are now trading above their initial public offering prices and are expanding their operations.
The JOBS Act certainly factored into the small but significant drop in unemployment the United States saw this fall. More paring of excessive rules burdening start-ups could improve the jobs picture even further.

HEADLINE: Gujarat Is Yours, Modi Tells America

BYLINE: AARTI VIRANI


HIGHLIGHT: His message to Indian-Americans via video conference was that nation should come before religion. 

 BODY:
[Video: Watch on Youtube.]
EDISON, New Jersey -Gujarat's controversial chief minister, Narendra Modi, unfurled his definition of secularism, addressing hundreds of Indian-Americans in New Jersey and Chicago through a live telecast from Ahmedabad on Sunday.
"India first," he bellowed in English, during a speech that he was delivering in Hindi. "We must never let India, her honor, or the dreams of the people be adversely affected - our country is above all religions," he continued in Hindi. 
Organized by the Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party, the event Sunday was kicked off with a series of high-octane speeches from Modi enthusiasts.
They included Ramesh Patel, the chairman of the Federation of Indian Associations, who took the opportunity to speak out against organizers of the Wharton India Economic Forum, who canceled Mr. Modi's keynote address, slated for March 23, because of questions about his human rights record - an issue that also cost him a visa to the United States almost eight years ago.
Mr. Modi, who is regularly accused of having taken insufficient action against the 2002 anti-Muslim riots that killed nearly 1,000 people in Gujarat, routinely denies these allegations. "We should condemn Wharton," Mr. Patel urged. "We cannot tolerate this sort of discrimination towards a democratically elected leader."
An estimated crowd of hundreds of people had gathered at the venue in Edison, New Jersey, and Chicago, to listen to Mr. Modi.
Other community leaders, like Satya Dosapati, a volunteer with Americans For Free Speech, handed out leaflets calling for organized action against the Ivy League school. "Basically, we want to protest the suppression of free speech and the freedom of expression," Mr. Dosapati stressed. "An educational institution should be able to hear different voices, including voices of dissent. Our protest will be held at the same time and venue as the Wharton event."
The Wharton controversy was conspicuously absent from Mr. Modi's hourlong telecast, however, as he opened his remarks with a whirlwind history of global leadership. "The 19th century was Europe's, the 20th century was America's," he began. "And it was at the turn of the last century that it was agreed that the coming century would be Asia's."
Mr. Modi then shifted his focus toward economic development and India's burgeoning youth population. "Over 65 percent of our nation is younger than the age of 35," he stated. "As the world's most youthful nation, it is our duty to provide skills to our youth so they can shine," he said. The ruling United Progressive Alliance, led by the Congress Party, recently devoted 10 billion rupees, or about $180 million, toward skill development for India as a whole in its recently released budget. In comparison, Gujarat-"a small state," Mr. Modi said -allocated 8 billion rupees.
"Gujarat has created a new ray of hope; it is natural that it draws attention from the world," Mr. Modi said, eliciting energetic bursts of applause from the audience. Gujarat's 60 million people "are my family, their happiness is my happiness and their problems are my problems. Winning or losing elections must never be our aim," said the four-term chief minister. "When we get a mandate of five years, we must serve the people selflessly. If we do that, people will forgive our mistakes as well."
Mr. Modi touted his constituent state as a model of economic resilience, pointing out that despite a global recession, Gujarat boasted progress in a variety of sectors, including tourism, where it saw a tourist arrival rate that was more than double the national average.
"Gujaratis are the best tourists," Mr. Modi quipped, in closing. "But until recently, Gujarat was never a tourist destination." As he encouraged members of the Indian diaspora to make more frequent visits, he quoted a slogan (part of a series of iconic ads featuring the Bollywood stalwart, Amitabh Bachchan) that has become synonymous with his home state: "Kuch din to guzaro Gujarat mein [Spend a few days in Gujarat]. Gujarat is yours."

HEADLINE: Framing - and Reflecting - Beauty

BYLINE: MAURICE BERGER


HIGHLIGHT: A photo in Deborah WIllis&#8217;s new exhibit shows a woman holding a mirror inside a beauty parlor. It underscores how African-Americans have constructed their image to empower themselves. 

 BODY:
Inside a beauty parlor in a small Florida town, Carrie is having her hair done. She is oblivious to the commotion around her. Peering intently into a mirror, she is at that quintessential moment of beautification when she must decide if the image she sees pleases her and she is ready to face the world. 
Deborah Willis captured that moment in Eatonville, a small, predominantly African-American town outside of Orlando. But you could argue that she first encountered that moment - many times over - as a child at her mother's Philadelphia beauty shop.
That candid portrait is part of "Framing Beauty," Ms. Willis's exhibition at the International Visions Gallery in Washington (on view through April 13), which explores how present-day African-Americans construct their identity and image. But the storied artifacts, subjects and communities depicted in these photographs imbue them with both a sense of history and continuity with the past. 
The subjects of "Framing Beauty" are the students and beneficiaries of a long history of African-American vigilance and activism - a poignant insight revealed in Ms. Willis's photograph of Carrie. In Eatonville, a town known for its legacy of autonomy, Carrie grasps - and controls - the mirror that reflects her determined and attractive face, a metaphor of the personal ways African-Americans have constructed their image in order to empower themselves. 
The photograph, one of five beauty parlor images in "Framing Beauty," reminds us of the powerful role of the beauty industry in African-American history and culture. As the historian Tiffany M. Gill points out in her book "Beauty Shop Politics," these businesses spurred not only black entrepreneurship in the Jim Crow era but also political activism. Motivated by such organizations as the National Negro Business League, African-American women in search of economic independence created vibrant communal spaces where women supported each other in the service of social and cultural change. 
That historical allusions abound in Ms. Willis's exhibition is not surprising. In addition to her photographic work, she is a widely known historian and curator of African-American photography. Influenced by her father, an amateur photographer, and her cousin, the proprietor of a photo studio, she was inspired to become an artist after reading a library copy of Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes's "The Sweet Flypaper of Life" in the early 1960s. 
It was the first time Ms. Willis, 65, had seen a book with photographs of black people, which changed her life. She pursued her formal studies at the Philadelphia College of Art in the mid-1970s, later receiving an M.F.A. from the Pratt Institute and a Ph.D. in cultural studies from George Mason University. 
"Framing Beauty" is informed by Ms. Willis's scholarship. Not just about the way contemporary African-Americans shape their self-image, the work ultimately reminds of the historic ways photography allowed a people to countermand the negative image of themselves in the culture at large. The exhibition helps us to understand, as Ms. Willis observes, the extent to which the medium allowed a people, even in times of abject oppression, to "experiment with varied ideas of themselves and ultimately to honor how they saw themselves and wished to be seen by others." 
Eatonville, one of a number of locations represented in "Framing Beauty," provided Ms. Willis with a perfect environment to explore the rich connection between past and present notions of African-American identity and self-presentation. 
Eatonville was one of the first black towns to incorporate after the Civil War. It soon became a Southern mecca for African-American culture and the arts, popularized in the 1920s and 1930s by Zora Neale Hurston, who grew up there and became the pre-eminent female writer of the Harlem Renaissance and the inspiration for Ms. Willis's "Embracing Eatonville." 
By the 1930s, Eatonville emerged as a model of black self-sufficiency, despite its continuing struggles with poverty, illiteracy and the hostility of the segregated world around it. Questioning the idea of integration - the enduring liberal answer to segregation - the town embraced a separatism that allowed its inhabitants to go about their lives and shape their self-images in an atmosphere less burdened by interracial tension. 
As Hurston herself observed about the empowerment she felt growing up in Eatonville, it was not until she was sent to school in Jacksonville, Fla., at the age of 13, that she would see herself as different and marginal: "I was now a little colored girl. I found it out in certain ways. In my heart as well as in the mirror, I became a fast brown," an anxious and tentative image of herself conditioned by the veil of apprehension and derision that enshrouded her in the outside world. 
The mood of the Eatonville photographs, like that of the exhibition in general, is largely one of quiet dignity - of a people unself-consciously celebrating their beauty and naming their style, to paraphrase Ms. Willis. Their subjects engage in updated versions of self-construction, following in the footsteps of ancestors who liberated "themselves from the legacy of caricatures that sought to define them throughout most of Western visual history." 
This theme resonates in Ms. Willis's photographs: a serene and elegant Madonna and child transgressing the racial limitations and blind spots of art history; a mural on the side of a Harlem church, its heavenly imagery depicting the passage from the earthly to the sacred in the form of parishioners, dressed in their Sunday best, walking into the building below; bodybuilders, their physique obsessively sculptured, engaging in public displays of authority and prowess; and a majestic elder, her cane braced in one hand like a scepter, being tended to in an Eatonville beauty parlor.
In the end, as Ms. Willis's scholarship has confirmed, the photograph has historically served as a powerful mirror in the African-American community, reflecting the achievements, triumphs and positive imagery all too often erased from the culture at large. Her compelling photographs bring this story up to date, ever mindful of the previous generations who emerged from the shadow of whiteness, in their own image, self-possessed and beautiful.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: The Next Big Battle

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: The sky has yet to fall, employment numbers are up, and here&#8217;s how to use Pinterest. So why aren&#8217;t you going to SXSW this year? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 The Budget: SkyNotFall 
The sequestration takes effect, and according to Keith Hennessy, the impact is: "skynotfall." Stephen Colbert offers a creative solution, and things are so bad that one ex-con is accused of sneaking back into jail. Some economists believe the sequestration doesn't cut spending at all, but $92 million is whacked from the Small Business Administration's budget, and Kelly Phillips Erb says some small businesses are already taking a hit. A small-business round table discusses the debt. These are four things to know about the next big budget battle, and do you also know who is one of the most influential people in the formation of the White House economics team?
 Small Business Statistics: The Bright Side 
The latest employment numbers bring "great news." Despite the Dow Jones industrial average's record close, small businesses are still struggling and although the recovery is lifting profits, many analysts conclude it's still not adding jobs. A survey shows steady job gains in February and Intuit's small-business employment index edged up. Moderate growth continued in the Philadelphia region. But small-business hiring was down in Pennsylvania and small-business closings increased in Missouri. Lending to small companies weakened in January, and Destiny Bennett explains the real reason small-business owners are not getting loans. A survey finds more baby boomer owners are selling their businesses. On the bright side: now is a great time to be in the tax business!
 The Economy: Surpassing Saudi Arabia
The United States was the world's largest petroleum producer in November, surpassing Saudi Arabia for the first time in 10 years - but an oil price analyst is doubtful about the potential of American oil production. Lance Roberts believes an asset bubble is indeed growing. Ezra Klein offers a few reasons to be optimistic. Economic activity in the nonmanufacturing sector increased for the 38th consecutive month, and activity in the manufacturing sector increased for the third consecutive month. Home prices nationwide increased on a year-over-year basis by 9.7 percent. Lumber prices approached an eight-year high. And these 100 facts about the economy will blow your mind.
 Management: Don't Quit the Day Job (Yet) 
Forbes publishes its annual list of billionaires. GoDaddy's founder warns against quitting your day job too soon. Mikey Rox lists 25 ways to raise your creativity, including: skim through a magazine. In this video, a blogger says Groupon and its former chief executive, Andrew Mason, should be ashamed. Marc Andreessen and B. Horowitz take a crack at annotating Mr. Mason's goodbye memo. Jeff Cornwall tells a story of how he knew it was time to fire a customer. Patricia Lotich lists her top 10 small-business resources. These are five potentially disastrous financial mistakes every entrepreneur should know about. An online grocery store uses its customer-purchase histories to predict when items will run out. A receivables management firm offers an "A to Z of receivables management."
 Your People: The Cool Kids 
Yahoo reins in telecommuters, and Best Buy copies it. A study reveals that more than 600,000 commuters travel more than 90 minutes to work every day. A new national survey finds more than a third of American workers experience chronic work stress, with low salaries, lack of opportunity for advancement and heavy workloads topping the list of contributing factors. Kirsten Chiala takes a look at how companies and employees are benefiting from "telework." Richard Juman suggests three ways to inspire a healthy corporate culture. Chucky terrorizes drive-thru employees. A company offers an alternative to the student loan by connecting prospective employees with potential backers who are willing to invest in their career goals. Data crunchers are now the cool kids on campus and these are the top 50 apps employees sneak into work. This is one of the craziest buzzer beaters you'll ever see.
 Start-Up: Blowing It 
After selling her start-up for $70 million at age 25, the founder blows through her fortune and heads to prison. These are the steps to follow to set up a home-based small business, and these are the funniest home Wi-Fi names. A new contest challenges you to explain what your start-up does and why anyone should care in six seconds. A crowdfunding site is started to drive the "new American dream." But a start-up guru doubts that crowdfunding will happen.
 Around the Country: A Start-Up Video Store? 
These are the 10 American companies with the best reputations. And here are 13 stores you will never shop at again (but this passionate owner of a video-rental store in Pennsylvania doesn't care). A "Grey's Anatomy" star tries to turn around a failing coffee business in Seattle. Texas leads the country in business relocations and expansions. The 2013 Startup Law Summit is scheduled this week in Chicago (a city that needs a "start-up growth anchor" according to Microsoft's C.E.O.). San Francisco's Bay Bridge lights up. Social entrepreneurship programs at Yale and Stanford Universities are scheduled for high school students this summer. Here are four underrated tech hubs to watch, and here are the 10 cities with the highest tax rates.
 Around the World: Singapore Is No. 1 
Singapore ranks as the top Tier 1 economy since 1980. German car sales plunge as Europe's auto crisis deepens, and some believe the fourth euro crisis cycle of panic has officially begun. But private business activity in the euro zone in February was not as bad as feared. Some believe that Spain still has a long way to fall. Since 2008, Somali pirates operating in the Gulf of Aden have cost the shipping industry $900 million to $3.3 billion per year. A plague of locusts descends upon Egypt. Swiss voters approve limits on executive pay. This is why Auntie Anne's Pretzels failed in China. Tim Fernholz claims that America is terrible at globalization. iYogi makes a big small-business bet in India.
 Social Media: Pronto! 
Facebook redesigns its news feed. Twitter kills TweetDeck. Mark Veverka warns that if your company or business does not have a social media strategy, it better get one pronto! A coming webinar features a social media expert who will explain how to use Facebook and LinkedIn for lead generation. Nick Bilton writes that it "seems as if Facebook is not only promoting my links on news feeds when I pay for them, but also possibly suppressing the ones I do not pay for." Hospitals with the most Facebook likes have lower death rates. Jeff Bullas explains how to use Pinterest's group boards to get more exposure for your business. These are the basics of social media marketing for business-to-business companies. Here are nine amusing travel hacks, and the Raiders' Desmond Bryant is the target of a hilarious meme. An awkward British guy invites Mila Kunis out drinking.
 SXSW: Ten Austin Start-Ups 
Here are the 10 Austin start-ups you need to meet at South By Southwest this week. Pizza Hut plans to hold 140-second job interviews there. You can get a free ride in the SXSW TechCab by confessing your sins. An Austin entrepreneur shares his SXSW tips. Andrea Swensson explains why she's not going this year.
 Marketing: Too Watery? 
Kelley Robertson says this is how not to use a referral. Derrick Daye shares seven ways to generate ideas from customers. Allison Carter warns you not to start content marketing if you are not willing to wait at least six months before seeing results. Online survey tools may be the most effective way to engage existing customers. Chris Robinson explains how business owners can increase site traffic through video. Here's the only way to market with SnapChat. Wal-Mart introduces a program supporting businesses owned by women worldwide. This is how Budweiser responded to accusations that its beer was too watery.
 Cool Ideas: Forgive Us 
A company offers digitized magazine subscriptions for waiting rooms. A new type of silicone exhibits both viscous and elastic properties. A flexible battery stretches 300 percent. This video explains how 3-D printing will change the world, but this infographic shows how long the 3-D printing revolution will take. Apple is said to be planning an iWatch and a fingerprint-sensing iPhone, and it now seems that the latest fashion is wearable computers. An entrepreneur auctions off his nameto the highest bidder.

 Tweet of the Week 
[#x200f]@alexia - "You going to SXSW(i)?" - Everyone even vaguely related to tech, right now.
 The Week's Best 
 Bob Phibbs wants to know if you are too weak to become stronger: "It isn't so much what you decide to reach out for, but it is that moment of decision. Going from the weakness of I'm overwhelmed, I don't need anyone else, it won't work, etc. to one of strength - this will allow me to work smarter, focus my attention, make my business competitive. That's why I pay for my Web designers to carry out my vision. That's why I paid for a one-day coaching with one of the smartest marketers around. That's why I do a lot of things. And I know a lot of you do too."

HEADLINE: Chavismo and Human Development in Venezuela

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Hugo Chavez may not have been much liked in the United States, but the public spending he invested in improving Venezuelan lives may stand the test of time, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States."
President Hugo Chávez is dead, but the debate over "Chavismo" lives on. His economic policies were aimed at improving the living standards of the poorest citizens of Venezuela, and those are the terms on which his ultimate success is likely to be judged.
Measured in terms of tangible improvements in human development, his achievements are significant. The bigger question is whether they can be politically and economically sustained. 
A loud critic of United States policies and leader of a broader Latin American renunciation of neoliberal policies, Mr. Chávez has never been popular in the United States. 
Strong aversion to both his political values and his personal style has often led to dismissive assessments of Venezuela's economic record since he became president in 1999. But as Mark Weisbrot and Jake Johnston of the Center for Economic and Policy Research have carefully documented, the Venezuelan economy experienced significant growth after 2003, when the Chávez government successfully gained control over the national petroleum industry, and fared surprisingly well even after oil prices collapsed in 2008.

Oil revenues were used to finance large public investments in health, education, housing, pensions and food subsidies to the poor. World Bank indicators show a sharp decline in poverty from slightly more than 60 percent in 2003 to slightly more than 30 percent in 2011. 
Many projects or "misiones" that Mr. Chávez put into place proved so popular that even Henrique Capriles, his opponent in the last election, promised voters he would maintain and augment them. 
While some critics of Mr. Chávez suggest that his policies have not had much impact on other Latin American countries, others contend that they are not that different from those carried out by other social democratic governments in the region, like Brazil's. The influential Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, past president of Brazil, has lauded Mr. Chávez's contribution to regional initiatives. 
The impact that Mr. Chávez had on other left-leaning governments in the region, especially in Bolivia and Ecuador, certainly represents part of his political legacy. 
Economists have not yet developed very good tools for assessing the impact of specific development policies, partly because these are intrinsically difficult to measure. The United Nations collects data on a number of different indexes, including the Human Development Index, which combines information on income, life expectancy and actual and expected years of education. 
This index shows Venezuela closely aligned with a regional average that has increased steadily since 1980. But this index is not very sensitive to short-run policy changes; both life expectancy and actual years of schooling are variables that change only gradually as the population ages. 
A better indicator of short-run improvements in health is the infant mortality rate. Data collected by the Central Intelligence Agency and aggregated on Index Mundi show significant declines in Venezuela between 2003 and 2012 - but even faster declines in Brazil, Mexico and Peru. 
The same database helps explain why Venezuela's exchange of subsidized oil for Cuban health care may deliver important future benefits. Infant mortality in Cuba, slightly higher than that in the United States in 2003, has now fallen below the United States average. 
Mr. Chávez's track record in increasing school enrollments does stand out among comparable countries. A detailed World Bank database shows that between 2003 and 2011 Venezuela narrowed the gap in gross school enrollments (number of students enrolled compared with those eligible for enrollment) between it and Brazil, Mexico and Peru (the percentage of primary school enrollments held even). 
Even more striking are the effects of one particular hallmark of Chavismo: the expansion of free public higher education. Tertiary enrollments increased to about 80 percent in 2009 (the latest year for which data are available) from 40 percent in 2003, far higher levels than those of Brazil, Mexico or Peru. 
We will never know what path Venezuela would have followed if Mr. Chávez had not repeatedly been elected president there. But we should recognize that much of the public spending he financed with oil revenues represents investment in the human capabilities of Venezuelans themselves. 
They are the ones who will determine the ultimate meaning of Chavismo.

HEADLINE: Those Who Love South Africa Ask If It's Existentially Violent

BYLINE: SCOTT JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: After the death of a Mozambican immigrant at the hands of police, Gra&#231;a Machel, Nelson Mandela&#8217;s wife, says the country is &#8220;bleeding.&#8221; Despite falling crime rates, it may be. 

 BODY:
Faced with a recent spate of high-profile incidents of violence, Nelson Mandela's wife, Graça Machel last week broke the usual silence of the former first couple and said that South Africa was "an angry nation."
Speaking at a memorial service for a Mozambican taxi driver who died after police dragged him through the streets tied to the back of a van, Ms. Machel warned that her adopted country was "on the precipice of something very dangerous with the potential of not being able to stop the fall." 
The ruling African National Congress immediately tried to downplay Ms. Machel's warning. An ANC spokesman, Keith Khoza, said "it doesn't help to point fingers." President Jacob Zuma, perhaps attempting to sooth tempers, said that South Africa was not "an inherently violent place to live in."
There is a kind of endless reckoning about the fate of South Africa. Many white South Africans have always believed South Africa was just that - inherently violent. Indeed, some of them participated in that violence in the most degrading and ordinary ways during the long years of apartheid - and when apartheid ended, many of them left, often to places like Australia or comfortable suburbs in America. 
But many stayed behind too, or even returned, believing - sometimes forcing themselves to believe, over and over again - that the core of their country was peaceful. After all, they point out, had it not been, it would have descended into civil war immediately after the fall of apartheid, or even more recently. Crime levels would have continued to climb. South Africans would have retreated further and further into their ethnic and racial enclaves. 
But those things have not happened, for the most part. On the criminal side, the statistics paint an optimistic picture compared to years past. Crime levels have been dropping fairly steadily since the early 2000s, and more dramatically still since peak levels around 1995. Murders have declined by roughly 25 percent since 2002. Socially, though South Africa is still a divided country, it is less divided than it once was, I believe, by vast margins. Most South Africans I know have not retreated further into their ethnic enclaves but have instead gone out into the world (both at home and abroad) seeking contact with others. 
Yet, many worried observers continue to ask if South Africa is more dangerous than ever. Perhaps, more importantly, is the danger now of an existential variety, as opposed to mere criminal opportunism? The comments at the end of this recent Huffington Post article about the track star Oscar Pistorius shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, written by a public relations consultant are indicative of the kind of hand-wringing taking place.
It didn't help when police shot and killed striking miners in August in what amounted to a massacre. Several of the miners were shot in the back trying to flee. Then there was the recent gang rape and murder of 17-year-old Anene Booysen, the revelations about a death squad operating in Durban and the case of a 29-year-old man accused of raping a 2-year old infant. 
Sadly, there is a palpable sense among many people that the country is on a dangerous trajectory toward a violent confrontation - with the past, with itself, and with its own varied and complex sense of identity and values. It's a topic that's close to my heart. I lived there for several years. Many of my closest friends still do. I married a South African. My children will one day share a connection with that country that I hope will be unbreakable.
But friends I know who once thought they would never leave have started to question the wisdom of that choice. In a recent letter, a friend wrote:
SA is not in too great shape right now. Many if not most of the ministers in Cabinet also regularly seem mired in scandal, with corruption and misappropriation of public funds reaching epidemic proportions. We should and could be doing a lot better than we are.
And later, "Maybe this is part of the growing pains of a country that is still angry, coping with a huge legacy, increasingly frustrated, and struggling to deal with its challenges. I'm not trying to be complacent myself, and while I agree that there is an alarming sense of 'drift,' some things just don't match the doom and gloom I read. It seems as if we are shutting politics out of our minds and just going on with our lives."
Part of the chasm that has emerged in understanding South Africa is that experiences can vary so widely, and so intensely. Some people who have lived there for years have never had any problems. Others come for short visits, only to be attacked, robbed or raped.
An American friend who has lived in South Africa for 15 years recently wrote, "I have only ever known a few people that have been stabbed or shot, and those all took place in [America]."
Despite that somewhat reassuring fact, he has changed his plans to buy a house in South Africa until - or if - the political and economic situation improves.
But he's a foreigner. The problem for South Africans is that they have to find a way to move ahead with each other. That is what Graça Machel and others are worried about.
"The level of anger and aggression is rising," she said, "This is an expression of deeper trouble from the past that has not been addressed. We have to be more cautious about how we deal with a society that is bleeding and breathing pain."
"Bleeding and breathing pain" - such a poignantly sad and tragically accurate description of a country on the brink of something. Exactly what that something turns out to be is in the hands of each and every South African who feels that pain.

HIGHLIGHT: Making the points again and again and again. 

 BODY:
Jeff Frankel participates in a discussion of Chinese currency policy - and finds many of the participants subscribing to the doctrine of immaculate transfer. As he says, I thought I had definitively disposed of that doctrine 25 years ago. But it keeps coming back. 
That's the sad thing about economic discourse, and the reason I keep talking about zombies: the same demonstrably wrong ideas just keep coming back, and back, and back, from the Treasury view on demand to the trust fund bait and switch. And those are just the logical fallacies; there are also historical fallacies (unprecedented growth under Reagan!) and empirical fallacies (huge growth from cuts in top rates!). 
On top of that, basic information takes amazingly long to make its way into public discussion. Some of us have spent years trying to drive home the point that many Americans haven't shared in rising life expectancy, making policy recommendations like a rise in the Medicare age a really bad idea; so while I'm glad to see the WaPo running a story saying "Hey, it turns out that lower-income Americans haven't seen much rise in life expectancy!", it's frustrating to see this presented as new and surprising information.
What all this means is that if you're going to try to play a constructive role in public economic discourse, you have to be willing to say the same thing over and over again. Also, if you're going to try to play a constructive role in public economic discourse, you have to be willing to say the same thing over and over again. And if you're going to try ...
This can be frustrating, and can annoy readers who want every piece to be brand new and counter-intuitive. But someone has to keep rolling the stone up the hill.

HEADLINE: Nominee for S.E.C. Chief Pledges to Keep Focus on Enforcement

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: In prepared testimony for her nomination hearing, Mary Jo White placed a premium on unearthing financial fraud, as she works to deflect concerns from lawmakers who question her ability to regulate banks she recently defended. 

 BODY:
Mary Jo White plans to strike a hard line against Wall Street wrongdoing at a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, as she deflects concerns over her ability to regulate the same banks she recently defended.
In written testimony released on Monday by the Senate Banking Committee, which must approve her nomination as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ms. White outlined her experience pursuing white-collar crime as a federal prosecutor in New York. As head of the S.E.C., Ms. White wrote, she would continue her campaign to root out financial fraud.
"If confirmed, it will be a high priority throughout my tenure to further strengthen the enforcement function of the S.E.C. - it must be fair, but it also must be bold and unrelenting," Ms. White, who has defended JPMorgan Chase, UBS and other Wall Street giants, said in the written testimony. "Strong enforcement is necessary for investor confidence and is essential to the integrity of our financial markets." 
The hearing on Tuesday will present the latest opportunity for Ms. White to woo her critics. Over several weeks, Ms. White held meetings with lawmakers and answered a questionnaire detailing her qualifications.
Now, in her written testimony, Ms. White provided the first window into her priorities as an S.E.C. chief. She placed a premium on unearthing financial fraud, while also spelling out an agenda that included keeping a closer eye on high-speed trading firms and putting the finishing touches on new rules for Wall Street.
"The S.E.C. needs to get the rules right, but it also needs to get them done," she said in the prepared testimony.
Although Ms. White is expected to receive Senate approval later this month, she will face broader questions at the hearing about her turns through the revolving door between government service and private practice. For three decades, she bounced between the federal government and a lucrative legal practice at Debevoise & Plimpton, where she defended JPMorgan Chase in financial crisis cases, Morgan Stanley's board in vetting a chief executive and Michael Geoghegan, the former head of HSBC.
To avert potential conflicts, Ms. White agreed to recuse herself for one year from most matters involving former clients and issues that touched the legal practice of her husband, John W. White, a corporate lawyer. Ms. White also vowed "as far as can be foreseen" never to return to Debevoise and planned to soon cut financial ties with the firm.
But some lawmakers still question her movements through the revolving door. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, has questioned whether Ms. White's pledge to avoid former clients would undercut her ability to run the agency. Others are scrutinizing her lack of regulatory experience.
Despite the concerns, Ms. White's nomination is expected to sail through the committee before receiving full Senate approval. The committee's chairman, Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, already hailed her nomination.
"She has a superb résumé and Chairman Johnson was impressed with her in-depth knowledge of the issues and her commitment to taking a balanced approach at the S.E.C.," his spokesman said in a statement.
Ms. White's supporters also trumpet her long tenure in law enforcement. During stints as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn and later as the first woman to be United States attorney in Manhattan, she helped oversee the prosecution of the crime figure John Gotti and directed the case against those responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The cases won her praise from several Democrats, including Senator Charles Schumer, who called her "tough as nails."
At the hearing on Tuesday, Ms. White will testify alongside Richard Cordray, who is positioned to become director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In January, when the White House nominated Ms. White to the S.E.C. spot, it reappointed Mr. Cordray to a position he has held for the last year under a temporary recess appointment. The Senate last year declined to confirm him in the face of Republican concerns about the new agency, a thorny topic likely to arise again on Tuesday.
But the focus at the hearing will remain on Ms. White.
"If confirmed," she said, "I will vigorously embrace and carry out the S.E.C.'s mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation."

HEADLINE: Even Without Intrade, Billions Will Be Bet on 2016 Race

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Yes, money will flow to other betting markets and bookmakers who offer odds on the election. But the billions I am referring to will be wagered somewhere else: Wall Street. 

 BODY:
The popular prediction market Intrade, which in November shut down its markets to United States residents after a complaint from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, announced on Sunday that it was closing down entirely.
I'm less interested in speculating upon the business or legal reasons for Intrade's shutdown than in pressing a simple point: billions will still be wagered on the outcome of the 2016 elections, with or without Intrade in place.
Some of this is because there are other betting markets and bookmakers who offer odds on the election. Several of these sites are already taking bets on the identity of the 2016 Republican presidential nominee, for instance, along with any number of other races. Most of these sites are not open to Americans. But they tended to perform more rationally than Intrade over the course of the 2012 campaign, with their prices more closely tracking polls, prediction models and news events. 
The billions I'm referring to, however, will be wagered somewhere else: Wall Street. Consider what happened to a series of stocks on Nov. 7 of last year, the day after Barack Obama won the election.
Four large banking stocks - Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley - declined by an average of 7 percent on Nov. 7 as investors speculated that another term for Mr. Obama would provide a less favorable regulatory environment than one under Mitt Romney. Collectively, these stocks lost about $24 billion in market value on Nov. 7.
Similarly, a series of coal and oil stocks were off by anywhere from 3 percent to 30 percent on Nov. 7, and lost a collective $18 billion in market value.
A few industries benefited from Mr. Obama's victory, however. The health care provider H.C.A., which should serve more hospital patients now that Mr. Obama's health care bill is likely to remain in place, saw its stock rise by 9 percent the day after the election, adding $1.3 billion in market value.
In industries like these, the amount of money changing hands in response to political events far dwarfs anything that took place on Intrade, where trading volumes were measured in millions rather than billions of dollars.
Betting on the election by means of buying or shorting common stocks can be a tricky endeavor, of course, since it requires investors to subject themselves to other risks associated with owning these stocks that might have little to do with the election outcome.
It might be possible to hedge some of these risks - for instance, if you thought that Mr. Romney was going to win the election, but weren't especially optimistic about the stock market over all, you could buy up oil and banking stocks while shorting the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. But these would entail some transaction costs and some portfolio risk.
For most traders, however, political outcomes are more of a nuisance. Stock market investors in industries like banking, health care, energy and telecommunications that are heavily subject to the federal regulatory environment essentially can't avoid betting on election and legislative outcomes, whether they want to or not.
Some of the value in having fully licensed and legal political betting markets that are open to American customers would be in allowing investors to hedge these risks more efficiently. In the meantime, there should be plenty of alternatives to Intrade in 2016.

HEADLINE: Republican State Senators Indicate New Openness to Raising Minimum Wage

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The New York Senate&#8217;s majority coalition, made up of Republicans and some independent Democrats, floated the idea, but other Democratic legislators were unimpressed, saying it was too vague. 

 BODY:
ALBANY - Republicans in the State Senate, who have resisted a push by Democrats to raise the state's minimum wage, said on Monday that they were open to including a wage increase in the state budget proposal that lawmakers are negotiating.
The Senate's majority coalition, made up of Republicans and an independent faction of Democrats, floated the idea of gradually increasing the wage to an unspecified amount from $7.25 per hour over the next three years. 
The Senate has been the chief roadblock for raising the minimum wage, which has been a top priority for Democrats for more than a year. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, included a measure in his budget proposal that would increase the wage to $8.75 per hour, and the Democratic-controlled State Assembly passed a bill last week that would raise the wage to $9 per hour and tie it to inflation. 
Republicans in the Senate, whose members make up the bulk of the coalition that controls the chamber, have resisted the proposals. They have argued that raising the minimum wage could hurt the state's economy and spur employers to cut low-paying jobs.
But on Monday, the majority coalition raised the idea of a gradual increase, though it did not provide specifics. The proposal was included as part of the Senate's budget resolution - essentially a blueprint that lays out the chamber's priorities heading into the final stage of negotiations over the state's new spending plan - that lawmakers adopted on Monday.
"What I said in our budget resolution is that I would consider it, along with other business tax credits and incentives," the leader of the Senate Republicans, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, told reporters after meeting with Mr. Cuomo and other legislative leaders. "I still think for a number of individuals, especially the young, that it could mean higher unemployment."
The other leader of the Senate majority coalition, Jeffrey D. Klein, an independent Democrat from the Bronx, was considerably more optimistic. He said the inclusion of the wage proposal in the Senate's budget resolution "absolutely" made him more confident that some version of a minimum-wage increase would be included in the budget that lawmakers adopt.
"We clearly have a lot of numbers, and I think it's incumbent upon us now to consider what that perfect number is for minimum wage workers around the state," Mr. Klein said.
Mr. Cuomo, speaking to reporters at a meeting with his cabinet, described the Senate's move as "a sign of progress."
"That means they are willing to discuss it in the budget," he said. "Now the problem is we all have different minimum wage numbers. So that's what has to be reconciled."
Other Democrats, however, were not enthusiastic about the Senate's proposal. A spokesman for the Senate Democrats, Mike Murphy, described the proposal as "not real," citing the lack of details in the budget resolution. He called on the Republicans to drop their objections and allow Democrats - who have a numerical majority in the Senate - to vote immediately on a minimum-wage increase.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, was also unimpressed by the Senate's proposal.
"The fact is, there's no substance to it," he said. "They don't tell you what it is. They don't tell you whether there's indexing or not. So we really have no clue as to what they did."
Lawmakers are required to approve a budget by April 1. This year, they are seeking to finish their work by March 21 in order to avoid conflicting with the observance of Passover and Easter.

HEADLINE: After Lehman, Callan Addresses Balancing Work and Life

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Erin Callan&#8217;s essay on managing the demands of a high-intensity career is the latest meditation on the subject by Wall Street women. 

 BODY:
Erin Callan, former chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers, has kept mostly to herself after leaving Wall Street during the financial crisis.
But she is back in public view, with an opinion essay in The New York Times on Sunday about managing the demands of a high-intensity job.
Writing from Sanibel, Fla., Ms. Callan says she has some regrets - not about the disastrous collapse of Lehman, per se, but about how she allowed her job to consume her life. Making reference to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and Marissa Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo - two powerful women who have recently incited debates over work-life balance - Ms. Callan draws lessons from her experience. 
"Whatever valuable advice I have about managing a career, I am only now learning how to manage a life," she writes.
"I didn't start out with the goal of devoting all of myself to my job. It crept in over time," she says. "Each year that went by, slight modifications became the new normal. First I spent a half-hour on Sunday organizing my e-mail, to-do list and calendar to make Monday morning easier. Then I was working a few hours on Sunday, then all day. My boundaries slipped away until work was all that was left."
"Until recently, I thought my singular focus on my career was the most powerful ingredient in my success. But I am beginning to realize that I sold myself short. I was talented, intelligent and energetic. It didn't have to be so extreme. Besides, there were diminishing returns to that kind of labor."
Ms. Callan, who had a stint at Credit Suisse after leaving Lehman in 2008, is adjusting to a new life with her husband, Anthony Montella. She recently put her home in East Hampton up for sale and is living for the time being in Florida.
Her essay, which was published just before the release on Monday of Ms. Sandberg's book, "Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead," appears intended to add to the conversation over women in the workplace. It adds to other meditations on the subject by Wall Street women.
Ruth M. Porat, the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley, was said to be a tireless worker, according to a 2010 profile by DealBook's Susanne Craig. Hamilton E. James, the president of the Blackstone Group, said at the time of Ms. Porat: "She never makes you feel like you are disturbing her personal life; I don't even know if she has one."
Balancing competing demands can be quite challenging. Alison Mass, co-head of the private equity banking group at Goldman Sachs, said in a 2010 commencement speech at New York University that she had to make some sacrifices.
"I've learned to accept that I cannot be an A+ at everything every day," she said, according to a transcript. "But I've also learned that I can be an A, on average, over the course of a week in my life."
Sallie L. Krawcheck, a former executive at Bank of America and Citigroup, told Forbes in 2008 about the importance of taking breaks from work.
"What's happened in this downturn, which I think is going to help me longer-term," she said at the time, "is that I've found that backing away - even if it's just for a 45-minute run in the morning or taking time off on the weekend - is crucial to getting through this."
From a personal standpoint, the collapse of Lehman might have actually helped Ms. Callan have important realizations about her life, she says.
"In 2007, I did start to have my doubts about the way I was living my life. Or not really living it. But I felt locked in to my career," she writes in the essay. "Without the crisis, I may never have been strong enough to step away."

HEADLINE: After Lehman, Callan Speaks Out on a Proper Work-Life Balance

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Erin Callan&#8217;s essay on managing the demands of a high-intensity career is the latest meditation on the subject by Wall Street women. 

 BODY:
Erin Callan, former chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers, has kept mostly to herself after leaving Wall Street during the financial crisis.
But she is back in public view, with an opinion essay in The New York Times on Sunday about managing the demands of a high-intensity job.
Writing from Sanibel, Fla., Ms. Callan says she has some regrets - not about the disastrous collapse of Lehman, per se, but about how she allowed her job to consume her life. Making reference to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and Marissa Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo - two powerful women who have recently incited debates over work-life balance - Ms. Callan draws lessons from her experience. 
"Whatever valuable advice I have about managing a career, I am only now learning how to manage a life," she writes.
"I didn't start out with the goal of devoting all of myself to my job. It crept in over time," she says. "Each year that went by, slight modifications became the new normal. First I spent a half-hour on Sunday organizing my e-mail, to-do list and calendar to make Monday morning easier. Then I was working a few hours on Sunday, then all day. My boundaries slipped away until work was all that was left."
"Until recently, I thought my singular focus on my career was the most powerful ingredient in my success. But I am beginning to realize that I sold myself short. I was talented, intelligent and energetic. It didn't have to be so extreme. Besides, there were diminishing returns to that kind of labor."
Ms. Callan, who had a stint at Credit Suisse after leaving Lehman in 2008, is adjusting to a new life with her husband, Anthony Montella. She recently put her home in East Hampton up for sale and is living for the time being in Florida.
Her essay, which was published just before the release on Monday of Ms. Sandberg's book, "Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead," appears intended to add to the conversation over women in the workplace. It adds to other meditations on the subject by Wall Street women.
Ruth M. Porat, the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley, was said to be a tireless worker, according to a 2010 profile by DealBook's Susanne Craig. Hamilton E. James, the president of the Blackstone Group, said at the time of Ms. Porat: "She never makes you feel like you are disturbing her personal life; I don't even know if she has one."
Balancing competing demands can be quite challenging. Alison Mass, co-head of the private equity banking group at Goldman Sachs, said in a 2010 commencement speech at New York University that she had to make some sacrifices.
"I've learned to accept that I cannot be an A+ at everything every day," she said, according to a transcript. "But I've also learned that I can be an A, on average, over the course of a week in my life."
Sallie L. Krawcheck, a former executive at Bank of America and Citigroup, told Forbes in 2008 about the importance of taking breaks from work.
"What's happened in this downturn, which I think is going to help me longer-term," she said at the time, "is that I've found that backing away - even if it's just for a 45-minute run in the morning or taking time off on the weekend - is crucial to getting through this."
From a personal standpoint, the collapse of Lehman might have actually helped Ms. Callan have important realizations about her life, she says.
"In 2007, I did start to have my doubts about the way I was living my life. Or not really living it. But I felt locked in to my career," she writes in the essay. "Without the crisis, I may never have been strong enough to step away."

HEADLINE: Oppenheimer Settles S.E.C.'s Accusations It Misled Investors

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The S.E.C. said that Oppenheimer had inflated the value of the largest investment in its fund. The false valuation raised the fund&#8217;s internal rate of return. 

 BODY:
Oppenheimer & Company will pay nearly $3 million to settle accusations by federal and state regulators that it misled investors about the performance of one of its private equity funds, in a case that signals stepped-up scrutiny of the buyout industry and how it values its holdings.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said that Oppenheimer had inflated the value of the largest investment in its fund. The false valuation raised the fund's internal rate of return - the preferred performance metric for private equity vehicles - to about 38 percent from 3.8 percent, the S.E.C. said. 
"Honest disclosure about how investments are valued and how performance is measured is vital to private equity investors," said George S. Canellos, the S.E.C.'s acting director of enforcement. "This action against Oppenheimer for misleadingly writing up the value of illiquid investments is clear warning that the S.E.C. will not tolerate lax disclosure practices in the marketing of private equity funds."
In recent years, the regulator has grown concerned over how private equity firms value their holdings, many of which are illiquid and hard to measure. Unlike mutual funds that own publicly traded stocks, private equity firms own private companies whose values can be difficult to determine.
Regulators have said that they are worried that certain firms might be embellishing returns to impress prospective investors. S.E.C. officials have said that in the difficult fund-raising environment, there is a possible incentive for firms to exaggerate the value of their portfolios.
As part of its settlement, Oppenheimer agreed to pay the S.E.C. a fine of about $620,000 and return about $2.3 million to investors. It neither admitted nor denied the accusations. The firm also resolved a parallel action brought by the Massachusetts attorney general's office, agreeing to pay an additional penalty of about $132,000.
An Oppenheimer spokesman said that the firm thought it had put in place additional policies and procedures related to the valuation of its funds and was pleased to put this matter behind it.
The Oppenheimer fund at the center of the case was a so-called fund of funds - a private equity fund that invested in other private equity vehicles. Called Oppenheimer Global Resource Private Equity Fund, it focused on investments in the energy sector. It was a relatively small fund, managing about $100 million, according to securities filings.
In 2009, just after the financial crisis hit, executives managing the Oppenheimer fund started to fudge its performance when trying to raise money from prospective investors, the S.E.C. said.
The Oppenheimer managers propped up the value of its largest position, a stake in a fund called Cartesian Investors, according to the regulators. Cartesian, it turned out, had only one holding, S. C. Fondul Proprietatea, a company that the Romanian government had set up to compensate its citizens for property seized by the Communist government.
Oppenheimer deceived the fund's investors, which included public pension funds and school endowments, by telling them that outside auditors had vetted the returns. It also said that Cartesian itself had used a third-party valuation firm to determine its value. Neither was true, according to the S.E.C.
As the holdings of private equity firms have grown larger and more complex, a lucrative cottage industry has developed around providing independent valuations of hard-to-value investments. Last December, the Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms, led a group that agreed to buy Duff & Phelps, a firm that has a specialty in this area, for about $665 million.

HEADLINE: Responding to Financial Crisis, Britain Overhauls Its Regulators

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Britain, unlike other economic powers, is responding to the financial crisis by creating two new agencies, one to oversee institutions and another to watch for market abuses. 

 BODY:
LONDON - After the financial crisis, countries like the United States adopted wide-ranging changes to their banking regulation.
Yet Britain was the only major economic power to go a step further by completely overhauling its regulators.
Taking the place of the current watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, will be two new bodies created to oversee the country's banks, hedge funds and other financial institutions. The Prudential Regulation Authority will monitor Britain's largest banks, while the Financial Conduct Authority will be responsible for consumer protection and market abuse. They will take over in April.
"Britain has gone for a complete overhaul," said James Smethurst, a regulatory partner at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in London. "It's a big task to ensure everything will work the way it should."
By splitting the duties of the Financial Services Authority, policy makers hope to separate the daily monitoring of banks' financial health from the policing of illegal activity like insider trading. The goal is to allow the separated regulators to focus on their own areas, instead of trying to cover everything from banks' capital buffers to market abuse. 
It is the second time since the late 1990s that Britain has done a major regulatory revamping. In response to the growing complexity in the financial industry, the Financial Services Authority was created starting in 1997 by progressively combining nine smaller agencies. The authority also assumed control of banking regulation from the Bank of England.
Yet as the financial crisis left Britain's banks on a knife-edge, politicians began to doubt whether the sole regulator could keep on top of the wide-ranging problems facing the country's financial institutions.
"When a system of regulation fails so spectacularly, people are going to ask what replaces it," George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a 2010 speech announcing the most recent major overhaul.
The task awaiting the new regulatory bodies will not be easy.
A series of recent scandals has tarnished London's reputation as a global financial center. The wrongdoing raised questions about why regulators had failed to spot a glut of risky lending by British banks, money laundering for drug cartels and other illicit activity that has cost consumers around the world billions of dollars.
Further scandals, including a $2.3 billion loss from illegal activity in London by a former UBS trader, Kweku M. Adoboli, and a $6 billion trading loss at a London-based unit of JPMorgan Chase, have heaped further pressure on British regulators.
"When we look back, last year will be seen as the low point," said Martin Wheatley, who will take control of the Financial Conduct Authority after six years with the Securities and Futures Commission, the regulator in Hong Kong. "The time is right; we can rebuild from here."
This is the toughest job of Mr. Wheatley's career. After earning a philosophy and English degree from the University of York, Mr. Wheatley, 54, worked for the London Stock Exchange for almost two decades before becoming a regulator. Over 6 feet tall, he comes off as relaxed and laid-back - traits that will inevitably be tested by future financial crises.
His counterpart at the Prudential Regulation Authority will be Andrew Bailey, a Cambridge-educated economist, whose sometimes rambling comments would not be out of place at a university lecture hall.
Mr. Bailey, 53, who has spent more than 25 years working at the Bank of England, will oversee 1,300 regulators based in a building in London's historic financial district, just around the corner from the British central bank. "We are holding institutions to higher standards than before the crisis," he said.
In an odd twist, the regulators will work from the desks formerly used by one of the banks they regulate - JPMorgan Chase. The authority leased the building when JPMorgan moved its staff to Canary Wharf last year and bought much of the furniture in the building.
Canary Wharf, London's newer financial hub, will also be home to the Financial Conduct Authority and its staff of 2,600.
Not everyone believes the two new bodies will have an impact.
While the regulatory structure has changed, the enforcement powers remain essentially unchanged. London's financial community is awash with skeptics who question how dividing regulatory powers into two new bodies will safeguard against future abuses.
"Regulators never had a lack of powers - they had an unwillingness to use them," said Bob Penn, a regulatory partner at the law firm Allen & Overy in London. "Regulators failed, not the regulatory structure."
Both Mr. Bailey and Mr. Wheatley admit the new regulatory structure may not have stopped the recent failures that have blackened London's reputation as a financial hub.
At the Prudential Regulation Authority, which will focus on banks' governance and capital reserves, regulators will be expected to take a more aggressive stance on how firms price risk. That will include questioning boards on risky trading activity that may leave banks underfinanced, as well as subjecting senior management to greater scrutiny over how they run their businesses.
The efforts to change banking culture follow widespread criticism of Barclays' senior executives after the bank announced it would pay a $450 million fine to settle claims by American and British authorities related to manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. In testimony to British politicians, Mr. Bailey accused the bank of having a "culture of gaming" the regulatory system.
"You can't regulate culture," Mr. Bailey said. "We expect standards that put more emphasis on the public interest."
For its part, the Financial Conduct Authority plans to place a priority on industrywide investigations over those that take aim at individual firms.
In late January, British regulators demanded that local lenders review the sale of certain interest-rate hedging products to small businesses after 90 percent of a sample of the instruments was found to have been sold improperly. The case, which already has forced banks to set aside more than $1 billion in potential payouts, resulted from a yearlong investigation that showed the misconduct was endemic across the country's banking industry.
British regulators and their United States and international counterparts also continue to investigate several global banks over the manipulation of important global benchmark rates like Libor. So far, the abuses have been limited mostly to low-ranking traders and managers, though authorities will hold senior executives accountable if they are implicated.
"In most cases, a direct line to the top management hasn't been there," Mr. Wheatley said. "If we see a clear guiding hand from boards, we would take a stronger line."
In the countdown to the regulatory changeover in early April, some analysts fear that the pending changes will lead to turf wars between the two new bodies.
Many of the country's largest institutions will be policed by both institutions, though the separate authorities have different priorities.
The focus of the Prudential Regulation Authority, for example, is on banks' financial well-being, while the Financial Conduct Authority will emphasize consumer protection. Sometimes, regulatory experts say, these different goals will lead to contradictory rulings with little clarity over who will act as referee between the two agencies.
For Britain to regain its reputation as a global financial center, a lot is riding on how Mr. Bailey and Mr. Wheatley will work with each other. Both men have put in all-nighters together dealing with scandals like the implosion of MF Global, and each will sit on the other institution's management board, though potential conflicts - particularly at times of financial crisis - are almost inevitable.
"We have to make it work," Mr. Bailey said. "The system won't succeed if we don't work together."

HEADLINE: Who Studies Abroad, Who Stays Put and Why

BYLINE: JOYCE LAU


HIGHLIGHT: More students are crossing borders than ever before. Have you studied overseas, or thought about it? What would stop you from going, and what would push you to make the leap? 

 BODY:
American students are twice as likely as their British counterparts to consider foreign study, according to a new report. 
While 56 percent of students in the United States said they'd like to head overseas, only 20 percent of young Britons said the same. The perceived barriers were largely the same: students from both nations felt they didn't have adequate information about options, and were also worried about finances, visas and homesickness. On the other hand, most did not see language barriers as a big deal. 
Their goals were slightly different, though. British students considered overseas studies for professional reasons, while Americans were seeking fun, travel and the chance to explore other cultures. 
The report by Education Intelligence, the British Council's research arm, worked with the National Union of Students in the United Kingdom and Zinch in the United States to poll 10,000 students. 
Of course, what people say they want to do in polls and what they actually end up doing are different matters. 
Many American students may say that they would like to go overseas. But according to the Institute of International Education, only 1 percent of U.S. students study abroad during any academic year. (About 14 percent of U.S. undergraduates have studied abroad at some time.) 
In comparison, the European Commission estimates that about 10 percent of European students are currently studying abroad. They do so largely thanks to financing from programs likeErasmus, but also because for most Europeans a handful of different countries are all within a few hours of home. 
While statistics vary on the details of who ends up where, the larger picture is clear: More students are crossing borders than ever before. According to Unesco, there are 3.4 million students on the move each year all over the world, and that number is expected to grow.
The mass migration has divided the world into "receiving nations" (mostly rich, Western, immigrant-heavy nations that import students) and "sending nations" (mostly developing nations that export students). Traditional receiving nations are seeing record-high inflows of foreign students: United States (more than 700,000), Britain (more than 430,000) and Canada (more than 100,000). Meanwhile, the major sending nations are still generally in Asia: China, India and South Korea top the list. 
But that line is blurring. China, the biggest sending nation, is also receiving more than 260,000 foreign students a year, according to the Ministry of Education. 
 Have you studied overseas, or thought about it? What would stop you from going - and what would push you to make the leap?

HEADLINE: Lowe's Campaign Keeps Eye on the Weather

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
LOWE'S is introducing a new round of advertising to promote home improvement projects in the spring, its prime revenue-generating period. The ads, which began appearing on Sunday, reflect an effort by Lowe's to take advantage of the rebounding housing market and catch up to Home Depot, the country's most profitable national home improvement company.
Spring, said Matthew Fassler, who follows Lowe's for Goldman Sachs, is ''Christmas for home improvement retailers.'' 
According to David Gober, a retail analyst for Morgan Stanley, 28 percent of Lowe's sales are generated in the second quarter of the calendar year, representing 36 percent of its total operating profit.
As part of its new advertising, an extension of the ''Never stop improving'' campaign introduced in 2011, Lowe's is for the first time advertising directly to men, in a spot that was first shown Sunday during a Nascar race on Fox, and that will be broadcast during the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament. On Tuesday, Lowe's will begin running ads created for specific regions and weather conditions.
The ads were created by the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, a division of the Omnicom Group, which has worked with Lowe's since 2006.
Mr. Gober said home improvement retailers ''took a pretty significant decline'' when the housing bubble burst about five years ago. ''Throughout the recession and in the early stages of recovery,'' home improvement spending per home was depressed ''well below long-term levels.''
Mr. Gober said there had been ''some recovery, particularly in the last six months of last year,'' in spending, as ''existing home sales and home prices seemed to have turned the corner.''
According to Mr. Fassler, sales of new and existing homes rose more than 10 percent in January, the seventh consecutive month of double-digit growth.
A report released last week by the Home Improvement Research Institute, a trade group, and IHS, an information company, predicted that home improvement spending in the United States would grow 4.3 percent this year, down from last year's increase of 5.4 percent.
However, the forecast said inflation in major building materials would affect the comparison between 2012 and 2013; it said spending growth in 2012, on a constant dollar basis, was 2.9 percent; and it predicted that spending growth would jump 3.4 percent this year.
Lowe's faces a formidable rival in Home Depot, whose same-store sales have outperformed Lowe's in almost every quarter in the last four years, including the fourth quarter of 2012. Home Depot has been doing better than Lowe's, Mr. Gober said, in part because of improved distribution, in-store merchandising and outreach to women by Home Depot. He also said Home Depot stores are in ''areas that have seen better jobs growth.''
The new Lowe's advertising includes a 60-second TV spot by the film and television director Peter Berg, which began running Monday. It depicts a family moving into a new neighborhood and embarking on home improvement projects that inspire others to do the same. It is being shown on network television and on cable channels like A&E, Bravo and History Channel.
A second 60-second TV spot -- which first ran Sunday and will run during the N.C.A.A. Tournament -- shows men gathered in a backyard, pretending to be competing in various sports, using home improvement tools like a tape measure and sledgehammer as sports equipment. A voice-over says, ''You'll probably never bat in the ninth inning of game seven, or have to make a shot with 20,000 fans screaming at you, or choreograph an original touchdown dance. But you do have a sport, and every weekend is your chance to take the field.''
Other 15-second TV spots -- depicting a woman gardening and a man seeding his lawn -- will run in different regions according to the advance of spring there.
The content of new digital advertising will be determined by the weather. One ad, for example, says Sunday's forecast is sunny, with a temperature of 68 degrees, and continues, ''It's a beautiful day outside. Now's the time to clean up your yard.'' Digital advertising is running on Web sites like CBSSports.com, Weather.com and eHow.
Thomas J. Lamb, chief marketing officer of Lowe's, said the new advertising -- which will run through June -- is aimed at homeowners, home improvement professionals and contractors. John Osborn, president and chief executive of BBDO New York, said the campaign is ''more targeted, more focused on where the customer lives and how the customer lives.''
Mr. Lamb declined to reveal Lowe's budget, although Mr. Osborn described the new advertising as ''more ambitious and more calibrated because the messaging is more integrated across more channels.''
According to Kantar Media, Lowe's spent $118 million in all media in the second quarter of 2011, while it spent $106 million in the same period last year. Total advertising expenditures by Lowe's in 2011 were $344 million, while they were $277 million in the first nine months of 2012.
Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School, praised the broad reach of the new advertising across TV, computer and mobile devices. ''The idea of going back and forth between the first and second screen is where advertising is going,'' she said.
Debra J. Mednick, executive director of home for NPD Group, a market research company, called the advertising ''smart and well-thought out,'' and said Lowe's ''did its homework. They understand their target audience and are capitalizing on the momentum in the economy, specifically the housing market.''

HEADLINE: Recording Williamsburg's Latest Transformation, and Raging Against It

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
''Gut Renovation'' is a documentary that tells a familiar tale. It chronicles buildings torn down, communities elbowed out, and new residents ushered in as a tidal wave of gentrification swept through Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
It has been nearly eight years since nearly 200 blocks in northern Brooklyn were rezoned to make way for residential development, and dozens of new buildings have sprouted up there since. So the deed is done: Williamsburg is transformed. But the movie, which had its New York theatrical premiere last week, illustrates how emotions that sprang from those changes can still be quite raw.
''You may think it's funny, but you're the people who are coming and ruining our neighborhood,'' the filmmaker, Su Friedrich, yells out a window toward the beginning of the movie, as a group of people in fancy slacks and overcoats pass by. ''And I'm recording it.''
''So, welcome to the neighborhood,'' Ms. Friedrich continues. ''You're ruining it!'' 
At that, the audience at the movie's opening night showing gave a good, hearty chuckle.
Ms. Friedrich, a filmmaker and Princeton University film professor, rented a large, bohemian-dream of a loft with her partner, Cathy Quinlan, for 20 years, from 1989 until 2009. Shortly after the area was rezoned in 2005, Ms. Friedrich began to record the changes, for what eventually became ''Gut Renovation.''
The film shows Ms. Friedrich's friends packing up their airy lofts and moving, displaced when rents rose and buildings sold. It tells of local shops and industries pushed out after decades in business. It chronicles the constant clatter of demolition and construction.
It also details an infestation of tiny dogs, at least one wearing a little green jacket, whose stout legs take over the sidewalk. It recounts vicious comments written on the real estate blog Curbed. (''I'm so sick of it already,'' one commenter wrote about artists who complained about gentrifiers. ''Smelly, unshaven, haven't bathed in days, 'artists.' Go to hell already.'') And the audience hears about a letter Ms. Friedrich received from a local real estate agent, inquiring about vacancies in their building. Ms. Friedrich scrawled a profanity on it, and then sent it back.
''It's not like I went out thinking, 'I'm going to make a film about being really angry,' but I just got more and more upset, but also more and more sad as I went along,'' Ms. Friedrich said on a recent stroll around her old neighborhood. ''And I am, I guess, kind of direct,'' she added.
''Look at that gray building,'' she said a few minutes later. ''I mean, could that be uglier?''
In 2009, Ms. Friedrich and her partner bought a two-family home in Bedford-Stuyvesant and waved goodbye to the old neighborhood.
At the opening night showing at Film Forum last week, where Ms. Friedrich was in attendance, a sold-out audience spent several minutes lined up outside in the wet snow. Once inside, they seemed to delight in her rage. They laughed at all the right moments; they gasped at particularly ugly buildings; one woman began a question to Ms. Friedrich afterward by saying that watching the movie was like ''watching my own life.''
Seeking another perspective on the movie, this reporter asked several companies that have been active in Williamsburg's development -- including Toll Brothers, whom the movie calls out by name -- if they would like to send a representative to watch the film. Their publicists stammered. Many sounded frightened. Requests were denied. Even a prominent local broker declined to participate, and real estate agents are hardly known for being shy and retiring.
Some of Williamsburg's newer residents were also reluctant to participate for fear that they would become a convenient dartboard.
''I feel like it's an incredibly divisive issue,'' said a resident of the Edge, a glassy tower on the Brooklyn waterfront, who did not want to be named. ''If you bought a new construction apartment, then you own a piece of what people don't want to be there. By definition, you are part of the problem.''
But the day after the premiere, at a Douglas Elliman real estate office in TriBeCa, an executive vice president named Sarah Burke agreed to watch the movie, in the relative safety of a company office. She sat very still, occasionally tapping a red fingernail on the blond wooden table in front of her, as ''Gut Renovation'' played on the flat-screen TV. With her previous employer, the Developers Group, Ms. Burke was involved in several projects in Williamsburg, including the Edge. She also lives in the area and has two small dogs.
''Can we fast-forward yet?'' she said a few minutes after the film began. ''Just kidding.''
Ms. Burke watched calmly, for the most part, leaning forward in her chair every few minutes to dispense counterarguments.
''She fails to mention that building was in a total state of disrepair,'' she said of a brick structure on Bayard Street that was torn down.
''At some point, people will sell a building; that's why you buy it,'' she added later in the film. ''It's not like shoes.''
And finally: ''Who wants to live next to a chicken processing plant?'' she said, as its old site and the building that replaced it flashed across the street. ''I mean, come on.''
But even viewers with less skin in the game raised objections to the film. Damian Begley, a film archivist, who saw the movie at Film Forum, said he was disappointed that the movie had no voices from the other side to discuss, perhaps, the economic advantages to the changes. Nick Occhiuto, a sociology graduate student at Columbia University who grew up in Williamsburg, shared that concern and added another.
''She's doing to the inhabitants of Bed-Stuy what she was lambasting the capitalists for doing to her,'' he said.
Ms. Friedrich does not agree. She said she and Ms. Quinlan bought their new home in a middle-class area from a man who had retired and wanted to leave New York.
''We felt we were buying a house from somebody who wanted to sell it,'' she said. ''If a black person who made the same amount and paid the same amount as me moved into the neighborhood, would they be considered gentrifiers? I don't know. Maybe they would.''
But Ms. Friedrich's decision to buy in Bedford-Stuyvesant did garner enthusiastic support from what is, perhaps, an unlikely ally: Ms. Burke.
''That was the best time in the world to buy,'' Ms. Burke said. ''And if she would like to sell it and make a profit, then she can call me.''

HEADLINE: The Axis of Ennui

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Because I have to generate two columns a week for you, Dear Reader, I spend some time hunting for new ideas on the conference circuit. When you are on that circuit, you are perpetually under the illusion that you are hearing from the exciting, fresh people who are about to change history.
You're hearing from, say, the brilliant technology entrepreneur Shai Agassi, who is starting a paradigm-shifting electric car company. You're hearing from some wizard with a new solar-panel technology, or some new social-networking entrepreneur. 
My main impression over the past five years is that the conference circuit capitalists who give fantastic presentations have turned out to be marginal to history while the people who are too boring and unfashionable to get invited to the conferences in the first place have actually changed the world under our noses.
Shai Agassi's company, Better Place, for example, has generated glowing magazine profiles, but it has managed to lose more than $500 million while selling astoundingly few cars. He stepped down as the chief executive, and his replacement lasted only a few months. It turns out that the things that are sexy to politicians and paradigm-shifting to conference audiences are not necessarily attractive to consumers.
Meanwhile, the anonymous drudges at American farming corporations are exporting $135 billion worth of products every year and transforming the American Midwest. The unfashionable executive at petrochemical companies have been uprooting plants from places like Chile, relocating them to places like Louisiana, transforming economic prospects in the Southeast. Most important of all, the boring old oil and gas engineers have transformed the global balance of power.
By 2020, the United States will overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. has already overtaken Russia as the world's leading gas producer. Fuel has become America's largest export item. Within five years, according to a study by Citigroup, North America could be energy independent. ''OPEC will find it challenging to survive another 60 years, let alone another decade,'' Edward Morse, Citigroup's researcher, told CNBC.
All of this was accomplished by people who exist largely beyond the reach of the lavalier-mike circuit.
Joel Kotkin identified America's epicenters of economic dynamism in a study for the Manhattan Institute. It is like a giant arc of unfashionableness. You start at the Dakotas where unemployment rates are at microscopic levels. You drop straight down through the energy belts of the Great Plains until you hit Texas. Occasionally, you turn to touch the spots where fertilizer output and other manufacturing plants are on the rebound, like the Third Coast areas in Louisiana, Mississippi and Northern Florida.
Vanity Fair still ranks the tech and media moguls and calls it The New Establishment, but, as Kotkin notes, the big winners in the current economy are the ''Material Boys'' -- the people who grow grain, drill for fuel and lay pipeline. The growing parts of the world, meanwhile, are often the commodity belts, resource-rich places with good rule of law like Canada, Norway and Australia.
Daniel Yergin, an energy guru, noted in Congressional testimony last month that the revolution in oil and gas extraction has led to 1.7 million new jobs in the United States alone, a number that could rise to three million by 2020. The shale revolution added $62 billion to federal revenues in 2012. At the same time, carbon-dioxide emissions are down 13 percent since 2007, as gas is used instead of coal to generate electricity.
Most of us have grown up in a world in which we assumed that energy was scarce, or even running out. We could now be entering a world of relatively cheap energy abundance.
Most of us have grown up in a world in which oil states in the Middle East could throw their weight around because of their grip on the economy's life source. But the power of petro-states is on the wane. Yergin argues that the oil sanctions against Iran may not have been sustainable if not for the new alternate sources of supply.
We've grown accustomed to despotic regimes in Russia and Venezuela that live off oil and gas wealth. But those regimes are facing hard times, too. Gazprom is already offering roughly 10 percent discounts on existing contracts. The Nigerians and Venezuelans may find it hard to compete. People in China and elsewhere are wondering if the fracking revolution means that the 21st century will be another North American century, just like the last one.
What are the names of the people who are leading this shift? Who is the Steve Jobs of shale? Magazine covers don't provide the answers. Whoever they are, they don't seem hungry for celebrity or good with the splashy project launch. They are strong economically, but they are culturally off the map.
This revolution will not be plenaried.

HEADLINE: House and Senate Work Simultaneously to Create Budgets, a Rarity

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congress this week will begin taking the first steps toward a more structured and orderly budget process, beginning what both parties hope is a move away from the vicious cycle of deadline-driven quick fixes.
In the Senate, Democrats were putting the finishing touches on a budget they plan to introduce on Wednesday, their first in four years, while House Republicans were preparing to introduce a spending plan of their own on Tuesday morning.
The two proposals, which would set spending targets for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, will be miles apart ideologically and difficult to merge. Democrats plan to rely heavily on closing tax loopholes that benefit corporations and the wealthy to produce new revenue, while Republicans will focus on slashing spending to balance the budget in 10 years. 
But the fact that both houses of Congress are working on their budgets simultaneously after years of impasse raised some measure of hope -- albeit slight -- that Democrats and Republicans might be able to work out some sort of compromise.
Compromise between the two parties, however, is only half of a more complicated bargain. Democrats also have to bridge the divide among a politically diverse group of Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee.
The committee chairwoman, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, said Monday that she expected all 12 members of her majority to vote in favor of the Democrats' budget, even if some members so far remain uncommitted.
''I have a really diverse committee,'' Mrs. Murray said, adding, ''They all recognize that we have some really common goals, and we have worked it out.''
That diversity is one of the major reasons Senate Democrats have not written a spending plan of their own since 2009, given the challenge of bringing together senators from Oregon to Virginia to Vermont who do not always agree on issues like whether cuts should fall more heavily on military or nonmilitary programs, and which tax loopholes to eliminate.
''Dealing with the difference of opinion is tough,'' said Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an independent who has tried to ensure that the Democrats' budget does not include an adjustment to the inflation rate that would calculate it in a way that would decrease federal benefits. Mr. Sanders said he was confident the inflation rate calculation would be untouched, but he was not prepared to sign on to Mrs. Murray's plan until he sees the final document.
''We've had long talks; we'll see what happens,'' he said.
The committee is closely divided between 12 Democratic votes and 10 Republican votes.
In another sign that both parties continue to look for ways to meet in the middle, President Obama is to visit Capitol Hill for four separate meetings this week with the Democratic and Republican conferences of both houses. The president and his aides have said that this rare display of bipartisan outreach, coming a week after Mr. Obama dined with a dozen Republican senators, is intended to help foster cooperation between the parties.
Against this backdrop, the Senate Appropriations Committee was preparing to lay out a separate stopgap spending plan to keep the government financed through September. The House passed its plan last week.
Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, who framed the Senate's action as a first step in a longer process, said, ''This week will offer another opportunity for the Senate to return to regular order, an opportunity for this body to legislate through cooperation, through compromise, as we used to do.''
''This legislation,'' Mr. Reid continued, ''will be a test of the Senate's good will. America's economy is poised to grow and expand. The last thing it needs is another manufactured crisis such as a government shutdown to derail its progress.''
The movement expected in Congress this week will draw attention to one of the more unusual aspects of business in Washington. When it comes to writing budget resolutions, the House and the Senate have worked on entirely separate paths. Senate Democrats, unable to always agree and not eager to take votes that could prove politically unpopular, have avoided drawing up large-scale a budget.
House Republicans, meanwhile, have made the budget the focus of their efforts. And they have seized on the issue as a way of portraying Democrats as inept and unfocused.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee snidely commented on Monday that Democrats had claimed ''for more than 1,400 days that the dog ate their homework.'' And Republican senators have churned out news releases noting what could have been accomplished since the Democrats last passed a budget, like 179 round-trip missions to the moon and 292 expeditions to the summit of Mount Everest.
But even if Democrats do pass a budget in the Senate, it will mean little unless it can be merged with the House Republican budget and pass both houses of Congress.
''I think because of all the attention on the failure to pass a budget in regular order, Democrats are at least obligated to,'' said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, who was until recently a member of the Budget Committee.
''But I don't think there's much optimism that we're going to reconcile a budget with this House quickly,'' he added.

HEADLINE: For Detroit, a Crisis Born of Bad Decisions and Crossed Fingers

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
DETROIT -- This city was already sinking under hundreds of millions of dollars in bills that it could not pay when a municipal auditor brought in a veteran financial consultant to dig through the books. A seasoned turnaround man and former actuary with Ford Motor Co., he was stunned by what he found: an additional $7.2 billion in retiree health costs that had never been reported, or even tallied up.
''The city must take some drastic steps,'' the consultant, John Boyle, warned the City Council in delivering his report at a public meeting in 2005. Among the options he suggested was filing for bankruptcy.
''I thought all hell would break loose -- I thought the flag would finally be raised,'' Mr. Boyle recalled in an interview last week. But his warning drew little notice. ''It was utterly astounding,'' he said. 
The financial crisis that has made Detroit one of the largest cities ever to face mandatory state oversight was decades in the making, a trail of missteps, of trimming too little, too late, of hoping that deep-rooted structural problems would turn out to be cyclical downturns that might melt away as the economy picked up.
Some factors were out of the city's control. As auto industry jobs moved elsewhere over the decades, for example, Detroit lost much of its affluent tax base. Lower than expected state revenue sharing did not help, nor did corruption allegations in the administration of Kwame M. Kilpatrick, a mayor who resigned in 2008 and was convicted on Monday of racketeering and other federal charges.
But recent findings from a state-appointed review team and interviews with past and present city officials also suggest a city that over the years was remarkably badly run.
The state review team found in recent months that the city's main courthouse had $280 million worth of uncollected fines and fees. No one could tell the team how many police officers were patrolling the streets, even though public safety accounted for a little more than half the budget. The city was borrowing from restricted funds and keeping unclaimed property that it was required to turn over to the state. In some city departments, records were ''basically stuff written on index cards,'' as one City Council member put it.
''This was bad decisions piled on top of each other,'' Gary Brown, the Detroit City Council president pro tem, said the other day. ''It has all been a strategy of hope. You keep borrowing where every piece of collateral is already leveraged. You have no bonding capacity -- you're at junk status. You're overestimating revenues and not managing the resources. Now the chickens have come home to roost.''
Once the nation's fourth-largest city, Detroit had grown up around the auto industry, booming right along with it in the 1950s. City workers gained ground with pay increases intended to keep pace with those the United Auto Workers won for its members, analysts said.
''It was easy to do so back in the 1950s,'' said Joseph L. Harris, Detroit's former auditor general. ''The city had 1.8 million residents then.''
But as auto jobs moved elsewhere and the region aged, Detroit's labor costs -- retiree health care costs, especially -- ballooned.
At the same time, officials papered over growing deficits with more borrowing. Finally Detroit's legal debt limit, which is linked to the total value of real estate in the city, fell when the mortgage bubble burst and property values plunged. Today the city says its debt limit is $1 billion, and it has effectively lost its ability to issue debt in the name of its taxpayers.
When a city cannot borrow, it cannot function; New York City showed that in 1975, Cleveland in 1978. But even as Detroit has approached the critical limit, some city leaders have seemed unaware, quarreling over smaller, symbolic issues like whether to lease a city-owned park to the state.
''It is peeling an onion,'' Mayor Dave Bing said of his growing understanding after he took office in 2009 of the depths of the city's financial woes. ''You dig and you dig and you dig, and you really start to find out how bad the problem was. ''
Mr. Bing knew plenty about the city's struggles before taking office and ran on a platform of reversing the spiraling finances. Still, within his first six months in office, the city came close to not making payroll.
''That's a scary moment,'' he recalled in an interview. ''You've got people living from paycheck to paycheck, week to week, and you're about to run out of cash. You can only imagine what kind of impact that that's going to have just on the life of the average person.''
The big structural imbalance was hard to see building up, because until 2008, when a new accounting rule took effect, cities like Detroit were not required to keep track of their workers' lifelong health care bills. That is why Mr. Boyle found a $7.2 billion promise that no one knew about. Detroit's general-obligation debt to its bondholders, by contrast, was a little less than $1 billion that year, safely within the city's legal debt limit, then $1.4 billion.
But while the numbers are particularly grim here, the basic story line is hardly unique. The same path, long and slow, can be found from Providence, R.I., to Stockton, Calif.
To preserve cash, the city resorted to increasing its workers' future pensions at contract time, instead of raising their pay. That helped balance the immediate budgets, but set up a time bomb sure to explode as more workers retired.
The cost of the retirees' pensions also grew because of an inflation-protection feature that compounds every year. Detroit cannot renege on paying the benefits, at least outside of bankruptcy, because the State Constitution makes it unlawful to reduce pensions after public workers earn them.
By the 2000s, Detroit was borrowing to solve budget shortfalls. Meanwhile, property tax revenues fell, not just because of departing residents, but also as values fell and some people quit paying. The city has reported collecting 84 percent of property tax levied, but a Detroit News analysis suggests a collection rate closer to half of property owners.
In recent years, city officials have made deep cuts in staff and operations, leaving residents complaining of darkened streetlights, slow police response times and bus delays. But while cutting workers can help reduce the current year's costs, it moves many of those people into the ranks of retirees, putting heavy long-term pressure on Detroit's two public pension funds.
By late 2011, a sense of crisis descended on Detroit. In November, Mayor Bing, a Democrat, addressed the city on live television, warning that Detroit would run out of money without concessions from unions, layoffs and privatization. A month later, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, called for a review of Detroit's finances, a first step in cases where the state is preparing to send an emergency financial manager.
City officials held off further intervention by committing to a legal agreement with the state in 2012 that laid out measures to save money. By fall, a board overseeing the agreement said progress was moving too slowly. While City Council members are contesting the matter during a hearing in Lansing on Tuesday, Mr. Snyder's administration is preparing to name an emergency manager within days. Mr. Bing says his administration has drawn up a plan to spare the city, though he acknowledges that it has yet to be fully put into effect.
Under Michigan law, the emergency manager would ultimately have the authority to remove local elected officials from most financial decision making, change labor contracts, close or privatize departments, and even recommend that Detroit enter bankruptcy proceedings, a possibility that experts say raises the prospect of the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history, at $14 billion worth of long-term obligations.
None of the decisions, experts here say, will be simple, and some wonder whether Detroit can be saved at all. Some 700,000 residents now live in this vast 139-square-mile city that once was home to nearly two million people. That number may fall to close to 600,000 by 2030 before the population begins to rise again, one regional planning group projects. By pushing costs into the future while its population is shrinking, Detroit has left the people least able to pay with the biggest share of its bills.
''Detroit is a microcosm of what's going on in America, except America can still print money and borrow,'' Mr. Boyle said.

HEADLINE: Oppenheimer Settles Accusations of Misleading Investors

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Oppenheimer & Company will pay nearly $3 million to settle accusations by federal and state regulators that it misled investors about the performance of one of its private equity funds, in a case that signals stepped-up scrutiny of the buyout industry and how it values its holdings.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said that Oppenheimer had inflated the value of the largest investment in its fund. The false valuation raised the fund's internal rate of return -- the preferred performance metric for private equity vehicles -- to about 38 percent from 3.8 percent, the S.E.C. said. 
''Honest disclosure about how investments are valued and how performance is measured is vital to private equity investors,'' said George S. Canellos, the S.E.C.'s acting director of enforcement. ''This action against Oppenheimer for misleadingly writing up the value of illiquid investments is clear warning that the S.E.C. will not tolerate lax disclosure practices in the marketing of private equity funds.''
In recent years, the regulator has grown concerned over how private equity firms value their holdings, many of which are illiquid and hard to measure. Unlike mutual funds that own publicly traded stocks, private equity firms own private companies whose values can be difficult to determine.
Regulators have said that they are worried that certain firms might be embellishing returns to impress prospective investors. S.E.C. officials have said that in the difficult fund-raising environment, there is a possible incentive for firms to exaggerate the value of their portfolios.
As part of its settlement, Oppenheimer agreed to pay the S.E.C. a fine of about $620,000 and return about $2.3 million to investors. It neither admitted nor denied the accusations. The firm also resolved a parallel action brought by the Massachusetts attorney general's office, agreeing to pay an additional penalty of about $132,000.
An Oppenheimer spokesman said that the firm thought it had put in place additional policies and procedures related to the valuation of its funds and was pleased to put this matter behind it.
The Oppenheimer fund at the center of the case was a so-called fund of funds -- a private equity fund that invested in other private equity vehicles. Called Oppenheimer Global Resource Private Equity Fund, it focused on investments in the energy sector. It was a relatively small fund, managing about $100 million, according to securities filings.
In 2009, just after the financial crisis hit, executives managing the Oppenheimer fund started to fudge its performance when trying to raise money from prospective investors, the S.E.C. said.
The Oppenheimer managers propped up the value of its largest position, a stake in a fund called Cartesian Investors, according to the regulators. Cartesian, it turned out, had only one holding, S. C. Fondul Proprietatea, a company that the Romanian government had set up to compensate its citizens for property seized by the Communist government.
Oppenheimer deceived the fund's investors, which included public pension funds and school endowments, by telling them that outside auditors had vetted the returns. It also said that Cartesian itself had used a third-party valuation firm to determine its value. Neither was true, according to the S.E.C.
As the holdings of private equity firms have grown larger and more complex, a lucrative cottage industry has developed around providing independent valuations of hard-to-value investments. Last December, the Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms, led a group that agreed to buy Duff & Phelps, a firm that has a specialty in this area, for about $665 million.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Search of Energy Miracles

BYLINE: By JUSTIN GILLIS. 
This week Justin Gillis, an environment reporter at The Times, begins a monthly column exploring the challenges posed by climate change.

 BODY:
At a legendary but secretive laboratory in California, Lockheed Martin is working on a plan that some employees hope might transform the world's energy system: a practicable type of nuclear fusion.
Some 900 miles to the north, Bill Gates and another Microsoft veteran, Nathan Myhrvold, have poured millions into a company developing a fission reactor that could run on today's nuclear waste.
And on the far side of the world, China has seized on discarded American research to pursue a safer reactor based on an abundant element called thorium.
Beyond the question of whether they will work, these ambitious schemes pose a larger issue: How much faith should we, as a society, put in the idea of a big technological fix to save the world from climate change? 
A lot of smart people are coming to see the energy problem as the defining challenge of the 21st century. We have to supply power and transportation to an eventual population of 10 billion people who deserve decent lives, and we have to do it while limiting the emissions that threaten our collective future.
Yet we have already poured so much carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere that huge, threatening changes to the world's climate appear to be inevitable. And instead of slowing down, emissions are speeding up as billions of once-destitute people claw their way out of poverty, powered by fossil fuels.
Many environmentalists believe that wind and solar power can be scaled to meet the rising demand, especially if coupled with aggressive efforts to cut waste. But a lot of energy analysts have crunched the numbers and concluded that today's renewables, important as they are, cannot get us even halfway there.
''We need energy miracles,'' Mr. Gates said in a speech three years ago introducing his approach, embodied in a company called TerraPower.
A variety of new technologies might help. Bright young folks in American universities are working on better ways to store electricity, which could solve many of the problems associated with renewable power. Work has even begun on futuristic technologies that might cheaply pull carbon dioxide out of the air.
But because of the pressing need for thousands of large generating stations that emit no carbon dioxide while providing electricity day and night, many technologists keep returning to potential improvements in nuclear power.
After all, despite its many problems, it is the one low-carbon energy source that we know can work on a very large scale. France gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear reactors.
Perhaps Mr. Gates can find a way forward. He is the world's second-richest man and surely the premier American technologist of the era, following the death of Steve Jobs.
His partner in TerraPower is Mr. Myhrvold, the former chief technology officer at Microsoft. Adept in geophysics, space physics, mathematics, economics, paleontology and gastronomy, Mr. Myhrvold is the man behind a $600 cookbook called ''Modernist Cuisine'' and a slew of other wildly inventive projects.
Their plan is to build something called a traveling wave reactor. In principle, it could operate safely for a half-century or more without refueling, and could run on material that has been discarded from today's reactors as hazardous waste, solving several problems at once.
They have persuaded an energy veteran, John Gilleland, to run the company; he employs about 60 people and is laying plans to build a prototype reactor.
''We sensed that nuclear had not been pushed in an innovative sense for some time,'' Mr. Gilleland said. ''No one had taken 21st-century technology and modeling capabilities and just sort of started over.''
Their method, like that of existing reactors, is based on fission, or splitting heavy atoms, then using the resulting heat to spin turbines and make electricity.
Lockheed Martin is pursuing a more difficult course: fusion. It involves fusing hydrogen variants into heavier elements, similar to the reaction that powers the sun.
The company will not say much about the program under way at its legendary Skunk Works facility in California, which developed the U-2 spy plane. But in a videotaped speech this year, a leader of the program, Charles Chase, suggested it was aiming for small, modular fusion reactors that could be built in factories.
Mr. Chase and his colleagues face long odds: 60 years of research on fusion has produced more disappointment than progress. ''There's really only one guarantee, and that's if we don't try, nothing is going to happen,'' Mr. Chase said in his talk.
Among the new nuclear approaches, fission reactors based on thorium are especially intriguing, offering potentially huge safety advantages. The basic concepts were proved in research by the American nuclear establishment in the 1960s, but the idea was ultimately abandoned by the Nixon administration in favor of a riskier approach called breeder reactors, which turned into an $8 billion black hole.
An engineer in Alabama, Kirk Sorensen, has helped excavate the old thorium work and founded his own tiny company, Flibe Energy, to push it forward. But it will surprise no one to hear that China is ahead of the United States on this, with hundreds of engineers working on thorium reactors.
''They're doing laps around the track, and we haven't even decided if we're going to lace up our shoes,'' Mr. Sorensen said.
Yet not even the speedy Chinese are likely to get a sizable reactor built before the 2020s, and that is true for the other nuclear projects as well. So even if these technologies prove to work, it would not be surprising to see the timeline for widespread deployment slip to the 2030s or the 2040s. And climate scientists tell us it would be folly to wait that long to start tackling the emissions problem.
Two approaches to the issue -- spending money on the technologies we have now, or investing in future breakthroughs -- are sometimes portrayed as conflicting. In reality, that is a false dichotomy. The smartest experts say we have to pursue both tracks at once, and much more aggressively than we have been doing.
An ambitious national climate policy, anchored by a stiff price on carbon dioxide emissions, would serve both goals at once. In the short run, it would hasten a trend of supplanting coal-burning power plants with natural gas plants, which emit less carbon dioxide. It would drive investment into current low-carbon technologies like wind and solar power that, while not efficient enough, are steadily improving.
And it would also raise the economic rewards for developing new technologies that could disrupt and displace the ones of today. These might be new-age nuclear reactors, vastly improved solar cells, or something entirely unforeseen.
In effect, our national policy now is to sit on our hands hoping for energy miracles, without doing much to call them forth. While we dawdle, maybe the Chinese will develop a nice business selling us thorium reactors based on our old designs. For communists, they do have an entrepreneurial bent.
But surely we would all feel better about the future if the full creative power of American capitalism were unleashed on the climate problem.

HEADLINE: Danger on Europe's Dinner Plate

BYLINE: By WAYNE PACELLE

 BODY:
THE discovery of horse meat in products labeled as beef in the European Union has raised serious questions, not just about food labeling, but also about food safety and the working of the somewhat opaque, global horse meat industry.
While the authorities in Brussels and various E.U. member states continue their investigations related to the scandal, there are questions unrelated to accurate labeling that must now be asked of industry and government regulators.
The European Union has strict rules on what meat products should be allowed into its home markets. In the case of horse meat imports, it's apparent that these products are held to a different standard -- a porous and permissive standard -- compared with other meat products destined for dinner plates and supermarket shelves. 
For example, the E.U. forbids imports of American chicken because the carcasses are bathed in chlorine. The authorities also ban pork imports because American producers treat the animals with ractopamine, a feed additive to promote leanness. And as a general matter, it is forbidden to use certain veterinary medicines on any animals used for human consumption.
Despite these important food safety policies and standards, every year tens (maybe hundreds) of thousands of animals are routinely given prohibited substances; racehorses, show horses and carriage horses regularly end up as meat intended for human consumption imported into the E.U.
Plants in Canada and Mexico slaughter horses from their own country, but the majority of the horses they kill come from the United States. Horse meat from these plants eventually makes its way to France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Contaminated horse meat imports from these North American countries can end up anywhere in Europe for further processing. In July 2012, residues of the drugs phenylbutazone (an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat pain and fever in animals) and clenbuterol (a drug that promotes leaner meat but that is banned in the United States and the E.U.) were found in a consignment of horse meat imported to Belgium from Canada.
European beef eaters are rightly appalled that they bought beef, but got horse meat instead. They should be even more concerned that some of that horse meat may also be contaminated and unfit for consumption.
There is no record-keeping mechanism for tracking the administration of drugs to racehorses. E.U. regulations stipulate that only meat from horses with a known medicinal treatment history (an equine passport) can be slaughtered for export to the E.U. But no North American horses have these passports. Yet last year approximately 160,000 American horses were transported to Canada and Mexico for slaughter, with the meat going primarily to the E.U. and Japan.
More testing and analysis would help, but it is insufficient. Animals coming off of U.S. racetracks and out of pastures are injected with prohibited substances on a routine basis, and that alone makes this type of meat unsuitable for import. These animals were never bred or raised for the table, but for other purposes, and they should be disqualified from the meat trade.
It is also widely acknowledged that there is a high level of fraud involved with the equine identification documents. Recent audits conducted by the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office in Canada and Mexico found that these countries are not in compliance with the E.U.'s food safety standards with regard to their medical records, even though non-E.U. parties have had two years to amend their residue control programs.
Experience has shown that those who tend to defraud the system designed to protect humans generally have even fewer qualms about the welfare of the animals they slaughter. The 160,000 U.S. horses slaughtered annually outside the United States are transported long distances in unsuitable vehicles. Conditions for horses elsewhere around the world are probably no better.
As the E.U. and the United States launch wide-ranging free-trade negotiations, now would be a good time to hit the reset button and make sure that E.U. food safety regulations are being honestly implemented. The global horse meat trade, by its very nature, cannot meet these standards. And now is a good time for the authorities in North America and Europe to eliminate trade in animals unsuitable for the dinner table.
Wayne Pacelle is president and chief executive of The Humane Society of the United States.

HEADLINE: On the Brink in Italy

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome.

 BODY:
GUIDONIA, Italy -- Emanuele Tedeschi wiped sawdust from his hands and gestured around the cavernous woodworking factory that has been in his family for two generations. The big machines, which used to run overtime carving custom furnishings for private homes, Roman palazzi and even the Vatican, sat idle on a shop floor nearly devoid of workers.
''A year and a half ago, the noise from production was so loud that you had to shout to be heard,'' said Mr. Tedeschi, walking amid pallets of cherry and other fine woods stacked up and waiting for a purpose.
Since a government austerity plan took hold last year, the Italian economy has tumbled into one of the worst recessions of any euro zone country. Mr. Tedeschi's orders have all but dried up. His company, Temeca, is still in business, but barely. 
Businesses of all sizes have been going belly up at the rate of 1,000 a day over the last year; especially hard hit among Italy's estimated six million companies are the small and midsize companies that represent the backbone of Italy's $2 trillion economy.
Economists worry that the pace of business closings may accelerate as long as the country lacks a functioning government. The departing prime minister, Mario Monti, was ousted by austerity-weary voters, but the election left Parliament gridlocked.
''With no one governing the country, there will be more paralysis, so things will get worse,'' said Mr. Tedeschi, 49, casting a worried glance at his wife and their 23-year-old son. They help fill the trickle of orders, now that Mr. Tedeschi has had to lay off six of the 11 full-time employees he had in mid-2011.
With the European Union standing as America's largest trading partner, the economic problems that plague Italy -- and the rest of stagnating Europe -- are felt across the Atlantic.
''This underscores the likelihood of Italy having a Japan-like decade with phenomenally slow growth,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor at Harvard and a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. ''And it raises painful questions about the long-run stability of growth in the euro zone over all.''
Italy's political quagmire might not disturb global financial markets right away, Mr. Rogoff said. But it raises the specter of the European crisis ''grinding on and on,'' he said, and it would certainly make it harder for European leaders to cut deals ''on the big-picture things that are needed to stabilize Europe.''
The afflictions of Italy's economy, one of Europe's largest, are not new, of course: a lumbering bureaucracy, stifling labor regulations and an eroding ability to compete in the global marketplace. As the economy of the 17 members of the European Union that use the euro as their currency was expanding at a weak average of 1 percent a year for much of the last decade, Italy grew at only half that rate, according to the International Monetary Fund.
But Italy's longstanding problems have grown worse in the last year as tax increases and spending cuts were pressed by Mr. Monti, who took over as prime minister in November 2011 after the euro crisis forced out Silvio Berlusconi. Last year the economy shrank 2.4 percent.
One in two small companies cannot pay its employees on time, according to CGIA di Mestre, a research institute. With layoffs surging, unemployment rose to 11.7 percent in January. Youth unemployment has jumped to 38.7 percent.
The austerity program was intended to reduce the risk of a debt crisis and ensure the backing of the European Central Bank, but instead it left the country with no growth. And without growth, Italy will have a harder time paying down its 2 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion) in debt, one of the largest debt burdens in the euro zone.
''For growth and unemployment to improve, we need to have a government that can remove uncertainty for businesses, consumers, investors and banks,'' said Tito Boeri, the director of the Fondazione Rodolfo Debenedetti, a research firm based in Milan. ''Political instability is probably one of the most damaging things for the economy.''
In some respects, Italy is not as hobbled as some other euro countries. The Italian government has managed to shrink the budget deficit. Industrial companies like Ferrari, Benetton and Ducati continue to help Italy maintain the euro zone's second-largest manufacturing base after Germany.
But it is businesses like Mr. Tedeschi's -- ones with fewer than 50 workers, which constitute the vast majority of Italy's economy and long provided much of its vitality -- that are buckling as banks halt lending and taxes rise. Credit issued by Italian banks fell in 2012 to the lowest level in more than a decade. And the government owes an estimated 70 billion euros in unpaid bills for goods and services to Italian companies.
Mr. Tedeschi started feeling the pinch in late 2011 at his factory in Guidonia, an industrial town north of Rome in Lazio, a sprawling region that is in many ways a microcosm of Italy itself.
Here, amid low-lying mountains and rolling green hills, are many midsize factories specializing in products stamped ''Made in Italy.'' But hundreds of those businesses have been shut lately.
''In one and a half years, everything changed,'' Mr. Tedeschi said. ''People started feeling afraid, and they stopped spending money. All the promises Monti made to relaunch the economy and help us enhance productivity never materialized.''
Orders for Temeca's custom-built bedrooms, kitchens, windows and doors slowed to a trickle. Even the Vatican, which commissioned a choir stand and furnishings for one of its palaces from Mr. Tedeschi's company, stopped placing orders last year.
Recently, he took a step he had hoped never to have to make: laying off employees, including a man who had been with the company for more than 30 years.
''When I had to fire those people, I cried,'' he said, sitting in his small office under a picture of Mother Teresa as his wife, Annarita Neroni, and his son, Lorenzo, looked on. Mr. Tedeschi said several members of a local trade group took their own lives last year when they could no longer maintain their business.
''This is a moment where if you stay alone in this situation,'' he said, ''you will wind up by shooting yourself.''
Mr. Tedeschi's wife said the family stopped drawing salaries more than a year ago to make payroll for the remaining workers. Disillusioned with the economy's rapid erosion under Mr. Monti, the family voted for the anti-establishment Five Star movement, led by the comedian turned activist Beppe Grillo, in the February elections, even though they knew it might lead to chaos.
''It's a form of protest,'' Lorenzo Tedeschi said, adding that he had been drawn by Mr. Grillo's plan to cut billions of euros in corruption and wasteful spending. ''We need to start from scratch in this country, and he gives us hope that there is a chance to make things equal.''
That may be tough, given that the discord Mr. Grillo created is likely to delay a recovery. Few people believe that official forecasts of a return to mild growth this year will materialize.
Lorenzo said he had no choice but to be optimistic. ''I still have my life ahead of me,'' he said. ''I have to believe that things will get better.''
Mr. Tedeschi interrupted his son. ''What has been happening is humiliating,'' he said. ''If I fail, and businesses like mine fail, then everything else fails.''
Ms. Tedeschi put her hand on her husband's shoulder. ''We are going through a financial war, which is burying us,'' she said. ''Will there be any survivors?''

HEADLINE: Hungary: Disputed Constitutional Change Approved

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
For Hungary, still seeking national accord on what constitutes democracy, and for Europe, still uncertain how to treat governments deemed to have strayed from European Union norms, Monday produced a symbolic moment in the annals of protecting civil rights.
On a state visit to Germany, President Janos Ader of Hungary visited a prison in Berlin where East Germany's dreaded secret police, the Stasi, held thousands of political prisoners, including some of the harshest critics of the now defunct Communist regime.
Back in Hungary, lawmakers from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party and its small ally, the Christian Democrats, passed a lengthy amendment to the Constitution that critics, including human rights activists, the Council of Europe, the E.U. and the United States, fear could undermine the judiciary, silence criticism and threaten the checks and balances of democratic government. 
''We are not yet North Korea, but this amendment is extremely alarming because it removes constitutional control and checks over the legislature,'' said Peter Hack, a leading professor of constitutional law at ELTE University in Budapest. ''It is a bald and dangerous power grab.''
While even the government's staunchest critics acknowledge that Hungary, an E.U. member, has put communism far behind it, thousands took to the streets of Budapest over the weekend to protest the changes, and the opposition Socialists boycotted the vote. Constitutional experts said that the amendment, passed in the 386-seat Parliament by 265 votes to 11, with 33 abstentions, will allow the government to reintroduce measures rejected by the constitutional court over the last 18 months.
These include a law requiring students who received state scholarships to stay in Hungary or pay them back if they leave; a ban on political advertising in private media; and a law allowing local authorities, in the name of public order, to fine or jail homeless people living on the street.
The passing of the amendment comes amid growing concerns that the center-right government of Mr. Orban, which has a two-thirds majority in Parliament and came to power in 2010, is trying to tighten its grip, including in the judiciary, the media, the central bank, education and even cultural life. It has laid bare the limits of the European Union in calling to account member states it fears have transgressed its democratic norms.
On Monday, the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, and the head of the Council of Europe, Thorbjorn Jagland, issued a joint statement, saying that the amendments raised ''concerns with respect to the principle of the rule of law, E.U. law and Council of Europe standards.''
The United States has also sounded the alarm. Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said Thursday that the amendment ''could threaten the principles of institutional independence and checks and balances that are the hallmark of democratic governance.''
For some constitutional experts, the most egregious provision passed on Monday was an article stating that the constitutional court and the president, who signs legislation into law, are not allowed to examine the content of a constitutional amendment. Instead, they are limited to examining whether the procedure for passing the amendment complied with the law.
Ferenc Kumin, a government spokesman, rejected the criticism, saying that the overhaul of Hungary's Constitution was imperative to upgrade the outmoded previous charter, which was based on a Communist-era constitution rewritten in 1989 as a reformist government cast off Communist rule.
Mr. Hack and other constitutional experts noted that only one paragraph from the Communist-era constitution remained in the 1989 constitution, and it stated that Budapest was the capital of Hungary.
''We cannot have a rational discussion on the basis of critics questioning our democratic norms or based on nonsense arguments,'' Mr. Kumin said. ''We believe all of the contents of the amendment can be defended.'' He added that the government had crafted the amendment to take into account some of the constitutional court's criticism.
Yet critics complain of encroaching centralization.
On March 1, Mr. Orban appointed a close ally, Gyorgy Matolcsy, formerly the economics minister, to head the central bank, fanning fears that the bank would lose its independence. Mr. Orban had repeatedly clashed with the previous central bank governor Andras Simor, who was appointed by the Socialists, and had refused to heed the government's call for a looser monetary policy.
Mr. Orban's government has also come under sharp criticism for revising Hungary's media laws, including the creation of a powerful Media Council which, among other things, is responsible for allocating radio frequencies, and is stacked with Orban supporters, appointed for nine-year terms.
At 49, Mr. Orban, an athletic father of five, is one of Central Europe's most powerful and charismatic politicians.
He became famous in 1989 when, as a opposition leader, he called for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary, articulating the aspirations of the entire region. He served as prime minister from 1998 to 2002, lobbying for Hungary to join the European Union, and seeking to overturn the old communist order, before narrowly losing power to the Socialists and being consigned to opposition for eight years.
Ever since his party won its stunning victory in 2010, analysts said he had shown a determination to do whatever was necessary to hold on to power, abetted by a weak opposition. A populist, he has tapped into Hungarian disillusionment with a lackluster economy by railing against the Union and the International Monetary Fund.
''Orban is hungry for power,'' said Andras Kosa, a journalist with the online version of HVG, a center-left weekly economic and political magazine. ''The Fidesz government thinks it is best to rule as many sectors of Hungarian life as possible. They think they know what is best for everyone.''
Dan Bilefsky reported from Budapest and Paris; Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

PARIS -- The economic outlook in major industrialized economies is improving, with the United States and Japan leading the way, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Monday, adding that activity in the euro zone was also picking up. 
The figures come after news last week that the U.S. jobless rate had fallen to a four-year low, offering a bright signal on the health of the world's biggest economy.
The Paris-based O.E.C.D. said its latest monthly leading indicator for its 33 member countries was at its highest level since June 2011.
The composite leading indicator rose to 100.4 from 100.3 in December, which the organization said pointed to ''firming growth.''
It also brought the measure, which is designed to flag turning points in economic activity, further above the long-term average of 100.
The O.E.C.D. says that the turning points in its indicators tend to precede changes in economic activity by about six months.
The United States showed the strongest improvement, with a reading of 100.9, unchanged from December. The index for Japan rose to 100.6 from 100.4.
The recession-hit euro zone also showed better signs, with its reading at its highest level since April, edging up to 99.7 from 99.6. The index for Germany, the largest euro zone economy and the engine for growth, rebounded to 99.6 from 99.2.
The O.E.C.D. said the readings for Italy and France signaled ''no further declines in growth,'' with the Italian index rising to 99.3 from 99.2 while France inched up to 99.5 from 99.4.
Among the major emerging economies tracked by the organization, the reading for China pointed to ''moderating growth'' at 99.0 after 99.1 in December. India saw ''growth slowing down,'' with a reading of 97.2 after 97.3, the O.E.C.D. said.

HEADLINE: Food Costs Threaten Rebound in China

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Diners looking for beef hot pot on a chilly evening in Beijing pay more than their counterparts in Boston, a discrepancy that shows the challenges China faces in reviving growth as inflationary pressures return.
A 6 percent increase in food costs drove a rise in the Chinese consumer price index to 3.2 percent in February, compared with the same period a year earlier, a 10-month high, official data released Saturday showed. The index was 2 percent in January.
On Monday, China's top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, forecast consumer price inflation at about 3 percent for 2013. 
Food prices typically rise in advance of the Lunar New Year holiday, which occurred in February this year. But since the holiday ended, meat prices, especially those for beef and lamb, have stayed elevated.
Retail beef prices in Beijing city markets are higher compared with supermarkets in the Boston area. Pork, China's staple meat, is only about 50 cents per kilogram, or 23 cents a pound, below the U.S. price, a Reuters comparison of standard retail prices show. Those prices represent a direct hit on the spending power of Chinese, whose average income is about a 10th the size of Americans' salaries.
Contributing to food production costs are the loss of farmland and farm labor to urbanization -- Chinese cities are swelling as they absorb hundreds of millions of people.
Grazing restrictions because of land degradation are also causing costs to rise across the country.
''The more the economy develops, the harder it is to raise calves,'' said Wang Jimin, who tracks cattle trends for the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science's Rural Economic Development Institute. ''In the short term, I don't see meat prices falling unless there are a lot of imports.''
After an international outbreak of mad-cow disease a decade ago, China allows beef imports only from Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay, so options to tame prices with imports appear limited.
For the near future, high feed costs will also help elevate the price of pork, an increase that is expected to drive broader inflation gains by the third quarter.
''It's a question of fundamentals, not monthly C.P.I. fluctuations,'' said Shi Tao, a livestock analyst at eFeedlink in Shanghai, referring to the consumer price index.
He said he expected a reduction in the pork supply this year because some pig breeders had decided to drop out of the business after losing money last summer.
Beef production in China has decreased every year since 2008, although it could rise by less than 1 percent this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.
''Cattle take at least a year to raise, not like chickens, which need a few months at most,'' said Yang Shaohui, a poultry vendor in Beijing. ''Poultry producers can respond to the market much faster.'' His chicken was selling for about a third of the price of the beef at a nearby stall.
The pressure on meat prices in China highlights not only the challenge of bringing inflation under control but also the drive to shift the economy toward consumer-led growth, Beijing's stated goal after decades of export-led expansion.
''Accelerating food prices mean less growth in spending on other goods and services in the economy,'' Carl Weinberg, the China-watching chief economist at the New York consulting firm High Frequency Economics, wrote in a client note.
A large increase in prices could jeopardize Chinese economic growth, which weakened in 2012 to its slowest pace in more than a decade. Growth only started to pick up in the fourth quarter after a seven-quarter slide.
It is a dilemma that China's incoming leaders, Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, might have hoped they would not have to face so early in the economic recovery.
''This year, I think, there are three priorities: to stabilize economic growth, which is not too big of a problem,'' to stabilize the prices of goods, ''where already it looks like there could be some pressure,'' and to reduce the risk from hidden debt, like off-book wealth management products, said Zhao Xijun, deputy director of the Finance and Securities Institute at Renmin University in Beijing.
There are already indications that the Chinese central bank is shifting its policy focus to inflation from growth. China needs to control inflation as a priority, the central bank said in its fourth-quarter policy report in February, shifting from a pledge in its previous report to support the economy above other needs.
Rising food prices represent a sensitive area for the Chinese Communist Party leadership given that social tension has often accompanied price increases. Food price increases can fuel inflation expectations that lead to a broader rise in inflation and the risk that the central bank will tweak monetary policy to keep a lid on the price pressures.
But policy makers should resist the temptation for pre-emptive action, said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.
''Though policy makers should be wary of inflation later this year with an economic growth recovery, it's too early to call for significant monetary tightening,'' he wrote in a note to clients.

HEADLINE: Market Rally Continues, Though Volume Is Light

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market rose modestly on Monday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average to its fifth straight nominal record high and giving the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index its seventh straight advance.
The gains put the S.& P. 500 just nine points away from its record closing high, which it reached in October 2007.
Stocks have rallied strongly since the start of the year, helped by signs of improvement in the economy and the Federal Reserve's continuing program of quantitative easing to stimulate the economy. These factors have limited recent pullbacks as investors have used them as buying opportunities. 
''These dips are consistently bought. There is definitely a soft floor for the market,'' said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City.
''It's a Q.E. bid,'' Mr. Kenny said, referring to the Fed's policy of keeping short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008. ''Quite frankly, earnings have not disappointed to the point where it has been disrupted, and there is nothing out there that seems to be getting in the way of this slow but very consistent and methodical drift higher in the market.''
Trading volume was relatively light, however, suggesting the rally may be losing steam.
So far this year, the Dow has gained more than 10 percent, while the S.& P. 500 is up more than 9 percent.
On Monday, the Dow industrials gained 50.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 14,447.29. The S.& P. 500 index rose 5.04 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,556.22, just nine points shy of its record closing high of 1,565.15, which it reached on Oct. 9, 2007.
The Nasdaq composite index added 8.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to 3,252.87. The Nasdaq is still well below its record high of more than 5,000, reached during the dot-com boom in 2000.
Wall Street's ''fear gauge,'' the CBOE Volatility Index, declined to its lowest level since February 2007, suggesting investors were not unnerved by a brief pullback in Monday's early trading, despite expectations by many investors that a correction might be looming. The index, known as the VIX, dropped 8.2 percent to 11.56.
Boeing helped lead the Dow higher, gaining $1.71, or 2.1 percent, to $82.94, after the aircraft manufacturer said strong demand was prompting it to increase its production rates of commercial planes.
Among the stocks on the move, BlackBerry surged $1.84, or 14.1 percent, to $14.90 after AT&T said it would start selling the company's new BlackBerry Z10 touch-screen smartphone in the United States on March 22.
Dell gained 21 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $14.37 after the computer maker agreed to give the activist investor Carl C. Icahn a closer look at its books less than a week after Mr. Icahn joined the growing opposition to Michael Dell's plan to take private the company he founded. Dell's shares are now trading well above the offer price of $13.65 to take the company private, indicating that investors expect a higher offer.
Genworth Financial, the mortgage and health care insurer, jumped 66 cents, or 6.7 percent, to $10.50. An article in Barron's predicted Genworth stock could almost double in the next year, bolstered by gains in the mortgage and health care markets.
In contrast, Dick's Sporting Goods tumbled $5.49, or 10.8 percent, to $45.11 after the retailer reported fourth-quarter results that were lower than expected and gave a disappointing forecast.
In the bond market, interest rates edged up slightly. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note slid 3/32, to 99 15/32, while its yield rose to 2.06 percent, from 2.05 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: City Suspends Pension Payments for Arts Institutions

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
New York City is withholding payment into a pension system that covers some employees at many of the city's day care centers as well as some of its best known cultural institutions, including the American Museum of Natural History, the Brooklyn Museum, the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
City budget officials said the suspension came after a review indicated that the number of workers covered by the pension system was possibly inflated. 
Mark Page, the city's budget director, disclosed the suspension of payment into the pension plan, Cultural Institutions Retirement System, or CIRS, at a meeting last week of the City Council's Finance Committee.
Mr. Page said the city has questions about whether its share of the pension costs, projected to be about $17 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, was overstated because of irregularities in pension calculations. Under an arrangement that dates from 1962 the city pays into a pension system that covers some workers in dozens of day care centers with city contracts as well as dozens of cultural institutions.
''There is a bunch of money that we have paid for over the years that has been, I guess, nice for those enterprises but not very nice for our taxpayers and what we have actually gotten for our money,'' Mr. Page said at the committee hearing.
At the cultural institutions the employees typically covered are a fraction of the staff and generally occupy unionized positions, like security guards or gardeners. Their salaries are also provided by the city, although they are not city employees.
''The city has not paid the CIRS bill this fiscal year, and the city is currently conducting a review of payments made to CIRS on behalf of these nonprofits to ensure that proper and accurate bookkeeping records were maintained,'' said Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for the mayor's office.
She said the city had ''detected potential anomalies in the data provided by these nonprofits related to the payments the city was making for them to CIRS.'' When the review by the Office of Management and Budget is completed, she said, she expects that whatever money the city owed the institutions would be paid into the retirement system.
Raglan George Jr., executive director of the union that represents the day care workers and a trustee of the pension system, said there had been no inflation of numbers. He said the dispute concerns a failure by the city to account for the pension payments of about 1,200 workers who were let go last year because the city had introduced a new early-childhood education program.
''When they made that decision they never considered the impact on the pensions,'' he said of the city officials.
Mr. George said that the pension system is otherwise well financed, and that the delay in the city's payment would not affect those currently drawing pensions.
Richard Koski, the executive director of the retirement system, said in an interview that he could not discuss the issue and does not have full details of the city's concerns.
''We've been around for 50 years, and I think we do a really good job for the folks who work there,'' Mr. Koski said. He said the system covers 20,000 people, both active and retired, and about 50 cultural institutions.
The cultural institutions listed as members on the pension system's Web site range from well-known attractions like Wave Hill, El Museo del Barrio and the Museum of the Moving Image to smaller organizations like the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and the Center for Book Arts. About one third of the city's payment to the pension system covers the cultural employees, and the rest covers the day care employees.
Officials at several of the institutions declined to comment, some saying that they did not have enough information yet.
The retirement system operates as a partnership among the city, the cultural institutions and the Day Care Council of New York, a membership organization of child care and family service providers and advocates. The city's decision to suspend payment in the system was first reported in The New York Post.
In a letter this year to the commissioners for the city's Cultural Affairs Department and the Administration for Children's Services, Mr. Page said the city's review had shown that the cultural and day care employees were working under a collective bargaining agreement that called for ''benefits greater than those afforded to city employees.''
The letter said that when the current collective bargaining agreement expires on June 30 the city would finance those pensions only at the same level as city employees, and that the city would no longer subsidize benefits like matching the 401(k) contributions of employees.

HEADLINE: Obama's G.O.P. Outreach Hits Barriers

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For all the attention to President Obama's new campaign of outreach to Republicans, it was four months ago -- on the eve of bipartisan budget talks -- that he secretly invited five of them to the White House for a movie screening with the stars of ''Lincoln,'' the film about that president's courtship of Congress to pass a significant measure.
None accepted.
The president's associates, busy lately fielding questions of what took so long, readily acknowledge that Mr. Obama could have done more over the past divisive four years to wine, dine and simply engage the other side to reach bipartisan deals on a range of issues. They give multiple reasons for his reserve -- personality, family commitments (6:30 dinner is said to be ''sacrosanct'' most nights) and too little appreciation for the aura of the presidency. 
But now that he is trying harder -- on Tuesday Mr. Obama makes the first of four visits to the Capitol over three consecutive days -- Democrats say that his effort will put to the test, or at least expose, what they call the biggest factor of all: Republicans' resistance to what overtures Mr. Obama does make, whether social or legislative, given the political danger of appearing too close to a president so unpopular with the conservative base.
''I find it sort of hard to stomach the criticism that he has not been reaching out to Republicans,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a Democrat close to the White House.
Republicans are politically ''schizophrenic,'' he added. ''On the one hand they complain about the president not reaching out,'' he said. ''But when he reaches out directly, a lot of them are running for cover.''
What spurred Mr. Obama to reach out to rank-and-file Republicans with a flurry of phone calls, meals and now Capitol visits were the recent announcements by their leaders -- Speaker John A. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky -- that they will no longer negotiate with Mr. Obama on budget policy as long as he keeps demanding more tax revenues as the condition for Democrats' support of reduced spending on Medicare and other entitlement programs.
Both leaders face political risks from deal-making with the president -- Mr. Boehner the potential loss of his leadership job; Mr. McConnell the danger of a Tea Party challenge as he faces re-election next year. The record is full of examples of Republicans who have paid a price for appearing too cozy with Mr. Obama.
Given that, administration aides for a long time would not confirm that any members of Congress had been invited to the intimate movie screening in the White House theater on Nov. 15, on the evening before Mr. Obama was to have his first White House meeting with leaders of both parties about avoiding an approaching ''fiscal cliff'' of automatic tax increases and spending cuts.
The five Republicans invitees, including Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell, sent regrets; aides cited the lateness of the invitation and the leaders' commitments on Capitol Hill. Four of the five Democrats who were invited, including both party leaders -- Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California -- did make it, joining not only Mr. Obama but the film's director, Steven Spielberg; its screenwriter, Tony Kushner; and the actors Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader.
Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma had a scheduling conflict that evening, but he has been one of the few Republicans in Congress to have an open channel to the president, a relationship that began when Mr. Obama was a senator. Mr. Coburn, in an interview recently but before the president's latest outreach, said that such legislative engagement was counter to Mr. Obama's ''personality type.''
''What he doesn't realize is if he tried a different style, he'd get a whole lot more cooperation,'' Mr. Coburn said, adding: ''He's really a neat guy. People don't know that about him.''
But Mr. Obama insists that he tries.
''I promise you, we invite folks from Congress over here all the time,'' Mr. Obama said at a White House news conference in January, when challenged about criticism of his infrequent outreach. He added, ''Sometimes they don't choose to come, and that has to do with the fact that I think they don't consider the optics useful for them politically.''
Mr. Obama cited the example of Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor of Florida. In early 2009, Mr. Crist literally embraced the new president and his $800 billion two-year economic stimulus package when Mr. Obama visited Florida, thereby poisoning his candidacy for his party's Senate nomination; it went to Marco Rubio, who then won the general election.
''It was the death knell for me as a Republican,'' said Mr. Crist, who is now a Democrat.
Mr. Rubio, he recalled, put a photograph of the Crist-Obama embrace on his political literature and, at one rally, an angry Republican voter heckled, ''Why don't you just go hug Obama?'' (These days it is Mr. Rubio, widely considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate, who has been trying to walk a hazardous line between getting legislative results -- in his case a bipartisan immigration bill that Mr. Obama will sign -- and not appearing too close to the president.)
More recently Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, another Republican seen as a presidential contender, enraged conservative activists with his warm reception of Mr. Obama as he toured the state after Hurricane Sandy, just before the November election.
Mr. Crist said his immediate thought was: ''First Crist, now Christie. Look out buddy.'' Before long came news of Mr. Christie's snub by organizers of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference: He is not invited to this week's conclave, which for years has served as a showplace for ambitious Republicans.
Mr. Obama's promise to end Washington's wars was a big part of his appeal in the 2008 campaign, and to buttress that vow he pointed to his bipartisanship as a state senator. In Springfield, Ill., he was known for weekly poker games with Republicans and Democrats as well as legislating with them.
One Republican Illinois Senate leader, Kirk W. Dillard, famously went so far as to make a television ad in 2007 for Mr. Obama's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. ''Republican legislators respected Senator Obama,'' Mr. Dillard said, looking into the camera. ''His negotiation skills and ability to understand both sides would serve the country very well.''
Mr. Dillard's ad became a big issue in his own campaign for Republicans' 2010 nomination for governor. After starting far out front, he narrowly lost. ''We must oppose this guy,'' the influential conservative blogger Erick Erickson wrote a week before the primary, citing only Mr. Dillard's relationship to Mr. Obama.
Now Mr. Dillard is running for governor again, seeking the 2014 nomination and testing whether Republicans have forgotten the pro-Obama ad.
Aides say Mr. Obama will continue his outreach even if the phone calls and other overtures can ''feel fake to him,'' in the words of one associate. The president signaled as much in his January news conference.
''Now that my girls are getting older, they don't want to spend that much time with me anyway,'' Mr. Obama said. ''So,'' he added, ''maybe a whole bunch of members of the House Republican caucus want to come over and socialize more.''

HEADLINE: New Big East And Fox Team Up

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
No sports network loves college football and college basketball more than ESPN.
But Fox Sports is showing enough passion to imagine that Rupert Murdoch, Fox's head coach, will one day be spotted on campuses on fall Saturdays donning oversize mascot heads to predict the winners of the football games carried by his empire.
The levels of boola-boola in Fox's bloodstream have been rising for years -- one symptom was luring the play-by-play announcer Gus Johnson from CBS -- but they are peaking now because of the start-up in mid-August of Fox Sports 1, an all-sports cable channel. Fox Sports executives laid out many of the network's plans last week, but they did not discuss a deal with the Catholic 7 -- the basketball universities that are seceding from the Big East -- which is expected to be announced in a week or so. 
The seven universities acquired the Big East name last week by leaving behind tens of millions of dollars in exit and entry fees that they would have received -- had they not left -- as a result of other universities' comings-and-goings from the drastically realigned conference.
The new Big East will join a Fox Sports 1 college roster that features the Big 12, the Pacific-12 and Conference USA. Fox also owns 51 percent of the Big Ten Network, carries the Big Ten football championship game and alternates the Pac-12 football title game with ESPN.
The seven Catholic universities had privately voiced concerns that the Big East was changing to chase football cash; aware of the discontent, Fox last fall made clear its desire to talk to the group. The universities also knew that the terms of what essentially acted as a prenuptial agreement would let them leave the Big East as a unit, without paying exit fees, and make their own TV deal.
Fox won them over with a 12-year deal worth about $500 million, according to reports. But the contract could spike to $600 million if the conference grows to a dozen teams, according to two people briefed on the contract but not authorized to speak publicly about its terms. A number of universities are said to be candidates to join the new Big East, including Xavier, an Atlantic 10 member, and Creighton, of the Missouri Valley Conference.
ESPN, by contrast, will be paying the old Big East about $20 million annually to carry a conference featuring Connecticut, Cincinnati, Temple and South Florida -- which are not leaving, for now -- in addition to Navy (in football only) and a group of new, mostly Southern universities.
Football is the financial bell cow of college sports, but Fox chased the basketball-only conference for several reasons:
¶ Fox Sports 1 doesn't need football, but basketball is the cream of the old Big East, especially as Syracuse, Pittsburgh, Louisville and Rutgers exit the conference.
¶ Basketball adds volume to Fox Sports 1 as it plans to make its debut Aug. 17 with as many as 90 million subscribers.
¶ The seven universities bring Fox history and rivalries, especially Georgetown, St. John's, Seton Hall and Providence, four of the original seven Big East teams, and Villanova. (Marquette and DePaul are the sixth and seventh programs.)
But as Fox has increased its devotion to college sports, it has not hung on to a major bowl position.
From 2007 to '10, it carried the Bowl Championship Series on broadcast television.
But ESPN outbid Fox by nearly $100 million for the next four years and moved all the games to cable. The advertising recession forced Fox into a conservative bid, but it would have been more aggressive if Fox Sports 1 had existed to bring in subscriber revenue.
ESPN made deals recently to make certain that no one, including Fox, could get the B.C.S. games and the new B.C.S. playoff system until 2026.
Among the nearly three dozen bowl games, Fox shows only the Cotton Bowl. Last January, it was seen by an average of 11.9 million viewers, who watched Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel, the Heisman Trophy winner, amass 516 total yards in a 41-13 win over Oklahoma.
Triumphant as it was, the game did not prompt Murdoch to feed victory treats to Reveille, Texas A&M's collie mascot.

HEADLINE: Nominee to Lead the S.E.C. Vows an 'Unrelenting' Fight on Fraud

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mary Jo White plans to strike a hard line against Wall Street wrongdoing at a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, as she deflects concerns over her ability to regulate the same banks she recently defended.
In written testimony released on Monday by the Senate Banking Committee, which must approve her nomination as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ms. White outlined her experience pursuing white-collar crime as a federal prosecutor in New York. As head of the S.E.C., Ms. White wrote, she would continue her campaign to root out financial fraud.
''If confirmed, it will be a high priority throughout my tenure to further strengthen the enforcement function of the S.E.C. -- it must be fair, but it also must be bold and unrelenting,'' Ms. White, who has defended JPMorgan Chase, UBS and other Wall Street giants, said in the written testimony. ''Strong enforcement is necessary for investor confidence and is essential to the integrity of our financial markets.'' 
The hearing on Tuesday will present the latest opportunity for Ms. White to woo her critics. Over several weeks, Ms. White held meetings with lawmakers and answered a questionnaire detailing her qualifications.
Now, in her written testimony, Ms. White provided the first window into her priorities as an S.E.C. chief. She placed a premium on unearthing financial fraud, while also spelling out an agenda that included keeping a closer eye on high-speed trading firms and putting the finishing touches on new rules for Wall Street.
''The S.E.C. needs to get the rules right, but it also needs to get them done,'' she said in the prepared testimony.
Although Ms. White is expected to receive Senate approval later this month, she will face broader questions at the hearing about her turns through the revolving door between government service and private practice. For three decades, she bounced between the federal government and a lucrative legal practice at Debevoise & Plimpton, where she defended JPMorgan Chase in financial crisis cases, Morgan Stanley's board in vetting a chief executive and Michael Geoghegan, the former head of HSBC.
To avert potential conflicts, Ms. White agreed to recuse herself for one year from most matters involving former clients and issues that touched the legal practice of her husband, John W. White, a corporate lawyer. Ms. White also vowed ''as far as can be foreseen'' never to return to Debevoise and planned to soon cut financial ties with the firm.
But some lawmakers still question her movements through the revolving door. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, has questioned whether Ms. White's pledge to avoid former clients would undercut her ability to run the agency. Others are scrutinizing her lack of regulatory experience.
Despite the concerns, Ms. White's nomination is expected to sail through the committee before receiving full Senate approval. The committee's chairman, Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, already hailed her nomination.
''She has a superb résumé and Chairman Johnson was impressed with her in-depth knowledge of the issues and her commitment to taking a balanced approach at the S.E.C.,'' his spokesman said in a statement.
Ms. White's supporters also trumpet her long tenure in law enforcement. During stints as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn and later as the first woman to be United States attorney in Manhattan, she helped oversee the prosecution of the crime figure John Gotti and directed the case against those responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The cases won her praise from several Democrats, including Senator Charles Schumer, who called her ''tough as nails.''
At the hearing on Tuesday, Ms. White will testify alongside Richard Cordray, who is positioned to become director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In January, when the White House nominated Ms. White to the S.E.C. spot, it reappointed Mr. Cordray to a position he has held for the last year under a temporary recess appointment. The Senate last year declined to confirm him in the face of Republican concerns about the new agency, a thorny topic likely to arise again on Tuesday.
But the focus at the hearing will remain on Ms. White.
''If confirmed,'' she said, ''I will vigorously embrace and carry out the S.E.C.'s mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Mexican Leaders Propose a Telecom Overhaul

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- President Enrique Peña Nieto and leaders of Mexico's three main political parties on Monday presented a sweeping overhaul of the laws regulating telecommunications, the most serious effort yet to rein in the country's dominant telephone and television companies.
The proposal would give broad new powers to regulators who have been frustrated in their attempts to reduce the market power of América Móvil, which is controlled by the billionaire Carlos Slim Helú. 
Most important, it would allow regulators to require a company with control of a majority of the market to divest some assets or submit to special rules to prevent it from abusing its market dominance.
América Móvil controls about 80 percent of Mexico's fixed lines, about 70 percent of its mobile lines and 74 percent of its fixed-line Internet connections, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. (Mr. Slim owns about 8 percent of The New York Times Company.)
A study released last year by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated that the lack of competition in telecommunications costs the economy about $25 billion a year. The study noted that Mexico was at the bottom of the rankings among O.E.C.D. countries in penetration for fixed, mobile and broadband markets. Profit margins for América Móvil are much higher than the O.E.C.D. average, and the company invests less per person than companies in any other country.
''The government is sending a clear signal that its way of dealing with the sector is very different,'' said Jana Palacios Prieto, a telecommunications expert at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness.
Through a combination of legal challenges and lobbying, América Móvil's lawyers have managed to block or delay regulation that might chip away at the company's market share and its margins.
''We are two to three decades behind other countries,'' said Ernesto Piedras, the director general of the Competitive Intelligence Unit, a telecommunications consulting firm. ''We have a regulatory outlook that is so poorly enforced that practically any modification will leave us better off.''
The measures announced Monday also aim to curtail the market dominance of Mexico's broadcast duopoly: Televisa, which is controlled by Emilio Azcárraga Jean, and TV Azteca, which between them control almost the entire television market. The proposal envisions auctioning off two new private television networks, a plan the broadcasters have fought for years.
Televisa said in a statement that it welcomed more competition, while América Móvil did not have an immediate comment.
The measures that were announced on Monday must still clear a series of legislative hurdles. The first step is for Congress and state assemblies to approve a constitutional reform. Because the changes were negotiated among Mr. Peña Nieto's top aides and leaders of the three main political parties, they are expected to pass.
Then Congress must rewrite several laws to put those changes into effect. That, analysts say, is when the industry may find ways to water down some of the measures.
Among the proposals announced on Monday is one that would lift the limit on foreign investment in telecommunications to 100 percent from 49 percent. The law would give full autonomy to Mexico's Federal Competition Commission, which has struggled to impose fines on América Móvil and tried unsuccessfully to force broadcasters to provide their free channels to pay TV competitors.
The changes would also create a new body over the next year with broad powers to regulate telecommunications companies, including the possibility of ordering them to divest assets to prevent them from exercising control over the market.

HEADLINE: Responding to Financial Crisis, Britain Overhauls Its Regulators

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON -- After the financial crisis, countries like the United States adopted wide-ranging changes to their banking regulation.
Yet Britain was the only major economic power to go a step further by completely overhauling its regulators.
Taking the place of the current watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, will be two new bodies created to oversee the country's banks, hedge funds and other financial institutions. The Prudential Regulation Authority will monitor Britain's largest banks, while the Financial Conduct Authority will be responsible for consumer protection and market abuse. They will take over in April.
''Britain has gone for a complete overhaul,'' said James Smethurst, a regulatory partner at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in London. ''It's a big task to ensure everything will work the way it should.''
By splitting the duties of the Financial Services Authority, policy makers hope to separate the daily monitoring of banks' financial health from the policing of illegal activity like insider trading. The goal is to allow the separated regulators to focus on their own areas, instead of trying to cover everything from banks' capital buffers to market abuse. 
It is the second time since the late 1990s that Britain has done a major regulatory revamping. In response to the growing complexity in the financial industry, the Financial Services Authority was created starting in 1997 by progressively combining nine smaller agencies. The authority also assumed control of banking regulation from the Bank of England.
Yet as the financial crisis left Britain's banks on a knife-edge, politicians began to doubt whether the sole regulator could keep on top of the wide-ranging problems facing the country's financial institutions.
''When a system of regulation fails so spectacularly, people are going to ask what replaces it,'' George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a 2010 speech announcing the most recent major overhaul.
The task awaiting the new regulatory bodies will not be easy.
A series of recent scandals has tarnished London's reputation as a global financial center. The wrongdoing raised questions about why regulators had failed to spot a glut of risky lending by British banks, money laundering for drug cartels and other illicit activity that has cost consumers around the world billions of dollars.
Further scandals, including a $2.3 billion loss from illegal activity in London by a former UBS trader, Kweku M. Adoboli, and a $6 billion trading loss at a London-based unit of JPMorgan Chase, have heaped further pressure on British regulators.
''When we look back, last year will be seen as the low point,'' said Martin Wheatley, who will take control of the Financial Conduct Authority after six years with the Securities and Futures Commission, the regulator in Hong Kong. ''The time is right; we can rebuild from here.''
This is the toughest job of Mr. Wheatley's career. After earning a philosophy and English degree from the University of York, Mr. Wheatley, 54, worked for the London Stock Exchange for almost two decades before becoming a regulator. Over 6 feet tall, he comes off as relaxed and laid-back -- traits that will inevitably be tested by future financial crises.
His counterpart at the Prudential Regulation Authority will be Andrew Bailey, a Cambridge-educated economist, whose sometimes rambling comments would not be out of place at a university lecture hall.
Mr. Bailey, 53, who has spent more than 25 years working at the Bank of England, will oversee 1,300 regulators based in a building in London's historic financial district, just around the corner from the British central bank. ''We are holding institutions to higher standards than before the crisis,'' he said.
In an odd twist, the regulators will work from the desks formerly used by one of the banks they regulate -- JPMorgan Chase. The authority leased the building when JPMorgan moved its staff to Canary Wharf last year and bought much of the furniture in the building.
Canary Wharf, London's newer financial hub, will also be home to the Financial Conduct Authority and its staff of 2,600.
Not everyone believes the two new bodies will have an impact.
While the regulatory structure has changed, the enforcement powers remain essentially unchanged. London's financial community is awash with skeptics who question how dividing regulatory powers into two new bodies will safeguard against future abuses.
''Regulators never had a lack of powers -- they had an unwillingness to use them,'' said Bob Penn, a regulatory partner at the law firm Allen & Overy in London. ''Regulators failed, not the regulatory structure.''
Both Mr. Bailey and Mr. Wheatley admit the new regulatory structure may not have stopped the recent failures that have blackened London's reputation as a financial hub.
At the Prudential Regulation Authority, which will focus on banks' governance and capital reserves, regulators will be expected to take a more aggressive stance on how firms price risk. That will include questioning boards on risky trading activity that may leave banks underfinanced, as well as subjecting senior management to greater scrutiny over how they run their businesses.
The efforts to change banking culture follow widespread criticism of Barclays' senior executives after the bank announced it would pay a $450 million fine to settle claims by American and British authorities related to manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. In testimony to British politicians, Mr. Bailey accused the bank of having a ''culture of gaming'' the regulatory system.
''You can't regulate culture,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''We expect standards that put more emphasis on the public interest.''
For its part, the Financial Conduct Authority plans to place a priority on industrywide investigations over those that take aim at individual firms.
In late January, British regulators demanded that local lenders review the sale of certain interest-rate hedging products to small businesses after 90 percent of a sample of the instruments was found to have been sold improperly. The case, which already has forced banks to set aside more than $1 billion in potential payouts, resulted from a yearlong investigation that showed the misconduct was endemic across the country's banking industry.
British regulators and their United States and international counterparts also continue to investigate several global banks over the manipulation of important global benchmark rates like Libor. So far, the abuses have been limited mostly to low-ranking traders and managers, though authorities will hold senior executives accountable if they are implicated.
''In most cases, a direct line to the top management hasn't been there,'' Mr. Wheatley said. ''If we see a clear guiding hand from boards, we would take a stronger line.''
In the countdown to the regulatory changeover in early April, some analysts fear that the pending changes will lead to turf wars between the two new bodies.
Many of the country's largest institutions will be policed by both institutions, though the separate authorities have different priorities.
The focus of the Prudential Regulation Authority, for example, is on banks' financial well-being, while the Financial Conduct Authority will emphasize consumer protection. Sometimes, regulatory experts say, these different goals will lead to contradictory rulings with little clarity over who will act as referee between the two agencies.
For Britain to regain its reputation as a global financial center, a lot is riding on how Mr. Bailey and Mr. Wheatley will work with each other. Both men have put in all-nighters together dealing with scandals like the implosion of MF Global, and each will sit on the other institution's management board, though potential conflicts -- particularly at times of financial crisis -- are almost inevitable.
''We have to make it work,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''The system won't succeed if we don't work together.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expels 2 Venezuela Envoys

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; María Eugenia Díaz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- The United States said Monday that it had expelled two Venezuelan diplomats in response to the ouster last week of two American military attachés by Venezuela. 
''Around the world, when our people are thrown out unjustly, we're going to take reciprocal action,'' Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said at a news conference. ''And we need to do that to protect our own people.''
She said that the two Venezuelan diplomats had already left the country. The State Department identified them as Orlando José Montañez Olivares, a second secretary at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, and Víctor Camacaro Mata, a consular officer in New York.
The diplomatic tit for tat started last Tuesday when Venezuela said it had expelled two Air Force attachés because of what it described as an effort by the United States to destabilize the country.
In a television broadcast, Nicolás Maduro, who was President Hugo Chávez's vice president, accused one of the attachés of trying to recruit Venezuelan military personnel to conduct destabilizing acts.
Later that day, Mr. Maduro announced that Mr. Chávez had died. Mr. Maduro will serve as the interim president until a special election to replace Mr. Chávez is held on April 14.
Venezuela and the United States began informal talks late last year to improve relations, but American officials have said that the effort has since stalled.
''We do hope for better relations with Venezuela,'' Ms. Nuland said. ''There is work that we would like to do together, particularly in the areas of counterterrorism, counternarcotics, economics and energy relations, but it's going to take a change of tone from Caracas.''
Meanwhile, Globovision, a television channel here that actively supports the country's political opposition and is highly critical of the government, announced Monday that it was being sold to a financier who is seen as being sympathetic to the government.
The election will pit Mr. Maduro against Henrique Capriles Radonski, a state governor. Globovision serves as a counterpoint to the main state-run channel's pro-government coverage.

HEADLINE: U.S. Demands Chinese Block Cyberattacks

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House demanded Monday that the Chinese government stop the widespread theft of data from American computer networks and agree to ''acceptable norms of behavior in cyberspace.''
The demand, made in a speech by President Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, was the first public confrontation with China over cyberespionage and came two days after its foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, rejected a growing body of evidence that his country's military was involved in cyberattacks on American corporations and some government agencies.
The White House, Mr. Donilon said, is seeking three things from Beijing: public recognition of the urgency of the problem; a commitment to crack down on hackers in China; and an agreement to take part in a dialogue to establish global standards. 
''Increasingly, U.S. businesses are speaking out about their serious concerns about sophisticated, targeted theft of confidential business information and proprietary technologies through cyberintrusions emanating from China on an unprecedented scale,'' Mr. Donilon said in a wide-ranging address to the Asia Society in New York.
''The international community,'' he added, ''cannot tolerate such activity from any country.''
In Beijing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, did not directly say whether the government is willing to negotiate over the proposals spelled out by Mr. Donilon. But at a daily news briefing Tuesday she repeated the government's position that it opposes Internet attacks and wants ''constructive dialogue'' with the United States and other countries about cybersecurity issues.
Until now, the White House has steered clear of mentioning China by name when discussing cybercrime, though Mr. Obama and other officials have raised it privately with Chinese counterparts. In his State of the Union address, he said, ''We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.''
But as evidence has emerged suggesting the People's Liberation Army is linked to hacking, the China connection has become harder for the administration not to confront head-on. The New York Times three weeks ago published evidence tying one of the most active of the Chinese groups to a neighborhood in Shanghai that is headquarters to a major cyberunit of the People's Liberation Army. That account, based in large part on unclassified work done by Mandiant, a security firm, echoed the findings of intelligence agencies that have been tracking the Chinese attackers.
American officials say raising the issue with the Chinese is a delicate balancing act at a time when the United States is seeking China's cooperation in containing North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, and joining in sanctions on Iran. Yet they have been expressing their concerns about cyberattacks with Chinese officials for years. Starting in 2010, they invited P.L.A. officials to discuss the issue -- a process that has only just started -- and last November, Mr. Obama broached the subject at a summit meeting with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, a senior administration official said.
Since then, the official said, there has been a ''perfect storm'' of media coverage and protests from the corporate world. Still, he said, Mr. Donilon chose not to mention the P.L.A. in his speech because he did not want to engage in finger-pointing.
''What we are hoping to do,'' another senior official said, ''is force the Chinese civilian leadership to realize that the P.L.A. is interfering with their foreign policy.''
The Chinese have insisted that they are the victims of cyberattacks, not the perpetrators. On Saturday, the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, issued his own call for ''rules and cooperation'' on cybersecurity and said reports of Chinese military involvement in cyberattacks were ''built on shaky ground.''
''Anyone who tries to fabricate or piece together a sensational story to serve a political motive will not be able to blacken the name of others nor whitewash themselves,'' Mr. Yang told reporters at the National People's Congress, which was preparing to ratify the ascension of Xi Jinpingto the Chinese presidency.
Mr. Donilon said the threats to cybersecurity had moved to the forefront of American concerns with China, noting that he was not ''talking about ordinary cybercrime or hacking.''
That distinction, a senior administration official said, was meant to separate the theft of intellectual property by Chinese state entities from small-scale hacking by individuals, or the use of cyberweapons by a state to protect its national security. But the distinction between cyberattacks aimed at intellectual property theft and those aimed at disabling a military threat is largely made by Western officials devising legal arguments, not one the Chinese have embraced.
Even as he emphasized the need for international rules to guide cyberactivity, Mr. Donilon made no reference to the billions of dollars the American military and intelligence agencies are spending to develop an arsenal of offensive cyberweapons -- to be used against military targets, officials insist, not economic ones. The most famous of these operations was the covert cyberattack mounted by the United States and Israel to disable the centrifuges that Iran uses to enrich uranium at its site in Natanz.
Mr. Donilon sketched out a vigorous agenda in Asia, insisting the United States would keep pursuing its ''strategic pivot'' toward the region, despite cuts in military spending. He announced that the Treasury Department would impose sanctions on a North Korean bank specializing in foreign-exchange transactions -- ratcheting up the pressure on the North Korean government on the day that Pyongyang announced it would no longer abide by the 1953 armistice that halted the Korean War.
With fears about North Korea's increased nuclear and missile capabilities causing considerable anxiety in Seoul and Tokyo, Mr. Donilon restated a ''declaratory policy'' that was first formulated by President George W. Bush after the North's first nuclear test, in 2006. He warned that the United States would reserve the option to retaliate against the North, not just if it used nuclear weapons but if it allowed the ''transfer of nuclear weapons or nuclear materials to other states or nonstate entities.''
That formulation did not appear to cover, however, the transfer of technology to build nuclear facilities, as North Korea did in Syria. That reactor was destroyed by Israel in 2007.
''It's understandable that the people of South Korea would be concerned about the threat they face from the North,'' Mr. Donilon said, apparently alluding to talk in the South of building the country's own nuclear arsenal, a move the United States halted decades ago. Mr. Donilon added that the United States had assets in place ''to insure that South Korea's defense is provided for.''

HEADLINE: Harvard Explains Why Staff E-Mails Were Searched

BYLINE: By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA and JESS BIDGOOD

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard and its president on Monday made their first public comments on the university's searching of staff members' e-mail accounts, and offered a qualified apology for keeping the searches secret from most of the employees involved.
The episode has angered faculty members and refocused attention on Harvard's largest cheating scandal in memory, which involved a take-home final exam in a government class last spring. After an investigation, about 70 students were forced to take a leave of absence. 
In September, when confidential information about cheating cases appeared in news reports, administrators ordered searches of the e-mail accounts of 16 resident deans, to find the source of the leaks.
In an online statement posted Monday morning, university officials acknowledged the searches and explained their reasoning. The statement eased the concerns of some faculty members but did not alleviate them completely, and professors said they expected that e-mail privacy would be the topic of a full-throated discussion at the next faculty meeting, in early April.
In her first comment on the matter, Harvard's president, Drew Gilpin Faust, said that she did not know about the searches at the time, but that having been apprised, ''I feel very comfortable that great care was taken to safeguard the privacy of all concerned.''
Faculty responses revealed a gap between expectations in academia, where privacy is often seen as integral to academic freedom, and the corporate world, in which employees are often told to assume that workplace e-mails are not private. Some professors wondered aloud whether they had been naïve to think that things would be different at a university, and said they were forced to re-examine assumptions about confidentiality.
''It's disturbing because I don't know what it means about whether they could look at my own e-mail,'' said Oliver Hart, an economics professor. ''We need to have a discussion and a better understanding of the policy.''
He and other professors said the searches would prompt him to conduct more business through private e-mail accounts outside of Harvard's reach.
Most professors who agreed to discuss the matter on Monday insisted on anonymity, not wanting to run afoul of the administration. Several of them, conceding that the university had a legal right to conduct the searches, said the problem was, as one put it, that ''we never thought they would -- we never thought about it at all, and we probably should have.''
One leak last year involved an e-mail from the university's Administrative Board to resident deans, offering guidance on how to advise students accused of cheating. Some have questioned why such a minor breach prompted an investigation.
But the statement posted Monday, attributed to Michael D. Smith, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, and Evelynn M. Hammonds, dean of Harvard College, said administrators were more troubled by another leak, recounting closed-door discussions by the Administrative Board.
''The disclosure of the document and nearly word-for-word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information -- especially student information we have a duty to protect as private -- was at risk,'' the deans wrote.
Resident deans live among students in Harvard's residential houses and act as student advisers, and they are also lecturers, meaning that they teach courses but are not on a tenure track to professorship. Each one generally has a personal Harvard e-mail account and one specifically for the job of resident dean.
The deans' statement on Monday emphasized that the search was conducted only of the resident dean accounts, not personal ones, and only for the subject line on each message, to determine whether the confidential e-mail had been forwarded.
The search determined that one resident dean had forwarded the e-mail to two students who were accused of cheating and had sought the dean's advice.
Deans Hammonds and Smith wrote that the resident dean who had forwarded the messages did so in good faith and was not punished. The statement did not say whether administrators determined how the e-mail found its way to the news media, or who was responsible for the other leak, of the Administrative Board's deliberations.
That resident dean and one other were told about the e-mail searches shortly after they took place, administrators said, but the other 14 resident deans were not told until last week, after The Boston Globe inquired about the matter.
They were not told to protect ''the privacy of the resident dean who had made an inadvertent error,'' Deans Hammonds and Smith wrote. ''We understand that others may see the situation differently, and we apologize if any resident deans feel our communication at the conclusion of the investigation was insufficient.''
On his blog, Michael Mitzenmacher, a computer science professor, wrote that he was satisfied with some parts of the administration's explanation, but ''in my opinion, the administration made an error in judgment'' in not telling the resident deans of the search.
Wilfried Schmid, a mathematics professor, said he still wanted to know more about what happened. ''I certainly get the sense that many of my colleagues will be upset, and so there will be a discussion,'' he said.
But he urged the faculty not to lose sight of what he considered the bigger issue, the cheating episode itself.

PRIVATE SECTOR BENEFITS Mary L. Schapiro, below, is starting to get a taste of opportunities in the private sector after stepping down as chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in December. 
General Electric announced on Monday that it had nominated Ms. Schapiro to serve as one of its directors. She will stand for election at the company's annual meeting on April 24.
The G.E. board position will certainly pay her more than she made in government service. G.E. paid its directors about $250,000 in 2011; at the S.E.C., her annual salary was around $165,000.
CORNERSTONE OFFERING A group led by the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners began marketing the sale of a 40 percent stake in Indonesia's largest department store operator on Monday, a move that could raise up to 13.13 trillion rupiah, or $1.36 billion.
CVC and its partners are seeking to cash in on investor optimism that consumer spending power will continue to grow in Indonesia, Southeast Asia's biggest economy. The firm is based in London and owns stakes in businesses including the Formula One racing group. NEIL GOUGH

'FAT CAT' ON THE TRACK President Obama irked Wall Street bankers a few years ago by calling them ''fat cats.'' But one banker has embraced the name.
This week, Rich Ricci, the head of Barclays' investment banking unit, is entering several horses including Fat Cat in the Hat in the Cheltenham Festival, a four-day racehorse event in central England. Some lawmakers said the race illustrated the gap between highly paid bankers and the wider public that continues to suffer from slow economic growth in Britain. MARK SCOTT

HEADLINE: A Conversation With: Prof. Aseem R. Shukla, University of Pennsylvania

BYLINE: NIHARIKA MANDHANA


HIGHLIGHT: Wharton made a mistake in rescinding an invitation to Narendra Modi, professor argues. 

 BODY:
 The University of Pennsylvania recently withdrew an invitation to Gujarat's chief minister, Narendra Modi, who was to deliver a keynote address at the Wharton School's India Economic Forum via video link later this month. The withdrawal, based on questions raised about Mr. Modi's human rights record, has spurred an animated debate about freedom of speech and Mr. Modi's leadership credentials in India and among the Indian diaspora. 
 On March 6, India Ink carried aninterview with Ania Loomba, a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania, who helped mobilize opposition to Mr. Modi's speech. In a petition to the university, Ms. Loomba and other professors accused Mr. Modi of not doing enough to prevent communal riots in Gujarat in 2002 that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 people, most of whom were Muslim, allegations Mr. Modi has repeatedly denied. 
 "We were concerned that this conference would help contribute to his efforts to sanitize his government's record," Ms. Loomba said. 
 But opinions among the university's faculty on the situation are far from unanimous. India Ink contacted Aseem R. Shukla, an associate professor of surgery at The Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation, an advocacy group, for another point of view. In an e-mail interview, Mr. Shukla explained why he thinks the university made a mistake. 
 Q. 
Why do you think UPenn was wrong to rescind Narendra Modi's invitation to speak at the Wharton forum?
 A. 
The rescinding of Mr. Modi's invitation just weeks before he was scheduled to address the forum went against the most fundamental tenets of freedom of thought, speech and inquiry that the University of Pennsylvania categorically upholds as published policy.
Indeed, this university was lauded recently as among the top seven institutions [in America] for respecting free expression on campus. In capitulating to the petition that a few of my Penn colleagues initiated, this vaunted ideal of free speech was reduced to a platitude; Penn invited international opprobrium; and the university insulted legions of Indians and Indian-Americans who, while not necessarily supporting Mr. Modi as a politician, have confidence in India's democracy and judiciary.
Students and faculty of Indian origin are justifiably aggrieved that their invite list encountered asymmetric scrutiny and rejection in the face of perceived controversy.
Penn's tradition of free speech was celebrated when extreme anti-Israel speakers, Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam and radical Occupy Wall Street protesters held sway on campus. But free speech became an empty homily when it came to the speaker selection of a group of Indian-American business school students.
 Q. 
Why do you think the university made such a decision if it would stir controversy and could potentially cause the university embarrassment?
 A. 
I am not privy to the internal discussions at Wharton, nor the university administration. To me, my university manifestly misfired in the disinvitation on varied fronts:
A) It inserted Penn into the Indian political square by its insult of Mr. Modi - the most popular political leader in India by most opinion polls.
B) It erroneously regarded the anti-Modi petition as a collective representation of Penn's diverse faculty.
And C) It woefully underestimated that Indians and Indian-Americans across the globe are finding their voice, exercising the shared American and Indian ideal of mobilizing mass protests and articulating indignation.
 Q. 
Why do you think he was invited to speak in the first place?
 A. 
In any forum where business and India intersect, one may rightly presume that the politician feted by the United States Business Council, prominent economists and every major industrial leader in India as the paradigmatic leader for economic development and corruption-free governance in contemporary politics would be included on a panel.
As a likely prime ministerial candidate, dialogue should be fostered with Mr. Modi, rather than eschewed.
Mr. Modi represents the largest opposition political party in India from the center-right. Wharton students had invited leaders of the center-left ruling political party as well. The panel was balanced and diverse ideologies were set to be heard. This balance is now lost, and the forum will suffer loss of credibility and prestige as a result.
 Q. 
The professors whose petition prompted the revoking of Mr. Modi's invitation argued that inviting him as a keynote speaker amounted to an endorsement of his leadership. Do you agree?
 A. 
Does the university endorse Mr. Farrakhan because he spoke on our campus? Or House majority leader Eric Cantor, who was invited by Wharton to address the community? Is Penn anti-Israel because Palestinian activists calling for an electronic intifada and cessation of all relations with Israel had their say here?
I have tremendous respect for the intellectual capacity and discretion of students at Penn. We as faculty must advocate that our university never compromise on its mission to foster the free exchange of ideas and teach students to make informed decisions after diligently gathering facts. Faculty is empowered to join this dialogue and air opposition to speakers - as the faculty petitioners did, but faculty must not insinuate troubles and intimidate with avowals to protest portentously, "in a variety of ways," as those petitioners also did.
 Q. 
To you, what does Narendra Modi stand for?
 A. 
As a high-profile, polarizing national leader, Mr. Modi means many things to many people. He has legions of detractors and spirited supporters. I am free to love him or hate him, but none of that should have any bearing on whether my students are entitled to hear directly from him and render their own judgments.
 Q. 
What would you say to the United States, which continues to deny Mr. Modi a visa?
 A. 
When the Supreme Court of India's Special Investigative Team exonerated Mr. Modi of all accusations that he did not do enough to stop the horrible riots that gripped Gujarat in 2002, the United Kingdom and European Union ended its boycott of Mr. Modi.
Several U.S. legislators are entering statements into the Congressional Record that the Modi visa denial should be revisited in light of the Supreme Court report, because the visa denial repudiates the freely democratic election of 60 million Gujaratis in India, and because the visa denial could endanger the burgeoning potential for American economic investment in that state.
 Q. 
What would you say to Mr. Modi's critics who ask, in the context of the 2002 riots if human rights can be divorced from development?
 A. 
Human rights and development must not be mutually exclusive. Indeed, as Columbia University's economist Jagadish Bhagwati recently wrote, Mr. Modi's "Gujarat model" of economic growth is generating revenue that is being utilized for profound improvements in the social sector, health, and education.
When a democratic society such as India develops economically, a societal imperative to address human rights concerns begins to gain primacy. Gujarat is often considered the most developed state in India, and social indicators show concurrent improvement. This week's Indian government report states that malnutrition under Mr. Modi's Gujarat had the largest decline in the nation.
The 2002 riots were a national tragedy, but part of a tragically recurrent phenomenon in communally-charged Gujarat state that preceded Mr. Modi's government.
Dozens, including leaders of many political parties, have been found guilty and sentenced for instigating and carrying out attacks during those riots. Mr. Modi denies culpability and Gujarat's and India's Supreme Court, thus far, bear him out. If courts find otherwise, he must face the full fury of the law, just as Mr. Modi often states.
 Q. 
How would you react to critics who say support for Mr. Modi and his governance stems from a deliberate and orchestrated public relations campaign?
 A. 
My answers above are predicated on empirical facts.
 Q. 
In your opinion, can a polarizing figure like Mr. Modi lead a large and diverse country like India.
 A. 
Politics are inherently polarizing, depending on one's perspective. In the United States, just less than half of all Americans would say that President Barack Obama is a polarizing figure unfit to lead this country. The inability of Congress to find middle ground elicits fair questions about electoral dysfunction.
But that is the nature of democracy that we embrace as a fair compromise for liberty and freedom to choose our leaders, and sometimes, to hear from them even when we detest what they may have to say.
 This interview has been lightly edited.

HEADLINE: Wealth, Spending and the Economy

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: As the nation&#8217;s overall wealth has recovered, a vast majority of the gains have been in equities, benefiting mostly the wealthy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
The Federal Reserve Board last week released the latest data on national wealth. Economists were gratified to see that the net worth of Americans is very nearly back - less of a tenth of 1 percent - to where it was before the 2007 crash. At the end of that year and at the end of 2012, net national wealth was just over $66.1 trillion. The rising stock and housing markets are the primary reasons, but so is the decline in debt, which is down $822 billion since 2007. 
This generally good news, however, masks the fact that the benefits of rising wealth have not been equally shared. As one can see in the table, which is based on gross assets, there has been a significant change in the composition of assets. Much more is now held in the form of such financial assets as stocks and bonds and much less in nonfinancial assets, principally home equity.
Obviously, this has important distributional implications because the average middle-class family has the bulk of its wealth tied up in its home. According to the Fed, the gross value of household real estate is $5 trillion below its precrash peak: $17.7 trillion in 2012 compared with $22.7 trillion in 2006.
Depressingly, the gross value of household real estate is up only about $1.4 trillion over the last year despite a 7.3 percent increase in home prices, according to the widely followed Case-Shiller Index. The nation will need to do that well annually for another three years before beleaguered homeowners are back to where they were in 2006 in terms of housing wealth.
Obviously, those lucky or smart enough to be in the stock market have reaped the bulk of wealth gains. These have gone overwhelmingly to the wealthy. According to the New York University economist Edward N. Wolff, corporate stock constitutes just 3.1 percent of the net wealth of the middle class (defined as the middle three wealth quintiles), excluding pension accounts, with two-thirds of their wealth in home equity. (Raw data are from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.)
But for the ultrawealthy (defined as the top 1 percent), home equity accounts for only 9.4 percent of their wealth, with stocks accounting for 25.4 percent. The not-quite-rich (defined as the next 19 percent of households below the top 1 percent) are also heavily invested in stocks, which constitute 14.9 percent of their wealth, with 30.1 percent in home equity.
These data have important macroeconomic consequences, because household wealth and its composition affect people's work, saving and consumption.
According to a generally accepted rule of thumb, consumers spend 3 to 5 cents from every $1 increase in wealth. Thus the $10 trillion decline in household net wealth from 2007 to 2009 took $300 billion to $500 billion in annual spending out of the economy, enough to reduce the gross domestic product by 2.1 percent to 3.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 - more than sufficient to account for the length and depth of the recession.
But recent research suggests that the negative impact of declining wealth may even be greater because people react differently to changes in housing wealth than they do to changes in financial wealth. They also react differently to declines in wealth than they do to increases in wealth.
The latest research - by the economists Karl E. Case, John M. Quigley and Robert J. Shiller - shows a $1 decline in housing wealth reduces consumption by 10 cents per year, whereas a $1 increase in housing wealth raises spending just 3.2 cents. This suggests that homeowners will spend $500 billion less this year than they would if home prices were at their 2006 level.
By contrast, changes in stock-market wealth have a much smaller effect on spending. Consumption rises or falls about 2.5 cents for each $1 change in stock market wealth. Therefore, the $4 trillion increase in financial wealth from 2011 to 2012 will add only about $100 billion to spending this year.
The decline in wealth among those nearing retirement has been especially stressful, with many forced to work years longer than they planned. At the same time, there are fewer job opportunities for those in their 50s and early 60s. This has forced many to burn through savings put aside for retirement faster than they planned, while others will need to save more to compensate for declines in asset values, which will reduce their ability spend even if the housing and stock markets continue to rise.
The decline in wealth may have long-lasting consequences as well, by reducing bequests to the next generation. Given that younger workers are already having a harder time saving and investing than their parents' generation, in part because of crushing student debts, the depletion of their parents' wealth could leave many with no inheritances that might have helped fill the gap.
While a rising stock market is good news, its impact is limited because few Americans own much stock. Those who have been lucky enough to benefit are increasing their spending and thus raising economic growth, but there aren't enough of them. Most Americans need the housing market to rise considerably more before their finances are restored. That will be several more years, even if current positive trends continue.

Nearly three months into a new session and more than a week after the automatic budget cuts took effect, Congress has decided to take thefirst steps toward a budget process that both parties hope is a move away from the deadline-driven cycle of quick fixes. Though it will be hard to merge the spending plans proposed by each party, the fact that both houses of Congress are working on their budgets simultaneously is enough to ignite a glimmer of hope in some Washington optimists, Jeremy W. Peters reports.

        
Democrats say that President Obama's renewed efforts at making nice with Republicans will put to the test, or at least expose, what they call the biggest factor of all: Republicans' resistance to any overtures Mr. Obama makes, whether social or legislative, given the political danger of appearing at all cordial with a president so unpopular among the conservative base, Jackie Calmes writes.
 Around the Web 

        
It's that time again, Politico reports. The Faith and Freedom Coalition will be inviting the biggest names in the 2016 presidential field to a conference that will allow them to court the Republican Party's evangelical base.

        
The Hill: After President Obama received overwhelming support from black voters in the 2012 election, some members of the Congressional Black Caucus have been asking him, "Where are the black cabinet nominees?" The caucus's chairwoman, Representative Marcia L. Fudge, Democrat of Ohio, expressed concern that Mr. Obama had yet to name any black nominees to his second-term cabinet.

Anyone with an Internet connection can listen in as President Obama delivers remarks to his Export Council in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. It will be live-streamed on the White House Web site.

        
Later, Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will hold a bilateral meeting with Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei, as the White House continues its renewed focus on the Asia Pacific region.

        
After that Mr. Obama will head to Capitol Hill for the first of multiple meetings with legislators from both parties.

Nearly three months into a new session and more than a week after the automatic budget cuts took effect, Congress has decided to take thefirst steps toward a budget process that both parties hope is a move away from the deadline-driven cycle of quick fixes. Though it will be hard to merge the spending plans proposed by each party, the fact that both houses of Congress are working on their budgets simultaneously is enough to ignite a glimmer of hope in some Washington optimists, Jeremy W. Peters reports.

        
Democrats say that President Obama's renewed efforts at making nice with Republicans will put to the test, or at least expose, what they call the biggest factor of all: Republicans' resistance to any overtures Mr. Obama makes, whether social or legislative, given the political danger of appearing at all cordial with a president so unpopular among the conservative base, Jackie Calmes writes.

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.&#8217;s statement that prosecuting big banks could harm the financial system raises a lot of questions. | Mary Jo White, the nominee to head the S.E.C., goes before the Senate Banking Committee. | Michael S. Dell gave a rare interview about his effort to buy Dell Inc. | Federal regulators accused Illinois of misleading investors about the condition of its public pension system. 

 BODY:
Some banks may have become too big to prosecute, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said last week in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. That comment - an acknowledgment, for the first time, that Mr. Holder has not pursued big bank prosecutions out of fear of possibly harming the financial system - raises a variety of questions, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. "Does this mean that our banks are still too big to fail? Should we prosecute corporations? Should the size of an institution or its systemic importance influence the decision of prosecutors? What's the right policy?"
"At a minimum, Mr. Holder's comments are embarrassingly at odds with the Obama administration's view that too-big-to-fail was fixed by the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law." But the remarks also point to a deeper question of whether indicting corporations is effective. "The fact that prosecutors have not claimed a big-time scalp in the financial crisis obscures the issue of prosecuting companies themselves and the complications such prosecutions raise." 
 The case of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen provides a lesson. "The charges against the firm put it out of business, and 28,000 employees - most of whom had nothing to do with the Enron case or the shredding of documents - lost their jobs. Making matters worse, the conviction of Arthur Andersen was overruled on appeal by the Supreme Court. Prosecutors decided not to pursue the case. Ever since then, the Justice Department has been much more cognizant of the collateral damage of bringing a criminal case against a company - as opposed to prosecuting the individual employees responsible for the crime."
NOMINEE FOR S.E.C. CHIEF SET TO WOO CRITICS | Mary Jo White, President Obama's pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, is going before the Senate Banking Committee in a hearing starting at 10 a.m., with plans to deflect concerns about her ability to regulate the banks she recently defended. In written testimony released on Monday, Ms. White outlined her experience going after white-collar crime as a federal prosecutor in New York, pledging to continue rooting out financial fraud as head of the S.E.C., DealBook's Ben Protess reports. "If confirmed, it will be a high priority throughout my tenure to further strengthen the enforcement function of the S.E.C. - it must be fair, but it also must be bold and unrelenting," Ms. White said in the testimony. "Strong enforcement is necessary for investor confidence and is essential to the integrity of our financial markets."
Ms. White's testimony "provided the first window into her priorities as an S.E.C. chief," Mr. Protess says. "She placed a premium on unearthing financial fraud, while also spelling out an agenda that included keeping a closer eye on high-speed trading firms and putting the finishing touches on new rules for Wall Street." Also at the hearing will be Richard Cordray, who was reappointed as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. DealBook will be live-blogging the confirmation hearing.
 ICAHN GOES MUM; DELL FOUNDER SPEAKS OUT | Carl C. Icahn, who last week seemed poised to join the shareholder opposition to the proposed $24.4 billion buyout of Dell, has agreed to review the computer maker's confidential data. The move keeps the activist investor silent, for now, as he examines Dell's books as a participant in the "go shop" process being run by Dell's board, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports. In a statement on Monday, Mr. Icahn's firm said it "looks forward to commencing its review of Dell's confidential information."
Meanwhile, the bidding group - Michael S. Dell and the investment firm Silver Lake - has hired Citigroup to provide advice, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cites unidentified people familiar with the matter. The move would prevent another possible bidder from using Citigroup's services. With Citigroup in the bidder's camp, most of the big Wall Street banks would now be working on the deal in some capacity.
 Mr. Dell gave a rare interview about the deal. He told the radio program Marketplace that the proposed transaction "means the company will be even more founder-led than it was in its first few decades. I think this is very good for our customers. It gives our shareholders an opportunity to take advantage of some of the benefits of the things that we are doing as a company without taking on all the risks that I and Silver Lake will bear."
 ON THE AGENDA | Costco Wholesale reports earnings before the market opens, and Dole Food reports earnings on Tuesday evening. Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, is on CNBC at 8:30 a.m. Robert Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, is on CNBC at 3:10 p.m.
S.E.C. ACCUSES ILLINOIS OF FRAUD | "For the second time in history, federal regulators have accused an American state of securities fraud, finding that Illinois misled investors about the condition of its public pension system from 2005 to 2009," Mary Williams Walsh reports in The New York Times. "In announcing a settlement with the state on Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Illinois of claiming that it had been properly funding public workers' retirement plans when it had not. In particular, it cited the period from 2005 to 2009, when Illinois also issued $2.2 billion in bonds." Still, "the S.E.C. did not measure any loss in dollars, and it did not impose fines or penalties in Monday's settlement."

HEADLINE: Can Wind, Water and Sunlight Power New York by 2050?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A group of researchers proposes a way to power New York State entirely with wind, water and sunlight by 2050. 

 BODY:
 March 13, 12:43 p.m. | Relevant tweets appended | 
A group of scientists and energy analysts has laid out a path under which New York State could, in theory, eliminate its use of fossil fuels and nuclear power - including for transportation - by 2050. The graph above charts the contributions played by improved efficiency and adoption of renewable electricity sources as well as hydrogen fuel cells (with the hydrogen generated with renewable energy).
The plan, "Examining the Feasibility of Converting New York State's All-Purpose Energy Infrastructure to One Using Wind, Water and Sunlight," is slated for publication in the journal Energy Policy.
The analysis, predicated on the need to swiftly address global warming, essentially does for New York what two of the authors, Mark Z. Jacobson of Stanford University and Mark A. Delucchi of the University of California, Davis, did for the world in an energy roadmap published in Scientific American in 2009. 
The paper argues against any role for natural gas, using arguments developed by two of its authors, Anthony Ingraffea and Robert Howarth of Cornell University. Here's one taste of what they're calling for (from a news release): 
According to the researchers' calculations, New York's 2030 power demand for all sectors (electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, industry) could be met by:
4,020 onshore 5-megawatt wind turbines
12,770 offshore 5-megawatt wind turbines
387 100-megawatt concentrated solar plants
828 50-megawatt photovoltaic power plants
5 million 5-kilowatt residential rooftop photovoltaic systems
500,000 100-kilowatt commercial/government rooftop photovoltaic systems
36 100-megawatt geothermal plants
1,910 0.75-megawatt wave devices
2,600 1-megawatt tidal turbines
7 1,300-megawatt hydroelectric power plants, of which most exist
To me, the analysis works best as a thought experiment, given the monumental hurdles - economic, political, regulatory and technical - that would hinder such a shift.
In gauging the costs and benefits of various energy options, the authors include the costs from illness and death linked to pollution from fossil fuels. I'd love it if such indirect costs were integrated better into how decisions on energy policy were made. Therein lies some of the value of this kind of analysis.
But, like any good thought experiment, the paper raises a host of questions, including about its basic assumptions.
- Does New York State need - for its own sake or the environment's - to be an energy island? A lot of economists, and environmental analysts, would say no.
- Does this team's justification for such an abrupt shift in a state's energy system and norms match the level of risk posed by human-driven climate change?
That's a question that will always - with or without industry lobbying - get varied answers depending on competing priorities and differing perceptions of risk across society.
If you presume the answer is yes, that leads to specific questions about how to achieve such a transformation on the time scale they propose. (This is very reminiscent of discussions here of California's ambitious 2050 targets for greenhouse gases.)
I'm engaged in a fruitful e-mail exchange with the authors. Read on for one of my questions, with the answer from Mark Delucchi of Davis (There's more, but I have to teach and didn't want to delay in getting the discussion started here). 
My question:
On the energy end, how does your plan propose to get around the realities of built infrastructure today? Who puts up the money to retrofit buildings when, as New York City wrote in its energy plan, "Energy use in buildings accounts for 75 percent of New York City's greenhouse gas emissions, and 80 percent of the buildings that will exist in 2050 are already here today."
Delucchi's reply: 
I think there is nothing to "get around". There are several general strategies for dealing with existing infrastructure, broadly defined.
1) Instead of upgrading, maintaining, and replacing deteriorating existing infrastructure, invest in new infrastructure. If we don't appreciably accelerate retirement, there is no "extra" (early-retirement) cost to consider.
2) Retrofit and rebuild for maximum efficiency and minimum environmental impact. The correct basis for evaluating this economically is a full social lifetime cost-benefit analysis with a near-zero discount rate. On this basis, I believe that most improvements will be economical.
3) Electrify all sectors as rapidly as possible. In particular, create policies and physical plans that accommodate the electrification of transport. These policies and plans generally will not involve large-scale, rapid replacement of major infrastructure, but rather extensive but decentralized modifications and additions: charging stations; incentives for EV ownership, driving, and parking; mode shifting from heavy trucks to rail; port electrification; transportation and urban planning in support of electric transport, including transit and rail; etc.
4) Rapid expansion of micro WWS [wind, water, sunlight] generation and associated decentralized infrastructure: rooftop solar, micro-wind, V2G, smart grids. These are mainly upgrades and additions to infrastructure, rather than replacement. And again, the correct evaluation basis is full social cost-benefit analysis over the entire physical lifetime, at near-zero discount rate.
As you probably have seen, the Urban Green Council just came out with a report showing how NYC can reduce its carbon footprint 90 percent by 2050. I haven't read the report carefully, but from what I've seen it is reasonable. I have excerpted from the abstract:
"This study focuses primarily on the building sector, the source of 75 percent of New York City's greenhouse gas emissions. Building simulation modeling using eight basic building types shows that heating and cooling loads can be dramatically reduced through air sealing, heat recovery ventilation, and additional insulation, to a point where all heating, cooling, and hot water can be provided by heat pumps. Analysi of the city's building stock shows that the total electric load in 2050, which must be supplied by carbon-free sources, will be slightly more than today's electric load. Contributions from rooftop photovoltaic panels will be significant. An initial analysis shows that over the period examined, and on the basis of today's prices for both fuel and improvements, the savings from energy use reductions will be comparable to the costs of the building improvements. The total amount is affordable and will pay for itself over time if the cost of improvements falls as expected and fuel prices increase.
"In the transportation sector, electrification and expansion of both passenger and freight rail and conversion of on-road vehicles to electric drive, hybrids, and turbo diesels, coupled with the recently enacted CAFÉ standards, will allow total residual carbon emissions to drop well below 10 percent of today's levels. Adding electricity generation from biogas derived from waste and sewage treatment provides an additional input of carbon-free power while consuming a potent greenhouse gas.
"Several unused alternatives, such as maintaining the district steam system on waste combustion, are discussed but were not incorporated in the analysis.
"Although not a blueprint or detailed plan for the next 37 years, '90 by 50' demonstrates that the extreme emission reductions required to minimize climate change are in fact possible using technologies that are known and in almost all cases currently available, and that the cost is within reasonable bounds."

HEADLINE: MetroPCS Urges Shareholders to Back Merger With T-Mobile

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: MetroPCS urged shareholders on Tuesday to approve its merger with T-Mobile USA, in the face of opposition from two major hedge funds. 

 BODY:
The cellphone service provider MetroPCS urged shareholders on Tuesday to approve its merger with T-Mobile USA, in the face of strong opposition from two major hedge funds.
MetroPCS's chief executive, Roger D. Linquist, argued in a letter that the complex merger, which would give existing investors a 26 percent stake in the combined company, was the best possible option for shareholders. Mr. Linquist added that the company had considered various alternatives, but concluded that it would best grow by becoming the top low-cost cellphone service company in the country. 
"If stockholders do not approve the proposals related to the proposed combination, there is no assurance MetroPCS will be able to deliver the same or better stockholder value in the future," he wrote.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Federal Communications Commission disclosed that it had approved the transfer of operating licenses between the two companies.
"When markets are competitive, consumers are better off when the government forbears from intervening and allows private parties to negotiate and enter into voluntary agreements," the agency's commissioner, Ajit V. Pai, said in a statement.
But the biggest threat to the deal is not from the government. It is from MetroPCS's own shareholders.
The company's letter on Tuesday came as two of the biggest investors, Paulson & Company and P. Schoenfeld Asset Management, claimed the deal would leave the combined company with too much debt. The two hedge funds also protested the split of the combined company's shares, arguing that MetroPCS shareholders should own more.
Together, the two firms hold more than 10 percent of MetroPCS. 
In his letter, Mr. Linquist argued that the debt the combined company was taking on was in line with that of industry peers, and that the interest rates were also comparable.
A vote on the merger is scheduled for April 12.

HEADLINE: Greenberg Forges Ahead With Lawsuit Over A.I.G. Bailout

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The American International Group&#8217;s former chief executive is moving ahead with a lawsuit against the federal government over its $182 billion rescue of the insurer &#8212; even without the backing of the company itself. 

 BODY:
 2:23 p.m. | Updated 
The American International Group's former chief executive is moving ahead with a lawsuit against the federal government over its $182 billion rescue of the insurer - even without the backing of the company itself. 
A.I.G.'s former leader, Maurice R. Greenberg, filed an amended complaint against the government on Tuesday, largely restating his arguments that 2008 bailout of the insurer was unconstitutional and wrongly cheated shareholders out of billions of dollars.
His case received support on Monday, when the federal judge overseeing the case granted the lawsuit class-action status.
A.I.G. itself declined to join the lawsuit in January, after the insurer faced an enormous public uproar over the prospect of suing the source of its lifeline. Lawmakers and others had strongly criticized the company after The New York Times reported on the deliberations, with some legislators deeming it "the poster company for corporate ingratitude and chutzpah."
The insurer's chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, has long promoted the fact that his company paid back the government in full - and with an additional $22.7 billion profit. (Coincidentally, Mr. Greenberg contends that the profit rightfully belongs to shareholders at the time of the bailout.)
By forgoing the lawsuit, A.I.G. risks missing out on billions of dollars that Mr. Greenberg and his fellow plaintiffs would garner if they win. That might also invite a multitude of lawsuits against the insurer.
In the amended complaint, filed by Mr. Greenberg's Starr International Company, lawyers for Mr. Greenberg argued that A.I.G. was under pressure from its onetime largest shareholder, the federal government, not to join the legal fight.
"The United States indicated it would wage a negative public relations campaign against A.I.G. and its directors, terminate any cooperative relationship with AIG, and heavily scrutinize A.I.G.'s S.E.C., tax, and other filings from the 2008 to 2010 period when defendant controlled A.I.G.," lawyers for Mr. Greenberg wrote.
A.I.G. said in a statement that its board's decision in January hasn't changed.
"A.I.G. will neither pursue these claims itself nor permit Starr to pursue them in A.I.G.'s name," the company said. "A.I.G. will move to dismiss the derivative claims asserted by Starr in A.I.G.'s name, consistent with the A.I.G. board of directors' previous decision. "
A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said in a statement: "Two months ago, the A.I.G. board of directors carefully reviewed Starr's allegations and decided that they were not worth pursuing. We continue to believe that the claims have no merit whatsoever, and we will continue to defend the case vigorously."

HEADLINE: Intrade Sheds Light on How Gray Markets Can Go Dark

BYLINE: ROBERT CYRAN


HIGHLIGHT: While Intrade&#8217;s predictive record was good, it didn&#8217;t foresee the rising controversy over under-regulated speculation. 

 BODY:
Intrade sheds light on how quickly gray markets can go dark. The site, which took bets on everything from elections to oil prices to its own demise, was abruptly shuttered on Sunday. While Intrade's predictive record was good, it didn't foresee the rising controversy over under-regulated speculation. It's a cautionary tale for others operating in a somewhat shadowed zone. 
What halted Intrade isn't clear. The Irish company said it discovered problems, including possible "financial irregularities." Regulators already had come calling. In November, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a lawsuit that prompted the company to close its site to U.S. punters.
The pseudo-exchange occupied a niche that overlapped with futures dealing, online gambling and secondary market trading. Eventually, the C.F.T.C. decided that predicting the price of gold, for money, was the same as investing in the future price of a commodity, and that Intrade therefore wasn't stopping ineligible U.S. customers from making wagers.
Other similar sorts of markets have met a similar fate. In 2006, U.S. lawmakers cracked down on overseas gambling sites by prohibiting banks and credit card companies from processing related payments. It eradicated big slugs of market value for British companies PartyGaming and 888.com.
Others, like fantasy sports site StarStreet, are still flourishing. The company says its operations are legal because games where competitors create fictional teams using real-life professional athletes are based on skill and therefore exempt from the same 2006 law.
Exchanges like SecondMarket, which allow trading in the equity of private firms including Facebook before its initial public offering, have been gradually becoming more accepted. The new JOBS Act simplifies compliance and expands the number of eligible companies. Last week's announcement by Nasdaq that it was forming a joint venture with SharesPost underscores their continuing emergence.
Yet markets in unlisted companies, even big ones like Twitter, provide less disclosure and are far more illiquid than public ones. The collapse of Germany's small-cap Neuer Markt after the dot-com bubble and the shrinkage of London's AIM since 2007 are cases in point. Even Goldman Sachs couldn't attract enough investors to sustain its GSTrUE marketplace. If regulators don't catch up with gray-zone operators, other forces often do.

HEADLINE: White Says Her S.E.C. Would Be Tough on Wall St.

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Senate Banking Committee is expected to approve Mary Jo White, who provided few details of her plans for the S.E.C. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Mary Jo White moved closer to becoming a top Wall Street regulator on Tuesday as she sailed through a Congressional confirmation hearing. But even her supporters on Capitol Hill pointed to significant challenges awaiting the next leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
While she received a friendly reception during two hours of testimony, the Senate Banking Committee grilled Ms. White, the nominee for S.E.C. chairwoman, on her regulatory agenda, demanding that Ms. White complete new rules for Wall Street and take aim at financial fraud. Lawmakers argued that the agency, four years after the financial crisis, must confront a broad array of problems facing the public markets. 
Ms. White promised to tackle enforcement actions and unfinished regulation, but offered scant details on her plans. She did, however, signal a flexible approach to reforming money market funds, an approach that could draw scrutiny from investor advocates and liberal lawmakers.
Some lawmakers also pressed her to outline her strategy for navigating conflicting interests, another potential hindrance for her early days at the S.E.C.
Ms. White, who for decades bounced between roles as a federal prosecutor and a Wall Street defense lawyer, must recuse herself from investigating former clients for at least a year. After defending JPMorgan Chase for its role in the financial crisis, for example, Ms. White could have to sit out an S.E.C. investigation into the bank's recent $6 billion trading loss.
Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who has sounded alarms about Ms. White's turns through the revolving door connecting government and private practice, stressed the possible conflicts on Tuesday. "Nobody questions your integrity but we need some reassurance," he said. "What have you done over the last decade," he asked, that would comfort "ordinary investors?"
Ms. White explained that her work for Wall Street "does not change me as a person. It doesn't mean I embrace the policy thoughts of any of my clients." Now, she said, "The American public will be my client, and I will work as zealously as is possible on behalf of them."
Despite fielding some concerns from the Senate Banking Committee, Ms. White easily cleared the latest hurdle to her nomination. Showing no signs of strain, she struck a confident tone and maneuvered around the thorniest questions, prompting both laughter and praise from lawmakers.
The hearing cleared the way for the committee to vote on Ms. White's nomination as early as next week. Congressional officials expect her to ultimately cruise through the full Senate confirmation. Even one of the committee's Republicans, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, declared his intention to vote for Ms. White
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, set the tone from the start of the hearing. He praised Ms. White's "long and distinguished career" as the first female United States attorney in Manhattan and ticked off a litany of awards she won for prosecuting terrorists. Mr. Schumer also noted her playful side: animal enthusiast, motorcyclist, basketball player and lover of cold beer.
"The same toughness she shows playing basketball she will show as S.E.C. chair," he said, eliciting an uproar of laughter in the hearing room. "She will score many points and not commit too many fouls."
But Ms. White will encounter significant obstacles at the S.E.C., an agency that finds itself in a critical transition period. When Mary L. Schapiro became the S.E.C.'s leader four years ago, she faced a daunting task. Her primary job was to restore legitimacy to an agency blamed for missing the financial crisis.
With the agency now back from the brink, lawmakers say that Ms. White must elevate the agenda to take on topics outside her predecessor's regime. Ms. White, for example, vowed to examine the growing world of high-frequency trading, an issue that continues to confound the agency.
As for the dozens of unfinished rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, Ms. White called them an "immediate imperative." But the agency to date has come up short, falling behind on dozens of Wall Street reforms, including the so-called Volcker Rule that reins in risky trading at big banks.
Ms. White will also step into the contentious debate over money market funds, the investments that needed government assistance to survive during the crisis. It's a sore spot for the agency after internal bickering and industry lobbying halted reform last year. While Ms. White promised that the S.E.C. would tackle the topic again, she indicated that any new rules would not interfere with "the value" of the funds.
Her words alarmed investor advocates, including some of Ms. White's staunchest supporters, while others noted that it was too soon to read much into her stance. The advocates argue that a regulator's job is to protect investors, not the funds that cater to them.
"Preserving the money market fund product is not an appropriate public policy goal," said Dennis Kelleher, the head of Better Markets, an advocacy group that has praised Ms. White's credentials.
Ms. White, the head of litigation at Debevoise and Plimpton, also faces questions about her role in some S.E.C. enforcement cases.
Citing the "very high bar" she sets for herself when confronting ethical issues, Ms. White explained that she would avoid former clients for a year. In addition to potentially stepping back from the JPMorgan investigation, Ms. White might also temporarily avoid cases involving UBS and other clients.
Lawmakers questioned whether such recusals, even if well intentioned, might cripple her authority.
"How will you signal that wrongdoing will not be tolerated?" asked Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota, the committee's Democratic chairman.
"I don't think there's anything more important than vigorous and credible enforcement of the securities laws," she replied. "I'll be very focused on that throughout my tenure."

Some of the country's leading public health experts called Monday's judicial ruling against New York's limits on the sale of large sugary drinks a predictable setback in what has become a national campaign against obesity, the country's newest health epidemic.
Many public health experts support the effort by the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, saying it was an early attempt to limit the size of portions, which have expanded dramatically over the years and are at the root of the obesity epidemic. 
They, like Mayor Bloomberg, invoked other long public health battles, like those over tobacco and motor vehicle fatalities, to argue that the ruling was a temporary roadblock in a larger war on obesity that would probably take decades, and a lot of litigation, before seeing success. Even other anti-obesity measures taken by New York, like the ban on trans fats and the requirement that menus display calorie counts, wound up in court before they went into effect.
"This is a bump in the road," said Dr. David Ludwig, a professor of pediatrics and nutrition at Boston Children's Hospital. "We can take comfort from the time frames of other big public health campaigns. None were easy. None happened without legal challenges. The campaign against obesity has already begun on many levels."
Opponents of the limit say it is an inappropriate use of government power to restrict something that should be a matter of individual choice. Health experts acknowledged that the limit did go farther than menu labeling, the city's previous initiative, in that it was manipulating choices to try to change consumer norms, instead of offering information and letting the consumer decide.
"It has a different flavor to it," said Brian Elbel, assistant professor of population health and health policy at the New York University School of Medicine.
But they said that the initiative was justifiable because it was not an outright ban - anyone can circumvent it by buying two 16-ounce sodas - but a classic nudge-type effort, a concept in behavioral economics in which consumers are pushed into better behavior because certain choices are made less convenient. The rule also makes the choice to drink soda more expensive, as it costs more to buy two 16-ounce drinks than to buy one 32-ounce drink. 
"It's both a nudge in terms of making it less convenient, but it's also implicitly a tax by raising the relative cost of an ounce of soda," said Dr. Kevin Volpp, director of the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Dr. Volpp said he also understood the opposition to the limit, as it raised the specter of such bans' being applied to many other types of items - potato chips, for example. 
"It's a slippery slope," he said, "and it's not entirely clear where the line should be drawn."
Dr. Ludwig drew an analogy to the government's requiring seat belts and imposing speed limits. He said that the individual liberty argument would have more weight if the health effects weren't spilling over into society in the form of higher insurance premiums and a greater share of public dollars going to Medicare and Medicaid.
"If all the consequences were paid for by the individual, I could understand an argument that focused just on personal choice," he said. "But that's simply not the reality of the situation."
Marion Nestle, a professor in the department of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, argued that the size limit was meant to be a small counterweight to what she said was the enormous power of money and marketing of the beverage industry, which aims some of its resources at children, the most vulnerable members of society.
"The question is, who is making the decisions on portion size?" Dr. Nestle said. "Up to now, it's been the soda industry, backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in annual marketing."
The restriction, which was one of the first in the nation to address portion size, had value even if it did not survive in court, said Barry Popkin, professor of nutrition and economics at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, because it had added to the public conversation about how to address the nation's obesity problem.
"There's been in increase in national awareness of the role of sugary drinks and large portion sizes," he said. "Either way, we've had a victory."

HEADLINE: Change Agent: Examining How and Why the Pope Can Make a Global Difference

BYLINE: TOM MARSHALL, KATHERINE SCHULTEN and MICHAEL GONCHAR


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson we&#8217;ll help students raise questions and seek answers on the role of the church and the pope around the globe. 

 BODY:
 Updated: March 19 
It's not just the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics who are paying attention to the election of the next pope, which began on Tuesday in Vatican City after the retirement of Pope Benedict XVI. 
In this lesson we'll help students to also understand the far-reaching impact of religion and the church on politics, culture and daily life in every corner of the world.
Teachers may wish to begin by asking students to brainstorm what they already know, or what they would like to know, about the pope and the impact of Catholicism. Then read the stories below to find out more or develop ideas for further inquiry.
 Questions and Activities 
 1. Why did the pope decide to retire, and why is that considered such a big deal? 
The decision by Pope Benedict XVI was not wholly unexpected; at 85, he had showed signs of fatigue. But the announcement still caught many observers by surprise since papal retirements have been so unusual. Read this story about initial reactions to the announcement and watch a video in which reporter Rachel Donadio talks about the pope's efforts to govern "in a world where secularism is taking over."
Based on these stories, do you think age was the only reason the pope retired? Why or why not? 
Given that nearly one in five Americans say they are atheist, agnostic or "nothing in particular," do you agree that we live in a world in which secularism is taking over? If so, does that concern you? 
 2. What role does the church play in the world today - and why should non-Catholics care? 
This 2007 article describes Pope Benedict's stadium address to 30,000 young people in Brazil, whom he called "the future of the church":
People danced to religiously spiced samba. Nuns did the wave. The reserved pope received group hugs. 
Since 1900, Catholicism has grown exponentially in Latin America, Asian nations like China and the Philippines, and particularly in Africa, where membership has jumped from 2 million to 177 million members. 
Historically, the pope and the Catholic church have wielded enormous influence not simply upon religious practice, but also upon the politics and governance of countries around the world. 
Choose one of the countries highlighted in this interactive to investigate what role Catholicism is currently playing in its politics and culture. Does it seem to be uniting or dividing its people? Why?
Then, consider in what ways you can see evidence of the role of Catholicism in our world at large today. What predictions can you make about its influence in the coming decades? Why?
 Update: March 19: Does the election of Pope Francis signal a comeback for Latin America? What can the church do to compete with the appeal of evangelicalism there? Read the thoughts of six experts in this Room for Debate post and decide with whom you most agree. For another perspective, you might also read the Op-Ed "God is an Argentine."
 3. Did Pope Benedict XVI do a good job? 
Pope Benedict XVI is regarded as a scholar of church law who tried to reform Catholicism along traditional lines and, particularly in Europe, to challenge secularism. In this story for The New York Times Magazine, the writer Russell Shorto describes the pope's youth in Nazi Germany and his efforts in the face of church scandals like sexual abuse. His leadership of the church has been described as a turbulent one marked by internal struggles and the leaking of documents to the press. Even his own butler has been indicted. 
For some Catholics, Pope Benedict XVI's reign has been very effective in promoting greater transparency. Others, like the columnist Frank Bruni, say the Vatican's rulings hold little sway for independent-minded Americans. Gary Wills, a prize-winning historian, says he's given up hope that a new pope can heal rifts within the church. But Paul Kennedy, a history professor at Yale University, says the debate about popes relies on stereotypes and misses the point about Catholicism. "Loving your God, and loving your known and unknown neighbors as yourself, is the core," he writes. "The married-priests issue is a footnote; the female-priests issue is a footnote; so is divorce, contraception, Latin Masses, changes in the liturgy, even perhaps the death penalty."
In 2010, as the ripples from the sexual abuse scandal spread across Europe, some suggested that Benedict should resign. To learn more about the role of these scandals in the recent history of the church, use the teaching and discussion ideas we published that year.
Over all, do you think this pope did a poor job of governing, or was simply responding to fissures in the contemporary church? How do you think he will be remembered when the history of the church is written? Why?
 4. How have previous popes changed the course of world history? 
Many people believe Pope John Paul II helped end communism in Europe, while Benedict I tried to stop World War I. There's more debate about Pius XII, praised for his "heroic virtues" by the Vatican but criticized by others for failing to take strong, public steps against Hitler and the persecution of Jews during World War II. And that's just the 20th century; world history is replete with examples of influential popes. 
Research individual popes and the ways in which they changed the world for better or worse. Then, hold a class election to name an "all-star team" of consequential popes in world history.
 5. Who chooses the pope, and what sort of leader do people say the church needs now? 
There are 115 men who qualify, as Cardinal electors under the age of 80, to vote for the next pope. They range in age from 53 to 79, come from every region of the world, and are said to be deeply divided over the church's priorities. What are they looking for in the next pope? Magnetic charm, toughness, and vision seem to be on the list, and that's not all. The Times reports: "Any serious papal candidate has to be prayerful, theologically sound and fluent in Italian, the language of the Vatican and of Rome, which is, after all, the pope's own diocese." Other commentators compare the job of pope to being a CEO in charge of a large, multinational corporation.
Given the challenges facing the church, what attributes would you consider particularly important for the next pope? For a world spiritual leader in general? Why?
A fun way to play with the question: Use The Guardian's interactive Pontifficator to choose attributes and see who emerges as "your" pope.
 6. White smoke? Conclave? How, exactly, does choosing a pope work? 
In some ways, the process resembles a political campaign. First the cardinals arrive in Rome, and some of the Americans hold news conferences until colleagues pressure them to stop. A few celebrate masses in area churches, telling jokes to parishioners and even kissing babies. They chat daily on their goals for the church and draw lots to choose rooms, which are typically on the plain side: unadorned white walls, a single bed, table and chairs. Finally, on Tuesday, they're off to the Sistine Chapel for rounds of anonymous balloting, with puffs of smoke to indicate success or failure. 
What reasons have church officials given for deliberating in secrecy and following time-tested rituals for choosing the next pope? View this interactive to understand what happens inside the conclave. What would be the advantages or disadvantages of streaming the proceedings live over the Internet for the whole world to observe? 
 7. How has Catholicism changed in recent times, and what challenges does that pose for a new pope? 
Recent polls show changing attitudes toward the Roman Catholic church, with increasing numbers of U.S. parishioners following the general population in taking a more tolerant view of homosexuality, for example. Another poll by The New York Times and CBS News reported that 75 percent of Catholics in the United States thought it was a "good idea" for Pope Benedict XVI to resign, while 69 percent said the church should allow priests to marry and permit women to serve as priests. 
Based on such polls, how do American Catholics generally view the Vatican's position on divisive issues? What questions - from using birth control to the role of nuns - are facing the 21st century church in general? What do you think would be the worldwide impact of appointing a new pope who is more aligned with U.S. parishioners? Interview or survey a variety of Catholics in your area to discover how their attitudes match up with those in the surveys above. 
 8. How should the next pope connect with a younger, wired generation? 
In December, before he announced his retirement, Pope Benedict XVI opened a new Twitter account and posted messages to a worldwide audience. By the time he resigned, he had 1.5 million followers, some of whom had taken the opportunity to poke fun or criticize the church's positions on issues like birth control and the sexual abuse scandal. 
As a class, review the new account, twitter.com/Pontifex, and an archive of papal tweets. Does the Vatican seem to be using this technology effectively to reach new audiences and address hot-button topics? 
If you were part of a teenage delegation to the Vatican to give advice to the new pope about reaching young people, what would you say? To what extent should the new pope continue to play his traditional role, and to what extent should he seek to tailor his message to our changing world? Why?
 9. Who do you think will be the next pope? 
While students cannot participate in the actual conclave, they can make their own predictions or choose their own papal favorites using a variety of online tools. To get started, The Times provides a primer on the top contenders to lead the Roman Catholic Church. From there, students can fill out their own "Sweet Sistine" bracket predictions, inspired by college basketball's March Madness. Or, to select a new pope based on different papal characteristics, like age, outlook and priorities, students can also use The Guardian's interactive Pontifficator. If students want to know the odds that any one cardinal will be chosen, they can actually visit a pope betting page to consult what the bookmakers are saying.
When the white smoke rises from the chimney, compare your predictions with the conclave's selection. Why do they think the cardinals selected whom they did? What does the selection of the next pope suggest about the direction the Roman Catholic Church is headed in the future? 
 10. Update: March 13: Meet the New Pope: Cardinal Bergoglio of Argentina 
HABEMUS PAPAM FRANCISCUM
- Pontifex (@Pontifex)13 Mar 13
Jorge Mario Bergoglio, 76, is the first leader of the church ever chosen from South America, the first non-European leader of the church in more than 1,000 years,the first Jesuit, and the first to be called Francis. 
"In choosing him, the cardinals sent a powerful message that the future of the Church lies in the Global South, home to the bulk of the world's Catholics," writesRachel Donadio. 
You can see readers' reactions and add your own here. What do you think of this choice? How will he meet the challenges of the church today? 
Why is he described in this article as "a conservative with a common touch"? Why is he seen as a champion of the poor? Where does he stand on issues like abortion, gay marriage and the ordination of women? How does he shift the church's "center of gravity" away from Europe and toward the growing power of Latinos across the Americas?
 Update: March 19 "At the formal start of his papacy, Pope Francis offered a passionate pledge to serve 'the poorest, the weakest, the least important,' striking the same tones of humility as have marked the days since he was elected last week," begins this article. How is this tone and message a shift from that of Pope Benedict? How much do recent popes differ in general? Take this quiz to see how they have differed on seven key issues.

HEADLINE: A Food Market for New York

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The city has a chance to do something on Fulton Street that would benefit us all. 

 BODY:
There is nothing like a grand urban food market, which can anchor a neighborhood and even a city. Think of the 120-year-old Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia; the Ferry Building in San Francisco, which 10 years ago helped revitalize the Embarcadero; and the ever-popular Pike Place Market in Seattle. Even much-maligned Los Angeles has a permanent mid-city market, in business since 1934. 
New York ... well, the grandest market "we" have is 80 miles away, in Philadelphia. 

New York City built a dozen or so indoor markets around 100 years ago, and a couple of smaller ones remain in operation. [1]
 We're enthusiastic about our existing big markets, represented by the ongoing success of the quite limited Chelsea Market and the excitement over the decidedly upscale Eataly. 
But imagine the Union Square Greenmarket with a roof over its head, bigger and better: fishers and foragers, selling directly; purveyors of all types, gathering great food from everywhere; prepared foods that might make you drool. Think of the first great indoor market you visited - huge in scope, democratic and central - and imagine it in Manhattan. 
Such an opportunity exists at the site of the former Fulton Fish Market. The romance of this location at the foot of Fulton Street can hardly be overstated: it was a trading center before Europeans arrived; it was the site of the first Brooklyn-Manhattan ferry;and the fish market itself was here for nearly 200 years before moving to the Bronx (and, it seems to me, losing its soul) in 2005.
The huge buildings have remained uninhabited since then, but their spirit has been kept alive through the efforts of Robert LaValva, a former city planner, and others. It was LaValva, inspired by the story of London's Borough Market (a millennium-old site that was revived recently and permanently changed the south bank of the Thames), who started, soon after the fish market's depature, what's become the New Amsterdam Market. Since then, it's become a weekly seasonal (April to December in 2012) fixture in front of the former fish market buildings, held Sundays from 11 to 4. Like all good food markets, it brings together shoppers with small and mostly local purveyors and producers, like those mentioned above, plus farmers, artisans, fishmongers, cheesemongers, butchers, bakers and more. 
The fish market site - there are two buildings on it - would make an ideal permanent New Amsterdam market, something that could become our city's version of the Borough Market, Pike Place, Reading or even Barcelona's incredibleLa Boqueria. (I can dream, no?) It's a vision that can happen - and LaValva and others are pushing for it - but it won't come easily. 
A hearing this Thursday (March 14) before the Zoning Sub-Committee of the Land Use Committee of the New York City Council will to a large extent determine whether that vision is feasible. The adjoining Pier 17 (often referred to as "South Street Seaport") is about to undergo a massive redevelopment project, turning what amounts to a failed mall with a museum into what its developers (the Howard Hughes Corporation, or HHC), hope will be a successful mall with a museum. 
The mall's character is so far ill-defined, with the developers refusing to name retailers (they have promised not to rent to big-box stores) and touting its non-shopping-center, city-like aspects. (We actually have a city; do we need a malls that mimics it?) Perhaps it'll be different, but to me it sounds like a blend of Columbus Avenue, the Time Warner Center (or whatever they call it now) and the Javits Center. Exciting, huh? 
But it doesn't matter what I (or you) think about the Pier 17 development; it's unlikely to change. 
What might change, however, is the city's plan for the area's remaining public space, including the adjacent former fish market buildings. Changing that attitude is the goal of apetition to the mayor and city council sponsored by the Save Our Seaport (SOS) coalition. 
As it stands, the rezoning needed to give HHC what it wants on Pier 17 will affect the whole waterfront in that area and may give the developer control of the former fish market site. (There is already a letter of intent from the city allowing HHC to propose redevelopment of the fish market buildings.) 
That would be a mistake. What's needed, says SOS, is to protect all city-owned properties in the neighborhood from private redevelopment and devise an overall plan for them, one that could (and should) recognize the value of a rebuilt and permanent indoor market. 
Thursday's hearing is the public's only opportunity for public comment on this issue, although there are other ways to voice opinions; see the New Amsterdam Market's home page.
I asked LaValva, who puts quotation marks around his title of New Amsterdam's "president" but who is the right person to move the project forward, what he wanted to see happen. First, he said, there should be an impartial study of the best use of the area's city-owned assets. Meanwhile, he wants a five-year license for New Amsterdam Market to operate in the parking lot in front of the Fulton Fish Market site. 
"Within that five-year period," he said, "we'll prove our viability and develop a plan to rehabilitate the Fish Market site." The alternative would be a grave error, he says, one that might result in the loss of "what is arguably one of New York's most unique and irreplaceable public assets."

It is an incredible asset, with wonderful potential that dwarfs even that of the High Line. In its prime, the Fulton Fish Market was a vibrant, economically important part of the city, surrounded by restaurants, retailers and processors. No one who visited it - especially on dark, frozen dawns, or in the summer when the sun rose early over the East River - will ever forget it. [2] Especially with the renovated Fulton Street Station building, the New Amsterdam Market would draw New Yorkers and visitors in droves, as Borough Market does in London and Pike Place in Seattle. 
Which makes it in the interest of HHC to support this project, both verbally and financially. (The city might even make this part of the bargain, given the incredible dealthe developers are getting.) Because we can find groovy retail just about anywhere, but to find a really fantastic indoor food market, we have to go to Philly. 
1. The Essex Street Market, where my grandmother and mother shopped - as I do occasionally - is among them.
2. I was first there in the late '50s, on a school trip to the market and one of its famous restaurants, Sloppy Louie's. I never stopped going, or loving it.

HEADLINE: Election of a Pope Tests Betting Markets

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: If the papal odds are less reliable than the odds on, say, sporting events &#8211; which have a very good overall record &#8211; they still may be the most useful publicly available predictions. 

 BODY:
Intrade may have shut down, but the election of a pope still offers a good chance to study the predictive value of betting odds. Eight years ago, when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ascended to St. Peter's throne, the oddsmakers looked prescient: he was the favorite, or a co-favorite, in several places. Thirty-five years ago, the bookies - and, by extension, the wisdom of crowds - did much less well: Cardinal Karol Jozef Wojtyla, soon to become Pope John Paul II, was nowhere among the favorites.
This time, the favorite is Angelo Scola, the archbishop of Milan, as he was when we last checked in with the betting markets on March 4. A 71-year-old Italian with an intellectual bent, Cardinal Scola has a chance of between 25 percent and 33 percent of being elected, according to various oddsmakers. 
But after Cardinal Scola the oddsmakers' choices have shifted a bit. Cardinal Odilo Pedro Scherer, of Brazil, who was in ninth place with just 6 percent odds a week ago, is now just behind Scola, with a 22 percent chance, based on the odds at Paddy Power on Tuesday night. 
Then comes Cardinal Peter Turkson, of Ghana, with a 15 percent chance; Cardinal Marc Ouellet, of Canada, at 11 percent; Cardinal Sean O'Malley, of the United States, at 9 percent; Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, of Italy, at 7 percent; and Cardinal Christoph von Schönborn, of Austria, at 7 percent. Oddschecker.com has a fuller list - updated frequently - with even longer shots, although it lists the odds as betting lines rather than as percentages. (The odds also add up to more than 100 percent, so it is probably reducing each of the above odds a bit.)
There are no polls of the 115 cardinals who will be making the decision - at least no public polls - and no other variables, like economic growth, with a clear record of predicting the winner. So everyone following the conclave, from mildly interested observers to bettors to observant Catholics, is left to piece together fragments of information, much of it of dubious quality. 
"What public info is there to aggregate?" asks Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, who has studied prediction markets. Even the odds on Oscars winners seem likely to be more accurate, he added: "It's both a larger set of voters - large enough that they aren't voting strategically - and the info they are using is very public.While we've seen the best movies, few of us have read the writings, or attended the sermons, of the various cardinals."
But if the papal odds are less reliable than the odds on, say, sporting events - which have a very good overall record - they still may be the most useful publicly available predictions. As this blog hasnoted in the past, pundits and high-profile experts generally have an abysmal record with forecasts. Louis Menand, writing in The New Yorker in 2005, summarized some of the research, much of it by the psychologist Philip Tetlock. "People who make prediction their business - people who appear as experts on television, get quoted in newspaper articles, advise governments and businesses, and participate in punditry roundtables - are no better than the rest of us," Mr. Menand wrote. 
The last two papal elections are good examples. Shortly before the 2005 conclave, CNN.com wrote:
Betting firms and local media are backing Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany, who gave John Paul's funeral oration, but history advises punters to beware of favored candidates.
At lunchtime Tuesday after three ballots to pick the next pontiff, Ratzinger remained favorite on two out of the three online betting boards, with Intertops giving him the shortest odds at 5/2.
Ratzinger was a 11/2 second favorite for Dublin, Ireland-based Paddy Power and 9/2 favorite at Britain's William Hill. Nigeria's Francis Arinze led with Paddy Power on 7/2.
French cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger was third for Paddy Power (6/1) and also for William Hill (11/2) who put Arize second at 5/1.
Making up the top six in all three lists were 78-year-old Italian Carlo Maria Martini; his successor as the archbishop of Milan, Dionigi Tettamanzi and Claudio Hummes of Brazil.
Experts, though, seemed less solidly behind Cardinal Ratzinger. On the one hand, Laurie Goodstein and Ian Fisher of The Times called him the "central figure" entering the conclave, with more initial support than anyone else. On the other hand, the writer Michael Brendan Dougherty said on Twitter on Tuesday morning, "Although he seemed obvious after the fact, very few Vatican watchers gave Ratzinger a shot."
In 1978, neither experts nor oddsmakers foresaw the outcome. From the Aug. 11, 1978, edition of The Catholic Herald:
Ladbrokes opened the book on the election of the new Pope naming Cardinal Pignedoli favourite at 5-2. Cardinals Baggio and Poletti were joint second favourites at 7-2 with Cardinal Benelli fourth at 4-1. Also strongly fancied were Cardinal Willebrands at 8-1 and Cardinal Koenig at 16-1. Cardinal Hume was quoted at 25-1. The longest odds quoted were 33-1 [for] Cardinal Suenens.
In fact, Cardinal Wojtyla, archbishop of Krakow, won on the eighth ballot.
This time, the experts and oddsmakers seem to agree that Cardinal Scola is the favorite, but they don't agree on all of the second-tier favorites. A survey of Vatican watchers by YouTrend listed Cardinal Timothy Dolan of the United States as the second most likely pope, followed by Cardinals Ouellet, Scherer and O'Malley. Cardinal Luis Tagle, of the Philippines, was sixth. A couple of the oddsmakers' favorites, including Cardinals Turkson and Bertone, do not appear on the YouTrend list.
To be sure, experts aren't always less wise than crowds. A few Supreme Court experts did a better job forecasting last summer's health care decision than prediction markets did, and their success did not appear to be merely a matter of chance. Those experts managed to read some of the signs around the court in the weeks leading up the decision. The odds on the prediction market, by contrast, did not react to the signs at all. 
Similarly, during the 2012 election, poll analysts arguably did a better job than prediction markets or oddsmakers. 
A conclave is precisely the sort of event that can play to experts' strengths. As with the health care decision, experts have the potential to collect useful information that isn't available to the public. Of course, having the potential to do something and actually doing it are two different things.
