HEADLINE: Gene Tie to Male Violence Is Studied

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Scientists have identified a tiny genetic defect that appears to predispose some men toward aggression, impulsiveness and violence, a discovery that is likely to rekindle the harsh debate over the causes of criminal and abnormal behavior.
Researchers emphasized, however, that the finding was thus far limited to a single large family, and that the inherited illness was likely to be quite rare in the general population. 
 Nevertheless, scientists said the discovery counts as a persuasive advance for human behavioral genetics, a field that has lately been in disarray as previous announcements of genes for manic-depression, schizophrenia and alcoholism have either been disproved or come under withering criticism.
In the new work, researchers from the Netherlands and the United States studied a large Dutch family with a history of erratic and often hostile behavior among some, but not all, males in the group. Those afflicted often react to the most mildly stressful occasions with aggressive outbursts, shouting at, cursing or assaulting the person they deem a threat.
 
Intelligence Found Low
 At other times, the men have committed arson, attempted rape and exposed themselves in public. In addition, their intelligence is on the low end of normal, with an average I.Q. of around 85 to 90.
The researchers have linked the abnormal behaviors to mutations in the gene responsible for the body's production of monoamine oxidase-a, an enzyme critical for breaking down chemicals that allow brain cells to communicate. The scientists do not yet know the exact mechanism of the disorder, but they propose that lacking the metabolic enzyme, the brains of afflicted men end up with excess deposits of potent signaling molecules like serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline. Those surplus neurotransmitters in turn stimulate erratic, often hostile conduct.
"A human behavior like aggression is very complex," said Dr. Han G. Brunner, a geneticist at University Hospital in Nigmegen, the Netherlands. "But our study shows that in certain instances a biological factor clearly influences the behavior." Dr. Brunner is the lead author of the new report, which is appearing Friday in the journal Science.
Comparing the monamine oxidase-a genes in 5 afflicted and 12 nonafflicted males of the family, the scientists found a difference in only a single biochemical building block among the thousands that make up the gene, a type of defect called a point mutation. In each case, those who showed a predisposition to aggressive, impulsive behavior had the mutation, and those who did not show such symptoms lacked it.
 
Skin Cells Affected
 Biochemical analysis of the men's skin cells also showed a severe deficiency in the essential enzyme.
"Other studies have implicated biological and inherited factors" in aggression, Dr. Brunner said. "This is the first that actually pinpoints a specific gene and a specific mutation within that gene."
The gene is located on the X chromosome, which explains why only males, with their single copy of the X chromosome, can suffer from the enzyme deficiency. Women can serve as carriers of the genetic defect, but are themselves protected from its symptoms by their possession of a second, good copy of the gene, sitting on their second X chromosome.
The researchers do not yet know how many people worldwide may suffer from the enzyme deficiency, but based on other types of hereditary disorders, they estimate that defects in monoamine oxidase-a are likely to afflict no more than 1 in 100,000 people.
 
'A Rare Disorder'
 "What this paper does is give harder data to aggressive behavior in some people," said Dr. Emil F. Coccaro, director of clinical neuroscience research at the Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. "But this is a rare disorder. It ain't the gene for all those people who are committing murder left and right."
Dr. Markku Linnoila, the scientific director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda, Md., said: "This is an important step in understanding the biological determinants of human behavior. We learn by looking at extremes -- that's where the pay dirt is. Once you're able to make these kinds of findings, you look to see how it generalizes to the wider population."
Dr. Xandra O. Breakefield, an associate neurogeneticist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Charlestown and an author of the new report, cautions that even in a seemingly straightforward case like an enzyme disorder, the spectrum of the afflicted men's behaviors cannot be explained by a single genetic defect alone.
"Different members of the family behave differently," she said. "Some are functioning quite well, and one is married, has children and a job. Obviously how this syndrome is manifested as a behavior depends on many factors." She suggested that the finding could result in new therapies for the disorder, either drugs to help metabolize neurotransmitters, or a change in diet to prevent buildup of the chemicals.
 
Criticism of 'Aggressive Genes'
 Studies of the genetics of aggression and violence have fomented much acrimony among researchers and academics, some of whom see the research as disguised racism or attempts to reduce complex social and economic problems to a measurable blot on a laboratory X-ray. Last year a political uproar prompted the National Institutes of Health to cancel a conference scheduled to be held at the University of Maryland on the genetics of violence and criminal behavior.
Even Dr. Brunner emphasized that he and his colleagues had not set out to seek the genetic causes of aggression, but rather were responding to a request from a member of the Dutch family who already had done enough investigations on his own to conclude there was some hereditary abnormality at work in his bloodline.
Dr. Jonathan Beckwith, professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston and a critic of much research in behavioral genetics, complained that the latest study, like others before it, failed to define aggressive behavior in sufficient detail.
"It's been a long-term problem in this area, an insufficient characterization of the behaviors you're looking at," he said. "That's one reason why there have been so many announcements of genes that have later been retracted. There's often a lot less here than meets the eye."

HEADLINE: Amtrak to Cut Back Service On 3 Lines to Save $10 Million

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Amtrak announced today that it would reduce service on three passenger train routes and shut 15 ticket offices on Nov. 4. The cuts will save $10 million a year, it said.
The rail line is forced to cut service because it is not receiving an increase in Federal subsidies this year, as it requested, to offset declining ticket sales, said a spokesman, Howard Robertson. 
 These routes will be scaled back:
*The Pioneer, which has operated daily between Chicago and Seattle through Denver and Portland, will have only three runs a week west of Denver, departing Denver and Seattle on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday.
*The Texas Eagle, between Chicago and San Antonio-Houston, will run three times a week instead of daily south of St. Louis. The train that goes beyond St. Louis will depart Chicago on Sunday, Tuesday and Friday and San Antonio-Houston on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.
*The River Cities train between Kansas City and New Orleans will effectively be eliminated as Amtrak cuts out stops in St. Louis and Carbondale, Ill. Instead, Amtrak will provide nonstop buses between St. Louis and Centralia, Ill., that will connect with trains. Also, train service to Belleville, Ill., on the River Cities run will be dropped.
The rail line delayed a decision on eliminating three commuter trains on its Harrisburg-to-Philadelphia route. Amtrak is seeking financing from Pennsylvania.
Ticket offices will be closing in Delray Beach, Fla.; Pocatello, Idaho; Centralia, Ill.; Chillicothe, Ill.; Mattoon, Ill.; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Hattiesburg, Miss.; McComb, Miss.; Malta, Mont.; Southern Pines, N.C.; Devils Lake, N.D.; Amsterdam, N.Y.; Youngstown, Ohio; Temple, Texas, and Cheyenne, Wyo.
Trains will continue to stop at stations where ticket offices are being closed. Passengers with reservations can buy their tickets from the conductors on the trains for which they have reserved seats, but passengers without reservations would have to get their tickets in advance from a travel agent or at an Amtrak ticket office elsewhere.
The closings of these ticket offices, combined with a staff reduction at ticket offices in Johnstown, Pa., and North Philadelphia, will eliminate the positions of 33 ticket agents, Mr. Robertson said. "We will try where possible to put those people elsewhere," he said.
For further savings, Amtrak wants to eliminate 149 other positions this year but has not decided which ones, Mr. Robertson said.
Amtrak, with 25,000 employees nationwide, will get $351 million from the Federal Government this fiscal year, the same as it received last year but less than the $381 million it requested.
Amtrak revenues for the 1991-92 fiscal year were $1.3 billion, down from $1.4 billion the previous year. Figures for last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, have not been compiled.
The decline could be attributed to "everything from the recession, the airline deals, to the strike" against the railroad in July 1992, Mr. Robertson said.

HEADLINE: More Signs of a Productive U.S.

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Contrary to a widely held view that the United States is an industrial has-been whose productivity in manufacturing has been surpassed in some other countries, a new study concludes that for manufacturing as a whole, the United States still holds a significant edge over the presumed world standard-setters, Germany and Japan.
The yearlong study -- by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, together with three of the nation's top experts on productivity including Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics -- combined research into nine industries with a wide array of available statistics. 
 While other studies have also found that the United States was still the world's productivity leader in manufacturing, the new study provides a more detailed look at individual industries.
Productivity, or output per hour worked, is the ultimate yardstick of an economy's competitiveness. It determines a nation's material standard of living as well as its standing among nations.
 
Explaining the Disparities
 Perhaps the most provocative findings concern the probable causes of the productivity differences that do exist. It concludes that in industries where the United States has fallen behind, the reasons have more to do with how goods are produced than with the skills of workers or the quality of technology.
"If the United States is lagging behind Japan in certain manufacturing industries, it doesn't appear to be because of the failure of our schools or technology," said Martin Baily, a University of Maryland professor, who helped direct the study. "We haven't put enough effort into organizing the workplace and designing products so that they are easy to manufacture."
Others versed in the field welcomed the McKinsey effort. "A couple of economists in some dingy room can cook up anything," said John A. Young, former chief executive of the Hewlett-Packard Company and chairman of President Ronald Reagan's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness. "This draws on McKinsey's incredible network of people in the field who can do a little sanity check on the numbers."
The study, a sequel to a McKinsey report last year that found that American service industries had a large productivity lead over the German and Japanese industries, challenges the view of some influential economists -- from Lester Thurow of M.I.T., author of "Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, Europe and America," to Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chief of the Council of Economic Advisers -- who have argued that American manufacturing has been overtaken by German and Japanese industries.
"There's a lot of conventional wisdom swirling around here that's turning out, by and large, just to be wrong," said Bill Lewis, director of the McKinsey Global Institute in Washington, and a former Assistant Secretary of Energy in the Carter Administration.
The study also suggests that losing leadership in a particular set of industries -- cars, steel, consumer electronics -- does not preclude first-rate economic peformance or, for that matter, high living standards any more than a student with A-'s and B+'s would necessarily be less able than one who has a mixture of A+'s and D's.
"In the heads of a lot of people, there's a consumer-electronics theory of economic welfare," said Francis Bator, a Harvard University economist, who advised the research team. "It's nonsense."
The advice the report proffers runs counter to the conventional wisdom, and boils down to doing what the United States -- as opposed to Europe and Japan -- has already been doing: Where you lag, open your borders -- not just to imports, but to transplants; where you lead, set up shop in the countries of the laggards.
"You can make theoretical arguments about managed trade," Mr. Lewis said, "but the evidence that we found, for the first time, is that the more open you are, the more productive you become. On the U.S. side, the proof is the renaissance of the U.S. auto industry."
McKinsey's comparisons of individual industries show that the United States is by no means the most efficient producer of all products: Japanese output an hour is 15 percent to almost 50 percent higher in cars, car parts, machine tools, consumer electronics and steel.
Germany's productivity, which is half to three-fourths this country's in half a dozen industries from cars to beer, is equal to the United States' in steel and machine tools.
But these industrial powerhouses trail so far behind in some other industries -- packaged food in Japan, beer and cars in Germany -- that, measured in dollars of comparable purchasing power, the average Japanese or German factory worker produces $8 worth of goods in the time it takes an American worker to make $10 worth. The comparisons are based on case studies of nine industries that account for about a fifth of United States manufacturing.
In Japan, for example, a worker in the highly protected and fragmented food-processing industry -- which employs more workers than the auto, computer, consumer-electronics and machine-tool industries combined -- produces $39 worth of food in an hour, compared with an American counterpart's $119.
"What makes the Japan-U.S. comparison for manufacturing as a whole so much in the U.S. favor is that food production is such a large business in Japan and is so primitive," Professor Bator said.
 
Quality Beyond Technology
 The study suggests that a lack of leading-edge technology is less important than some suggest. Brewers in Germany, for example, are far less productive than Japanese or American beer makers. But the reason is hardly that the Germans lack the technology. The more efficient American and Japanese brewers use machinery imported from Germany.
Nor is lesser technology necessarily the difference in cars. General Motors, for instance, poured billions into robots and other glitzy technology, while Toyota and other Japanese manufacturers placed less emphasis on a high-tech approach and concentrated on how they trained, organized and motivated workers.
McKinsey's prescription for raising productivity -- to expose manufacturers to head-to-head competition with Japan, Germany or whoever is No. 1 in an industry -- raises hackles among American advocates of industrial policy.
The Europeans, said Stephen S. Cohen, co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy, "would be foolish to resist pressures to insulate themselves."
"They don't need more pressure," he added. "They don't have to take the same bloodletting"
But Professor Baily has a different perception. "We keep hearing policy makers say 'We've got to protect,' as if Americans got no benefit from going through all this pain and agony," he remarked. "Our industries today are in much better shape. Our view is that the evidence -- particularly from Germany, which hasn't allowed that kind of competition -- suggests that you should let the winners and losers emerge."

HEADLINE: Tokyo Journal;
Red-Light District, Fortunes Dimmed, Is Gloomy

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 21

 BODY:
When the Tokyo Metropolitan Government opened a big commercial complex this year next to a warren of peep shows, strip clubs and massage parlors known as Kabukicho, it was regarded as a cleansing shaft of light that would refurbish the hard-bitten area.
The new building had well-lighted plazas, a hospital, a large health club and a store that symbolizes the purer virtues of fresh air and good clean fun to Japanese as well as Americans -- L. L. Bean. 
 It was a noble idea, but the experiment in clean living is receiving a decidedly mixed welcome in this city's best known red-light district.
"It's too bright here now," moaned Isoji Mochizuki, manager of the tiny Hotel Villa Shinjuku, a "love hotel" along a once-dark alley where rooms are let by the hour. "People never come during the day and at night it's too lit up now. We're demanding that at least they plant some trees to block all that light."
 
Lamenting a Loss
 The looming complex is just one sign that all is not as it used to be in Tokyo's Tenderloin. The air is still redolent of stale beer most evenings, as hawkers in dark glasses cluster in the shadows, ready to pounce with pictures of doe-eyed beauties and promises of a good time.
Mercedes-Benzes with heavily tinted windows -- the calling card of organized crime groups, known as yakuza -- continue to patrol the alleys between the garishly appointed clubs and stalls selling freshly grilled eel and prawns.
But whether it is aggressive property developers, the growing fear of AIDS or, worst of all, an influx of foreign prostitutes and Asian gangsters, many Kabukicho die-hards are lamenting the loss of simpler times. It is coming as a rude shock that the underside of Japanese society is proving as vulnerable to the economic and political dislocations under way here as the Parliament and giant corporations.
"On the surface this has become a much more healthy place," complained Naoyuki Ogawa, the owner of American Crystal, a so-called private room massage club.
"But now you see people from the Taiwan mafia or the Southeast Asian mafia," he added. "The new competition has actually made this a more dangerous area. We've had more assaults on pachinko parlors and other shops. It's not like the old days when the yakuza believed in peaceful prosperity."
 
A Still-Thriving Industry
 Kazumi Suzuki, deputy head of the Shinjuku Police Precinct, the ward in which Kabukicho is situated, put it more bluntly. "It's almost all foreigners now engaged in prostitution," he said. "The customers are more and more foreigners, too."
Although prostitution is technically illegal in Japan, the "pink industry," as it is known, thrives in all its myriad forms in Kabukicho. There are clubs with booths where women fondle the customers and "soaplands," where men get a good scrub and other services.
While hard-drinking businessmen are the mainstays of the clubs, young people throng to the many cheap pubs. In the older alleys of closet-sized bars once favored by artists and writers, wandering musicians serenade patrons with accordions and traditional ballads.
The nearby Shinjuku train and subway station, whose many recesses fill up at night with homeless people, is as crowded at midnight as in the afternoon rush hour.
 
Keepers of the Peace
 Kabukicho is the successor to the famous old pleasure quarters of Tokyo -- once known dreamily as the "floating world" -- that have been an integral part of life here for hundreds of years. In the eyes of some, it is no less essential today, providing a safety valve for the white-collared minions in the pressure-cooker known as Japan Inc.
Even the gangsters in jade green or royal blue suits, who control the nights in this area of western Tokyo -- a stone's throw from the huge new city hall -- have long been accepted as keepers of the peace.
Mr. Ogawa proudly brandished his membership card to the new health club and said he was not among those who objected to the complex. It is called Hygeia, a play on a word incongruous in the area's sunless, cramped streets -- hygiene.
"Among my friends many wanted to join this club, but since it's in Kabukicho they wondered if the other members would be, you know, scary people," he said. "But it's mostly just ordinary salarymen."
Meanwhile, across the street sits the crumbling building that houses the Kabukicho merchants' association.
 
How the Change Began
 Change began in a small way in the early 1980's when a law was introduced requiring that clubs close at midnight. Not all do, but it meant that the area slowed down in the early morning hours, squeezing profits. As some clubs went under, fast-food restaurants moved in. Today, among the brightest lights in Kabukicho are those of McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Haagen-Dazs.
The two-year-old recession and another law that took effect last year cracking down on the yakuza have put a further dent in business. On top of that has been the influx of other Asians, from Taiwan, China, South Korea and Southeast Asia.
Many came during the boom years of the 1980's, when Japanese shunned undesirable work, whether it was on road construction gangs or in massage parlors. The yakuza then began to import Asian women, at times forcibly and under brutal conditions. But without realizing it they opened the way for other Asian gangs, too. The result has been yet more competition for a shrinking pie.
Mr. Ogawa has sought to turn back the clock in his own way. His approach is stamped in big letters on the front door of his club, "Japanese Only!"
"That's so people can know it is safe," he said. "I don't want to sound like I'm prejudiced. I know some foreigners are wonderful people and that they don't have AIDS. But once we let one in I'm worried about how we would control things. My customers have to be comfortable."

GRAPHIC: Photo: Kabukicho is a strip in Tokyo where business hours start at dark and hotels rent rooms by the hour. The boom of the 1980's included Japanese shunning undesirable work and the opening in Kabukicho of Hygeia, left, a brightly lit complex with a health spa, a hospital and an L. L. Bean store. Now, the Tenderloin district is steeped in competition as the parlors compete for a piece of a shrinking pie. (Haruyoshi Yamaguchi for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Watching the Bottom Line, Investors Trim 8.94 Off the Dow

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Investors took most of their cues yesterday from reports of third-quarter earnings, creating small ripples throughout the stock market that failed to converge into big waves.
Most of the broad indicators zigzagged through the session in a narrow range, though a sharp drop in bond prices touched off a selloff of blue chips just before the closing bell. 
 Despite two snippets of favorable economic news, the market again seemed hesitant as investors warily considered the record gains of recent weeks. They shrugged off a cut in interest rates by the German central bank and a positive report on the economy from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
 Instead, they scrutinized the balance sheets of companies like Computer Associates, which rose 4 7/8, to 38, after it said its profits jumped in the last quarter. Another strong performer was Tandy, which shot up 4 7/8, to 40 1/2, on news that its earnings were higher than expected.
"It really is a case of if you have the good numbers, you do well," said Dennis E. Jarrett, chief market analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company. "The direction of the market in most cases was almost immaterial. People are cautious. They are not anxious to dive in."
 
Computer Stocks Benefit
 Declines in the blue chips -- particularly in the stocks of companies whose earnings are sensitive to the health of the economy -- were offset by gains among small and medium-sized companies, which had plunged earlier in the week. Computer, media and tobacco stocks were among the market's standouts, while telecommunications, transportation and chemical issues suffered.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 8.94 points, to 3,636.16. It had been mostly even in midafternoon, but then was hit by news that the Treasury's 30-year bond yield had shot up to 5.91 percent from 5.82 percent. Higher interest rates often hurt stocks because they make the return on bonds more attractive relative to equities.
 
Mixed Indicators
 Other indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down 0.71 point, to 465.36. The American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.93 point, to 477.52. Ending a three-session losing streak, the Nasdaq composite index rose 3.03, to 771.28.
Big Board volume was 289.6 million shares, down from 307.2 million shares on Wednesday. Declining stocks outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9.
Most active on the New York Stock Exchange was WMX Technologies, the waste-management company, which dropped 1/8, to 23 7/8. The stock plunged 4 7/8 on Wednesday after the company reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings.
Circus Circus Enterprises, which also fell hard Wednesday because of lower income, continued its decline, dropping 7/8, to 38 1/4. Philip Morris rose 7/8, to 52 3/4, rebounding from losses earlier in the week.
After reporting an earnings turnaround, Sears, Roebuck rose 1, to 59. Mobil was up 1/8, to 80 5/8, on third-quarter profits that rose 40 percent. American General was down 2 1/8, to 29 1/2, on heavy volume. It posted third-quarter income of 55 cents a share, down from 63 cents a year earlier.
Dow Chemical fell 2 1/2, to 56 3/8, on news that its profits had fallen 9 percent.
Technology issues again dominated the Nasdaq. Microsoft was off 1 1/2, to 79 1/2, on trading of nearly four million shares. Its earnings, reported Wednesday, were slightly better than expected, but analysts expressed concerns about prospective growth.
Apple Computer increased 2 1/2, to 30 1/4, and Intel rose 1 3/4, to 64 1/2.

Dole Tries To Rein In President, But Slips

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
In foreign policy as in domestic policy, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas can play good cop / bad cop with President Clinton.
As a good cop, Mr. Dole has offered to work with the Administration to overhaul the health care system, and he helped orchestrate a compromise resolution on Somalia last week that averted a collision between the President and Congress. 
 But just as Mr. Dole spoiled Mr. Clinton's honeymoon with Congress by leading the filibuster that killed his plan to stimulate the economy, he offered another challenge this week by proposing a resolution that would have placed strict limits on the President's military options in Haiti. Only this time he misstepped.
As the Senate minority leader, Mr. Dole serves as Mr. Clinton's loyal "speed bump." But the Kansas Republican is also positioning himself for a possible third run for the Presidency. That means he must compete with Senator Phil Gramm, the highly partisan conservative Texan who is already crisscrossing New Hampshire, while trying to avoid the image that Democrats try to pin on him as the Darth Vader of gridlock.
"When running for President, the safe place is right of center," a senior Republican Senator said. "There's a lot of Gramm versus Dole in this."
Mr. Dole usually plays his balancing act with skill, but this week he stumbled a bit in his attempt to fine-tune the President's wavering policy in Haiti. On Sunday, without first consulting other senior Republicans, Mr. Dole announced he would introduce a resolution that would have obliged Mr. Clinton to seek an authorizing vote from Congress before deploying troops in Haiti.
The Dole proposal included a big loophole, by which the President could have filed a formal certification stating that American lives or national security interests were imperiled before invading the country. But Mr. Dole was clearly throwing down a challenge to the President's authority, saying that trying to restore Haiti's deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was not worth a drop of American blood.
The Republican leader found himself in the unfortunate position of being a general with too few troops, and he quickly backed off. He offered to negotiate with the White House, and in three days of talks he watered down his proposal into a weaker, nonbinding Sense of the Senate.
Before the Senate agreed to the resolution today by a 98-to-2 vote, Mr. Dole told his colleagues on the Senate floor that he was trying "to help the President of the United States." In an interview afterward, he said: "The President did get the message. I think it will be a cold day in July before American troops are sent there."
Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton effectively struck a truce on foreign policy when they each agreed to support the compromise resolution on Haiti, as well as a similar resolution inspired by the Republican leader calling for but not requiring Congressional authorization for the deployment of troops in Bosnia.
But while White House officials praised Mr. Dole for his willingness to compromise, a number of Republican lawmakers found fault with the Senator's handling of the Haiti issue. Speaking on condition that they not be identified, they said he misjudged the sentiments of his Republican colleagues and proposed a constitutionally questionable resolution for what appeared to be political reasons.
The senior Republican Senator said Mr. Dole had "overcompensated" for his recent moves to the left in supporting Mr. Clinton on Somalia and backing the health care proposals of Senator John H. Chafee, the Rhode Island Republican who is seeking a compromise with the Administration.
Mr. Dole's positions on the two issues put him at odds with Mr. Gramm, whose approaches were more finely tuned to the majority in the Republican Senate caucus and to Republicans who vote in primaries.
The senior Republican , who is normally a strong supporter of Mr. Dole, expressed disappointment that after fighting off Democratic attempts to hamstring the foreign policies of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Mr. Dole would now try to do the same against Mr. Clinton.
"Bob probably did not anticipate that people like me would object to his well-intentioned move on constitutional grounds," said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Speaking of the original Dole proposal, he added: "If it had passed, it could have come back to haunt us. It would have set a dangerous precedent."
Expressing the view of several Republicans, Senator Conrad Burns of a Montana said, "You got to ask, How would I vote if my guy was in the White House?"

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN TRAIL;
Ammunition in Tax-Rebate Scare

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

 BODY:
With little warning, debate has been rekindled over New Jersey's homestead tax-rebate program -- a touchy subject with one of the most powerful groups in the electorate: the elderly.
Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, a Republican, charged yesterday that the administration of Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, had either manipulated or mismanaged the distribution of this year's rebate checks and touched off what the Speaker described as panic and anger among thousands of elderly people. The tax rebates are sent annually to homeowners and tenants. 
 "It appears thousands of them have gotten homestead rebate checks in the mail but have been told they cannot cash them at the bank and if they spend the money, they will have to pay it back," Mr. Haytaian thundered during a news conference.
"A suspicious man might think the Governor mailed out the checks deliberately so they could yank them back at the last moment, infuriate senior citizens just days before the election and place the blame on Republicans," Mr. Haytaian said. "I think there is something sinister about the timing and the handling of the rebate checks."
Mr. Haytaian's accusations brought swift countercharges from the Democrats.
"Mr. Haytaian's motivation is painfully obvious," said the Assembly Democratic minority leader, Joseph V. Doria Jr. "He desperately wants to obscure the fact that they cut the rebate program last year and he wants to alarm senior citizens for political gain."
The dispute begin when the executive director of the State Office of Aging in Warren County, Mr. Haytaian's home, sent a letter to thousands of county residents age 65 or older, who only days before had begun receiving rebate checks. The letter advised them: "Don't cash your homestead rebate check!!!"
The letter cited a recent New Jersey Tax Court decision that certain groups of people were no longer eligible for the tax rebate: tenants living in government-subsidized housing, including developments for people with low incomes and the elderly, and tenants living in a dwelling that is exempt from property taxes.
Some bank officials, acting on their own, stopped honoring the rebate checks, and signs went up at numerous housing complexes and group homes for the elderly warning residents not to cash their checks.
 
Brady Endorses Democrats
 James S. Brady, the White House press secretary who was wounded in 1981 during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, went to New Jersey yesterday to endorse Mr. Florio and Democratic legislative candidates.
Mr. Brady calls himself a "staunch Republican" but said he supported Mr. Florio and the Democrats because of their positions on gun control and their defense of the state's ban on semiautomatic weapons.
Polls have shown that New Jersey residents overwhelmingly support the weapons ban, one of the toughest in the nation. But the polls also show that gun control is not one of the major issues in this year's election.
Nevertheless, Mr. Florio and the Democrats have pressed the issue and Mr. Brady's visit today was part of that campaign strategy.
Since he was wounded March 30, 1981, Mr. Brady has become one of the most outspoken advocates in the nation for gun control through his Washington-based lobbying organization, Handgun Control Inc.
 
Support From Black Clergy
 Mr. Florio picked up a much more significant endorsement yesterday from black clergymen who represent nearly 700 churches.
Both Mr. Florio and Mrs. Whitman had eagerly courted the Black Ministers' Council for its endorsement and had met with members of the group several times since September to explain their positions on minority judgeships, contracts, public education, employment and the economy.
"Our main priority was not whether the candidate was Democrat or Republican, but which candidate is best for our constituency," said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, pastor of St. Matthew A.M.E. Church in Orange and a spokesman for the council. "After hearing, reading and questioning the candidates we have concluded that for us, the best candidate is Jim Florio."
Both candidates have focused tightly on middle-class and suburban voters and avoided direct references to exclusively urban issues. The large urban centers, with mostly black populations, typically vote Democratic. But many blacks have talked of disappointment with Governor Florio over the relatively small number of minority appointments as judges and prosecutors.
Even though some ministers voiced concerns about Mr. Florio, Mr. Jackson said the council was more troubled by Mrs. Whitman's inexperience and platform, most notably her tax-cut plan and her advocacy of a school voucher program.
 
G.O.P. Assails Clinton Visits
 Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, weighed in yesterday with criticism that Governor Florio's campaign was not footing the bill for trips to New Jersey by President Clinton and others who had stumped for the Governor. "We want to make sure they play by the same rules as everybody else," Mr. Barbour told reporters in Washington, echoing complaints already made by Mrs. Whitman.
The chairman said he was particularly incensed by Attorney General Janet Reno's recent trip to New Jersey. "We have a tradition in this country that goes back at least a generation," he said. "The Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General do not campaign."
The Florio campaign has insisted that most of the trips were for official business, and thus should not be paid for by the campaign. To underscore his point that the trips were blatantly political, Mr. Barbour showed a video tape of Roy Neel, the Deputy White House chief of staff, telling the Democratic National Committee recently that Mr. Clinton was traveling to New Jersey to help out Mr. Florio.

HEADLINE: Revolution in Lawyers' Fees: The Meter Is Being Shut Off

BYLINE: By MARGOT SLADE

 BODY:
It has been the bedrock of the lawyer-client relationship for decades: the billable hour. Lawyers have charged for their services by the hour, many with little inhibition about the number of hours accumulated, and clients have paid, often without a second thought.
But now the ground is shifting in response to increased competition among law firms and to diminished revenue among law firms and clients alike. And that shift, particularly in corporate law, has begun to bury the hourly rate. Cost-cutting alternative billing schemes are on the rise, and in some cases firms are even being forced to bid for corporate business. 
 The tremors of this change, first felt a few years ago, are now rippling through law firms from coast to coast.
 
Fixed, Capped or Contingent
 "Clients are talking about fixed fees, capped fees, fee estimates, contingent fees and discounts," said Blane R. Prescott, a partner with Hildebrandt, a management consulting company based in Somerville, N.J. "They want to see a budget, something that will give them a better idea in advance of what a law firm's services will cost. They want to discuss that budget and how it was developed."
Given a glut of lawyers and a dearth of clients, Mr. Prescott said, "clients are getting what they want."
Others who monitor the legal profession agree. Although there is no comprehensive national survey to buttress their view or to document the extent of savings for clients, "anecdotal evidence and our own recent, small-scale survey confirm the trend that we perceived: law firms increasingly moving to alternative billing approaches at clients' request," said Richard C. Reed, who is a consultant at Altman Weil Pensa, a Philadelphia-based legal management consulting firm, as well as chairman of the American Bar Association's alternative billing task force.
Those alternatives are a central element of an accelerating revolution, driven mostly by clients, in the way the nation's law firms do business. It is, industry analysts say, a cultural revolution that puts a premium on serving clients, not racking up hours, and on producing quality work, as clients define it: work that places an emphasis on timely performance, efficiency, risk-sharing between the firm and its clients, and the firm's willingness to discuss how cost estimates were arrived at.
Although the revolution is being powered by the muscle of corporations -- those Goliaths of law firm clientele -- some benefits are trickling down to David as well. Particularly in estates, trusts and other areas of family law, where the preparation of documents is increasingly automated, individual clients can frequently obtain services for a fixed fee.
 
Performance Criteria Change
 To clients, the sea change promises value for money. To law firms, it underscores efficiency as a requisite of long-term client relationships. And to individual lawyers within those firms, it brings a shift in performance standards.
In firms that embrace the new approach, partners are rewarded for their marketing and management abilities, "especially for their talent in pricing legal services and supervising legal projects," said Ward Bower, a principal at Altman Weil Pensa. And associates, he said, are "judged on how effectively and efficiently they serve clients, as against how many hours they record."
One benefit of all this is that an associate who is trying to balance family and career, for example, can be judged on something other than hours billed, said Peter D. Zeughauser, vice president and general counsel of the Irvine Company, a real estate development concern in Newport Beach, Calif.
The "down side," Mr. Bower said, is that as law firms turn leaner, they will need fewer lawyers; in the wake of vast numbers of layoffs that have already resulted from a weak economy, even more associates may be finding themselves out of jobs.
"Our object is to procure the right quality of legal services in the most cost-effective way," said David Grimes, vice president and director of administration in the legal department of the Bank of America. "And by 'quality' we refer to a law firm's ability to establish a relationship with us, to know us and the risks we are willing to take in any document or transaction, its willingness to work with our in-house staff and to work within a budget."
And what of firms that demur? "Frankly," Mr. Grimes said, "we don't use them."
 
$600 an Hour
 It was not always that way. Law firms long dictated the quantity, the quality and the price of legal service, and the price that many of them set was high: most recently as much as $500 or even $600 an hour.
The price had to be high, in order to cover the overhead generated by expansionist policies of the 1970's and 80's. To meet a swelling demand for their services, firms had gone on spending sprees, bringing in so-called "rainmakers" (partners with a knack for luring clients), hiring new associates, investing in technology and expanding not only into larger offices but also into other cities.
As their cost of doing business rose, firms compensated by increasing their billing rates and their hours, often by throwing hordes of young associates at a project and charging for the time of each. The legal industry called this "leveraging"; clients frequently called it overstaffing.
"Two things were central to making money then: how many hours you produced and how many people you could employ," said William C. Cobb, president of Houston-based W.C.C.I. Consultants, which specializes in strategic issues facing the legal industry.
 
Effect of Recession
 But law firm control of the legal services market was doomed, and, as a consequence, so was the unchallenged pre-eminence of the billable hour. By the late 1980's, the supply of lawyers was up but the amount of their business down, a result of a nagging recession and corporate clients' cost-cutting, especially through the increased use of in-house legal departments.
It was a buyer's market, and the buyers were balking at what they considered overstaffing of cases and high hourly fees.
In addition, some law firms hit up against what Mr. Reed, the A.B.A. task force chairman, calls the "productivity paradox."
"The advent of advanced technology, such as computers, minimized the number of human hours needed to generate legal work," he said. "Lawyers realized that if they charged only by the hour, they would earn less."
With revenue down, costs up and their profit margins squeezed, an increasing number of law firms have been developing alternative billing strategies. "And they are using market-based pricing -- based on the value a client is likely to place on a particular service -- rather than the time-and-materials approach of cost-plus pricing," said Mr. Bower, the Altman Weil executive.
What clients value, he said, are efficiency, on-time delivery, predictability of expenses and pricing that is competitive, even if that does not necessarily mean inexpensive. "There are, for example, 'you bet your corporation' cases," Mr. Bower said, "in which the situation is so severe that the client doesn't care what the legal work costs; all that matters is winning."
"In this sense, legal services are like health services," said Robert C. Buenger, marketing director at Bryan Cave, a St. Louis-based law firm with a diversified corporate practice. "Everyone wants managed health care to contain costs, until they get sick. Then they want the best care, regardless of costs."
 
Sharing the Risk
 Even these clients, however, may want to spread the risk of cost overruns and bad outcomes, Mr. Zeughauser said.
"Law firms are notoriously poor at forecasting how much it will cost to accomplish a particular task; they generally low-ball it," he said. "Capping fees and refusing to pay over a certain amount shifts that risk to the firm. Law firms are also bad at predicting the likelihood of a bad outcome, especially in litigation. Relying on a contingent fee, in which the lawyers profit from a good outcome and share in a bad one, shifts that risk, too."
To further contain legal costs, Mr. Zeughauser said, his company has forced competition for its business. "We've gone from one law firm, which supplied 90 percent of our legal services, to 35 firms," he said. "We've even invited law firms to submit bids on particular business." The result, he said, has been a saving of 25 to 75 percent in costs, depending on the given service.
No matter what alternative strategies they pursue, "what law firms should not do, if they want to survive, is play the part of the old buffalo hunters," said Mr. Cobb, the W.C.C.I. president. "When buffalo become scarce, buffalo hunters can come up with a better way of hunting, they can hunt something else, or they can nurture the buffalo they have. Buffalo hunters cannot sit in bars waiting for the buffalo to return on their own. They won't."

MOBIL CORP. (N)

 BODY:
The Mobil Corporation said yesterday that its 40 percent rise in third-quarter operating profit was the result of higher international oil production, strong margins in refinery operations, and increased sales of its petroleum products.
These gains, as well as a rise in natural-gas prices and increased oil production in Nigeria, more than offset a $4-a-barrel drop in worldwide crude oil prices, to the lowest level in five years. 
 Allen Murray, the company's chairman, commented, "Mobil had very good operating earnings, considering low worldwide crude oil prices and sluggish economic activity in several key industrialized regions."
He added, however, that the low oil prices and weakened demand would make a continuing rise in profit difficult for the company, the nation's second-largest oil concern. Mobil is based in Fairfax, Va.
Earnings from operations were better than analysts had predicted. Mobil said its net earnings rose just over 61 percent. Net income included a gain of $53 million, primarily from income-tax-rate reductions on deferred tax balances in Britain, Germany and Singapore.

HEADLINE: Tax-Credit Financing to Aid In Building Housing Units

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
New York City should get enough money from a Federal tax-credit program to help build at least 6,000 new housing units for the poor over the next five years, housing advocates said yesterday.
Earlier this year a delay in Congressional renewal of the tax-credit program slowed scores of public-private housing projects throughout the city that had been depending on the money. But in August the program was made permanent as part of the Clinton budget package, paving the way, proponents said, for even greater participation from corporations. The program allows corporations to donate money toward a fund to build housing in exchange for reductions in their Federal tax bills. 
 Two organizations -- the Enterprise Foundation and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation -- plan to announce tomorrow that they will make a five-year, $300 million commitment to building low-income housing with the help of the tax-credit program. They estimated that the fund would be able to pay for 6,000 units, 1,000 more than in the previous five years.
 
Rebuilding Housing
 Acting as partners in managing the program with the city, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and the Enterprise Foundation distribute the tax-credit money to local community groups. These groups, selected for their organizational skills and commitment to their neighborhoods, then develop the housing.
Since 1987, 35 corporations, including American Express, the Bank of New York, J. P. Morgan, Con Edison and Republic National Bank, have invested $201 million in the housing fund. The program has helped rebuild housing in Harlem, East New York in Brooklyn, and the South Bronx, in many instances serving as a catalyst for neighborhood revitalization.
So far, corporations have been donating at a greater rate than before, with $71 million having been pledged to the equity fund since the tax credit was made permanent in August. In 1988, the first year the tax credit was in operation, corporations contributed $22 million.
Paul S. Grogan, president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, said the Clinton Administration's decision to make the tax credit permanent has increased its attractiveness to donors.
"Making the tax credit permanent sent a message of stability to corporate investors," Mr. Grogan said. "In the past some corporations would not consider participating, or made very small investments because of the cloud of instability that hung over the tax credit when it had to be renewed each year."
Nationally, Mr. Grogan said, the tax credit is expected to result in the construction and rebuilding of from 120,00 to 125,000 units a year.
In New York, the tax-credit money will give a major boost to one of the city's most successful low-income housing production programs. Since 1987, the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development has rebuilt more than 30,700 apartments, and the tax-credit money has paid for about some of the cost of rebuilding about one-third of these apartments.
Most of the units have been carved out of abandoned buildings the city has taken from owners because of tax delinquencies. Of the apartments rebuilt with tax-credit money, 30 percent are set aside as permanent housing for homeless people.
The tax-credit financing can also be used for operating expenses, social services and day care.
The two groups plan to announce the program with the Federal Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry G. Cisneros, and a number of other prominent Democrats from New York and Washington.

HEADLINE: Blast Prosecutors Making Case, Shard by Shard

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
A piece of a brake drum, some shreds of burned tire, a hinge with flecks of yellow paint, the twisted wreckage of a wheel, pieces of manifold and an alternator -- these were among the items displayed to the jury yesterday as prosecutors, testing the patience of the judge and risking losing the attention of the jury, continued, slowly and methodically, to build their case against the four men accused of blowing up the World Trade Center last Feb. 26.
The prosecution's theory, outlined in the opening statement of the chief prosecutor, J. Gilmore Childers, when the trial opened three weeks ago, is that the bomb was brought into the underground parking garage of the trade center in a yellow Ford Econoline van that had been rented three days earlier at a New Jersey Ryder rental agency by one of the defendants, Mohammed A. Salameh. 
 And so, for the last week, 20 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, all of whom searched through the bomb wreckage at the World Trade Center, have testified so that surviving parts of the vehicle, or of the explosive device itself, can be put into evidence.
 
A Glacial Pace
 But so far none of the Federal agents, or any of the other 27 witnesses who have testified, have explicitly linked the scraps and shreds of metal and rubber to the yellow Ryder rental van. That fact, and the glacial pace by which the evidence is accumulating, led Judge Duffy at the end of yesterday's session to the rare gesture of advising the prosecution on how to get to the point a bit more quickly, presumably before the jurors' minds begin to go numb with the monotony of it all.
"I'm not running anybody's case," Judge Duffy said. "But might I suggest to the Government that what you do is get the guy in here from Ford or wherever and get him to say that all of this spells whatever it spells."
Despite his evident impatience, however, Judge Duffy overruled every objection made by the defense to stop the prosecution from introducing yet another shard, said to be from the Ryder van, or from showing it to the jury.
And so, during the course of the day, four witnesses, including three from the F.B.I. and one from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, were prompted by the prosecution to tell the jury what they or other members of the search teams found in the wreckage, and exactly where it was found.
 
Standard Courtroom Prop
 First up was David Symons, a nine-year veteran of the F.B.I. who said his job as a member of one of the teams searching through the rubble left behind by the blast was to tag the evidence found by other members of his team. Mr. Symons sat at the witness stand with a half-dozen pieces of wreckage arrayed in front of him, which he identified as a piece of a vehicle manifold, a piece of a flywheel, a generator, a pulley part and part of a pump.
The next witness, John Goetz, an Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent from the agency's Philadelphia office, examined a large number of other items that the prosecutor, Henry DePippo, wearing the pale yellow work gloves that have become a standard prop of the courtroom routine, pulled from a large plastic evidence bag.
There was a piece of tire, a piece that he said came from the steering mechanism of a vehicle, a latch from a trunk or a hood, part of a radiator, another part of a tire, and a piece of metal frame with the word "Ford" stamped on it.
The other witnesses produced additional, very similar evidence, leading Judge Duffy, at the normal midafternoon coffee break, to quip: "We're taking our break now because the coffee is hot. Anybody who's been watching will understand the need for that coffee."
What causes the proceedings to unfold at so glacial a rate is not just the prosecution's apparent determination to present what Judge Duffy grumpily called "every shard." It is not even the studied colorlessness of the prosecutors. It is the need to pass through the same series of steps which, taken together, produce a kind of humdrum courtroom choreography.
 
And Then the Gloves
 Each witness gives a bit of his background, especially his training in post-blast investigations. The prosecutors, taking objects out of plastic bags or battered cardboard boxes, ask each witness to identify each object. The witness then looks at pictures and affirms that they are "fair and accurate representations of the objects."
Next, the witness puts a small, round, colored sticker on a floor plan of the World Trade Center showing approximately where each object was found. By now, the floor plan, mounted on an easel, looks like something that might be found in a modern art gallery, with dozens of little splashes of yellow, green and red highlighting the gray background of architectural drawings.
Finally, Judge Duffy tells the jurors to put on their own pairs of yellow work gloves so the smaller pieces of evidence, and the pictures of the same objects, can be passed among them without danger of injury. The evidence makes its slow way to all 12 jurors and five alternates while the rest of the courtroom watches and waits, the defendants staring impassively ahead of them, Judge Duffy resting his head on his open hand, courtroom observers fidgeting.
Cross-examination also follows a similar pattern, with the defense lawyers generally trying to demonstrate that the witnesses do not really know what the shards of evidence really are, exactly who found them, or where they were found, and certainly that they do not know what vehicle or vehicles they came from.

HEADLINE: Critic of Weicker Joins Race for Governor

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Comptroller William E. Curry Jr., a Farmington Democrat and a frequent critic of the Weicker administration, today announced his candidacy for governor.
Mr. Curry, 41, a former state senator, is the third Democrat to enter the race. Last month Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican turned independent, announced that he would not seek a second term. Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, an independent who ran with Mr. Weicker, has decided to try to succeed him. 
 Mr. Curry has spent much of his political career challenging the political establishment and espousing liberal viewpoints. He said today that he wants to restore the electorate's faith in government. He contends that faith has waned as the state's economy slumped, crime increased and the quality of public schools deteriorated.
The two other Democratic candidates for governor are the Senate president pro tem, John B. Larson of East Hartford, and State Senator Richard J. Balducci of Newington, the former House Speaker.
On the Republican side, former United States Representative John G. Rowland, the party's gubernatorial nominee in 1990, is expected to make another run for the office. Secretary of the State Pauline R. Kezer, the only Republican to win a statewide office in 1990, also is considering a bid.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
CATERPILLAR INC. (N)

 BODY:
Powered by an 18 percent jump in domestic sales, Caterpillar Inc. reported yesterday that its third-quarter net income from operations was $96 million, far ahead of the year-earlier quarter's $5 million and the $50 million to $65 million generally projected on Wall Street.
Caterpillar also booked a $300 million after-tax benefit from settlement of a long-running dispute with the Internal Revenue Service and a one-time $36 million tax credit, lifting total net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 to $432 million. 
 The strong domestic performance by the world's largest construction equipment company offset a 3 percent decline in overseas sales, which account for roughly half of Caterpillar's business. Overall revenues, including those from financial services, grew to $2.85 billion.
Caterpillar said that the outlook for sales in North America and developing countries continued to brighten but that the recession in Europe and Japan was lingering.
Analysts said the third-quarter results pointed to expanding profit margins and growing domestic market share.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
A Skittish Market Sells Off Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market sold off across the board yesterday as traders and investors worried about the possibility of faster economic growth and higher inflation.
But the lesson was not that interest rates are moving sharply higher. Nor was it that the economic fundamentals of sluggish growth and low inflation, which have underpinned this year's bond rally, have changed significantly. Rather, it was that the market will continue to be volatile and easily rattled, even by what are normally considered second-tier economic reports. 
 With long-term interest rates at the lowest level in 25 years, traders and investors have become cautious. Every day they wonder if interest rates have finally hit bottom. And they are vulnerable to any news that might make them reach that conclusion.
 
Three Waves of News
 Yesterday, the news came in three waves, though none was the kind of news that usually affects bond prices. Still, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 113/32 points, pushing up its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, to 5.91 percent from 5.82 percent Wednesday.
Among the news, the German central bank surprised most market analysts by cutting two key interest rates by half a percentage point. The Lombard rate fell to 6 3/4 percent while the more important discount rate dropped to 5 3/4 percent.
That made some people wonder if interest rates would start to fall even faster in Europe, which would mean that the recessions there could end much sooner than expected. That, in turn, could mean more demand for American exports, helping economic growth here, possibly sparking higher inflation. It was a long chain of reasoning linked by a lot of ifs, but it was enough to prompt selling when, as one trader said, "the bond market is looking for excuses to sell off."
John R. Williams, managing director of global economics at the Bankers Trust Company, said, "There is just a growing view that maybe the global economy is about to turn up a bit," though he added that he does not agree with this view.
A second factor was the surprising report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Its index of regional economic conditions jumped to 15.1 in October from 0.7 in September. Some analysts, like Raymond Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., believe this index gives a good hint of how the index of the National Association of Purchasing Managers will behave for October. Mr. Stone said the Philadelphia index points to a jump in the purchasing managers index to 53 or 54 in October from 49.7 in September.
He also said that the employment index in the Philadelphia index rose sharply, pointing to the possibility of an overall increase in manufacturing jobs in October, which would be the first rise in seven months.
"If it is a harbinger of stronger manufacturing growth it is something to worry about," Stephen Slifer, financial market economist at Lehman Brothers, said.
The last factor was new concern in the market that the October report for the Consumer Price Index will show an increase of three-tenths to four-tenths of one percent. The index was unchanged in September.
But the reason for much of that rise would be the adjustments made in the index to smooth out the regular seasonal fluctuations in prices, which means that the underlying rate would not be increasing. Still, given the tentative nature of the market right now, it was solely the prospect of a higher C.P.I number rather than the explanation on which many traders and investors focused.
The report that initial claims for state jobless benefits rose by 6,000, to 350,000, in the week ended Oct. 16 had little impact on the market, traders said. It was the second consecutive weekly increase and reflected applicants who were switching from an expired Federal program.
 
Treasury Notes
 The prices of Treasury notes also declined yesterday. The price of the 10-year note fell 24/32 as the yield rose to 5.32 percent from 5.23 percent the day before. The yield on the two-year note rose to 3.84 percent from 3.82 percent.
In the when-issued market, the two-year notes to be auctioned by the Treasury on Tuesday yielded 3.91 percent, up from 3.86 percent, while the five-year notes to be sold Wednesday yielded 4.74 percent, up from 4.67 percent.
 
Municipal Bonds
 In the municipal market, Goldman Sachs & Company won the competitive bid for $424.3 million of Florida Board of Education general-obligation bonds. The bond due in 2018 was priced to yield 5.17 percent, with an after-tax yield of 8.08 percent, while the bond due in 2023 was priced to yield 5.242 percent, with an after-tax yield of 8.19 percent at the top rate of 36 percent.

HEADLINE: Adventures in Daveland (and Not Just at Night)

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
SOMETIMES television viewers begin to think of the characters they watch as real people. Psychologists have a term for this. The viewer, they say, has entered into a "parasocial relationship" with the figures on the small screen.
The psychologists do not have a term for what has happened to the people who work near the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway and 54th Street in Manhattan, the new home of "Late Show With David Letterman." 
 Like a Nebraska farm family that calmly enters a spaceship manned by aliens, the neighborhood residents, over the last several weeks, have given up their allegiance to normal, daily life and signed onto Letterman reality. They may seem to run businesses or work 9-to-5 jobs. But they are actually waiting for the rapture: the arrival of a Letterman crew and the five minutes of needling from Dave that will transform them, for Letterman watchers across the country, into fictional characters.
The guys at the Bagel Cafe on the corner of Broadway and 54th? Yes, they've been on the show. And Rupert Jee, manager of Hello Deli on 53d Street, took a standing ovation at center stage a few weeks back.
"Saw you on TV," said a woman waiting in line at the cash register on a recent afternoon. "You were great."
Mr. Jee thanked her.
"You're not going to be on the show tonight, are you?"
Mr. Jee thought it over. "Who knows? Maybe. You can't tell around here."
"Here" is Daveland, a tiny, very strange theme park that occupies, at the moment, Broadway between 53d and 54th Streets, and stores around the corners, heading west, on 53d and 54th Streets. The area runs on Letterman time. In the morning, tourists in twos and threes peer into the theater's glass doors. Some check out the stores that have achieved that special Letterman brand of fame: they've been ridiculed by Dave.
By noon, fans hoping to get one of the 50 standby tickets available every day line up on Broadway to be assigned a number, then disperse until later in the afternoon. At the same time, the first of 350 ticket holders begin lining up on 53d Street.
The curious can sample a new dish, polenta a la Letterman, at Il Teatro restaurant, or browse the Letterman Lizard Lounge in the Pet Department Store. At McGee's, a pub right next door to the theater, they can behold Dave's hat from the NBC days behind the bar. If they look across the street and upward, they can see "Hey, Dave!" signs in the office building at 1700 Broadway. (They can also enter the New David theater, but this is not an official stop on the Dave tour. It predates the show, and it shows X-rated gay films.)
Rock America, a souvenir store, has already become legendary. A Letterman camera crew wandered in during a recent show so that Mr. Letterman, back in the studio, could check out the merchandise, which included a $4.99 magnet with a photograph of Mr. Letterman in a University of Michigan T-shirt, as well as a T-shirt ($19) and sweatshirt ($44) with the "Late Show" logo in gold on a deep blue background, just like the theater marquee. (Mr. Letterman ignored the front window, which has a fake copy of The New York Times with the headline "Rock America Store Names David Letterman #1 Sexiest Showman in America!") In the end, Mr. Letterman ordered a photo I.D. card. Keumsoon Lee, the owner of the store, seemed to find this natural. "After all, he's a neighbor now," she said.
The store retains the name Rock America, but to millions of viewers it's really The Place Where Dave Bought His I.D. Card. Out-of-town visitors now wander into Ms. Lee's store to relive the experience.
"The goofier a person he can get to talk to, the more time he'll spend," said Hank Freid, the general manager of the Ameritania Hotel around the corner from the theater on 54th Street. "He spent a lot of time at the souvenir shop."
Mr. Letterman has also waved the magic wand over Academy Clothes, a tuxedo boutique that, like several other stores in the area, more or less signed onto the show without being asked.
In the doorway of the store is a list: "Top 10 Reasons to Shop at Academy Clothes." The reference is to a stock Letterman bit. The Academy's list, in full:
10. Free receipt with every purchase.
9. We give good tailoring.
8. All measurements are politically correct.
7. You'll like our material.
6. Our jackets are well hung.
5. Barneys is way across town.
4. No cover. No minimum. No MSG.
3. We'll teach you how to pronounce "cummerbund."
2. Free mambo lessons.
1. Dave window-shops here.
Despite Nos. 8 and 4, which show signs of effort, it's pretty clear that the writers of the show have not been moonlighting.
Fame can strike suddenly. On the show's first exploratory walk around the new neighborhood, the camera crew set up outside Academy Clothes. Bart Dadon, an owner of the store, stood in the doorway to watch what he thought would be a man-in-the-street interview. Suddenly, the camera swung in his direction and began to advance. He was the man.
From the studio, Mr. Letterman inquired about the merchandise. Mr. Dadon showed him a flashy sequined jacket. Mr. Letterman offered him $100 to wear it into the subway.
"I jumped at the chance," said Mr. Dadon. "And he made good on it, too." Mr. Dadon said he split the windfall with his tailor, Enrique Standard, whom he described as "my Ed McMahon."
The Letterman encounter has heightened Mr. Dadon's profile considerably. "I've done five radio interviews," he said. "There's been a tremendous response. People from as far away as Honolulu and Mississippi have stopped in here. I look forward to him picking on us for years to come."
 
Bids for Attention
 Neighborhood residents know that any one of them could be next. New Yorkers are not a shy people, and there are signs of serious struggle to gain Mr. Letterman's attention.
At 1700 Broadway, the office tower across the street, several windows have signs of the sort usually seen at baseball parks. One reads: "Hey Dave, Best Damn City, Best Damn Show, Best Damn Haircut."
"They're Meg wannabes," said Mr. Dadon, somewhat contemptuously, referring to Meg Parsant, who worked in the Simon & Schuster building across from the old Letterman show on NBC, and achieved celebrity when Mr. Letterman began calling her for on-the-air chats.
Some bids for attention show a little more initiative, like Il Teatro's polenta dish, for example, a tour de force that involves shaping polenta into tapered ovals that refer to the CBS eye and topping them with three seafood components in different colors: salmon Dijon (yellow), red snapper marechiaro (pink) and shrimp and scallop scampi (white).
"As succulent, tasty and sophisticated as the Late Show With Dave!!" read the letter that accompanied the polenta and assorted dishes that the restaurant sent over to the show soon after it was broadcast for the first time on CBS on Aug. 30.
The letter is displayed outside the restaurant in a glass case along with a thank-you note from Mr. Letterman.
"We expect that any day he's going to review us and put us in the show," said Steve Vucetaj, the maitre d'hotel. Mr. Vucetaj also mentioned that his business was up between 30 and 40 percent as a result of the show.
 
Improved Streets
 That's another reason to love Dave. Hello Deli now feeds Letterman crew members during lunch and after the show. In addition, the line for the show snakes down 53d Street, right in front of the deli. That has meant lots of drop-in traffic.
"This block totally changed," said Ms. Lee of Rock America. "We had problems before with thieves and robbers, even schoolkids who shoplifted. That's all stopped."
Most shopkeepers agree that things are looking up. More foot traffic means more customers, or at least potential customers. Wholesome Letterman fans now outnumber the louche characters who once found the area attractive.
McGee's now enjoys the patronage of Letterman crew members and many members of the studio audience, who pile in after the show is taped. People waiting in line often run in for a quick one.
"A lot of people in the neighborhood now think it's the place to be," said Martina Meegan, a bartender. "They all want to know: does he come in here, and what does he drink," she said.
Well, what does he drink? "He hasn't had anything to drink in 12 years," said Ms. Meegan, "but Paul Shaffer makes up for it. He drinks Remy."
Some customers put in bids on the Letterman hat behind the bar. (It's a baseball cap with the old "Late Night" logo.) Ms. Meegan has received offers in the neighborhood of $50. "I have one just like it at home," she said, "so if the price goes up, I may bring it in."
 
A Letterman Suite?
 Mr. Freid at the Ameritania does not mind taking credit for the economic upswing. "I think we had more of an impact than he did," he said. "Before we bought and renovated the hotel, it had a lot of undesirable people living in it, and people were afraid to walk on the street. I don't think the Letterman show would have moved here if we hadn't come in."
The Ameritania has been a little slow to capitalize on the proximity of the Letterman show. Its display of enthusiasm is limited to a tasteful blue-and-gold sign above the now-famous bagel shop that reads, "Ameritania Hotel Welcomes David Letterman Late Show." That's it. The hotel's clientele is almost entirely European, and it seems that the Statue of Liberty is higher on their list than Mr. Letterman.
There is no David Letterman Suite.
"Actually, that's not a bad idea," said Mr. Freid. "We could say something like, 'Laugh yourself to sleep with Letterman.' It's something to think about."
The Letterman boom has also given the more creative criminal types an opportunity. At the Pet Department Store, for example, a couple raced in and demanded 30 T-shirts with dogs on the front, saying that they were needed immediately for a photo shoot on the Letterman show. Eager to oblige, the store put together the order and then got stuck with a fake credit-card number.
Pro-Letterman feeling still runs strong at the store, however. In addition to creating the Letterman Lizard Lounge, an attractive corner with assorted reptiles in terrariums, the store has allowed its star poodle, Pupper, to do two promotions for the show, once wearing a Harley-Davidson jacket and motocycle cap with visor.
"We're also giving away a month's supply of dog, cat, lizard or fish food to any pet that can hold a Letterman cigar in its mouth long enough for a photo shoot," said Leigh Applebrook, the store's owner.
 
Not Everyone Is a Fan
 It's a fairly safe bet that Mr. Letterman will not be strolling into Santino Photo Electronic, a camera and electronics store a few steps away from the studio. The late-night show has many fans, but Sasson Elo, manager of Santino Photo, is not among them.
"Basically, I hate the man, O.K.?" he said.
The roots of Mr. Elo's enmity run deep, and in several different directions. First there's the snub. "We spent $400 to put out a banner welcoming him," he said, "and he never visits. That's rude."
Then there are the people in the line. "They're cheap," said Mr. Elo. "They don't buy." Even worse, he said, they get bored, come in his shop and waste the time of the salesmen.
Then there's the line itself. Mr. Elo hates it. It used to run in front of his shop and, he said, scared off customers. CBS has since moved the line from Broadway to 53d Street, which Mr. Elo concedes is an improvement.
It's not clear that a visit from Mr. Letterman would help at this point. "We're here 20 years," said Mr. Elo. "Who's Dave? Dave is nothing to us."
But he's everything to just about everyone else in the area. "They shot a guy from a cannon right on the street there the other day," said Mr. Jee at Hello Deli. "It used to be like a ghost town here. Now the job is more like play than work."

HEADLINE: Big Board's Open Positions on Short Sales Drop

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Even though stock prices are high and merger activity is strong, the number of shares sold short and not covered on the New York Stock Exchange fell this month, the Big Board reported yesterday.
The 2.8 percent drop, to 1.19 billion shares, came on the heels of a 12 percent rise in short interest in September, the biggest gain in recent years. 
 On the American Stock Exchange, however, sentiment that prices are at inflated levels grew stronger. The Amex said that short interest rose by 8.7 percent, to 100.9 million shares. The October total is the second-highest monthly short interest in the history of the exchange, surpassed only by the 104.5 million shares sold short in August.
The short-interest figures for both the New York and American exchanges covered trades during the month that ended on Oct. 7.
Short-sellers borrow shares and sell them. Much of the heavy short-selling reflects bets that share prices will decline, enabling the seller to repurchase the shares at a lower price, repay the lender and pocket the difference in price.
Some market averages on the Big Board, including the Dow Jones industrial average, posted modest declines during the period covered. But market participants said they were not surprised that short interest fell.
"My own reading is that interest rates have come down so much and there is so much money moving into equities that a lot of people who are typically fairly bearish at a time like this have to concede the market is strong," said Don Morken, a general partner at Genesee Investments in Seattle. "In that sort of a situation, you want to get out of the way, and unwind your short positions."
In addition to betting on a decline in prices, shorting is also used to speculate on the success of a merger involving stock swaps.
For example, The New York Times Company showed the largest increase in short positions this month, leaping by nearly 56 percent, to 9.26 million shares. In September, the company completed its purchase of Affiliated Publications, owner of The Boston Globe, for more than $1 billion, most of it in stock.
"To lock in a profit, arbitragers bought Affiliated stock and shorted the New York Times," said Susan L. Decker, a publishing and advertising analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in San Francisco.
Speculators used the same technique with shares in Merck & Company, which has agreed to acquire Medco Containment Services for stock and cash.
Short interest in Merck rose by more than 2 million shares this month, to 25.7 million shares, the largest short position of any stock on either the New York or American exchange.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
A President Like Us

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Like all Presidents, Bill Clinton is just a human being, the same as the rest of us. The trouble is that he is acting like it.
Most human beings are quick to take credit when things go well, wriggle out of responsibility when they go wrong, talk big, act small, try to bluff their way out of trouble and look put upon when cornered -- oh, the injustice of it all. 
 But we do not elect Presidents to be just like the rest of us. We want them to be better, stronger, wiser. When we are disappointed we go back to the booth in hope and belief, which are the grace and salvation of America.
In his conduct of foreign policy, on which American safety rests, Mr. Clinton is letting us down, and himself. The Administration weaves, rationalizes, blames everybody in range. The world notes every time.
The Administration is not heading for a crisis of confidence at home and abroad, but is already in it.
For weeks, I avoided writing those paragraphs. I hoped something would happen to prove them wrong or badly overstated.
I am not particularly solicitous about elected officials, but neither do I regard them as existing exclusively to provide journalism with daily targets. And like most Americans I am weary of failed or boring Presidents and want this one to make it.
But the Administration has become embarrassing. Mom, it was the U.N. that did it. Mom, that mean Secretary General is making faces at me. Mom, it was the American people, look how pale they get when American blood is spilled.
No. The U.N. did nothing that the U.S. did not approve in Bosnia, Somalia or Haiti. Washington acts as if it does not understand perfectly well that the U.N. cannot do anything important unless the U.S. agrees.
In Bosnia, I am against U.S. military intervention. But Washington arrived at that decision after avoiding the leadership responsibility -- to say yea or nay, without marbles in mouth or brain. It is still mumbling.
On Somalia, pretend it was U.S. troops who were the first to be ambushed and slaughtered, not Pakistanis. Pretend that the U.S. called for help, and Pakistan sent troops, who thereupon took casualties.
Right away the Pakistanis said they were not simply getting ready to pull out but meantime were not going to share street patrol duty with Americans. Would Americans still see Pakistanis as reliable allies?
(Speaking of credit: Henry Kissinger coolly saw the problems the new President was inheriting in Somalia and wrote them in his column before Mr. Clinton was even inaugurated.)
On Haiti, why did the U.S. even think of sending in soldiers armed only with sidearms to train thug "police" who itched to kill them? Why could not U.S. intelligence do better than send word that there was a one-in-three chance that goons would riot against the troops?
Mr. Clinton is giving cynics an ax-handle against his own decent human rights policy. Supporting human rights does not mean sending in the troops every time, or underarmed troops any time.
As for Americans, more than any nation they have been ready to bleed for others. But they are not morons and now ask why, how long, how much. In neither Bosnia, Somalia nor Haiti did Mr. Clinton tell them.
If Americans turn too inward, who encouraged them? A political hired hand hung that foolish and boorish sign -- "it's the economy, stupid" -- in his office. But it was his boss who hung it up over the whole country.
The Clintonians were right to support Boris Yeltsin, unless you prefer Pamyat or Communist hacks. In the Mideast they did not act as Arab apologists. But wisely they did not become more Israeli than the Israelis and question the Labor Government's risk-taking.
These intelligent decisions, however, do not override the belief in the U.S. and abroad that the Administration is confusing and ineffective on foreign affairs. That encourages enemies to close in for the kill and friends to feel sorry for Mr. Clinton -- both dangerous trends for any President.
He can still get himself out of the crisis of confidence. All he has to do is admit error, accept blame, take responsibility, quit behaving put upon, as if Americans were supposed to keep him happy, not the other way around -- altogether, just stop acting so damned human.

HEADLINE: Can't We Afford a Little Music in Our Lives?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I went to see the Martha Graham Dance Company last week. The dancing was superb and this heightened my sadness and distress at having a third-row seat, perched above an empty orchestra pit, listening to the music pumped through a rather tinny sound system at New York's City Center. The music is an integral part of the dance and I find this state of affairs appalling.
At first I thought my reaction was the embittered response of a musician struggling to make a living in one of the many American orchestras that hover at bankruptcy's gate. But upon reflection, I think that any educated listener would respond as I did. 
 Without drastic changes in our priorities, the situation will only get worse. Music programs in the public schools throughout this country have been slashed to shreds. Last week in Albuquerque, N.M., voters overwhelmingly defeated a proposal to build a performing arts center, although the $10 million needed for construction was already in place, waiting. Now they have to figure out what to do with the money.
While Broadway grossed a record-breaking $327.7 million in 1992, the newly ratified contract for musicians working on Broadway has the potential to offer less work to musicians and raises questions about the future of live music in musical theater. It is more than a depressed economy we have to contend with in all these situations.
As both a performer and a listener, I have experienced wonderful excitement, chills and tingling up and down my spine at great moments in live performances. Never have I experienced this sensation from listening to a synthesizer or a stereo. Thrill seekers, unite: why should we deprive ourselves of one of life's greatest pleasures?

New York Leads

 BODY:
To the Editor:
" 'Art' Is No Luxury" (editorial, Oct. 14) makes short shrift of New York State financing for the arts. 
 New York leads the country in state support for the arts. The New York State Arts Council's $26 million to local arts groups is more than six times the national average -- and an increase of 14 percent from last year. Beyond that, just this year, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo stepped in to rescue the New-York Historical Society, restoring its financial health while preserving its vast store of priceless art, artifacts and historical documents.
New York's Natural Heritage Trust was allotted nearly $11 million this year to finance organizations like the Guggenheim Museum, New York City Ballet and symphony orchestras in New York City, Buffalo, Syracuse and on Long Island. Our state and city university systems offer academic degrees in fine arts and performing arts to allow the talents of tomorrow to flourish.
The state budget includes nearly $230 million to help pay the salaries of the more than 10,000 music and art teachers in our elementary and secondary schools. And the state will spend $2 million this year to finance the Empire State Plaza Performing Arts Center and the New York State Theater Institute.
Certainly, the Council on the Arts has shared in the spending cuts that have been required since 1989 to keep the state budget in balance. Those cuts spanned the spectrum of government services -- from college financial aid, to health care for the poor and elderly, to layoffs and salary freezes for state employees.
Your linkage of arts financing to Governor Cuomo's efforts to retain the Yankees is odd. Like the arts, sports franchises contribute to our economy. New York City's Comptroller recently estimated that the Yankees generate $150.9 million in annual economic activity. What Governor Cuomo has proposed is an investment that would keep those dollars in New York City, rather than lose them entirely.

HEADLINE: A Candidate's Colleagues Render a Mixed Verdict

SERIES: Giuliani: A Lawyer's Career -- A special report.

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICKwith JANE FRITSCH

 BODY:
In picking their next mayor, New Yorkers will choose between an incumbent, David N. Dinkins, whose work they have watched for four years and a challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose professional career is far less familiar. But one group of New Yorkers would seem to know Mr. Giuliani best: the lawyers who have seen him work for much of the last 20 years.
They saw him develop as a young assistant Federal prosecutor in Manhattan and watched him during his short stints in private practice. Like everyone else, they remember him most vividly from his years as United States Attorney in Manhattan. 
 They remember the energy and enthusiasm he brought to 1 St. Andrew Plaza, where the United States Attorney works. But many also wonder whether he has shed some of the impatience and intolerance they say he displayed as a prosecutor, when he routinely described those who disagreed with him as "jerks" or "babies" or "dishonest."
Even Mr. Giuliani's longtime mentor, Harold R. Tyler Jr., a former Federal judge, is not sure what to expect from a Giuliani mayoralty, and has declined to endorse him. "I don't know whether being a good lawyer translates into being a good mayor," Mr. Tyler said last week. "He does love New York, but whether that will make him a good mayor is another question."
All but the most fervent of Mr. Giuliani's detractors in the New York legal community readily acknowledge his many strong points. They say that he is smart, energetic, hard-working, decisive, incisive, innovative and inspiring to those under him.
Conversely, all but his most fervent admirers note Mr. Giuliani's shortcomings. At times, they say, he can be overly zealous, self-righteous and thin-skinned, authoritarian and press-hungry and a bit provincial, thinking he shines more brightly by surrounding himself with loyal lesser lights.
Since leaving the prosecutor's office, Mr. Giuliani has gone into a kind of professional hibernation. Though affiliated with two large law firms hoping to cash in on his celebrity, he has practiced only sporadically, largely invisibly and not entirely happily. At each firm, he left behind many lawyers believing they had inadvertently subsidized his political career.
Instead of practicing law, Mr. Giuliani has spent much of the last four years preparing for his second run for mayor. While this miffed some law partners, Mr. Giuliani's friends say it broadened and deepened his understanding of people.
Richard Parsons, chairman of the Dime Savings Bank and perhaps his most prominent black supporter, described the old Mr. Giuliani as "not the kind of person who mixed a lot in the melting pot."
But Mr. Parsons added, "The process of trying to achieve office has broadened this man. He has a greater understanding of others and consequently of himself. He's blossoming as he grows older. He may be awkward with blacks, but he's initially awkward with a lot of people. It's just a matter of getting to know the guy."
Mr. Giuliani declined to be interviewed for this article. A campaign spokesman, Richard Bryers, said Mr. Giuliani would not cooperate because, he said, coverage of him in The Times has been consistently biased.
 
Making a Name
How to Become A Household Word
 Mr. Giuliani did for the office of United States Attorney in Manhattan what C. Everett Koop did for the office of Surgeon General of the United States: he made a prestigious backwater a household word. His predecessors, good and bad, Democrat and Republican, generally left little imprint on the public consciousness. The ever-conspicuous Mr. Giuliani, by contrast, was routinely and admiringly compared to Thomas E. Dewey and Eliot Ness.
Even those without law degrees could list the hit parade of those he had convicted: the Bronx Democratic leader Stanley Friedman and others in the Parking Violations Bureau scandal; Leona Helmsley; organized crime leaders in the "Pizza Connection" case; numerous insider traders on Wall Street. Vanity Fair called him "the most dazzling prosecutor in 50 years," whose life was "a crusade to coax, shame or force people into choosing good over evil."
But to lawyers of all political stripes, the verdict on Mr. Giuliani has always been far more equivocal.
Some, particularly those who have worked for him, shared the perception that he had compiled, as an assistant, Charles Carberry, once put it, 'the best record in law enforcement of anyone without a cape." Thomas Puccio, former head of the Organized Crime Strike Force in Brooklyn -- surely the only man Mr. Giuliani both taped (during the Parking Violations Bureau investigation) and invited to his wedding -- calls him Manhattan's best Federal prosecutor in 20 years.
Edward Little, who tried the Wedtech case, recalled how Mr. Giuliani authorized him to call Attorney General Edwin Meese, for whom they both worked, "a sleaze" in his summation, then backed him up when the Meese Justice Department threatened to discipline him for it. "Everyone thinks Rudy is self-serving and political and it just isn't true," Mr. Little said. "The guy is as straight as they come, an incredibly loyal and idealistic person."
Other alumni from the Federal prosecutor's office concede that he had early successes. But over time, they say, he became a self-promoter, someone who critics say called more news conferences than all his predecessors combined, who engaged in unseemly stunts like the episode in which he and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato went undercover for a drug bust in 1986, who took credit for cases dumped in his lap or already under way, always looking to further his political ambitions.
"Giuliani focused all publicity on himself, and did so with unseemly intensity," stated a petition circulated four years ago by several alumni of the United States Attorney's office, including Michael Armstrong and Arthur Liman, along with Richard Uviller of Columbia Law School.
"Rudy is for whatever helps Rudy," said Gerald Lefcourt, a New York lawyer who battled Mr. Giuliani in the Parking Violations Bureau trial.
The critics share the sentiments of Edward Bennett Williams, the famed Washington lawyer who opposed Mr. Giuliani in an insider-trading case, who once described him as "consumed with raw power." His ambition struck Gov. Mario M. Cuomo upon first meeting Mr. Giuliani a decade ago. "Your friend Giuliani is looking for my job," Mr. Cuomo is said to have told the man making the introduction. (The Governor says he does not recall making such a statement.)
In 1989, an article in The American Lawyer based on interviews with 50 lawyers and judges said many perceived in Mr. Giuliani "an ambition so consuming that that which sustains it is embraced willy-nilly, that which does not directly feed it is neglected, and that which runs counter to it is earmarked for destruction."
E. Robert Wallach, whom Mr. Giuliani unsuccessfully prosecuted in the Wedtech case, once described Mr. Giuliani as engaging in "prosecutorial wilding": handcuffing and carting away three Wall Street traders, two of whom were later cleared; the prosecutions of Bess Myerson and Imelda Marcos, both of whom were acquitted; the prosecution and conviction of financial figures, later reversed on appeal.
Mr. Giuliani's admirers attribute many of these sentiments to sour grapes. "Let's face it, some of them are envious," Mr. Tyler said. "They tend to dislike prosecutors, particularly successful ones. I can't quite understand why, since a lot of criminal defense lawyers have never had it so good since he left."
Some admirers say that he must broaden his circle beyond the cadre of colleagues, nearly all white and male, adulatory and intellectually inferior to him, to which he has always cleaved. So sycophantic were his advisers at the United States Attorney's office that James B. Stewart, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal and author of "Den of Thieves," once wrote that others in the office called them the "Yesrudis," as in "yes, Rudy" -- pronounced, according to Mr. Stewart, "with a Southern slave accent."
But Wendeen Eolis, a New York legal consultant and longtime friend of Mr. Giuliani's, called the charge "an old, outdated misperception." She said: "Rudy's key advisers have always been smart people, and he gives them not just responsibility but the authority to go with it."
 
Starting Out
Abundant Talent And Ambition
 From the outset of his career Mr. Giuliani gave ample evidence of the legal talent, charisma and drive that carried him to his present prominence. Less clear was the degree or direction of his political commitment.
He has said that he simply missed the political and social upheaval of the 1960's, and his classmates at New York University Law School, a crucible of antiwar and civil rights activity in the late 1960's, concur. "My recollection was that Rudy Giuliani was nowhere to be found on either issue," said Norman Siegel, the director of the New York Civil Liberties Union who now supports Mayor Dinkins.
Mr. Giuliani avoided military service, as did many young men of his generation, with a series of draft deferments. After law school Mr. Giuliani clerked for Federal Judge Lloyd MacMahon, to whom he grew very close. He then became an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan, graduating quickly from routine drug cases to chief of the narcotics unit.
At the age of 29, he took over police corruption cases, earning himself top billing in the book and movie versions of "Prince of the City." He experienced another flicker of fame in the 1974 conspiracy trial of Bertram L. Podell, a former United States Representative from Brooklyn. Rattled by Mr. Giuliani's grueling cross-examination, Mr. Podell called for a halt to the questioning and pleaded guilty.
As a youthful prosecutor he kept a photograph of the late President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert on his office wall, and he voted for George McGovern in 1972. But he began to drift rightward shortly thereafter. He told Vanity Fair in 1987 that he had not felt safe with Democratic economic and foreign policy.
In 1975 Mr. Tyler, then Deputy Attorney General in the Ford Administration, hired Mr. Giuliani as an aide to help him oversee criminal matters. When Jimmy Carter became President in 1977, Mr. Giuliani moved back to New York and became a partner in Mr. Tyler's firm. Four years later, it was Mr. Tyler who recommended Mr. Giuliani, by now a Republican, for the No. 3 post in the Reagan Justice Department. The job thrust Mr. Giuliani into several disputes that, for the first time in his career, brought him unwelcome public attention.
The most notable disagreement came when he decided to drop bribery charges against four officials of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the Government's first major criminal indictment for illegal payments to foreign officials. The prosecutors handling the case, whom Mr. Giuliani did not consult, publicly expressed dismay at Mr. Giuliani's action. Mr. Giuliani excoriated them.
"As far as I'm concerned, we were watching a madman," one lawyer handling the case, Michael A. Lubin, told Mr. Stewart, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal. "It would have been a great videotape. He ranted and raved for a full 20 minutes. He just went nuts." Mr. Giuliani said at the time that his decision was correct.
During that time, Mr. Giuliani was also the Justice Department's point man on the issue of Haitian immigrants who had fled their country in leaky boats and reached Florida. The Reagan Administration, in a departure from usual practice, ordered the Haitians held at crowded, makeshift detention centers for months, sometimes years. In 1982, a Federal judge ruled for the Haitians but added that the Government had not engaged in discrimination.
In 1983 Mr. Giuliani, who had struck up a friendship with Senator D'Amato in Washington, was nominated by the Senator to be United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. His mother opposed his taking the job, Mr. Giuliani has said, deeming it a step down. But citing his love for the city, Mr. Giuliani returned to New York.
 
Return to New York
Seizing the Day, Slaying Dragons
 When Senator D'Amato selected Mr. Giuliani, there was great apprehensiveness among his future colleagues.
Some, citing the McDonnell Douglas case, feared he would soft-pedal white-collar prosecutions. Others felt he had showed disrespect for the office he was about to lead by ordering staff cutbacks and forcing his predecessor, John J. Martin Jr., to hire Kenneth Caruso, a friend and now a campaign adviser, who had already been rejected by Mr. Martin's hiring committee.
Instead there followed a frenzy of activity and a surge in morale. So successfully did Mr. Giuliani use his influence in Washington to win turf battles with other Federal prosecutors that the skirmishing all but stopped.
"I didn't want to waste my time," said Edward A. McDonald, another former Federal strike force chief in Brooklyn. "I saw which way the wind was blowing. It was clear early on that Rudy Giuliani was anointed by the Republican powers that be to come up to New York, showcase his wares and run for political office."
Those who worked for Mr. Giuliani nonetheless depict him as fiercely nonpartisan. They say he urged them to follow the credo of an illustrious predecessor, Emory Buckner: "Figure out what the right thing is to do, then do it."
Critics charged that Mr. Giuliani's deputies, largely undersupervised as he spread himself increasingly thin, came to adopt what The American Lawyer called a "macho rah-rah-let's-crush-'em-like-bugs-because-they're-probably-criminals mentality." The office's approach brought criticism from some Federal judges, including many Republican appointees. One, John Sprizzo, complained from the bench of prosecutorial overkill.
 
'A Lightning Rod'
 Appellate courts came to subject some of Mr. Giuliani's convictions to searching scrutiny, and in several cases -- notably, those of executives of Princeton-Newport and GAF Corporation -- overturned them for errors that, some believe, they might have tolerated from someone else. "By making himself a lightning rod and making a big deal of his aggressiveness, Rudy lost the courts' confidence," said Gerald Lynch, a former prosecutor now at Columbia Law School. "The close calls tend to go with the Government, but the close calls did not go to Rudy."
No one epitomizes the bar's divided feelings about Mr. Giuliani better than Paul Curran, the United States Attorney in Manhattan in the early 1970's. Mr. Curran played a major role in Mr. Giuliani's advancement. Later, Mr. Curran represented Robert Freeman, one of the three handcuffed traders Mr. Giuliani went after and the only one convicted.
Mr. Curran called that episode "a fiasco," one that gave him pause about his former deputy. He is nonetheless supporting Mr. Giuliani's mayoral bid. "I think that overall, he did a good job as United States Attorney," he said. "He made some bad mistakes and he shot his mouth off too much, but he developed some good cases and had the guts to try a big case himself."
 
Eyes on the Mayoralty
Private Practice, Public Disputes
 Amid much fanfare in early 1989 the law firm of White & Case, eager to shed its stodgy image, hired Mr. Giuliani for a reported $650,000 a year (and his assistant, Dennison Young Jr., for almost $350,000). Some partners opposed the move. One had once represented Judge Hortense Gabel, the aged, ailing jurist Mr. Giuliani had prosecuted -- and, through her daughter Sukhreet, taped -- in the Myerson case. The American Lawyer asked why a firm would lavish $1 million upon "two strangers who basically intend to use the place as a meal ticket and a mail drop."
As the 1989 mayoral election heated up, the reticent firm paid a price for its acquisition, finding its carefully guarded client list picked over by rival politicians and the press. When the election was over, Mr. Giuliani returned to the firm but produced little business. The marriage of convenience having soured, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Young quietly left the firm.
 
Looking for Glamour
 Mr. Giuliani, again with Mr. Young in tow, then went to another firm looking for glamour and new business, the firm now known as Anderson, Kill, Olick & Oshinsky, for a reported $500,000 a year. Though Mr. Giuliani immediately cost the firm at least one client -- Helmsley-Spear, Leona Helmsley's company, pulled its business within 24 hours -- he brought in others, including A.T.&T. and Willie Mays. (The former baseball player, according to his agent, loathes "egghead type" lawyers but found Mr. Giuliani "a regular guy" and considers him a friend.)
But according to some at the firm, he seemed bored with what he considered the tedium, lack of visibility and distastefulness of private practice. "How can people do this for a living?' he once asked a colleague. Another recalled how, during a conference call one Sunday, he fetched a television set and turned on a Giants-Vikings game. His happiest moments, one partner said, came on business trips, when star-struck strangers approached him at airports.
As his second mayoral bid heated up, Mr. Giuliani's productivity diminished. At a firm in which even rookie lawyers are privy to billing information, everyone knew the numbers: projected to bill 1,900 hours in 1992, he billed less than 178. According to Newsday, the firm paid him $294,000 that year. Last January, as the firm faced serious financial difficulties, two partners suggested in memorandums that he and Mr. Young be dismissed. Instead, the firm let go several more junior lawyers.
"He's definitely very self-centered and single-minded, without much of a conscience about protecting the institutions he joins," said Bruce A. Brown, who practices with the New York office of Phillips, Lytle, Hitchcock, Blaine & Huber. "If making this city the best city in America happens to coincide with his self-interest, he could be an excellent mayor."
The two took a leave of absence in May.
"We sure as hell did not make cash on Rudy," said Eugene Anderson, a founding partner of the firm. "If I had it to do over again, I'd be more realistic about politics than I was then. But I believe in experiments. And I think that over all, it was successful."

HEADLINE: Plan Opens More Data To Public

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 21

 BODY:
In the clearest indication yet of the Clinton Administration's willingness to offer broader public access to Government information, the National Science Foundation is financing a project that will make corporate filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission available free via a computer network.
The decision to support the project, which will provide access to the S.E.C.'s on-line data base of financial data from America's public corporations, is a shift away from the Federal information policies under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Those Administrations favored letting private companies sell printed and electronic versions of Government data. 
 Although the National Science Foundation project, which will be announced on Friday, is a test, it has broad implications for creating fast, inexpensive consumer access to public records of all sorts. The precedent could threaten the huge industry that has grown up to sell financial records, court cases and other public documents over services like Mead Data Central's Nexis and Lexis networks.
 
 
Available Over Internet
 The project will make disclosure of information from corporations accessible to anyone who has access to the Internet computer network through a modem or a direct network link. The Internet, a loose collection of computer networks that is administered by the National Science Foundation, is now routinely accessible from most university campuses and businesses.
"This is a priority for this Administration," said Michael Nelson, special assistant to the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology policy. "This is another indication of the Administration's commitment to make Federal information more available to the taxpayers who paid for it."
Internet access is rapidly becoming a feature of many commercial on-line computer services as well. Some 20 million computer users are connected to the Internet.
"This is a wonderful example of how the Internet might be used to provide access to Government information," said Marc Rotenberg, national director of the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a Washington public interest group.
In June, the Office of Management and Budget announced that it was reversing previous Administration policy that had defined Government information as a commodity, often available for sale to private industry. The new policy encourages Federal agencies to make as much information as possible available to the public with fees as low as possible.
The project underscores how rapidly changing computer and network technologies are making it possible to offer low-cost access to Government information that has previously been available only on paper in libraries or electronically on mainframe computers that were difficult and expensive to tap into from remote locations. But increasingly, that mainframe data can be transferred easily to inexpensive work stations.
It also emphasizes the rapidly increasing scope of Internet as the forerunner of a national data highway that is expected to carry computer data, video and voice conversations beginning in the next century.
The project, financed with a $660,000 two-year grant from the science foundation, is being undertaken by the Stern School of Business at New York University and a small Washington company, the Internet Multicasting Service. They plan to make the Friday announcement.
Currently, the S.E.C. data base, called the Edgar Dissemination Service, is operated under contract by Mead Data Central. Mead acts as a data wholesaler, providing a variety of computer data feeds to the retail information industry.
 
Commercial Charge Cited
 Under this system, a retail information provider, like Mead Data's own Nexis service, charges about $15 for each S.E.C. document, plus a connection charge of $39 an hour and a printing charge of about $1 a page.
The only fees to use the S.E.C.'s data base under the science foundation's project would be for access to the Internet, for which pricing varies. Commercial access can be bought for as little as $2 an hour. But many college students now obtain Internet access as part of their tuition costs and many businesses buy a high-speed Internet connection that might cost the company hundreds or thousands of dollars each month but permits employees to share unlimited access to the network.
A legislative-affairs lawyer for the Information Industries Association, Ronald Plesser, said the industry would not oppose the project as long as the Government did not intend to restrict commercial publishing of Federal data.
"We have no problem with data bases being made available over the Internet," Mr. Plesser said. "But there has to be an interest in insuring a diversity of sources. We don't want a Government monopoly on the ownership and dissemination of Government information."
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee has been pushing for greater public access to the S.E.C.'s Edgar Dissemination Service. He said today that he applauded the science foundation's move.
 
'S.E.C. Finally Gets It'
 "I've been trying to launch Edgar into cyberspace for the last year, and I think the S.E.C. finally gets it," Mr. Markey said, adding that he expected the project to stimulate the commercial market rather than hurt it.
The company involved in the project, the Internet Multicasting Service, is a nonprofit organization founded by Carl Malamud, an economist who developed computer technology for the Federal Reserve Bank. Mr. Malamud has also been instrumental in creating technology that is capable of broadcasting information including audio, video and data over the Internet.
He said the data would be delayed by a day, in contrast to the instant access that is provided by some on-line publishers for financial professionals. Under terms of the science foundation grant, the New York University researchers will buy raw data and reformat them so that they can be obtained over the Internet through Mr. Malamud's organization. Mr. Malamud said he hoped to have the new data base service operating by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Qaddafi Reported to Quash Army Revolt

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi appears to have put down a rebellion by army units seeking to topple his Government in the last 10 days, according to Western intelligence reports and Libyan opposition leaders.
Western diplomats in Cairo and others interviewed by phone in London, Rome and Tripoli said that while details were sketchy it appeared that army units staged revolts in other military installations. 
 The largest rebellion apparently took place near the city of Misurata, on the Mediterranean coast 120 miles east of Tripoli, the capital. But uprisings may also have been staged at Bani Walid, a rural area 90 miles southeast of Tripoli, Brach and Tarhuna, they said.
"We have had reliable reports of large numbers of wounded and casualties in the hospitals," said a European diplomat who has seen reports from his embassy in Tripoli. "This seems to prove that some real fighting took place."
 
Nothing in the Press
 The state-controlled news media in Libya has made no mention of any disturbances, and Libyan officials reached by phone said there was no internal unrest.
But Western diplomats said there were reports of dozens of casualties, bombing raids against the rebel outposts by the Libyan Air Force, explosions at arms depots and purges of senior military officers.
The attempted coup would be the worst internal fighting in Libya since an uprising in 1986, just after the American bombing of Tripoli, by sections of the Libyan Army. The 1986 rebellion was crushed by units from Colonel Qaddafi's revolutionary guards, who were also involved in the latest fighting, Western diplomats said.
"People in the Government were quite rattled," a senior Western diplomat said. "Several old military hands appear to have taken part."
The reports of fighting come as the United Nations is considering whether to increase sanctions against Libya, including a freeze on its assets, because of its refusal to extradite two Libyans charged in connection with the bombing of a Pan Am jet that crashed over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.
 
Air Traffic Halted
 The United States, Britain and France have asked that the sanctions be broadened because of Libya's refusal to hand the men over for trial, but Russia is opposed. It fears such a step could prompt Libya to suspend payment on a $4 billion debt.
The new sanctions would also ban the sale to Libya of equipment used in oil refineries and transportation. Sanctions already in effect has halted international air traffic to Libya.
Libya is also under pressure to cooperate in a French investigation into the 1989 bombing of a French airliner in which 171 people were killed. French judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for four Libyans, including Colonel Qaddafi's brother-in-law, in connection with the 1989 blast.
The international isolation has hurt Colonel Qaddafi's prestige, crippled the military because of a lack of spare parts and forced Libyans to travel by road to Tunisia or Egypt to take international flights. It has also damaged the tepid economic liberalization begun by the Government a few years ago.
The reports of the rebellion support recent statements by the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, an exiled opposition group, that spoke of a simultaneous uprising that included a revolt by 2,000 troops in Misurata.
Despite widespread discontent with Colonel Qaddafi's erratic and sometimes bizarre rule, Western diplomats have predicted he will only be overthrown by the army.
"He will be ousted in the same manner in which he took power -- by a coup," a Western diplomat who follows Libya said.
When the uprising took place is unclear, but most of the diplomats said they believed the worst fighting happened between Oct. 11 and Oct. 14. These diplomats contend that the Government carried out "numerous" executions of military officers and hundreds of arrests after the revolt.
There may also have been an attempt on Colonel Qaddafi's life on Oct. 13, diplomats in Cairo said.
Colonel Qaddafi, in a televised speech in Misurata last Sunday, four days after the supposed assassination attempt, spoke of "people who oppose the regime and who are to be punished by death."
"Treason is an abominable deed and those who commit it will go to the lowest level of hell," he said.
He went on to warn listeners to beware of "heretics" and those working for "the C.I.A. and other stray dogs."
Colonel Qaddafi, who has ruled Libya since 1969, governs a country that is dominated by powerful tribal leaders. The revolt may have been instigated by the Wurfala tribe, one of the country's largest, according to western intelligence reports.
Senior Egyptian officials contend that Colonel Qaddafi is unable to hand over the two former intelligence officers charged with being behind the 1988 bombing because at least one of them belongs to the Megraha tribe. Libya's second most powerful political leader, Abdel-Salaam Jalloud, is also a member of the Megraha tribe.
"Libya is not just Qaddafi," a senior Egyptian official said. "It is a tribal system. Jalloud has his own people, his own tribe, and the two people wanted for trial are his relatives. The Government fears that if the two men go to trial they will ask that Jalloud be investigated."

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Comments Trim Advance by Dow

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed yesterday, after comments around midday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, abruptly curtailed what had been an impressive rally.
Much of the session's action seemed to key on developments in the bond market, which rallied early and then sold off sharply once Mr. Greenspan told an audience at the National Italian-American Foundation in Washington that economic conditions were improving. 
 "The 50-mile-an-hour headwinds which hobbled the rate of growth have now come down to perhaps 20 or 25 miles an hour," Mr. Greenspan said.
The remarks, and the bond market's reaction, produced concern among stock traders that interest rates may have bottomed. Low rates have been driving this year's stock market rally. If rates start to rise, mutual funds may move out of stocks into fixed-income securities.
Before Mr. Greenspan spoke, the Dow Jones industrial average had risen about 40 points, to a new high of 3676.96. But selling in the afternoon trimmed the Dow to 3649.30, up 13.14, at the close. For the week, the blue-chip index was up 19.57.
Broader market averages did not do as well.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.09, to 463.27. The American Stock Exchange's composite index was off 0.27, to 477.25. But the Nasdaq composite index, which was hammered earlier in the week, rose 1.40, to 772.68.
At 302.1 million shares, volume on the Big Board was very heavy and capped the third most active week in the exchange's history. For the week, volume totaled 1.53 billion shares.
"There is a lot of confusion, a lot of insecurity on the part of portfolio managers, who so far this year are looking at some very nice gains," said Edward P. Nicoski, chief market strategist at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. "They are taking profits and moving into areas where prices are not so overheated on the hope that they might be the ones that will start moving up in January."
Among the best performing issues yesterday were cyclical stocks, which could do well if Mr. Greenspan is right about the economy.
Caterpillar, the heavy equipment manufacturer, jumped 4 yesterday, to 89 7/8, on good earnings and an upgraded rating by analysts at Merrill Lynch & Company.
Good earnings also helped shares of Cummins Engine, another Dow stock. The diesel engine manufacturer rose 3 1/8, to 87. And a strong third-quarter performance at United Technologies pushed its shares up 3, to 61 3/4.
The sharp selloff in the bond market hammered bank and other financial stocks and sent the Dow Jones utility average down more than 2 points.
Other market losers included Kimberly-Clark, which reported a drop in third-quarter net income. Its stock fell 1 7/8, to 51 1/2.
In Tokyo, stocks were higher. The Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 85.41 points, or 0.42 percent, to 20,264.93.

President Clinton will meet Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, in Moscow in mid-January as part of the Administration's campaign to support Mr. Yeltsin's struggle to transform his country into a free-market democracy.
The trip, announced today by Secretary of State Warren Christopher at a joint news conference here with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, is also evidently intended to enhance Mr. Clinton's standing as a statesman and divert the spotlight from the Administration's foreign policy setbacks in Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia. The Administration would clearly like to focus attention on its support for democratization in Russia, the foreign policy area where the Clinton Administration feels it has been most successful.
 
Separate Trip for Gore
 It was also announced in Washington that Vice President Al Gore will make a separate trip to Moscow, three days after the Russian parliamentary elections, scheduled for Dec. 12. 
 Administration officials like to point out that the American President has looked most like a statesman at the two summit meetings he has attended: a meeting with Mr. Yeltsin in Vancouver last April and the Tokyo gathering of the seven largest industrialized nations in July. After both meetings, Mr. Clinton's approval rating for his performance on foreign policy soared.
"It does remind everyone that our foreign policy is much broader than some of the issues we've been dealing with lately," the White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said in Washington. She added that Mr. Clinton will spend eight or nine days abroad, attending the NATO summit meeting in Brussels on Jan. 10-11 and making other stops in addition to Moscow. The exact dates for the Moscow visit were not announced.
The trip will be Mr. Clinton's first to Moscow since the late 1960's when he visited when he was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University during a Christmas break. "I've been there in January before," Mr. Clinton told reporters at the White House. "It's light about four hours a day. It shows you my timing."
Mr. Christopher told reporters that Mr. Clinton's visit was in no way intended to influence the outcome of Russia's parliamentary elections.
"I don't think my meeting with Yeltsin should be taken as anything but an endorsement of democracy and free-market reform in Russia," said Mr. Christopher, the highest-ranking American official to visit Moscow since Mr. Yeltsin dismissed the Russian Parliament and crushed a revolt.
During the news conference, Mr. Kozyrev endorsed an American plan, made public at a Defense Ministers' meeting of NATO this week, that would create a mechanism that could eventually lead to closer cooperation between NATO and the countries of the former Warsaw Pact. The American plan sets no schedule, however, for these former Communist nations to actually achieve membership in the alliance, something sought by Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
 
Clear Differences
 In conversations with reporters accompanying Mr. Christopher on this trip, State Department officials have indicated that a clear difference of interpretation exists between Mr. Christopher and Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who made it clear at the NATO meeting that he had no enthusiasm for allowing membership of the former Communist states.
The difference was evident in a cable to NATO Foreign Ministers written by Mr. Christopher early in the week that expressed the need to support the eventual expansion of NATO at the January summit, senior State Department officials said. But despite Mr. Christopher's cable, the initiative has been widely interpreted in European capitals as intended to delay its expansion indefinitely.
"In our view, the summit should firmly open the door to an eventual expansion of NATO that would occur through an evolutionary process," Mr. Christopher wrote in a cable that was approved by the Pentagon and the White House.
 
Go-Slow Approach
 Indeed, Mr. Christopher stressed today that the composition of NATO would "not be changed lightly," and a senior official said that the process would take years.
Mr. Kozyrev praised the American initiative for its go-slow approach. "The thrust of this approach is quite correct," he said. "This is exactly what we've been saying here lately -- that states in Central and Eastern Europe and states of the former Soviet Union are entitled to become members of any organization, but there is no rush."
Mr. Kozyrev called the American approach "one of respect to every state and there is no attempt that is being made to leave Russia on the sidelines."
Mr. Yeltsin, apparently under pressure from his armed forces, sent a letter to President Clinton last month opposing an expansion of NATO to include former Warsaw Pact countries eager to join, like Poland and the Czech Republic. The letter, which was also sent to President Francois Mitterrand of France, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Prime Minister John Major of Britain, added that any expansion that did not include Russia would undermine European security.
 
Trading Compliments
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Christopher flew by helicopter to meet Mr. Yeltsin at one of the Russian President's dachas, a hunting reserve about 80 miles northwest of Moscow.
Before their 45-minute meeting in a two-story solarium filled with tropical plants and stuffed exotic birds, the two men smiled for the cameras in a display of mutual boosterism.
"President Clinton sends his warmest regards," Mr. Christopher told Mr. Yeltsin. "He's full of admiration for what you're doing here, and he is enormously appreciative of your courage."
Mr. Yeltsin, who has been out of public sight for more than a week, returned the compliment, saying, "I have to say that of all the leaders of the world, President Clinton most steadily supports Russia, consistently, immediately and steadfastly."
 
Lenin as a Punchline
 A senior official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said that after Mr. Christopher informed Mr. Yeltsin on the American proposal for NATO, Mr. Yeltsin raised his arms and called it "terrific" and "brilliant."
Mr. Christopher offered no criticism of Mr. Yeltsin's recent decrees, which have included the shutting down of some newspapers and the outlawing of several political parties.
In his meeting with Mr. Christopher, Mr. Yeltsin described the banned parties as "fascistic," senior American officials said. But he was also quoted as joking that democracy has progressed so fast that "the only thing that remains to be done is to bury Lenin."
Despite the obvious warmth, there were areas of discord. Mr. Christopher was unable to persuade Russia to drop its resistance to extending economic sanctions against Libya through the United Nations. The Clinton administration wants to punish the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi for sponsoring terrorism, but Russia is concerned that sanctions will prevent Libya from paying $4 billion it owes Russia for weapons purchases.

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN TRAIL;
Whitman, Aboard Bus, Is on Upbeat Roll

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for Governor, spent the last leg of her three-day, cross-state bus tour in Ocean County yesterday courting elderly residents for their votes, counseling teen-agers and entertaining a group of kindergarten students with a popular children's story.
"This campaign is about people, about jobs, about the future," Mrs. Whitman told a group of elderly residents of the Holiday City community in Berkeley Township. 
 At Toms River North Regional High School she was welcomed by students carrying her campaign signs, autograph seekers and sustained applause for her response to a question on abortion.
"I am pro-choice; I've always been pro-choice," Mrs. Whitman said. "It is a very personal decision between a woman and her physician and the Government should stay out of it."
On sex education, the Republican candidate told about 500 students who crammed into an auditorium for her visit that "abstinence is the only way to insure you don't get a sexually transmitted disease."
Mrs. Whitman began her day with a visit to the Sand Castle Early Childhood Center in Toms River, where she practiced a traditional bit of campaigning -- holding a baby as photographers snapped away -- and a bit of the unconventional -- settling on the floor in the midst of about 25 kindergarten students to read them a story.
Mrs. Whitman's selection was "The Little Engine That Could," the classic children's story of a small train engine that was able to pull a larger train up a mountainside while encouraging itself with the refrain: "I think I can, I think I can."
Asked if Mrs. Whitman, who is trailing Gov. Jim Florio by double digits in all the most recent independent polls, had selected the book for its symbolism, her media aide, Keith Nahigian, said the choice was purely coincidental.
"But maybe it's a sign," he said.
The bus trip that began Tuesday morning was packed with stops (and photo ops) galore: at diners, supermarkets, train stations, schools -- wherever voters, or voters' children, were likely to be found. As the bus rolled across the state, it provided a welcome sense of momentum to Republicans longing for their candidate to get moving in the polls.
Mrs. Whitman has little patience with those who find fault with the pace of her campaign.
"I've been doing this all along," she said yesterday at a Toms River stop.
The problem, she said, was the news media.
"They weren't looking at me over the summer," she said.
They have certainly been looking at her this week. At some stops, reporters, photographers and television crews were easier to find than plain ordinary voters.
Mrs. Whitman's travels also caught the attention and the attack of Mr. Florio, who was in Woodbridge yesterday to receive the endorsement of 40 owners of small businesses, or his speechwriters.
"I understand that Mrs. Whitman is finishing her bus tour today," the Governor said. "Anybody can get on a bus, but the question is, which direction is the bus going? Mrs. Whitman's bus is going backwards -- back to the trickle-down economics that nearly bankrupted the nation."
 
Florio's Best Friend?
 Perhaps it was inevitable.
Taro, New Jersey's death-row dog, has become an issue in the state's political season.
Gov. Jim Florio has his legal aides studying whether he has powers of canine clemency to save Taro from a court-imposed death sentence.
And yesterday the Bergen County Sheriff, Jack Terhune, got into the act.
Mr. Terhune, a Republican seeking re-election, suggested that the dog be spared, to spend the rest of its life in the county jail, where it has been impounded since March 1991.
Mr. Terhune denied any political pandering to dog lovers.
He called his life-in-jail suggestion more "cost-effective" than continuing to run up the legal expenses in the fight over the life of the dog, which is accused of biting the lip of a 10-year old girl in 1990.
Haworth's prosecution of the dog has cost its taxpayers $60,000 in legal fees. Lonnie Lehrer and Sandy Lehrer of Haworth, co-owners of the dog, say they have spent at least $25,000. The dog's food and upkeep costs at the jail for two and a half years have been about $18,000. Most of that expense has been for guards to walk and feed the animal. Sheriff Terhune said he would waive that fee if Taro is spared and charge only for the dog's food -- a cost that he projected at $9,000 if the dog lives another 10 years.
Mr. Lehrer scoffed at the idea of the dog's staying in the county jail forever. "That's not his life," he said. "He belongs to his family." Mr. Lehrer plans to appeal this week's ruling to New Jersey's Supreme Court.
Governor Florio's aides, meantime, say he wants to know his legal standing in the case. "His overall concern is we let the justice system continue to hear the case because he's in no position to intervene until a final decision by the courts takes place," said Audrey Kelly, a spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: Darts Clash With Brazil Over Loans

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
For the past couple of weeks, a high-stakes game of chicken involving one of America's wealthiest families and the Government of Brazil has animated what essentially is the final chapter of the Latin American debt crisis.
The dispute, which has Citibank and several other big banks caught in the middle, centers on a face value of about $1.4 billion in Brazilian loans held by the Dart family of Sarasota, Fla., which owns the Dart Container Corporation, a maker of foam containers and cups. 
 Those loans are part of a $43.5 billion package of loans that Brazil, the largest debtor in the developing world, and its major commercial bank creditors have been painstakingly working to restructure for nearly three years.
Now the plan is in trouble, even though holders of 95 percent of the debt have approved it.
That is because the Dart family, whose stake makes them the fourth-largest holder of the debt, have made it plain that they do not like the terms. As a result, Brazilian officials said they would not proceed with the closing of the transaction.
 
Not Small Players
 "This kind of problem is not new," said a trader who deals extensively in the debt of developing countries and spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But it usually occurs with smaller people. If the Darts had a smaller position, I think there would be an attempt to buy them out."
But the Darts are not small players. Indeed, other interested observers said they thought the family would ultimately choose to take a smaller profit on a revised plan rather than risk losing a great deal more if the financing package fell through.
Few people involved in the restructuring were willing to talk about it on the record because of its sensitivity. But they said that by the end of February -- when the plan was scheduled to close -- the Darts would probably blink, and go along with everyone else.
The Darts began buying the Brazilian debt in the rapidly growing secondary market for developing country debt about three years ago, when the loans in the form of securities were trading at a deep discount.
Prices have risen nicely since, but the Darts had kept their position secret until this spring, when it became clear that Brazil and the committee of banks negotiating the restructuring, led by Citibank, had agreed to alter the terms of the deal.
Under the original terms, the creditors were offered a menu of options to convert their debt.
Most chose to convert the securities into par bonds, which would give them the full face value of the loans but a lower fixed interest rate. The principal payment would be collateralized by United States Treasury bonds bought by Brazil with loans from the International Monetary Fund.
Another choice, and the one preferred by the Darts, was uncollateralized bonds. These bonds would be converted at full face value at an interest rate of 4 percent that would gradually rise to a fixed rate of 8 percent over six years. To make up for the lack of collateral, these bonds would pay the difference in interest between 8 percent and the current coupon in the form of more bonds, until the 8 percent ceiling was reached.
After receiving commitments, Brazil changed its proposal because the original restructuring plan, while lowering interest costs, did little to reduce its debt. But in requesting the changes, Brazil said reallocations should be on an "entirely voluntary basis."
Under its amended plan, Brazil asked the banks to convert at least 35 percent of the securities into a third alternative: deep-discount bonds. These would be securities converted at a discount to the full face value, thereby reducing Brazil's debt but with a floating interest rate. Like the par bonds, these securities would also be collateralized by United States Treasuries.
A committee of bankers agreed, as did most of the other creditors. But the Darts, who chose to place all their investment in the noncollateralized bonds, were less than thrilled, and lobbied against it. Between the time the original financing options were structured and Brazil came back with its new menu, market interest rates had fallen sharply. The Darts were opposed to being told they had to rejigger their options because the securities they had chosen were worth more.
 
An Impossible Deal?
 One possibility, some traders and bankers said, was that Brazil, would go ahead without the Darts, and then refuse to make interest payments on the Dart's holdings. That scenario would probably wind up in a courtroom somewhere.
"Nobody will permit the Darts to get a better deal than they get," said one portfolio manager with a smaller position in Brazilian debt. "They are being offered what everybody else is getting, so it's hard to see how they are being treated unfairly. But if they don't budge, then the deal becomes impossible."
Melissa Krantz, a spokeswoman for the Dart family, acknowledged that retaining a 100 percent interest in the noncollateralized bonds was the best possible financial result for her clients. But she added that if the Darts reduced their portion of noncollateralized bonds and took the 35 percent position in the discount bonds, as requested, Brazil would be out $73 million in up-front costs.
"We have tried to participate in a manner most advantageous to Brazil," she said. "We wish Brazil well. And Dart has not said it intends to stand in the way of the deal closing."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Japan Trade Talks Bog Down

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Trade negotiations between the United States and Japan, begun in July with smiles by President Clinton and Kiichi Miyazawa, who was Prime Minister then, have bogged down in fundamental disagreements, according to participants in the talks.
The disagreements, which emerged in talks here over the last two weeks, indicate that the framework for further talks will not necessarily serve as the basis of a harmonious new economic relationship . 
 Rather, the problems seem to confirm the fears of some critics that the vaguely worded framework agreement, hastily drawn up and signed in July, would merely postpone arguments until later. Later is now.
Negotiators for both sides, however, said that talks were still in an early stage and that they anticipated completing trade agreements by the deadline -- next January -- in three sectors that were the focus of discussions in the last two weeks: automobiles and auto parts, insurance and government procurement.
"I don't think we are at a point in these negotiations where we can say there is anything unbridgeable," said Charlene Barshefsky, deputy United States trade representative, at a news conference today.
Negotiations are expected to resume next month in Washington.
The framework negotiations are not as urgent as some other issues that will soon test the Clinton Administration's attitude toward Japan.
The Administration has threatened to hit Japan with sanctions on Nov. 1 if no progress is made toward opening Japan's construction market to foreign companies. Another clash could come by mid-November over whether Japan will drop its ban on rice imports to facilitate an agreement in the Uruguay round of global trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Today, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa moved to try to avert construction sanctions. He told a Cabinet meeting he would like to compile by the end of next week basic plans to introduce an open competitive bidding system for public works projects above a certain value. It is unclear, however, whether enough can be done by Nov. 1 to satisfy America.
For its part, Japan will withdraw from parts of the framework talks if construction sanctions go beyond barring Japanese construction companies from bidding for Federal projects, Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said today.
In the last two weeks the United States has presented Japan with lengthy proposals for measures it should take to increase market access for foreign products in automobiles and parts, insurance, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment.
American officials say they expect the share of foreign products in Japan's market to rise to roughly the same range as foreign market share in the other industrialized nations in three or four years. For instance, the Americans say, foreign companies have 5 percent of Japan's telecommunications market whereas foreign companies hold an average of 25 percent in the industrialized countries. Japan views such goals as targets and says it will not agree.
Japan also argues that some of the steps being requested by the United States are beyond the power of Japan's Government, while the framework is limited to "matters within the scope and responsibility of the Government."
It is believed for instance, that the United States is asking that Japan's Government undertake a consumer education program to dispel popular beliefs that American cars are too expensive or of low quality.
 
Who Should Explain?
 "Should explanations of U.S. products be made by the Government or by the companies?" Mr. Okamatsu of MITI asked.
Another big disagreement concerns wording in the framework agreement that the consultations "will take place under the basic principle of two-way dialogue."
Japan says this means the United States should also open its market where it is closed. The American Government, for instance, has never bought a Japanese supercomputer, even though Japanese manufacturers hold 40 percent of the European market, a clear sign that they make competitive products.
The United States maintains that although the framework calls for a dialogue it does not call for two-way market-opening measures and that the framework is clearly meant to address Japan's huge trade surplus.

HEADLINE: Yield on Long Bond Soars in Selloff

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Treasury market continued its selloff yesterday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, gave a mildly upbeat economic assessment.
The sharp drop in prices sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond soaring to just below 6 percent. 
 Mr. Greenspan's comments suggested to some investors that the Fed might lean toward higher interest rates to help keep a lid on inflation, which is aggravated by fast economic growth.
Some analysts said Treasury market investors used Mr. Greenspan's comments as an excuse to sell after growing jittery about owning bonds with interest rates at their lowest levels in more than two decades.
"Greenspan certainly was the nail in the coffin at the end of the day," said David Ader, a market strategist at Technical Data in Boston, a unit of Thomson Financial Services. "But this has been a very poor week in general for the bond market."
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond tumbled 29/32 of a point, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, soared to 5.98 percent, from 5.91 percent on Thursday.
 
'Headwinds' Have Abated
 Mr. Greenspan told a National Italian-American Foundation luncheon in Washington that the "headwinds" that had hampered United States economic growth -- debt accumulated during the economic expansion of the 1980's -- had significantly abated.
But analysts said Mr. Greenspan also remarked that the recent trend of widespread corporate layoffs was likely to continue, indicating a decidedly mixed view on the economy. This week, major drug companies and the BankAmerica Corporation announced thousands of job cuts.
The focus of the bond investors on news that is bad for the credit markets indicates how skittish they are about holding bonds after the phenomenal price rally of recent months.
That became clear on Thursday when a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, normally viewed as a secondary economic report, contributed to a similar selloff. The survey of businesses in the mid-Atlantic region showed a sharp improvement in the regional economic conditions.
"Most fund mangers have been approaching the U.S. bond market with one foot out the door," said Robert Giordano, the director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Mr. Ader of Technical Data said the overreaction of the market was demonstrated by the concentration of the selloff in longer-term maturities.
The 10-year Treasury note, for example, lost 17/32 of a point, but short-term Treasuries posted losses of only 3/32 to 4/32 of a point.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, tumbled 4.00, to 1,328.32.
Ordinarily, short-term securities would be most vulnerable to fears of higher interest rates, because the central bank uses short-term rates to carry out monetary policy.
Indeed, the discount rates on Treasury bills were relatively flat. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills slipped one basis point, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.02 percent. The discount rate on six-month bills was unchanged at 3.13 percent. But the discount rate on one-year bills rose 2 basis points, to 3.27 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10520/32 , down 8/32 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was 5.40 percent, up from 5.38 percent.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Petroleum Continues to Fall As Supply Seems Adequate

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices sank to four-week lows yesterday amid signs that gasoline prices were weakening and that oil supplies would be ample to meet demand this winter.
On the Mercantile Exchange in New York, crude oil for December delivery fell 28 cents, to $18.07 a barrel, in the eighth trading session of the last 10 in which prices have declined. 
 November heating oil fell 0.56 cent, to 53.55 cents a gallon, and November gasoline dropped 1.04 cents, to 49.59 cents a gallon -- a five-week low.
 
Further Decline Is Seen
 Gasoline prices continued a recent decline from what many traders viewed as artificially high levels reached after the summer driving season.
Some oil analysts said they expected oil prices to continue falling next week in the absence of fear of higher winter heating oil demand or signs of a cohesive agreement by OPEC to restrain output.
"The market is giving out the clear signal that it is oversupplied," said Philip Verleger of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "The barrel counters are wrong," he added, referring to some analysts' views of a tighter supply-and-demand picture. Domestic oil stocks are 327.1 million barrels, down 100,000 barrels from a year ago.
Unless cold weather hits the Northeast, the region where heating oil is used most, crude oil prices could fall below $18 a barrel.
"The short-term fundamentals don't look that good," said Victor Yu of Refco, predicting crude prices would fall to around $17.70 a barrel.
"It's still too early to say if the long-term downtrend has resumed," he said. "A lot of it will become a weather play." But some bullish traders said they remain convinced that oil prices would rebound once the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries shows it is holding the line on production.
"This is nothing more than a correction," one Texas trader said. "Why should I be bearish now when we've fallen about $1?The time to be bearish was $1 ago."
On other commodities markets, lumber prices soared, extending a six-month high. At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, November lumber jumped the $10 limit, to $348.10 a thousand board feet, the highest price since mid-April. On Monday, trading will resume with $15 maximum price limits.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Europeans Mimic Germany's Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday as several more European nations followed Germany's lead of the day before and brought down interest rates.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6755 German marks, up from 1.6667 on Thursday. 
 Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery lost $1.50, to settle at $371.30 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid price for spot gold of $370 an ounce, down $1.30.
Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Company, said much of the dollar's gain yesterday was a continuation of Thursday's rally, set off when the German central bank, the Bundesbank, surprised financial markets by trimming two key interest rates.
 
Jumping on the Bandwagon
 Several other European countries including Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria, quickly matched the German rate cut. Yesterday, France, Spain and Ireland also cut rates.
Lower interest rates abroad tend to drive the dollar higher as investors shift money into dollar-denominated investments to capture higher yields.
"The primary engine behind this movement is the U.S. went into recession before Europe did and now we're coming out of recession and they're still in it," said Randolph Donney, director of capital market research at Pegasus Econometric Group.
European countries are bringing down interest rates to stimulate their economies, whereas market participants in the United States are wondering when domestic rates will rise. That, Mr. Donney said, creates a powerful environment for the dollar to move higher.
Aside from some profit taking against the yen, the dollar moved ahead yesterday for that reason, he added. It was trading late in New York at 108.05 yen, down from 108.35 on Thursday.
The British pound slipped to $1.4735 in New York, down from $1.4835 on Thursday.
Other late New York dollar rates, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.4755 Swiss francs, up from 1.4709; 5.8539 French francs; up from 5.8505; 1,613.00 Italian lire, up from 1,606.00, and 1.3043 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3105.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
BankAmerica Is Planning to Eliminate at Least 3,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation plans to eliminate 3,000 to 3,750 jobs in the next 14 months.
The cuts are necessary to reduce costs to bolster earnings per share, which have been constrained by the recession in California, Richard M. Rosenberg, BankAmerica's chairman and chief executive, wrote in a staff newsletter released on Thursday. 
 BankAmerica shares closed today at $43.25, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts said the relative lack of movement in the stock reflected the minimal impact the cuts would have on earnings, though the impact will be positive, and the fact that such cuts have been anticipated for some time. A BankAmerica spokesman said it had not been determined whether the cuts would result in a charge to earnings.
The job cuts, about half expected to be accomplished by attrition, represent the second time the bank has cut its work force since it acquired the Security Pacific Corporation for $4.4 billion in April 1992. In the first round, BankAmerica eliminated 20,000 jobs, shrinking its work force to 98,000 worldwide. About 12,000 people were laid off; the rest were moved into jobs opened through attrition.
"Although total net income increased considerably as a result of the Security Pacific merger, we have not yet begun to increase our earnings per share, which is the basic measure of how well we are performing for our shareholders," Mr. Rosenberg wrote in the newsletter to employees.
"We are facing a prolonged recession in some of our key markets, and heightened competition from both banks and nonbank financial institutions," he continued. "As a result, both our net interest income and noninterest income have been basically flat for the last 12 months, and we don't see the economic picture improving appreciably in the near future."
This week, BankAmerica reported that third-quarter earnings were $486 million, 2.1 percent more than the $476 million it earned in the comparable 1992 period. But earnings per share were lower: $1.19 a share compared with $1.22 a year earlier.
Mr. Rosenberg wrote that the job cuts are part of a larger cost-cutting program associated with the Security Pacific merger that the bank hopes will reduce its annual expense budget of $6.5 billion by $250 million. "As we continue our efforts to keep expenses in line with our revenues, we realize that we will have to reduce expenses still further between now and the end of 1994," he wrote.

HEADLINE: Health Insurance Costs Rise Less Sharply

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Cost cuts by consumers and cyclical forces in the health insurance industry combined to slow the increase in health premiums last year, the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick reported yesterday, based on the results of a survey.
Health care premiums rose 8 percent from spring 1992 to spring 1993, compared with an 11 percent rise a year earlier. The latest figure was double the rate of inflation but was the lowest rate of increase since 1986-87. 
 One reason is the swiftness with which employers have embraced managed-care health plans, under which employees join health-maintenance organizations or preferred-provider plans. Last year, 58 percent of employers with 200 or more workers enrolled in such plans, compared with just 29 percent five years ago.
The survey indicated that President Clinton may now find it easier to promote his health care agenda.
"These modest rate hikes will continue over the next few years, and this is good news for Clinton's health planners, who need to predict the cost of future coverage," said James Buckley, head of group health consulting for Peat Marwick in New York.
Peat Marwick has also discerned a cycle of profits in the health insurance business since 1965. When insurance companies are profitable, increases in the premiums they charge are smaller two years later, Mr. Buckley said. When insurers suffer losses, premiums increase sharply two years later. According to the survey, the health insurance industry has been profitable for the last two years.
A spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America said that the health insurance industry has averaged profits of a cent and a half on each dollar of premium collected. "The health insurance business is not that profitable," said Stephen Young of the association.
Referring to the President's health program, Mr. Buckley said: "To the extent that the budget assumed an increase greater than it's going to be, they will have over-accrued their health and welfare costs. A lot of his savings come from his slowing the rate of increase, and this will help."
But the President will have to move fast, before people get used to lower rates and the cycle changes again, Mr. Buckley said.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

A Widow's Rights
 
Q I recently found out about a Social Security provision under which a widow can collect at age 60 if her husband was collecting benefits, if she is unemployed. Are the benefits I lost retroactive?
 
 ALICE MURRAY, Manhattan
A A widow is eligible for survivor benefits on the Social Security record of her deceased husband, as long as he was fully insured under Social Security at the time of his death and she was married to him for at least nine months. This duration-of-marriage requirement is waived if the death was accidental or occurred while the deceased was serving on active duty in the armed forces. 
 However, an application for a widow's benefits has no retroactivity. The rule is that it becomes effective in the month it is received by the Social Security Administration.
"There is, however, one exception to this," said Peter P. Di Sturco, New York regional director of the Social Security Administration. "If a death occurred in the month before the application was received, it can be effective with the month of death."
 
Capital Gains on Bonds
Q In 1984, bonds worth $100,000 were purchased for $65,000. They are now being called. Is there any way the taxes on the $35,000 gain can be spread out or deferred?
 
JOHN F. SHANLEY, Boca Raton, Fla.
A If the bonds were issued on or before July 18, 1984, the entire $35,000 profit would generally be taxed as a long-term capital gain when the bonds are called.
Under the 1993 tax law, though, you have the right to defer the recognition of the capital gain if you reinvest the proceeds in a specialized small- business investment company, which is licensed by the Small Business Adminstration to assist disadvantaged entrepreneurs.
Joseph N. Guariglia, a partner in McGladrey & Pullen, a New York accounting firm, said that "if the bond acquired at the market discount had been issued after July 18, 1984, the gain on the redemption would be taxed as ordinary income, to the extent of the accrued market discount on the bond, which could not be rolled over; the balance of the gain would be treated as long-term capital gain."
 
Zero-Coupon Bond Fees
Q Can zero-coupon bonds be purchased privately without cost or must they be purchased through a broker?
 
 EDWARD CAROLAN, Yonkers
A To buy zero-coupon bonds,you have to use the services of a brokerage firm or bank. Commissions are usually less than $50, with some brokers charging no fee on transactions of more than 10 bonds.
"An alternative to zero-coupon bonds is a mutual fund that has a portfolio structured to mimic a zero-coupon bond," said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. As one example, he said, "the Benham Target Maturities Trusts with different maturities -- five-year intervals out to the year 2020 -- offer, in effect, a Government zero-coupon bond as a mutual fund."
Mutual funds, of course, charge management fees, with expenses deducted before determining net asset value.

HEADLINE: An Arts Center Takes Off Like 40,000 Honey Bees

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 22

 BODY:
With painstaking care, an artist has moved 40,000 honey bees from Oakland to the Center for the Arts at Yerba Buena Gardens, a new arts center in San Francisco that seeks to draw people out of their neighborhoods and into the city's center.
For the inaugural exhibition, which opened last week, the bees' hive was lowered the 20 feet from an open skylight to the gallery floor a little bit each day for a month to acclimate the bees to their new location. The center itself has been more than 25 years in the making, a laborious civic process that has involved five mayors, many financial problems (an early investor, Olympia & York, went bankrupt), several lawsuits and countless discussions among advisory committees in the last decade over what kind of art and performance to show. 
 The result is an eight-acre institution dedicated to multicultural and largely experimental art displayed in bright, shining buildings well served by public transportation. Coming during a recession, the center has been heralded by city leaders as the best thing to happen to San Francisco since the Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937.
"It is the nexus of the city," said Helen Sause, project director for the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency. "No one culture or community feels that it is solely theirs."
 
Innovative Design
 One building, the Center for the Arts Galleries, was designed by Fumihiko Maki, this year's winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. It resembles an ocean liner, with porthole-like windows, a flagpole that looks like a ship's mast and metal staircases. There will be no permanent collection in the three gallery spaces, which have 25-foot ceilings, but revolving theme-oriented shows and individual exhibitions.
The 755-seat Center for the Arts Theater, designed by the Manhattan architect James Stewart Polshek, looks like a giant, all-white Rubik's cube. Both buildings face a gently rolling five-acre open space (not long ago a parking lot) where people can sit and watch outdoor projections of the performances inside. Across the street is the new brick-and-granite home of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which was designed by the Swiss architect Mario Botta. It is to open in 1995.
The neighborhood was once known as South of the Slot, a reference to the slotted tracks for cable cars on Market Street. The area has long been the city's underbelly and home to successive waves of immigrants. In the name of urban renewal, the city 25 years ago razed burlesque theaters, cheap motels and pawn shops to make room for two hotels, a convention center, parking lots and a sports arena that was never built.
The arts center now stands where the sports arena was meant to be. The switch was made, said Renny Pritikin, the center's artistic director for visual arts, "because of community activism to resist the brutal destruction of this neighborhood."
Residents filed suit in 1969 on behalf of the nearly 4,000 people who had been evicted, and it took nearly a decade before city officials met with neighborhood groups and worked out a plan for an arts center. The city set up an independent nonprofit organization to rent and maintain the buildings and oversee the programs. With $40 million from developers, the city paid the other half of the $82 million bill with bonds. The yearly budget of $4.5 million is to come from contributions, rentals (many to users of the convention center across the street) and ticket sales.
To reflect Northern California demographics, performances and exhibitions are to be steadfastly multicultural, mixing local, national and international arts. The policy has drawn some criticism. The choice of a 50-member Trinidadian steel drum orchestra to play at the center's opening last week was criticized by people who said a local group would have been more appropriate. But Baraka Sele, the center's artistic director for performing arts, dismissed critics of her international lineup of dance and music groups. "I program from the heart," she said.
With "In/Out of the Cold War," the exhibition in the arts galleries, Mr. Pritikin and his co-curator, Rene de Guzman, have also emphasized variety by gathering 32 black, white, Asian, Hispanic, gay and disabled artists to examine the end of the cold war through painting, kinetic sculptures, computer art, film and video.
Change is one of the show's themes: outsiders becoming insiders, life emerging from death. In one dark room, a carousel of military helicopters and winged angels goes around and around, creating an impression, with the help of a strobe light, that helicopters are turning into cherubs and back again. Also reflecting the life-from-death theme, an exhibit in another room, sealed off and viewed through plastic windows, shows live honey bees coming and going as they please through the open skylight. They are almost like unwitting performance artists as they dive to their hive in a real ox's skeleton on the gallery floor.
Many local artists and performers support the center's multicultural emphasis despite concern that the center could lose its local focus or that its approach might mean fulfilling racial quotas.
"San Francisco has a lot more artists than it has people to go to art," said Jon Raskin, a saxophonist who said he would like to perform in the theater. "This has the potential to help a lot of artists in the area."
A San Francisco photographer, Ira Nowinski, is to display his pictures of the white old men who once lived in the neighborhood at a show in 1995. When the old neighborhood was razed, he was upset, he said, but at least an arts center is better than an empty lot.
"When something terrible happens and there's a void, it's good to fill it with art," he said.

HEADLINE: Technology Will Force a Shorter Workweek;
Now, Get Past Politics

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The U.S. Senate passed a bill in the early 1930's calling for a four-day workweek to ease the terrible unemployment situation. The labor committee headed by Senator Robert Wagner endorsed this bill unanimously. If enacted, the legislation would have added eight million more jobs. It was fought fiercely by the Republican Party, the Manufacturers Association, conservatives and the usual so
called economists who relied on old economic theory. 
 The same types fight President Clinton's economic plan, give lip service to his health plan but are opposed to it. These same types lobbied against the 48-hour week, the 44-hour week and the 40-hour week, using the same scare tactics: reduction in work hours will ruin the country and bring severe depression. The country would go Socialist or Communist.
President Roosevelt was forced, under political pressure from the same groups, to ask his friend and supporter, Senator Wagner, to withdraw the bill, though many believed it would have passed by large margins.
I suggested in a 1967 newspaper article that the 32-hour week would help our then-severe recession. It received much favorable comment but was scuttled with the charge that the suggestion was Communist-inspired.
Perhaps now that the Communist bugaboo is behind us, in-depth consideration can be given to a plan I believe would erase our recessions, severe unemployment and the need to keep welfare costs so high because of unemployment. It could start at a slow pace. I urge the Secretary of Labor to study how such a law could be enacted to help lower- and middle-class citizens, who are the perennial victims of our recessions and depressions.

Midway Plans To Fly Again From Chicago

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

 BODY:
Midway Airlines, which operated from Midway Airport in Chicago for a dozen years until it halted service in 1991, plans to start up again this fall.
Its name and base airport will be the same, and its chief executive, Ken Carlson, was the founder of Midway in 1979, but little else has been retained from the original airline. Like many fledgling carriers, the new Midway, (800) 446-4392, is taking advantage of ripe market conditions -- including relatively inexpensive planes and a large pool of unemployed airline workers -- to fill a perceived niche. 
 That niche, Midway officials say, will be service to cities roughly two hours' flying time from Chicago. The airline plans to start flying between La Guardia Airport in New York and Midway on Nov. 15. Two more cities will be added before the end of the year from a short list of Boston, Philadelphia and Washington. And it hopes to lure business passengers with frequent flights, extra legroom, leather seats and lower fares than competitors.
The airline plans to fly roughly six round trips a day on weekdays between Midway and each of its destinations on new Fokker F-100 jets. It will offer a frequent-flier program that will enable the miles earned to be used on Midway or other airlines to be named later.
Midway officials acknowledge that in frequency of flights the carrier will fall far short of competitors like American and United, but said Midway planned eventually to approach those levels.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Struggling to Lighten the Mortgage Debt on Co-ops

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE circumstances of the co-op market have made a landlord -- small-time and probably temporary -- out of Michael Kollmer. In 1988 he and his new bride, Rachael Smith, bought a two-bedroom apartment in the 38-unit building at 622 West 114th Street, taking sponsor financing.
They were unable to sell it when Mr. Kollmer moved to New Rochelle in 1990 to be closer to a new job as a music teacher in Mamaroneck. This year the Kollmers, who now have two sons, bought a house in New Rochelle. They rent out the West Side apartment, absorbing a $150-a-month loss, the difference between the rent they receive and the carrying costs of the apartment. 
 "Some people who had to move out are losing $500 a month," he said. "They're hanging on by their fingernails."
But neither Mr. Kollmer nor other shareholders caught in afflictions of rent-regulated buildings that converted to co-ops in the late 80's are sitting on their hands. They are looking for ways to make their apartments more salable, which often means shoring up the fiscal structure of the building itself.
On West 114th Street, that may mean converting the building to a condominium. If that can be negotiated with the bank holding the mortgage and the sponsor, who still owns 14 apartments and gave financing on 11 that were sold, then potential buyers will find mortgage financing easier to come by. The negotiating parties would have to agree on the value of the units as condominiums in order to determine how much each co-op owner would have to pay to buy out the underlying mortgage on the building. Building debt in co-ops is paid off from maintenance payments to the corporation; in condominiums there is no building debt because buyers pay off the building's costs in the purchase price.
In Riverdale, shareholder efforts led to the negotiated prepayment of a loan, discounted by 10 percent, at the 178-unit River Terrace co-op at 2621 Palisades Avenue, which was done in a way that avoided an adverse tax effect. The co-op came away with $270,000 needed for capital repairs, said its lawyer, James Samson of the Manhattan firm of Bangser Klein Rocca & Blum.
And in New Rochelle, resident shareholders concluded negotiations with the new holder of the underlying mortgage on the building, which purchased it at a discount from the Resolution Trust Corporation, only last week. The residents negotiated a writedown that will keep the debt affordable and make the apartments marketable.
"The portion of the building's mortgage debt attributable to each unit should not exceed 35 percent of the value of the units," said Thomas W. Smith, of Smith Buss & Jacobs, the Yonkers law firm that represents the co-op board, citing guidelines that many lenders follow in underwriting building loans.
When the co-op sales market collapsed in 1989, some sponsors were unable to sustain maintenance payments to the building on unsold, renter-occupied apartments. But even when sponsors and resident owners are current, mortgage debt is often too high to keep apartments marketable.
WITH rates down, many co-ops, like other borrowers, have taken the opportunity to refinance. Possibly many more could than do. "They could buy a loan for cash and have another waiting to take its place," said Richard R. Pergolis, of the Manhattan mortgage-brokerage firm of Pergolis Swartz, which handled over 200 transactions last year.
"But a lot of them can't agree on anything," he said. "They all have a friend or an uncle or somebody who has an opinion. Everyone is going off in different directions."
Agreement among the shareholders is not the end of the problem, however. The New Rochelle co-op -- the 48-unit Stonelea Manor, at 110-120 Stonelea Place, near Interstate 95 in a neighborhood of older single-family homes -- is a case in point.
When the building was transferred to the co-op corporation, said Mr. Smith, the lawyer, it had a $1.3 million first mortgage with a savings bank within a $1.33 million five-year "wraparound" mortgage from the sponsor at a favorable rate. The size of the loan was based on potential value in vacancy sales at the then market values, the unfortunate practice at the time.
Eventually the Resolution Trust Corporation took over the bank and the loan found its way into a portfolio of loans sold at discounts to wholesale buyers. "We wanted to buy the loan ourselves," Mr. Smith said, and the building actually negotiated to do so. But in the end the co-op was surprised and disappointed to learn that it had been sold to an investment vehicle, Phoenix One Inc., which, through its agent, Strategic Resources Ltd. of Manhattan, buys nonperforming real-estate loans, restructures them and either holds them or resells them privately.
"We're taking a practical approach," said Paul Schack, president of the Phoenix Companies, based in Morris Plains, N.J., "which means we are looking at the economic realities of the home owners." The practical approach led to a solution last week under which the lender trimmed the mortgage balance to $1 million and the sponsor eliminated the wraparound loan, Mr. Smith said.
According to some specialists, mortgage debt should not exceed about a third of the vacancy value of the apartments, now considerably reduced from the level of the late 80's. More conservatively, others say that the debt level should be linked to the rental value of apartments, based on the market rental value of the already sold apartments and the actual rents of apartments still occupied by a preconversion tenant.
But in either case, debt cannot be excessive for the incomes of buyers in the area. Total housing debt should not exceed about 30 percent of household income. For co-op owners housing debt is a combination of payments on a co-op loan and the apartment's proportional share of the underlying mortgage on the building.
LENDERS, of course, are not keen on writing off debt while a loan is still performing. "It's a Catch-22," said Cynthia Wong, principal in Foray Capital Inc., a Manhattan financial advisory firm. "If there's a default on the loan, lenders will take a discount, but if the loan is good, how do you get them to do it?"
The co-op owner who paid $160,000 for an apartment a few years ago might be willing to accept, say, $130,000. But if the monthly maintenance is based on an exorbitant mortgage value in relation to market value, a buyer may have trouble getting a loan.
From the buyer's viewpoint, an apartment on the market for $130,000 with only $10,000 of underlying mortgage debt attributable to it may well be a better buy than an apartment selling for $100,000 that has $50,000 in mortgage debt attributable to it, Ms. Wong said. "The building is more stable," she said.
Stability is what the resident owners of Stonelea Manor in New Rochelle are looking for. Jon Forster, the 39-year-old treasurer of the board, found he had to give up a sales effort last fall because of lack of buyer interest. "We gave two open houses and no one came," he said. Had he been able to sell, he might have stayed with a job he took a year earlier in Pennsylvania. He commuted there, staying with family members during the week and returning home on weekends. Instead, he left the job for one in New York.
The present value of vacant apartments in the building is believed to be about $50,000 for a one-bedroom and $65,000 for a two-bedroom. Maintenance charges are about $400 a month for a one-bedroom apartment (about three-quarters of it paying off the building mortgage) and $550 for a two-bedroom. Without the negotiated settlement last week, maintenance would have risen at least 15 percent when the sponsor subsidy ran out, said Arlene Gordon Oliver, a lawyer and the board president.
"Right now the maintenance is affordable," she said. "We're trying to keep it affordable."

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Forcing Officers To Pay Their Fees
 
Q. Our small four-unit condominium has a board president, who owns two condos and who has not paid his monthly maintenance fees for eight months. What can be done? . . . Angela Wynn, Spring Lake, N.J. 

A. According to Benjamin D. Lambert, a lawyer in Woodbridge, N.J., you have to review the condominium's governing documents. A potential remedy might be a reference that states that board officers must be in good standing financially to retain their positions.
Mr. Lambert also said you could sue in small claims court if the amount owed was less than $2,500 or in civil court if the amount was higher.
"At a minimum," he said, "have an authorized representative of the board file a lien with the county recording office for the amount owed."
 
Charges for Air-Conditioners
 
Q. Recently, I installed the air-conditioner in my rent-stabilized walk-up apartment. I got my landlord's permission to do so, of course. But in addition to my rent, I was asked to pay $5 a month just for having the air-conditioner. Does my landlord have the legal right to do this? . . . Dorota Wnuk, Manhattan
 
A. Yes. According to Lou Ganim, a spokesman for the New York State Housing and Community Renewal Department, which oversees rent administration in New York City, the landlord in rent-controlled or rent-stabilized building may legally charge $5 a month for eachair-conditioner even if the tenant pays for electricity and buys and installs the unit. He added that the charges, which are designed to compensate the owner for any potential damage to the building, were valid even if the air-conditioner was temporarily removed in the winter.
 
Do Proxies Add Up To a Quorum?
 
Q. At a recent shareholders meeting of our co-operative community, we had fewer members present than usual. But when we counted the proxies, we had a quorum.
Our bylaws permit voting in person or by proxy, but do not specify if members actually have to be present to constitute a quorum.
We conducted business, but now some members who were not present either in person or by proxy are asking for another meeting, stating that this one was illegal.
Do proxies count toward a quorum? . . . Sally Seymour, Spring Glen, N.Y.
 
A. According to Marc Luxemburg, a lawyer and president of the Manhattan Council of Co-operatives, a shareholders meeting is legal if there is a quorum in person or by proxy. "The people who didn't show up, they have nothing to complain about, as long as proper notice of the meeting was given," he said. "It's up to them to be there or have a proxy there."

A Tourist Spot Where Shakespeare Once Reigned

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE statue of Hamlet that broods amid the undergrowth outside the vacant state-owned Shakespeare Theater at Stratford-on-the-Housatonic may soon find itself in happier surroundings.
After years of searching, the Connecticut Economic Development Department, which is responsible for the 14.5-acre site, has found a development team it considers capable of creating a viable entertainment complex at the dilapidated theater center. 
 An ambitious project that will cover up to an additional 35 acres that are now privately owned was approved on Oct. 6. It will take 10 years to complete and cost about $95 million. Contracts for a low-cost lease between the state and the developers are expected to be signed in January.
The plans for the Stratford Festival Theater and Waterfront Village call for creating a tourist attraction that will eventually include a 64-room inn, a 230-room hotel, a marina, restaurants, shops, a waterfront promenade, an education program and perhaps a second, more intimate, theater.
Dropping its previous opposition to financial participation, the state has agreed in principle to contribute $7.5 million from a $60 million economic development fund for regional projects.
"The theater, which will continue to operate as a nonprofit company, is on the priority list of the 16-town Bridgeport region," said Robert Santy, Deputy Commissioner of the Economic Development Department.
The winning proposal among the three submitted was from Stratford Upon the Housatonic Inc., a partnership of Robert M. DelBuono Jr., a Stratford financial planner and real estate developer; Steven A. Wolff, head of a Fairfield arts consulting concern called AMF Planning and Research Corporation, and Scott Wilson, head of TLCR Architects of Boston, which has experience in theater design and renovation.
Mr. DelBuono and Mr. Wilson unsuccessfully participated in a similar competition last year as Brickhill-Burke Productions Inc. of New York. This year, their new partnership's successful plan was assisted by a group of theater professionals assembled to formulate the proposal and carry out construction and artistic supervision.
Among those professionals is Robert Orchard, director of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., who said: "We will develop projects at Stratford and bring our own Shakespearean and classic productions down from Cambridge for an annual 8-to-10-week season." In addition, American Repertory will bring in productions from abroad.
Also involved in rebuilding and equipping the theater are Jules Fisher Associates, Broadway lighting designers; Jaffe Holden Scarborough, sound engineers, and the Tishman Construction Corporation of New England, a division of Tishman Real Estate in New York.
Michael Price, director of the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., and Judith Allen, director of the North Carolina Blumenthal Center for the Performing Arts, will continue to provide guidance in creating An American Playhouse, which will produce new and existing plays and musicals for performance at Stratford and on tour.
Founded in 1954 by members of the New York Theatre Guild, the theater, which operated only in summer, was to have been America's answer to England's Stratford-on-Avon and Canada's Shakespeare Theater. It attracted Katharine Hepburn, Helen Hayes, Maurice Evans and many other famous actors.
But by 1983 audiences had dwindled, and the theater closed. That year, the state bought the property, which had been foreclosed, for $1.3 million for use as a public park. An unsuccessful season in 1989 was its last.
RENOVATION of the theater, which is expected to reopen in 1996, and a 477-car parking lot will be the $18 million first phase of the development. This is to be followed by construction of the inn 100 yards away. "We may or may not build the inn ourselves," Mr. Wolff said.
The theater's lobby and restrooms must be expanded, dressing rooms must be added, scenery storage space and a loading dock need to be upgraded and enlarged. There is neither air-conditioning nor adequate heating. The electrical system must be replaced, and elevators will have to be installed.
"The building will be enlarged from 40,000 to 67,000 square feet," Mr. Wilson said, but the seating capacity will be reduced from 1,500 to 1,200 because of the reallocation of space. To achieve what Mr. Wilson called "a classy Connecticut look" rather than the existing pseudo-replication of the Globe Theater, fieldstone will be used on the exterior, complementing the building's millions of board feet of teak.
Before work can begin on an adjacent 5.4-acre parcel earmarked for the hotel and marina, asbestos and lead dumped by the defunct Raymark brake plant must be cleared. Officials at the Connecticut Environmental Protection Department and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency say that Mr. DelBuono, who owns the parcel, may have to undertake the cleanup himself. Under the law, owners of commercial property are responsible for removing contaminants, unless the original offender can be found. In this case, Raymark is in bankruptcy, limiting its liability.
The project, said Mark Barnhart, the City Manager, "will replace jobs lost by the downsizing of Sikorsky and Textron-Lycoming and create new long-term employment. We are very excited by the prospect of a major tourist attraction."
Some modifications in zoning regulations may be required to accommodate the new uses, possibly through a proposed theater district. A tax increment district is also contemplated, whereby a portion of taxes paid by the project's commercial operations would be reinvested in parking, sidewalks and business facade improvements in the theater district.
Construction and long-term financing, Mr. DelBuono said, "are being pursued with institutional and individual investors. Our construction schedule is conservative, with the timing dictated by financing."
Commercial development outside the theater site may not take place until 1999.
"We are delighted to have been chosen," said Mr. Wolff, one of the partners, "now the hard part starts."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: The Four Seasons;
A Landmark Upheld

 BODY:
The New York State Court of Appeals ruled last week that the Landmarks Preservation Commission had acted properly in designating the fashionable Four Seasons restaurant a landmark. The 5-to-0 ruling, written by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, upheld decisions by the State Supreme Court and the Appellate Division. Those decisions rejected arguments by the restaurant's landlord, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, that the designation would cause it economic loss because it would not be able to use the space for any other purpose.
The court also ruled that the commission was within its authority in giving landmark status to the striking interior architecture and furnishings, including the wide staircases, bronze railings, hanging sculptures, walnut bar, marble pool and ceiling panels. 
 The restaurant opened in 1959 in the Seagram Building, 99 East 52d Street. The commission designated both the building and the restaurant as landmarks in October 1989.
Marc P. Cherno, the landlord's lawyer, did not return a phone call. But a jubilant Laurie Beckelman, the commission chairwoman, said she was "especially pleased" with the ruling "as this is the first instance in which the highest court in the state has addressed an interior landmark designation."

HEADLINE: A SENSE OF PLACE

BYLINE: By Jay Romano

DATELINE: WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
WILLIAM S. HAINES JR. leaned against a green pickup truck and gazed out across an expanse of cranberry bogs that stretched nearly a mile in every direction. The bogs -- a checkerboard of large rectangular fields enclosed by raised dams and flooded with water from nearby reservoirs -- were bordered in the distance by stands of pitch pine, oak and American white cedar.
"This is absolutely the best part of New Jersey," Mr. Haines said, describing Hog Wallow, a section of Washington Township in Burlington County that is considered by some to be the epicenter of the Pinelands. 
 "If you meet somebody from another part of the country and you say you're from New Jersey, they look at you with a kind of pity," said Mr. Haines, a burly, bearded 40-year-old. "But this isn't the New Jersey they're thinking about."
Looking toward the horizon, where the pine trees met a crystal blue sky, he said, "This is the real New Jersey."
The bogs account for about one-tenth of the 11,000-acre farm that Mr. Haines's great-grandfather started in the 1890's. The rest of the acreage is devoted to the shallow reservoirs used to fill the bogs and the pristine forest that insures the purity of the groundwater that courses through the Pinelands.
Mr. Haines, who earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural economics at Cook College of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said that like his forebears, he plans on being a Pinelands cranberry farmer for the rest of his life.
"We've done this for a hundred years," he said while maneuvering his truck along the intersecting 12-foot-wide tops of the dams separating the water-filled bogs. "It's what we intend to keep on doing."
As a former first vice president of the New Jersey Farm Bureau, Mr. Haines has visited farms all over the state -- from Sussex County in the north to Cape May County in the south. And there is no place he would rather come home to than the family farm in Hog Wallow.
"I like the way it looks," he said. "I even like the way it smells," he added, alluding to the scent of the cranberry harvest.
The core of the Pinelands -- also known as the Pines, the Pine Barrens and the Pine Belt -- is a 650,000-are expanse of sparsely populated forested land that lies roughly within the triangle formed by Camden, Toms River and Atlantic City and contains communities with such unlikely names as Ongs Hat, Hanover Furnace, Friendship and Penny Pot. Traditional estimates place the population density of the area at about 15 residents per square mile.
"That's what I like about it," said Mr. Haines's father, William S. Haines Sr., 72, who still works the farm seven days a week. "It's the only place in New Jersey anymore that you can still be out in a real rural area."
The older Mr. Haines has lived on the farm since he was a newlywed 47 years ago. His wife died three years ago. And though his ZIP code is in Washington Township, his home is Hog Wallow in the Pinelands.
"I've got a place in Florida," he said, watching a team of workers harvest a bog topped with a floating layer of scarlet cranberries. "I never go down there much, though. I like it here."
The Pinelands were first settled by the Dutch in the 1600's. The settlers developed a brisk trade in timber, blueberries, glassmaking, ironmaking, shipbuilding and charcoal making. The area is most renowned, however, for its cranberry industry.
Pinelands cranberry farmers produce 4.45 million pounds of cranberries a year. As a result, New Jersey is now the third largest cranberry-producing state in the nation; only Massachusetts and Wisconsin produce more.
Most of the Pinelands, which covers about 22 percent of the state, is capped by a thick layer of sandy soil common in central and southern New Jersey.
"And underneath that nice sandy soil is one of the largest and purest aquifers in the country," said Terrence Moore, the executive director of the Pinelands Commission, a 15-member state panel that manages development in the Pinelands. The Cohansey aquifer, Mr. Moore said, contains more than 17 trillion gallons of water.
"We also have a number of endangered species," Mr. Moore said, explaining that in addition to "normal critters" like deer, muskrat, rabbits and beavers, the area also harbors corn snakes, timber rattlers, pine snakes and the Pine Barrens tree frog.
Some roads in the barrens cut poker-straight for miles through stands of tall pitch pine and cedar. Others, paved and unpaved, meander aimlessly through dense forest of dwarf pine and thickets of wild blueberry. It is not uncommon to drive for miles at a time and never pass a house, a driveway or even another car.
In 1978, the Federal Government designated the Pinelands a national preserve, creating the 1.1-million-acre Pinelands Preservation Area. The following year, the State Legislature, in response to the Federal act and concerned that encroaching development would irrevocably damage the delicate, pristine environment, passed the Pinelands Protection Act, strictly limiting construction within the preserve.
And while some farmers and property owners are opposed to the strict regulations -- they say that limiting development is a taking of their property without just compensation -- many inhabitants are happy that they won't be finding a shopping mall in the middle of a national preserve.
"They're letting too much building go on in the Pinelands already, I think," said Pearl Thomas of Southampton Township, who has lived in the area for all of her 71 years. "They want street lights; they want this; they want that. The people moving in want everything to be like it was where they came from. Most of them think cranberries grow on trees."
Mrs. Thomas was sitting in the temporary trailer office for this year's Cranberry Festival, an event held last weekend that drew more than 25,000 people.
"Years ago, people minded their own business," Mrs. Thomas said. "You could walk away from your house and come back and find it all there. You could trust your neighbors. Now, we're under lock and key."
Notwithstanding her concern for overcrowding and security, Mrs. Thomas said she could not even imagine living anywhere else.
"I was born and raised here," she said. "I'm not the outsider."
The folklore of the Pinelands paints its early inhabitants in less than flattering terms. In the early 1900's, one governor even suggested that its residents be segregated from the rest of the state because they led "lawless and scandalous lives."
The people of the Pines today, though, are generally well-educated, law-abiding, hard-working citizens. They love their land, cherish their privacy and seem to possess a contentment with their way of life that is rare in modern times and modern places.
Even some who do leave for what appear to be greener pastures eventually return.
"When you go out and see what everyplace else is like, it gives you perspective to see what you already have," said Mary Ann Thompson, chairwoman of this year's Cranberry Festival.
Ms. Thompson, a lawyer who worked for the United Nations and who has taught at the Rutgers Law School in Newark, has lived in New York, Atlanta and Washington, and has traveled extensively abroad. She returned to her home in Vincentown, a village with a total of eight streets, in the late 1970's.
"Now, whenever I talk to someone in the 201 area code, they think we're hicks," Ms. Thompson said.
But isn't a community with eight streets a bit quiet for a person with such cosmopolitan credentials?
"If it's too quiet, I can always go someplace where it's noisy," Ms. Thompson said. "That's one great thing about New Jersey. We're next to everyplace else that's noisy."

HEADLINE: At Work;
Will These Contract Talks Fly?

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
OBJECTIVE reality is the uninvited guest to virtually any labor-management negotiation, but rarely more so than in the current lengthy dispute between American Airlines and one of its unions, the 21,000-member Association of Professional Flight Attendants. Perhaps Srinivasa Ramanujan, the late Indian mathematical genius, could untangle the airline industry's wizardly compensation formulas and arrive at a kernel of pure truth.
Mere mortals wait in vain for any fact, factoid or fact-ette to stand up and bark. Are flight attendants still getting the shaft a decade after they made concessions, including allowing the company to impose its two-tier wage system, to save their jobs and, supposedly, the airline? Or is American a benevolent employer, simply seeking flexibility to allow it to compete in what every American man, woman, child and kitty cat by now agrees is a killer industry? 
 One thing is clear: those divergent views must soon converge. The flight attendants' contract with American Airlines became amendable last December. The airlines are governed by the National Railway Labor Act of 1926 and its agent, the National Mediation Board. The board's mandate is to keep any parties in a transportation industry dispute at the bargaining table until they resolve their differences, in effect extending contract deadlines, or they hit a wall.
Late last month, the board declared American and the attendants' union at an impasse. The dispute entered a 30-day "cooling off' period, during which the parties are supposed to go to their corners and come to their senses. The sides more typically continue making offers quietly while lobbying for advantage. Tomorrow everyone returns to the table in Washington to try to reach an agreement before the cooling off period ends on Friday. Meanwhile, the union has thrown up information picket lines at airports in 15 cities and has called a strike for "on or before Nov. 22," just as the Thanksgiving transmigrations begin. The company has canceled November vacations and issued a pamphlet to the attendants, entitled "What Happens to Me If the A.P.F.A. Calls a Strike?" Permanent replacement is not threatened for those who join the strike, but neither is it excluded.
The problem is how to judge the competing claims: Flight attendants have suffered a 40 percent decline in real wages since making heavy concessions in 1983, says the union. No, real wages have risen by 32 percent, says a spokesman for the AMR Corporation, American's Dallas-based parent. The carrier can afford to loosen its grip on the budget strings, the union says. "American Airlines isn't going broke," A.P.F.A. president Denise Hedges told a news conference in Dallas on Wednesday, shortly after AMR reported third-quarter earnings of $118 million, compared with a $100 million loss in the same quarter last year. "Insufficient but a step in the right direction," grumped Robert L. Crandall, AMR chairman. Changes in benefits would in effect reduce wages, says the union. Changes in benefits bring attendants into line with other work groups, says the company. And on and on.
American contends it is not asking from the flight attendants anything not already in place at other airlines -- for changes, in other words, it views as necessary to improve its competitive position. "We are the only major airline offering wage-scale increases," said Al Comeaux, a company spokesman. "We are not asking for any work-rule efficiencies that other airlines don't have."
The jackrabbit of the airlines race now is Southwest Airlines, also of Dallas, one of the few success stories in an industry that hit a sinkhole in the late 80's and has only just started to climb out. "Our costs for aircraft and gates are the same as Southwest," Mr. Comeaux said. "The one cost that's more controllable, more variable, is labor."
The union points out that Southwest runs a different and cheaper show, a system based on short hops with quick turnarounds and limited in-flight service. It especially galls the attendants that American is rated first in service but sixth in salary. The domestic pay scale now ranges from $14,988 for an entry-level attendant to $32,745 for someone at "max out," or step 14 -- 14 or more years of service. Under the company proposal, the maximum would rise to $36,430 in four years. The union wants "industry leading" wages, which could range anywhere from a tenth to a third higher than the current scale. The median salary is now $23,000, the average $25,000. Attendants, the union is quick to point out, are not Barbie dolls looking for adventure, who can sacrifice salary for travel privileges, but women and men trying to make a living and a career out of flying. "I was hoping this year to gross $20,000," said Diana Dunn, a union strike administrator who is entering her sixth year at American.
PERHAPS even more important than salary, however, is the gap between the union and the company on staffing planes, now a contractual issue the company would like to control. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration requires a minimum of three attendants on 727 flights. The union contract requires four. "On a late-night flight, with no meal, we still have to have four," AMR's Mr. Comeaux said.
The attendants are worried that if the airline begins tinkering with the schedules they now bid for on the basis of seniority -- and can count on roughly a month in advance -- eventually they will be reduced in effect to reserve status. They envision sitting by the phone, waiting for the company to call -- an efficiency for the airline, but a nightmare for anyone who wants a life. "The quality of work life changes dramatically," said Robert Clayman, the union's chief counsel. "It's equivalent to a speedup on an assembly line."
There is also resentment that the company wants to curtail the juggling schedules to extend vacation time, which for about two-thirds of attendants doesn't exceed 14 days until for their 11th year. The company says, indeed, it once encouraged its workforce to do that, but can no longer afford it.
Airline negotiations frequently reach the very edge of the precipice before the parties make a deal. The union appears to be more unified and better prepared than it was in 1987, when the last contract was forged, and the stagnant wider economy hasn't improved anyone's mood. But the betting is that both sides have too much at stake to jump.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
For Clinton, A Place on the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By Steven Greenhouse

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS a self-proclaimed New Democrat, President Clinton has tried to show that he has a warmer heart toward business than the Democrats of old. Notwithstanding corporate America's traditional skepticism toward Democrats, executives have been willing to give Mr. Clinton a hearing, but the bottom line is what his policies will mean for their companies' bottom line. On that, the jury is still out.
With an eye to helping business, Mr. Clinton has vowed to speed up growth, remove trade barriers and cut corporate health care costs. He has also pushed through a deficit-reduction plan, which his aides assert has gone far to push down long-term interest rates. All this, the Administration vows, will fatten profits. 
 But corporate America wishes it could be half as confident. Where Mr. Clinton boasts of deficit reduction, many executives see an increase in the corporate income tax rate to 35 percent, from 34. Where Mr. Clinton promises lower corporate medical bills, many companies are seeing red about requirements that they buy health insurance for all employees.
"Many of the Administration's economic policies either already have increased or will most likely increase the cost of doing business," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence.
To be sure, some companies will see fatter bottom lines as a result of Mr. Clinton's policies, while others will see leaner ones. But if businesses as a group can rejoice about anything that has happened on Mr. Clinton's watch, it is the plunge in long-term interest rates (although the Federal Reserve certainly shares the credit). Not only has this reduced the cost of borrowing, but by helping push up stock prices, lower rates have encouraged many companies to issue stock to replace their debt.
"In these ways, lower rates are reducing the cost of doing business," said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. By some estimates, lower rates could increase profits -- which stood at $282 billion at an annualized rate in the second quarter -- by $15 billion to $20 billion a year. Mr. Dederick forecasts an increase of 11 percent this year and 12 percent next year, compared with 7 percent in 1992.
Arguably the biggest effect Mr. Clinton will have on profits will turn on the effect he has on overall growth. If the tax increases that take effect next year crimp consumer and business spending, the economy could droop again, and profits along with it. But if low interest rates produce an unexpected surge in spending and investment, the economy and corporate profits could make a surprising bound upward.
What will all this mean for stocks? Perhaps, not very much.
One view, from Laurence H. Meyer, who runs a St. Louis consulting firm, is that so long as long-term rates stay low, the stock market won't sag, despite concerns that it is overpriced. And unless growth zooms unexpectedly above 3 percent, don't expect much of a rally either.

COMPANIES
 
Ever Get Burned by a Fast-Talking Broker? Now, Some Justice
Who says the small investor can't get justice? Who says you're out of luck when your broker assures you something's safe and you lose your shirt? Last week the little guy scored big when Prudential Securities agreed to pay $371 million to settle charges that it defrauded 400,000 investors. Part of that is fines, but the bulk of it -- $330 million -- will go to investors who can prove they got false promises or were otherwise cheated. (If, eyes wide open, you took a flier on a high-risk limited partnership and lost, forget it.) In 1989, Drexel agreed to shell out $650 million, but that was big-game stuff involving institutional investors; this is the largest settlement ever involving the mistreatment of, say, retirees who see modest nest eggs hacked away by fast-talking brokers. And it may get even bigger: Prudential, which made $1 billion on limited partnerships, must pay all claims -- no limits, no statutes of limitations. 

QVC Knocks Louder on the Door
It's called a tender offer, but tender it's not. It means the gloves are off. Last week QVC, ignored by Paramount's board even after coming courting with $9.5 billion in roses, got more aggressive by making an $80-a-share tender offer to stockholders for 51 percent of the company. The rest would be QVC stock. The total offer remains at $9.5 billion, but that's a lot more cash than anyone's mentioned yet. So where does that leave Viacom, the rival suitor? For now, with $7.5 billion in wilted roses in its hand.
 
A Shrinking Drug Industry
The drug industry's headache is getting worse. Big health care groups are flexing their buying muscle, and the Clinton plan includes sanctions to punish drug makers for high prices. A result: Drug makers have been shedding workers right and left. Last week Upjohn, Pfizer and American Cyanamid announced plans to cut a total of 7,000 workers. New York and New Jersey will surely feel the pain, because that's where a lot of the jobs are. Upjohn had the added problem that patents on two of its drugs -- the anxiety treatment Xanax and the insomnia remedy Halcion -- expired last week. But that's small consolation for the about-to-be-jobless who find themselves anxious and sleepless.
 
Mr. Sculley Knows Best?
Maybe John Sculley knows something we don't. After heading Apple Computer for a decade, he's got one of the heftier high-tech resumes. So you'd think that when he picked up the help-wanted ads after leaving Apple, he wouldn't head for a little company facing a spate of lawsuits alleging stock manipulation. But that's what he did last week, signing on as chairman and chief executive of Spectrum Information Technologies, which controls patents linked to wireless transmission of computer data. Spectrum's shares soared in May after a deal with A.T.& T., but then quickly drooped. But maybe Mr. Sculley does know something. Investors clearly think so. The magic of his name suddenly made Spectrum nearly a quarter of a billion dollars more valuable.
 
Citicorp on the Mend
Citicorp was in bad trouble several years ago, and one big culprit was commercial real estate loans. But it's been chipping away at that problem, and last week it said quarterly income had more than tripled, to $528 million. Citicorp stock didn't react much, but of course the shares have already more than tripled in two years.
 
Stew Leonard Gets His Bill
Stew Leonard has always done things big. His Connecticut stores rewrote all the rules, selling vast quantities of dairy goods and produce basically by putting on a continuous circus. So it's not surprising that when he turned his agile mind to something less wholesome, he'd dream up what's been called the country's largest computer-driven tax-evasion scheme. He doctored revenues, and the spare cash -- tens of thousands of dollars at a clip, $17 million or so in all -- would be put in suitcases and whisked off to St. Martin. Last week he paid the price, as a judge sentenced him to more than four years in prison and fined him $947,000. At the store, the show goes on.
 
A Whopper, Hold the Ads
This is what the fast-food customer is really saying: "A double order of your ads, please, and a burger and fries on the side." In the huge American fast-food derby, image is the main dish, so it's no wonder the big chains rack their brains for the right advertising. Some get it right, some just can't seem to. Which brings us, of course, to Burger King. Remember the "Herb the Nerd" ads? O.K., you'd rather not. Remember "We Do It Like You'd Do It"? Grammar aside, just try saying that three times quickly. So again last week, the chain's share of that golden market slipping, the frantically revolving door of Burger King ad agencies turned again. The company started hunting for a new agency for the bulk of its domestic advertising, lately handled by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles. Brace yourself for the next inspiration.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Nameless Cash? Lloyd's Accepts
It was so very British. To really be able to put your nose in the air, you had to take part in the odd ritual of putting your fortune, down to your kitchen chairs, behind Lloyd's of London. Upper-crust investors, quaintly called "names," had no limit on what they could lose -- a high-risk game seen as jolly good fun. Because of course one didn't lose with Lloyd's, one just kept making a respectable income. Until recently. A few years ago, amid billions in losses, the whole jolly game came crashing down, and a lot of "names" saw the fortunes of generations wiped out. So last week Lloyd's dumped a three-century tradition and allowed institutional and corporate investment.
 
An Auto Show for a New Japan
Japan's auto industry has come of age, and it's not happy about it. For in this industry, coming of age means you don't keep growing year after year. As Detroit well knows, it means mixing good years with bad. Japan's sobered car makers had a coming-out party of sorts last week, a Tokyo Motor Show more subdued than usual. There was talk of fuel conservation, safety and "ecolution" (a mix of ecology and evolution). "But they are not talking about the market," one analyst said. "It's almost like they want to hide the problems." But then again, their problems pale next to those faced by Detroit a few years ago.
 
Economics Saves Chernobyl
It's apparently one more price to be paid for the Soviet breakup. Almost everyone wants the Chernobyl nuclear plant closed: American experts cite numerous safety flaws, and Ukraine's 1991 decision to scrap it this year was applauded by the plant's neighbors. But Ukraine has budget deficits and needs energy badly -- nuclear power accounts for 35 percent of its electricity -- and it owes Russia $2.5 billion for oil and gas. So last week the Ukrainian Parliament changed its mind, voting to keep it open. That leaves the rest of the world, remembering the 1986 disaster, with an awful lot of crossed fingers.
 
Cheering Germany's Rate Cut
Germany cut its key interest rates again, and all of Europe celebrated. Stock markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris hit all-time highs on Friday, as investors bet that the rate cuts would give a much-needed lift to Germany's economy -- and thus Europe's.
 
ECONOMY
 
A U.S. Blessing on Recycling
This nation is rapidly becoming committed to recycling, but the flip side of the equation doesn't work yet. Americans are dutifully putting so much paper in their recycling bins that it's piling up in warehouses. That's because the market for used paper is so weak. So in a move to hasten the completion of this cycle, President Clinton put pen to (recycled?) paper last week, issuing an executive order requiring Federal agencies to buy paper made from at least 20 percent recycled fiber by the end of next year, and 30 percent in five years. The Government buys less than 2 percent of the country's paper, but Mr. Clinton wants to send a message to states and cities. The paper industry was skeptical, voicing concern that paper-mill operations would be disrupted, but environmentalists called it a victory, with one saying the order would save more than a million trees. We could, of course, just use less paper (this page excluded, naturally).
 
Pecking at the Health Plan
President Clinton knew his health plan would have enemies, but he was also counting on a few friends, like the National Association of Manufacturers. This group mainly represents companies that provide health coverage, and would benefit in not having to compete against lower-cost rivals that do not. The plan, though, "is too ambitious, and must be dramatically scaled back," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, the group's president. But Mr. Clinton is not going to settle for bits and pieces on this one; he wants to fix the health mess, now.
 
Collider Collides With Congress
Not many people understand the Superconducting Supercollider. Is it tomorrow's science or yesterday's sinkhole? Physicists talk of crashing protons at nearly the speed of light. But Congress saw a 10-mile hole under the Texas plains, a hole that's already cost $2 billion. The total cost is now put at $11 billion, more than twice original estimates. Last week, after much hemming and hawing, it pulled the plug. "A sad day for science," one backer said. But the day was won by those who said there just wasn't enough money.

HEADLINE: Feeling the Bumps in the Road At the Tokyo Auto Show

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
IN 1985, visitors to the auto show here were treated to a preview of Honda's new Accord, a car that crossed the Pacific and outsold all American models for three years running. The 1989 show marked the first sighting of Lexus, the Toyota luxury sedan that displaced Cadillacs, Mercedeses and Jaguars from garages of the wealthy.
The once-obscure Tokyo Motor Show, held every other year, had suddenly become a gallery for the dynamic imagination of Japan's auto industry, whose creations provoked nightmares from Detroit to Turin. 
 But a visitor to this year's show, which opened to the public yesterday, could see how that nightmare has become less frightening from an American point of view. With Japanese sales slumping at home and abroad -- a result of the country's recession, a soaring yen and Western retaliation in the form of savvier car design and improved quality -- this year's exhibits are heavy on future technology but light on dramatic new models likely to be sold soon in the United States. Japanese auto makers, to save money, are introducing new models more slowly than during the salad days of the late 1980's.
Still, a close examination of the exhibits suggests that the car companies already are gearing for better days. They evidently are sure that consumers will buy -- and governments will mandate -- cars that pollute less, consume less energy, are easier to recycle and minimize safety hazards. And despite the strong yen, the Japanese are finding ways to cut costs so new technologies will be affordable. For example, Toyota's just-released annual report, which is handed out at the company's exhibit, brags that engineers are saving money by the once-unthinkable practice of using some parts from last year in next year's models.
Specifically, the report mentions mirrors that can be used on a number of models, thereby saving the development cost incurred each time a new one is designed.
The money Toyota saves on new mirrors and the like can be spent toward further development of the EV-50, an experimental electric passenger car on view at the show here. Under California law, by 1998, 2 percent of sales in that state by the biggest-selling auto makers, including Toyota, Honda and Nissan, must be of vehicles that are virtually emission-free.
"The EV-50 is the most important car here, though the company isn't happy about selling electric cars because our engineers say they don't work very well," said James Olson, senior vice president of Toyota's United States sales subsidiary. Powered by lead acid batteries, the four-seater can reach a top speed of just 72 miles per hour, and it has a range of about 155 miles before recharging, which can take several hours.
(Toyota kept one crucial new car, called Avalon, under wraps in a studio. The auto maker earlier this month announced it will build the six-seat sedan, which replaces the Cressida, in its Georgetown, Ky., plant in 1995. The car will sell in the United States for about $30,000. "Boring," was the description of one Toyota executive of Avalon's looks. "But I'm too young to be a typical buyer.")
The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation has addressed the electric vehicle's problem of limited range and power with ESR, a prototype of a "hybrid" car that is powered by batteries but also has a small, efficient, low-polluting gasoline engine. The car runs on its batteries alone or in conjunction with its engine, which doesn't directly power the car but instead is used to charge the batteries.
With the engine giving a boost to the batteries, the ESR claims a range of more than 620 miles and a top speed of 125 m.p.h. -- superior performance among prototypes developed to comply with California law. The ESR, Mitsubishi believes, could meet California's strict emissions requirement, but for now the company does't plan to use the car's hybrid technology. Instead, it is considering a number of other options, including a different electric car on which it is working.
For the here and now, Mitsubishi displayed a retracting hardtop version of its 3000 GT sports car to be sold within a year in the United States, built in Long Beach, Calif., jointly with the ASC Corporation of Southgate, Mich. With the touch of a button, the metal and glass roof deployed and retracted smoothly into the trunk -- while gawking viewers snapped pictures furiously.
The Mazda Motor Corporation alone has staked its bet on hydrogen, rather than electricity, as the nonpolluting energy source that can satisfy environmental concerns. Mazda's HR-X2 prototype claims significantly better range, almost 150 miles, than an earlier hydrogen prototype shown two years ago. One reason the range is still modest is the weight and bulkiness of the equipment needed to safely carry hydrogen, which has an explosive nature. But in terms of speed and acceleration, the HR-X2 performs much like a normal car.
Unlike almost every other combustible fuel, hydrogen does not produce carbon dioxide, which is blamed for contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Burning hydrogen yields water. How an infrastructure would be built to produce and distribute large amounts of hydrogen for drivers remains a mystery, but Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry plans to study the possibilities.
THE HR-X2's body is made of liquid-crystal polymer, a light and easily recyclable material. Mazda thinks the polymer is sturdy enough to pass crash tests. Moreover, the body swiftly detaches from the HR-X2's metal suspension so its components can be sorted upon retiring the vehicle from operation and disassembling it. European countries, Japan and some states are considering tough regulations that eventually may make crushing or shredding entire cars prohibitively expensive.
Responding to what it hopes will be more immediate market forces, Mazda unveiled a chic-looking, conventionally powered luxury sedan called the Eunos 800, which soon will appear in American showrooms as the Mazda Millenia. The Eunos 800, meant to compete with Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, is a remnant of Mazda's ill-fated Amati line of luxury cars. Amati was to have been a separate franchise, but it fell to the ax in 1992 due to the high yen and sagging sales of Japanese luxury models.
THE Honda Motor Company showed its EVX electric car, a version of which it is nearly ready to produce. The headlights are designed to use just a tiny amount of power, and solar cells mounted on the vehicle's roof can recharge the batteries a bit when the sun is out.
But Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president, voiced skepticism similar to that expressed by other auto executives. "I don't think it will pay as a business," he told reporters. In other words, he said, Honda and others must be ready to bear the expense of electric vehicles if they want to stay in business in California.
Honda's FSR (for "future safety research") prototype embodies features that Honda engineers believe may appear in cars around the turn of the century. Headlamps that move and cameras on the nose improve visibility on blind curves and at intersections. Reflective paint on the body makes the car more visible at night, particularly from the side. In Japan the single biggest category of traffic fatalities involves pedestrians, so the research is especially relevant here.
Subaru, the brand name used by Fuji Heavy Industries, brought a few perky prototypes to the auto show, but the only car that mattered greatly was an actual model for sale, the new Legacy. The car resembled most other Japanese sedans of its size, except for a distinctive scooped-out portion onits hood.
Fuji lost more than six billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 31; that's $50 million at the rate of exchange then in effect. Without improved United States sales from its new Legacy, most analysts say, Subaru has little chance of hanging on as an independent auto maker in the crowded North American market. In the Japanese tradition, Subaru may well be forced into an arranged marriage with a larger, less financially strapped Japanese car maker.
The problem is that many Japanese car makers are now financially strapped, while many Western auto makers are on the comeback trial.
That shift in fortunes has had an impact on the status of the auto show itself. Executives from the West used to arrive here, filled with anticipation and dread, to discover what new bombshells would explode in their faces. But now, "the focus point again is Detroit," said Koichi Amemiya, president of Honda sales in North America.
Indeed, these days Japanese executives are traveling to shows in the United States and Europe with just as much anticipation and dread as their American counterparts felt upon arrival here not long ago.
The most talked-about car to debut in a show this year was not a Honda or a Toyota. It was Chrysler's Neon subcompact, which grabbed the spotlight last month -- in Frankfurt. The Neon, which is designed to compete directly with small Japanese cars, isn't even on view here this week, because Chrysler at the moment has no plans to sell it in this country.

HEADLINE: Profile: Kenneth Stone;
His Message for Mom & Pop: There's Life After Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: MERRILLVILLE, Ind.

 BODY:
IN the late 1980's, after spending more than a decade helping Iowa towns and businesses cope with change, a rising tide of phone calls and speaking invitations alerted Dr. Kenneth Stone that he might have the best data in the nation on what happens when Wal-Mart and other mass merchants move into a community.
Since then, the mild-mannered 57-year-old Iowa State University economist has diligently accumulated something even more precious: insights into how local retailers can survive -- even thrive -- when Wal-Mart and its competitors, like Kmart, the nation's No. 2 retail chain, roar into town. 
 Now, as mass merchants expand across the landscape, Mr. Stone is being run ragged. Although admits that he lacks stage presence and a gift for gab, audiences, like the lawn and garden shop owners who recently came here to northwest Indiana to hear him, can't get enough of him. "What's fascinating about all this is that a lot of people say they have come back to hear me two or three times, even though I think I am a boring speaker," Mr. Stone said.
That demand certainly won't taper off as long as he does so little to capitalize on his sudden renown. The ride from obscurity to guru status has made Mr. Stone richer than he ever imagined, but not nearly as wealthy as he could be. By hanging on to his job as a state extension economist, Mr. Stone is committed to working free within Iowa. And when he uses his free time for outside consulting, he sticks to a standard fee of $1,000 plus expenses, a fee that is laughably modest on the business consulting circuit. Although Mr. Stone said he plans to experiment with variable fees, he is determined to stay available to small communities and groups for whom even $1,000 is "a stretch."
Typically, Mr. Stone starts his talks with a broad perspective. Here, he told the garden shop owners they were seeing the "over-storing of America," citing not just such mass merchants as Wal-Mart, but shopping clubs and "category killer" chains like Toys 'R' Us. "The reason I pick on Wal-Mart is that they are leading the way," he said.
In truth, Mr. Stone does not so much pick on Wal-Mart and its rivals as pick over their strategies and use them as lessons. Some advice comes in the form of admonishments to learn what works, like staying open on Sunday. Some advice centers on how to cooperate with mass merchants, like signing agreements to service equipment they sell. And some comes down to blunt warnings, like don't try to undercut their price on items like disposable diapers or toothpaste unless you are located far enough away that they are not routinely checking your prices.
One key to Mr. Stone's appeal is that he persuades audiences that he has thought about their individual concerns. Here, for example, instead of simply saying it is important to carry product lines that Wal-Mart overlooks, he mentioned bonsai trees and other specifics. And he talked about Kmart, which has been emphasizing lawn and garden products.
Mr. Stone has delivered similar pep talks to tire and carpet makers, newspaper distributors, hardware shops, eyeglass retailers and grocers. He has done it in Iowa towns so small they barely appear on maps, and in cities as large as Oakland, Calif. He has traveled to every state except Delaware in the last five years.
In recent months, with Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., headed toward the New York City region, Mr. Stone has spoken to New York-area grocers at the Tavern on the Green restaurant in Central Park, to rural retailers and community leaders from New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania at a meeting in Middletown, N.Y., and on Long Island.
The eldest of seven children who grew up in St. Marie, an agricultural hamlet in southeastern Illinois, Mr. Stone recalls suffering "unbearable shyness" when he began speaking publicly. He seems to have as many anecdotes as Wal-Mart does products but, faced with an audience, he tells them sparsely, building toward conclusions rather than punchlines. In a story used to underscore the value of good labeling, he simply said he had never realized Wal-Mart catered to elderly shoppers by making price labels large enough to read without bifocals until he absentmindedly left his glasses in the car on a recent visit to an outlet in Iowa.
Mr. Stone may not entertain audiences, but his data often surprise them. Wal-Mart and the other discounters, for instance, attract more high-income customers than is commonly believed. They have begun to offer better service too, using such tactics as hiring horticulturalists for their lawn and garden sections.
While discounters are zealous about setting bargain prices on several hundred items, there are tens of thousands more whose prices are similar to -- or higher than -- those of smaller retailers. And although everyone realizes the mass merchants are growing, the magnitude of this still stuns many people when Mr. Stone lays it out for them.
THE centerpiece, of course, is Wal-Mart, which grew from $1.2 billion in sales in 1980 to $55.5 billion in 1992. "This company has a good chance of becoming the biggest business in the United States," Mr. Stone said.
Still, the secret of Mr. Stone's success is that his data give him the ring of authority. That aura is reinforced by his bearing, which includes traces of a military career that took him on two tours of duty in Vietnam. And his talk reflects the years he worked as an engineer in the military industry before seeking a Ph. D. in agricultural economics at the University of Illinois.
"He reaffirmed a lot of things we knew we needed to know," said Steve Tholen, whose family owns the Tholen's Landscape and Garden Center stores in Kankakee and Boubonnais, Ill. With 35 employees and just $1.7 million in revenues, Tholen's now finds itself within a few miles of a Wal-Mart, a new Super Kmart, Venture, Target, three big home-improvement chain stores and three lumber yards, all of which are aiming at parts of Tholen's business.
Mr. Tholen and his wife, Nancy, said Mr. Stone persuaded them that they had to spend more time checking competitors' prices and more time and money training employees to offer customers expert advice.
Dr. Stone's favorite testimonial came from a hardware shop owner who came up to him after a meeting in Denver and said an earlier talk by Mr. Stone had saved his business. The shop owner had been planning to quit when a Wal-Mart opened nearby but, after hearing Mr. Stone, he sought and won a contract to service power equipment sold by the discount giant. He ended up with higher total sales, Mr. Stone said.
Mr. Stone has mixed feelings about the thank-you message that Emily Teller of Westford, Mass., left on his answering machine last month. She thanked him for the contacts he provided and the role his research had played in helping her and other community activists block an attempt by Wal-Mart to open in their town.
That research is not entirely unfavorable to Wal-Mart. It shows that the original wave of expansion actually broadened the shopping region of many towns, helping to bring new customers to local merchants. For some stores, the added customers offset business lost to Wal-Mart. Increasingly, though, the chains are making sure fewer people must travel long distances to get to them, leaving local retailers to fight it out with the discounters.
Mr. Stone is delighted if such data help persuade communities not to grant discounters tax abatements, but he does not want his work to be used to impose artificial restraints on the mass merchants' growth. Indeed, Mr. Stone said he has no qualms about sharing retail trade data with chains seeking good locations in Iowa. And he has no sympathy for local merchants who are unwilling to work harder and smarter when competition picks up.
Wal-Mart is among those impressed by such evenhandedness. "As near as I can tell, Dr. Stone tells people facts about Wal-Mart, about retailing and about their business, and lets the chips fall where they may," said Donald Shinkle, Wal-Mart's chief spokesman.
MR. STONE did not see anything momentous brewing in 1988, when he published research on the impact of Wal-Mart's arrival on some small Iowa communities. He had been beavering away at the obscure task of studying the economic decline of rural communities since getting his Ph. D. in 1976.
By taking advantage of Iowa's sales tax reporting system, which churns out data from the state's 856 towns and cities by retail category, Mr. Stone built a unique data base to study Wal-Mart's impact, and mass retailing trends in general. Once word of his studies got around, journalists, retailers and economic development officials around the nation began calling Mr. Stone.
"It's been quite a run," he said. He credits the consulting income with putting two sons through college and helping him and his wife, Janis, an Iowa State researcher, put away more retirement savings. But they have not moved from the house they have lived in for 16 years. Until recently, Mr. Stone had always felt that demand for his insights was about to peak. Now he expects to have more business than he can handle.
Why not hire an associate, as have many successful consultants? Mr. Stone says it would be appealing to have more time for research, but he has already turned down several offers from retail executives and others to work with him. "I have too difficult a time coordinating myself to take anyone else on," he said.

NOTES

BYLINE: By Dan Shaw

 BODY:
New York's movers and shakers won't have to stay home and watch "60 Minutes" on Sunday nights in November. Al Pacino's film "Carlito's Way" will have its premiere on Nov. 7, followed by a supper party at the Plaza. On the 14th, celebrities and their children will be at Planet Hollywood for burgers, fries and a screening of the film "Addams Family Values." Then there's the premiere of the film "George Balanchine's 'The Nutcracker,' " and a fund-raiser for the New York City Ballet and the School of American Ballet at the Ziegfeld Theater on Nov. 21.
"Sundays nights are ideal because I don't have to compete with all the other charity balls and parties," said Peggy Siegal, the publicity agent who is coordinating the screenings. 
 God's Love We Deliver, the nonprofit group that delivers meals to people with AIDS, has just mailed out its first holiday catalogue, which features mugs, T-shirts, gingerbread cookies and six-foot fir Christmas trees ($80).
The first Hamptons International Film Festival, which ends today after a five-day run, apparently wasn't an economic boon for all Hamptons businesses. On Thursday, the 10-room Bridgehampton Motel, the haute roadside rest stop run by Alexis Stewart, still had vacancies.

Volkswagen Introduces A New Golf And Jetta

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
THE first new import to live in our driveway was a Volkswagen Rabbit, a tomato-red '77 model that we loved dearly. Actually, the car belonged to my wife, and it was the first new car that she had bought on her own.
The interior was black, and it packed an incredible amount of room into a small, square package. We took the car camping, and we used it for all the usual family trucking. It was thrifty and it was terrific. 
 Those were the days, of course, when VW was synonymous with success, coming off its long run with the Beetle. They were the days before the company somehow gave away its seemingly invincible role as America's favorite overseas visitor.
I have always thought that a big part of VW's problem was the success itself -- its dealers here simply became too fat, too arrogant. In any case, it is a long, sad tale, and the only reason for bringing it up now is that another "Rabbit" has come for a brief stay.
The name long ago changed to Golf, which was what Rabbits had always been called in Germany, and the new vehicle is a Golf III GL. It is a pretty metallic turquoise, and it is one of the very few 1993 models that Volkswagen has managed to get into the country this year.
Introductions of the four-door Golf III hatchback and its semi-twin, the Jetta III sedan, were delayed for almost a year because of labor troubles and production problems in Puebla, Mexico, where the cars are built. Dealers have had few to sell, and as of September sales had plunged 44.7 percent from 1992.
The company's share of the market has also shrunk to an almost invisible 0.32 percent, and the dealers have been kept in business through company subsidies. Now, though, the '94 cars are coming, and a steady flow is expected. The new compacts are basically the same as the '93 tester -- but with the important additions of standard dual air bags and optional antilock brakes.
Prices will rise $600 because of the air-bag installation, and that means a base sticker for the Golf of $12,500. The Jetta, which has the same interior but adds some standard niceties, will start at $13,725. Air-conditioning, updated with an environmentally friendly refrigerant, is an $850 option, and a new four-speed automatic transmission is optional at $875.
No price has been announced for the antilock brakes, which will come early next year, along with a two-door version of the Golf and a hot Jetta sport sedan offering a 172-horsepower V6 and traction control.
For the moment, though, all Golfs and Jettas use a 2-liter four that sends 115 horses to the front wheels through a standard five-speed stick. Economy is about 24 miles per gallon, city, and 31, highway, and the 14.5-gallon tank means a trip-range of 450 miles between fill-ups.
The new Golf still looks a bit like that long-lost red Rabbit, but it is far rounder -- and smoother and more rigid than the previous Golf as well. It has a body-colored grille, teardrop headlamps and a wider stance. Bumpers, too, are the same hue as the body, and there is a low liftover at the rear, making it easy to load cargo.
And cargo, human and otherwise, is what the little Volkswagen has always been about. The hatch rises on twin gas struts to reveal a "trunk" that will swallow 17 cubic feet of whatnot. That is 3.6 cubic feet bigger than the trunk of a Lexus LS 400 and 3.7 cubic feet more than you get in a Honda Civic hatchback.
Further, the rear bench folds flat, generating a gigantic 41 cubic feet of space. With the seat in place (and, incidentally, it is backed with sheetmetal to protect against objects flying forward in a crash), the new Golf carries four in comfort.
Headroom is good, front and rear, even allowing for the space taken up by the tester's optional $575 flip-or-slide sunroof. The interior is done in vinyl and cloth, and the front buckets offer good support, with long lower cushions and fully reclining backs.
The restyled dash is gently rounded and softer than in the past. Controls are easy to use, and there are dual cupholders at the front of the center console, with a single cupholder folding out of the rear.
Gauges include dials for fuel and temperature, with a large tachometer and an amusingly optimistic 140-m.p.h. speedometer. Performance, though, is all that can be asked, given the car's weight, which is 2,500 to 2,700 pounds, depending on the model and equipment.
On the road, the Golf is solid, even a bit stiff in the Teutonic tradition, but it is quiet and comfortable, with good acceleration and handling that has been enhanced by the wider stance.
For the driver, it is fun -- and it is odd as well. For instance, it might be expected that an economy car would have only rollup knobs for the windows. And the lack of power adjustment for the seats and the sideview mirrors is no surprise.
But then both Golf and Jetta have a central locking system that even buttons up the fuel-filler flap. And there is also a luxurious tinkling chime to warn if you open a door and forget to take your keys.
There is some confusion here about where Spartan ends and upscale begins. As I recall, however, Volkswagens were always a bit quirky. Maybe the company really is on the way back.

HEADLINE: GARDENING;
From Tulipmania to a Glory of Spring

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST

 BODY:
THERE is still time to plant hardy spring-flowering bulbs. But the opportunity is fast dwindling since the bulbs must grow roots before the ground freezes. It is these roots that absorb the soil's moisture, which in turn pushes up the leaves and the stems that support the flowers.
Tulips will probably take top priority this year, in celebration of their 400th anniversary. To mark the event, the Netherlands begins a yearlong tulip quadricentennial. The country, the center of an industry that propagates more than 3,500 tulip hybrids and species that are planted in gardens all over the world, has long been noted for its beautiful tulips and its vast bulb-growing fields are indeed a sight to be seen. 
 The Netherlands was home base for that era known as Tulipmania, when bulb prices eventually bankrupted many private fortunes. History records show that one tulip bulb was priced as high as 3,000 Dutch guilders or about $1,500.
Records also show that shortly thereafter a single bulb was sold for 4,500 guilders or $2,250 plus a horse and carriage. But prices have settled down and today tulip bulbs are about 50 cents each.
The bulb-selling craze or Tulipmania traces a fascinating record through history. The so-called father of the tulip industry was believed to be Carolus Clusius, an elderly botanist at the University of Leiden. He planted his handful of bulbs there in a garden in 1593.
Little did Clusius know what he had started. The Dutch populace had never seen tulips in bloom. The new flowers caused a sensation in the 17th century and soon became the rage. Those who could afford the flowers flaunted them as symbols of power and prestige. Demand for the bulbs accelerated to a fever pitch and growers were even selling futures on bulb crops that had not yet been harvested. The craze continued until 1637, when the market crashed and Tulipmania came to an abrupt end.
The original bulbs and seeds that Clusius planted came from Ogier Ghiselain de Busbecq, the Hapsburgs' ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. At the time of his ambassadorship, de Busbecq gave his collection of tulip bulbs and seeds to his friend Carolus Clusius. At the time, Clusius was prefect of the Imperial Garden in Vienna. By the time he returned to the University of Leiden, Clusius had already been experimenting and cross breeding tulips.
Although many at first thought that the tulip originated in Turkey, it is now felt that the tulip originated farther east, in the steppes of Armenia, Persia and the Caucasus. The tulip then spread to the region around the Black Sea, throughout the Mediterranean area and possibly even into China.
Many of the early wild tulips are called species tulips or botanicals in bulb catalogues, and they are sold to gardeners today. The tulips are small and delicate, as found in nature, and have not been bred or hybridized. They are delightful to grow and well worth having.
It is now believed that as early as 1000 A.D. the Turkish populace was starting to cultivate tulips. The flowers were favored in the courts of Suleiman the Magnificent, who was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1520 to 1566, and it is thought that Ambassador Busbecq first saw the tulips during one of his visits to the Court of the Ottoman Empire.
One of the curious things about the earlier tulips was the unusual mottled appearance of the flowers. They were shorter in stature and had two-tone mixed colors. Since they were featured in so many of the paintings of the Dutch masters, these tulips became known as the Rembrandt tulips.
When researchers delved into this peculiarity, they found that the mottled effect was not in the breeding, but was caused by the mosaic virus. Sale of diseased tulip bulbs is no longer permitted. However, the unusual patterns have now been duplicated in healthy tulips and the Rembrandt tulip look-alikes are available for sale.
Some of the modern tulips to look for are Union Jack, Cordell Hull, Shirley and Sorbet.
Another plus for modern research has been the formation of the Royal Dutch Bulb Growers Association, which maintains the industry's standards. There is also a living museum of bulb flowers maintained in the town of Limmen. Plantings there by the Hortus Bulborum preserve the gene pool used by the modern bulb hybridizers. The museum also has one of the original hybrids of Clusius, Duc van Tol, which he developed in 1595.
It has been estimated that American gardeners will plant as many as 270 million tulip bulbs this fall. One advantage for all bulbs is that these spring glories can often be planted where summer flowering plants cannot, because the trees' canopies provide too much shade.
Spring-flowering bulbs like the tulips will bloom long before the trees leaf out.

HEADLINE: Reduce Oil Imports Before the Next Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is particularly distressing that not only have we forgotten the lessons of two oil embargoes and the Persian Gulf War but also that we are still paying their economic price ("After 20 Years America's Foot Is Still on the Gas," The Week in Review, Oct. 17). Although we complain about automobile imports, the importation of oil costs us twice as much and is the biggest item in our negative balance of trade. 
 One of the only real successes in getting off oil in the last two decades has been in the electric utility sector, which since 1973 has reduced its use by a million barrels a day. This has been achieved through the construction of new coal and nuclear plants, which accounted for almost all new electrical capacity.
Yet even in this area we are still in jeopardy of returning to significant oil use. A large fraction of the old oil-fired plants have been modified to burn both natural gas and oil. The new wave of natural gas-fired plants now being built will be able to burn oil as well. Thus any sharp runup in gas prices or problems in the pipeline system could trigger large-scale increases in the consumption of imported oil to generate power.
A long-term solution to the oil import problem lies in more efficient vehicles, for which there can be no choice but to use liquid fuels, and the use of our vast domestic sources of coal and nuclear energy for power generation. Now is the time to make these investments while no crises loom and while energy prices and interest rates are relatively low.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Season of Fear;
Polititians Feel a Crime-Induced Chill in the Air

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT could be your next-door neighbor describing her fear for the safety of her teen-agers when they leave the house on weekend nights -- but it isn't. It's Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey, looking squarely into the camera as she tries to convince voters that she is not soft on crime, as Gov. Jim Florio would have them believe.
"As Governor," she says in a new campaign ad, "nobody will be tougher than me on drunk drivers and criminals, especially those who prey on women and children." 
 Mrs. Whitman did not have to emphasize her point with the usual campaign-season props of bloodied bodies and blaring sirens. People are already afraid.
Crime, always a potent political issue, has taken on a chilling new character for many Americans. In the public imagination, hard-core criminals can no longer be expected to simply rob and kill; they now seem to carry out their deeds with unparalleled wantonness, even exultation, and the criminal-justice system, when not directly part of the problem, hardly seems up to the challenge.
Many recent episodes are feeding the fear: There was the Mayor of Washington, D.C., Sharon Pratt Kelly, on Friday asking President Clinton for authority to call out the National Guard to combat the city's soaring homicide rate. There was the Reginald Denny beating case, which ended in Los Angeles last week with convictions of his assailants, but not on the most serious charges against them -- despite what to many people was damning videotaped evidence of brutality against the truck driver followed by a jig of glee. (Details of the verdict, page 2.) There was the police beating of Rodney King before that, and the initial acquittals of the officers that touched off the Los Angeles riots in the first place. There were the highway killings of foreign tourists in Florida, and the torching there of a black tourist from New York (bringing life sentences for his assailants last week). There was the roadside murder of the father of the basketball star Michael Jordan. Carjackings. The list goes on and on.
Like Mayor Kelly, politicians around the nation, many with an eye to Election Day a week from Tuesday, are responding to the perception that violent crime has sped out of control and that the criminal-justice system in many cases has broken down (witness the recent hearings on police corruption in New York City).
Last week Attorney General Janet Reno pointedly placed a large share of blame on television, warning industry executives that if they didn't tone down televised violence, the Government would compel them to.
In gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and in mayoral races in New York, Detroit, Miami and other cities, the heightened debate over crime has brought to the fore not so much new remedies but age-old tensions between Republicans and Democrats: Do you lock up more offenders? Hand out stiffer sentences? Or should the priority be getting guns off the streets?
 
Gun Control Gains Favor
 As the New Jersey race illustrates, the Democrats have the potential to make the issue their own as the National Rifle Association loses clout and as voters favor measures like the ban pushed through by Mr. Florio on certain semiautomatic weapons. Paradoxically, Republicans used to point to Democrats' support for gun control as evidence that they were soft on law and order. A test for Democrats in Congress is whether, after years of failed efforts, they can pass a strong anti-crime package this year.
Inescapably, the debate over crime has been complicated by the issue of race. The revulsion over the Los Angeles riots helped the election of Mayor Richard Riordan, a self-described law-and-order politician and the first Republican to hold that office in a generation. In the mayoral race in New York, there are tensions over whether the tough-on-crime stance of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican challenging Mayor David N. Dinkins, is a subtle appeal to prejudice.
"We've seen a difference in the nature of crime -- a bravado where you've got juveniles who have no fears," said Charles M. Oberly, the Attorney General of Delaware who is running as a Democrat for Senate next year. "It's an expedient political issue: What else do you tell people when you can't get them jobs and you've got an economy that's stagnant? So there's fear-mongering going on, and the public is ripe for it."
While the nation's overall crime rate dropped slightly in 1992 -- the first time it had not increased in eight years -- the most violent crimes, especially rape and aggravated assault, continued to rise, according to the F.B.I.'s Uniform Crime Report.
In politics, in any case, it is perceptions that count. So as people buy up burglar alarms in record numbers, they say in surveys that they feel less safe, even in their own homes, than ever before. In a poll conducted last April by L. H. Research for the Harvard School of Public Health, 94 percent of Americans said crime had gotten worse in comparison with the time they were growing up.
Mark Melman, a Democratic pollster, said crime is the No. 1 issue for mayoral candidates he is advising this year in Seattle and New Orleans, but not because crime is on the rise. "The real crime rate and peoples' perceptions are two different things," he said.
Already, Democrats are upbeat about their fortunes. Recalling that Mr. Clinton got a standing ovation when he mentioned the crime issue at a dinner for Senate Democrats, Don Foley, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign, said: "That's something I didn't expect to see from a Democratic audience in my lifetime." As the Democrats grow more comfortable with the issue, Republicans seem increasingly uneasy. Just as they moderated their opposition to abortion four years ago, many are changing tack on gun control now. Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, a Republican, reversed himself last month and proposed some of the most stringent gun control laws in the country.
Yet many Republicans are still torn over how best to shore up their reputation for toughness on crime. Haley Barbour, the Republican Party chairman, echoed the Democrats' dire concerns about crime, but made clear that a call for gun control was not part of his pitch.
"In some parts of Washington, D.C., people say they are afraid to go out of their houses," he said, dismissing the city's gun control law. "And they know that the only way that you're going to do something about that is to have sure and severe punishment to violent criminals."
Stuart A. Scheingold, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in crime and politics, has little patience for candidates who are talking up crime. "This is all symbolic," he said. "But everybody's avoiding the really tough issues of addressing the fundamental social conditions that are breeding this."
As an example, the much-promoted Clinton crime bill, which would extend the death penalty to 50 crimes, has been criticized as a rehash of a proposal by President Bush.
For now, many politicians are doing little more about crime than making commercials. In a spot strikingly similar to Mrs. Whitman's, Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle, a Democrat, strolls through a residential neighborhood, assuring voters: "I hear you. These are our streets. And we must take them back."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Promoting Home-Grown Ideas for Cleaner Air

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BURTON TRIBBLE came from Kansas to the nation's capital last week to volunteer the services of his 3,000 swine for the Clinton Administration's war against the greenhouse effect.
At the White House, Vice President Al Gore cited the hog farmer as an example of what business can do to cut the emissions of gases that trap the sun's heat within the atmosphere, possibly raising the earth's temperature enough to do serious environmental damage in years to come. 
 The United States signed a treaty last year pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, and the Administration last week produced a plan that calls for achieving the goal primarily through voluntary efforts and profit incentives rather than strict new regulations.
So what can a hog farmer do about it?
At the Tribble spread near Nortonville, Kan., the pollution takes the form of methane rising from a 20-foot-high tank where a slurry of pig manure ripens until it is used as fertilizer. Mr. Tribble wants to spend more than $100,000 installing a lid on the tank and other equipment to capture the methane and burn it for heat and electricity. He estimates that he will halve his energy bills and pay for the investment in less than five years.
It is not a terribly novel concept, but neither is it widely practiced on American farms, and Mr. Tribble said he has been having problems with the idea when he takes it to the bank.
"I am finding a major problem finding financing," he said. "Hogs have a stigma."
The Administration hopes to help with an inexpensive program of technology assistance, education and publicity, pushing projects like Mr. Tribble's into operation at about half the 3,000 or so swine and dairy operations where it makes economic sense, and capturing an estimated 1.5 million metric tons of methane without costly regulations or subsidies.
That would be one step among dozens -- involving utilities, forestry, home appliances, landfills and manufacturing plants -- that are expected to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, and hydrofluorocarbons, by 109 million metric tons in the next seven years.
Much of that reduction might happen with or without a national plan, since, like Mr. Tribble's methane plant, they are expected to pay for themselves. The Administration estimates that the private sector will invest $60 billion between 1994 and 2000, recovering every penny in reduced energy costs in that period, and saving $200 billion in the following decade.
Already, 50 utilities have signed letters of intent promising the Energy Department that they would cut greenhouse gas emissions, mostly in the form of carbon dioxide, even though no Federal law requires them to do so.
But increasingly, state utility commissions are requiring power companies to take pollution into account when making investment decisions, and are rewarding companies for investing in conservation.
Conservationists have applauded this thinking, which is what allows utilities to subsidize consumers who buy low-energy light bulbs, or to lend money to homeowners for efficient furnaces or insulation. The plan also relies heavily on encouraging efficient lighting in commercial buildings and efficient machines in factories.
 
It's Cheaper Overseas
 But environmental groups find some parts of the plan disturbing, especially those that encourage polluters to scour the world seeking cheap ways to reduce emissions, instead of taking more costly measures closer to home.
The concept is called "joint implementation," an approach that rests on the fact that greenhouse gases do their damage globally no matter where the emissions come from.
As an example, several American utilities are examining an investment in the town of Decin in the Czech Republic, where apartment houses are heated by plants burning environmentally dirty brown coal. The town cannot afford to tap into nearby natural gas pipelines, but if an American utility foots part of the bill, the reduction in emissions could be much cheaper for the utility than similar results in Wisconsin or New York.
Some environmentalists also worry about the plan's reliance on forests as storehouses for carbon absorbed by trees from the atmosphere. About 9 percent of the so-called "reduction" in emissions in the plan comes from expanding forests, as utilities and other producers of carbon dioxide are encouraged to plant trees.
Of course, the environmental movement favors forest preservation, but not necessarily trading trees for coal and oil. Unused fossil fuels like oil will store carbon for millions of years; trees die relatively soon, and then return their carbon to the air. "The best way to store carbon is in a dead dinosaur," said Dan Becker of the Sierra Club.
All the numbers being bandied about, and the Administration's optimistic talk about fighting the war with an all-volunteer army, mask considerable uncertainty over whether the goal will in fact be achieved.
If the economy grows 0.5 percent a year less than the Administration assumes, carbon emissions, mostly in the form of carbon dioxide, could be 29 million metric tons less than the plan predicts, the Administration estimated. If oil prices stay flat until the year 2000, carbon emissions could rise 16 million metric tons more than predicted.
On Monday, the Energy Department will publish its first comprehensive inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, up to 1990. It will show that carbon dioxide emissions grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent between 1985 and 1990, well below the rate of growth in the economy. Calvin Kilgore, a department official, said the economy was becoming more energy efficient on its own. And that, of course, was happening before global warming rose to the top of the national environmental agenda.

We Are the Wired: Some Views On the Fiberoptic Ties That Bind

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON

 BODY:
SOMEDAY, the visionaries tell us, we will be able to communicate with just about anybody by sending an electronic message; no matter where they are, the bundle of bits will find them. On the information superhighway, the literature of the world and the videos, too, will be just a point and a click away. So will anyone we want to hear from.
Someday, perhaps, but not yet. When we asked four writers to give us their visions of the information future, the science writer James Gleick communicated with us entirely through the Internet, the loose confederation of computer networks that serves for the time being as a kind of two-lane blacktop for exchanging information. But then Mr. Gleick, who is building an access ramp to let common folk use the Net, is an old hand at this. (Getting his words from the Internet and into our own computer proved a little trickier.) 
 We reached Bill McKibben, whose book "The Age of Missing Information" involved watching an entire day of television -- every minute broadcast by a staggering 103 channels -- by sending a fax to him in the Adirondacks. He faxed us back, but then we had to retype his words into the system. We had to resort to primitive telephone calls to contact the novelist Robert Coover, who runs a hyperfiction workshop at Brown University, and the cultural critic Neil Postman, author of "Technopoly" and "Amusing Ourselves to Death." Mr. Postman replied by fax, Mr. Coover through the Internet. Finally, we faxed the replies to Robert Zimmerman, in North Carolina, who sent the artwork by modem. GEORGE JOHNSON
 
 
Robert Coover
Stringing Together The Global Village
 Digital convergence is not a futuristic prospect or a choice to be made among other choices; it is an onrushing train. The digitalization of all forms of information (including the transmission of sensations) has proven itself to be accurate, economical, ecologically wise, universally applicable, easy to use, and fast as light.
Digital convergence is also radically disruptive: to communications systems, to the knowledge and entertainment industry, to human life in general. Ownership, whether of the information itself or of the means of its transmission, is highly problematic and potentially an explosive political and economic issue, one perhaps to be fought out, not on the streets, but on the nets, where rebellion and sabotage and telecom-baron wars can be as fatal as a bomb. And, if it is not clear who owns what in digitalized hyperspace, it is also not clear, beyond the sale of hardware, just where the profits are. Early developers of this new communications arena are hoping to turn it into a vast worldwide marketplace and to take their cut by renting stalls, as it were, but exclusive access has never been a principle of the ether, home of the computer nets. If telephony and cable put a lock on the hard-wiring, watch for pirate satellite ships.
Will everyone have equal and universal access to this magical new realm? No, they will not. But the gap between haves and have-nots, already almost unimaginably vast in our time, will not necessarily widen. Digitalization, like the Gutenberg technology before it, has so far had a democratizing effect on cultural exchange, greatly empowering the individual user, and it is easy enough to learn that small children can make full use of it. It can spread as rapidly as there is human will to do so. Making it more universally accessible is a contemporary political issue in the way that rural electrification and telephone line laying were earlier in the century. Certainly it is the new standard by which literacy must be judged, and for a time whole nations, but perhaps for government elites, will in effect be made newly illiterate. They need not remain so: this is easier to overcome than hunger or drought. New tasks for future Peace Corps: wire up the global village.
 
 
Bill McKibben
The Data That Are Thrown Away
 Many times this week, in the hoopla about the mergers paving the way for a marriage of phone and cable, I've heard happy salutes to the coming "information superhighway." The phrase -- beloved of the President, too -- seems instructive to me. For what is a superhighway? It is fast, and this technology will surely be fast. But it is also flat, uninteresting, repetitive.
A path provides you with immense amounts of information about a place -- walking it you feel the topography, the weather. You have time to look at what's around you, to talk with anyone you meet. Even a back road -- a blue highway -- offers lots of information, leaves you with some sense of the country you've driven through. But a highway makes sure you can't even stop at a restaurant that might serve something local.
So with the communications superhighway, I think. Five hundred channels sounds wonderful -- but the 500 channels, and the electronic bulletin board, and the CD ROM Louvre, will still be showing the same narrow band of human experience, the only parts that can come across a screen. Vast amounts of information -- the kind one gets from contact with other human beings or with the natural world or with live performance or with one's own navel -- remains beyond even the fiber-optified magicians.
I suspect that our saturation with information we don't need, with noise that increasingly rattles us, will begin to pall, that we will come ever more to resent the time it steals from our lives. Very few people anymore want a real superhighway through their neighborhood, and perhaps it will someday be the same with megatube.
 
 
James Gleick
A Frontier That Is Building Itself
 Excuse me, wait just a second . . . yes, I thought so! My television set is still sitting there all by itself in the kitchen, and I have to turn it off, not on, when the telephone rings. And my computer is somewhere else altogether.
Telephone companies and cable-television companies may not be able to keep their hands off each other, but blending our actual telephones and televisions will surely require a lot more than F.C.C. approval. The video side of the information superhighway is a one-way street and will remain so for a long time -- even if interactive boxes someday do let us send a few bytes' worth of nay votes up the line toward Geraldo.
Yet the real information superhighway has already taken shape, almost behind our backs, with startlingly little real planning and with only the most accidental assistance from Government policy makers and the telecommunications companies. The global Internet -- somehow lacking a mergers and acquisitions department, not to mention a board of directors -- has suddenly become the most universal and indispensable network on the planet.
It's a wild frontier, befitting its origins -- amorphous, unruly, impolite and anarchic. It's like a television station without programmers or a newspaper without editors -- or rather, with millions of programmers and editors, a lot more opinionated than polished. Like it or not, in a time seemingly dominated by giant communications empires, the amateurs may hold the key after all.
Now if I can just find the batteries for my remote control. . . .
 
 
Neil Postman
Buried in a New Kind of Garbage
 In the 19th century, beginning with the invention of telegraphy and photography in the 1840's, humankind attacked the problem of how to get information to people fast, conveniently, in various forms and in great quantities. It took about a hundred years to solve that problem satisfactorily, but in the process new and unprecedented difficulties were created. Information, once a valued resource in solving problems of our material and psychic worlds, became a cheaply available commodity, to be bought and sold. What was important was mixed with the trivial.
The connection between information and action was severed as people came to know of many things about which they could do nothing. The flood of information undermined and seemingly made irrelevant traditional sources of authority. A sense of what things mean was lost as information poured in from uncountable sources, directed at no one in particular, in unassimilable quantities. We moved from a culture burdened by information scarcity to one burdened by information glut.
The fact is that information has now become a form of garbage. We don't know what to do with it, have no control over it, don't know how to get rid of it.
In the face of this, we propose to spend billions on a super-information network. To do what? Instead of 60 TV channels, we'll have 500, maybe a thousand. We'll have access to more entertainment, more sports, more commercials, more news -- faster, more conveniently, in more diverse forms. We will, in other words, flood our lives with that from which we are already drowning. This is supposed to be our response to the challenge of the 21st century. It is, in fact, a looking back, not ahead; a 19th-century solution proposed by information junkies who have no sense of purpose and meaning, and who require distractions from confronting their emptiness.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: Following a Tough Act;
Bhutto Gets Another Chance to Get It Right

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan

 BODY:
BENAZIR BHUTTO, a gauzy veil draped over her hair in a gesture to Islamic modesty, smiled slightly last week when the speaker of Pakistan's Parliament announced that she had won a majority of votes to regain the prime ministership she lost three years ago, when she became the first woman to lead an Islamic nation.
It was a moment of victory for Ms. Bhutto. She had prevailed over her political nemesis, Nawaz Sharif, the man who succeeded her and who she said had conspired with the country's powerful army and President to oust her from office. Moreover, she had regained the power that she feels is rightfully hers, not only by popular acclaim but by birth as well. Far less clear, however, is what her victory means for Pakistan. 
 Ms. Bhutto's 20-month first tenure was notable mainly for her failure to grapple with the country's grievous economic decay. At 40, she is a bit older and perhaps wiser now. This time, however, she follows a tough act that could point up not only her inadequacies but those of all of Pakistan's politicians and the political system tainted by class and money in which they operate.
The tough act is Moeen Qureshi, a former World Bank vice president who was appointed interim Prime Minister for three months to break a paralyzing constitutional crisis. In his brief tenure, he dazzled Pakistanis and much of the world with a blizzard of laws and initiatives aimed at ridding the nation of endemic political corruption and economic mismanagement.
Many Pakistanis doubt whether Ms. Bhutto, steeped in the hurly burly of the nation's politics, can equal the accomplishments of Mr. Qureshi, a political outsider beholden to few. A public opinion poll conducted the week before the national elections found that 85 percent of those polled wanted Mr. Qureshi, though unelected, to remain in office. With the laws pushed through by Mr. Qureshi set to expire after four months, many wonder in fact whether Ms. Bhutto will preside over their undoing.
When she was first elected Prime Minister in 1988, Ms. Bhutto's victory reclaimed the office held by her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, until he was toppled in 1977 in a military coup and later executed. But her father's legacy gave the young Ms. Bhutto neither the stature nor the power to confront the hostility of the army and Pakistan's authoritarian President, Ghulam Ishaq Khan. When she was dismissed for corruption and incompetence, the first charge never legally proved, the latter a matter of opinion, she left office with the country in dismal shape. She had introduced no legislation of import, done more damage than benefit to the economy, ignored the plight of the country's women and presided over the collapse of relations with the United States.
Pakistan is crushingly poor and illiterate, dominated by two elites, the landed aristocracy from which Ms. Bhutto hails and an emerging urban business class represented by Mr. Sharif. The landed gentry's sense of deserved destiny clouded Ms. Bhutto's first administration and poses questions about what she will do now. "If you were to go by the past history, she won't do much," said Paula R. Newberg of the Carnegie Institute of International Peace. "But this time, she can't say, 'The royals won't let me rule.' This time it's up to her. She has to show leadership in political and economic terms."
 
Shaking Things Up
 In a sense, Ms. Bhutto's task is far easier now than it was in 1988 because Mr. Qureshi, ignoring politics, has laid the groundwork for economic recovery.
He was sworn into office last July after prolonged political and constitutional turmoil -- instigated in no small part by Ms. Bhutto herself -- in which the President dismissed Prime Minister Sharif, the Supreme Court reinstated him and nobody knew who was in charge. While overseeing the transition to a new elected government, Mr. Qureshi expanded his mandate to initiate sweeping reforms. He devalued the country's overvalued rupee, moved to free the Central Bank from political influence, introduced the first tax on large rural landowners (Ms. Bhutto's allies), ended capricious government spending and went after loan defaulters, including Ms. Bhutto and her husband. He also increased prices on subsidized commodities and utilities, measures that would be difficult for any elected government to enact.
Despite Mr. Qureshi's labors, Ms. Bhutto's instincts appear to be getting the better of her. A politician who invariably runs on populist platforms, Ms. Bhutto now seems inclined to review some of her predecessor's policies, in particular the agriculture tax, which for the first time imposes taxes on the wealthy land-owning classes. In an interview, she also expressed her dislike for the devaluation of the rupee, an action that has made the foreign goods consumed mostly by rich Pakistanis more expensive even as it will boost Pakistani exports abroad in the long run.
But her Government could well face its toughest questions over social and educational reform. More than 75 percent of Pakistanis are illiterate; among women, the rate runs to 90 percent. Women are subject to discriminatory laws -- rape victims are often jailed for adultery -- and are barred from much of social life. When pressed in an interview as to what she would do about illiteracy and the condition of women, Ms. Bhutto's concerns seemed focused on the elite. The new Prime Minister spoke about the need for women's universities rather than the necessity for compulsory primary education, a key to broad-based economic development, according to most developmental economists. She spoke about allowing women to become pilots for the national airlines rather than bringing women out of purdah, the culturally and religiously imposed quarantine for women practiced in much of rural Pakistan, where 70 percent of the country's 121 million people live.
And Ms. Bhutto too faces the stringent economic and military sanctions imposed against her country because of its nuclear weapons program. In her first speech, she made it clear that while she wanted to improve Pakistan's relations with the United States, she would not tamper with the nuclear program.
Arif Nizami, the editor of the Lahore-based newspaper The Nation, was in Islamabad for Ms. Bhutto's swearing-in, watching her ascent to power with a mix of expectation and resignation. "I think she has a working majority," he said of her coalition, which includes independents and splinter parties. "But do I think she'll be able to do anything radical? No I don't."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS: A Genteel Conspiracy Theory;
Is It Just Possible That Ford Wants to Beat G.M.?

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
TO hear normally buttoned-up auto industry analysts sound like conspiracy buffs surveying the grassy knoll, ask them this: Is the Ford Motor Company quietly trying to overtake the hobbled General Motors Corporation and become the No. 1 automaker in the United States?
Odd that the question should have to be asked. In other industries, companies like Pepsi, Avis, Apple and United make no bones about their eagerness to knock off the big guy. But one of the peculiar aspects of relations among the Big Three automakers is that they are publicly quite genteel. Perhaps because they focus their hostility on the Japanese, no one here talks much about crushing the domestic competition and becoming No. 1. 
 Ford itself is coy. "It's not a goal," said chairman Harold A. Poling. "I never think about it."
But, muddying the waters a bit, he said the company did want to keep increasing its market share while staying profitable -- a modest strategy that, if successful, would of course end in utter domination of the world.
"We don't write it on the wall, we don't talk about it and we frankly don't think about it," said Alexander J. Trotman, who is to replace Mr. Poling next month. Then he too opened the door a crack, saying: "I think it's a possibility."
Such comments have spawned opposing camps of conspiracy theorists, some believing that Ford harbors a secret yearning to dance on G.M.'s grave, others convinced that it is resigned to playing Sancho Panza no matter how quixotic G.M. gets.
"It's a 60-year tradition," said Sean P. McAlinden, a research scientist at the University of Michigan's Center for the Study of Automotive Transportation. "It's almost profane to break it -- they're almost afraid to."
The question is of more than intramural significance. G.M. traditionally filled the leader's role: setting prices, lobbying the Federal Government and expanding the market by inventing new products and new ways to sell them. Now no one does.
In sales, Ford has been coming on strong. G.M. has dropped from controlling 43 percent of the domestic market 10 years ago to controlling 33 percent now. The Japanese sopped up much of what it spilled, but Ford gained more than they collectively did. It went from controlling about 20 percent of the market in 1983 to controlling about 25 percent now.
G.M. is still struggling to bring out cars that will sell not because they are cheap but because they are good. Meanwhile, Ford produces five of the 10 top-selling vehicles in the U.S., including No. 1 car, the Taurus.
With a strong yen making Japanese vehicles pricier, Ford is the best positioned to take advantage of G.M.'s weakness. In the 1980's, G.M. invested billions in plants it didn't need, and is now struggling to shed excess capacity and tens of thousands of workers. Meanwhile, Ford was learning to operate its old plants more efficiently. By some estimates, Ford assembly plants are now about one-third more efficient than G.M.'s, which may make Ford the lowest-cost car producer in the world.
"When you're the low-cost producer, you're in charge," Mr. Poling said.
As Ford has increased its market share, it has also stepped into some leadership roles. Today its chairman, not G.M.'s, leads the Big Three's Washington lobbying on issues like health care and trade. And it was Ford, not G.M., that the United Automobile Workers picked this year to negotiate with over a new contract; the first contract usually sets the pattern for the industry. (Quite cleverly, some analysts say, Ford took the chance to negotiate pension and lay-off benefits that would significantly raise G.M.'s labor costs without much affecting its own.) And Ford reintroduced the color green into the automotive palette.
Moves like those convinced some analysts that, if Ford executives could be injected with truth serum, they would admit that they'd chew off a limb to become No. 1. In fact, a few of them have been caught in what in Detroit passes for pretty wild talk: they have speculated openly about selling more trucks than G.M.
"That's what they want -- they want to be the best in the world," said Wendy Beale Needham, an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson in New York. "They feel that G.M. is weak, and it is. They see this as an opportunity to go in and get as much market share as they can and hurt G.M."
But opposing theorists argue that being No. 1 carries burdens that Ford wants to avoid. In the first place, it would have to make a huge new investment in assembly plants to seize much more market share. Also, the industry leader attracts much more media and government scrutiny. Had Ford been the leader in the last couple of decades, for example, it would have been blamed for the industry's sloth about installing seat belts and air bags, and for its failure to produce a pollution-free car.
Also, the leader is expected to bear the costs, as G.M. once did, of doing the lion's share of the industry's research and development.
Perhaps G.M.'s most significant role as industry leader was to expand the market. When Ford was last indisputably No. 1, Henry Ford's notion of satisfying consumers' needs was to offer everyone one car -- the Model T -- in one color, black.
G.M. seized and consolidated leadership in the industry by not just meeting but creating needs: introducing the annual model change to keep customers hungry and diversifying its vehicles to suit every customer. G.M. economists began setting prices; G.M. lobbyists pushed for the dismantling of public trolley lines.
Ford has taken steps to expand the market. It has led the way on leasing, perhaps the most significant market innovation by the Big Three in recent years.
And, perhaps learning from Henry's mistakes, it has gingerly broken new ground on styling. A few years back, it began slapping the color green on some cars. The industry held its breath.
It worked. This year, by the way, look for purple.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Campaign Theme: Dinkins Isn't Up to the Job

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The New York City mayoral candidates have tried to frame their contest in many terms, from who would make the better healer to who would be tougher on crime. But for Rudolph W. Giuliani, one argument has emerged again and again: that Mayor David N. Dinkins is simply not up to the daunting task of managing a complex city.
"It is patently clear that he can't manage a riot, he can't manage a boycott, he can't manage a budget, and he can't manage a campaign to keep it even vaguely in compliance with the law," Mr. Giuliani said last week, summing up in campaign hyperbole what even Mr. Dinkins has acknowledged were missteps in handling problems including violence on the streets and raises for the city's union workers. 
 For his part, the Mayor has been at some pains simply to prove his bona fides, repeating over and over that he has balanced four municipal budgets in tough economic times, something that may count as an achievement but that is also required by law. Indeed, by the account of all but his most ardent supporters, Mr. Dinkins's record has been decidedly mixed, albeit in the face of the deepest local recession in decades.
Official reports have found that the Mayor was strikingly unaware of the extent of anti-Jewish violence in Crown Heights and of the feuding among his own top aides that led some of them improperly to favor a competitor for a $150 million contract to collect parking fines. In the same week in October 1990, he granted teachers a substantial raise, proposed record police hirings and then threatened 15,000 layoffs.
Mr. Dinkins favors a management style that delegates heavily to his cabinet of deputy mayors, but he has often failed to stop public feuding among them, producing policy deadlock. His own commissioners have found him so inaccesible that they organized informal meetings of their own to discuss city problems. He routinely runs an hour behind schedule for daily events and sometimes arrives appearing to be ill briefed and unable to cite specific examples to illustrate his points.
"Competence" is an elusive political notion, at once the bare minimum that citizens should demand from public officials yet, in an age of diminished expectations and intractable problems, a stand-in for an amalgam of other qualities from "leadership" to "innovation" to "originality." As a slogan, it has had mixed success. It worked for Edward I. Koch in his first run for the mayoralty against Abraham D. Beame (who had presided over the city's near bankruptcy) in 1977, but then fell flat for Michael S. Dukakis in his quest for the Presidency against George Bush (who inherited the Reagan mantle) in 1988.
This year, it has struck a particular chord, because Mr. Giuliani is not merely arguing that he is competent but that Mr. Dinkins isn't: an unusually harsh charge, possible only because of the strong public perception of blots on the Mayor's report card.
Mr. Giuliani also likes this argument since it tends to steer the debate away from sensitive and potentially divisive questions of race, ethnicity and outlook into a motherhood issue that no one could be against raising. He has made it in television commercials, attacking Mr. Dinkins for a litany of lapses, beginning with his failure to file income tax returns for four years two decades ago.
 
Freighted With Overtones
 But the question of competence is also freighted with overtones and disagreements on terms. Competent compared with whom? Based on what standards? Competent in the face of what vicissitudes? More or less competent than a challenger who has not done the same job?
"I would never call the Mayor incompetent as a manager or steward of the city's fiscal and human resources," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group financed by business that monitors the city's fiscal affairs, and that has been among Mr. Dinkins's sharpest and most persistent critics. "I would say that in the scope of New York City mayors, he is very much in the tradition."
"Mayors have lost a lot of control over the political process, to the State Legislature, to the unions, and to structural financial stresses that can only be addressed by the state and Federal governments," Mr. Horton added. "Is there room for improvement? Obviously, yes. If he were re-elected would he do any better in a second term, or could Giuliani? Those are the questions."
Mr. Horton said the Mayor's biggest failing was that he had not used hard times to persuade fellow politicians or the public to change the way the city does business, to win productivity improvements from the labor force to save money "except in bits and pieces."
It is precisely by this standard that Robert F. Wagner Jr., a former Deputy Mayor and the son and grandson of legendary New York politicians of the same name, contends Mr. Dinkins has failed.
"I would be less extreme than Rudy," said Mr. Wagner, who recently endorsed Mr. Giuliani. "But I think the last three and a half years have been characterized by a lack of leadership and a lack of hope for the future of the city. Certainly, David conveys a picture of decency and concern, but not of leadership. It's more than competence. It's leadership, in terms of being able to rally people, to manage, to inspire."
In some ways, Mr. Dinkins has never recovered from three episodes in his first year in office that left the distinct impression that he was overmastered by events. The first was the black-led boycott of a Korean-owned grocery in Brooklyn, which the Mayor sought to end by mediation.
The boycott began over allegations that the merchant had struck a black customer. Mr. Dinkins, who respected the boycott tradition of the civil-rights movement, was reluctant to inflame passions by seeming to take sides, and mediation tactics had resolved a similar boycott at about the same time. But he now acknowledges that some protesters were simply racist and "did not want a resolution.
Next came a spate of highly publicized violent crimes, to which Mr. Dinkins reacted with such apparent equanimity as to prompt a chorus of criticism that culminated in a front-page headline in The New York Post: "Dave, Do Something." What the Mayor did was delay for months while the Police Department completed a study of its staffing needs.
Ultimately, Mr. Dinkins proposed the largest police hiring program in history (and won special taxes to finance it, deferring other social spending programs). But he did so in the same week that he granted the teachers' union a 5.5 percent annual wage increase, setting a costly pattern for other workers just as the depth of the city's fiscal problems was becoming clear.
These events formed a picture of a City Hall out of control, and of a Mayor who took too few actions too late, an image that repeated and unchecked feuding among top aides did little to dissipate. Meantime, the Mayor cobbled together a budget that cut some of the very services he had campaigned to protect (library services, parks, education).
Finally, in August 1991, three days of violence between blacks and Jews in Crown Heights produced public disorder that the city had not seen in years, and a state report this summer found that the Mayor had shown a lack of awareness of the depth of the violence and failed to order the police to take prompt action.
Having made concern for the homeless a centerpiece of his campaign, Mr. Dinkins has largely failed to make any headway against the problem. Spending on shelters for families has almost doubled and the number of families sheltered has risen to 5,600 from 3,700, more than 1,000 of them still in the kind of welfare hotels he once scorned as inhumane.
Having seen budget problems dominate his entire first term, the Mayor this year broke his vow to grant union raises only in exchange for productivity increases, and now faces the prospect of a budget gap of several hundred million dollars in the fiscal year that ends in June and of more than $1 billion in each coming year.
Having rejected some of the advice of a panel of outside experts he commissioned to recommend solutions (like tolls on the East River bridges) two years ago, he has now commissioned a similar study by a new panel that includes one of the same members, whose report is not due until after Election Day.
All that said, as the Mayor likes to point out, "At the margin, we have done some things." Reversing his earlier policy, Mr. Dinkins has now moved to expand library service to six days a week for the first time since 1947, opened new neighborhood health clinics and public schools as after-hours community centers, and presided over a general decline in reported crime.
"Competence is entirely a fair issue to raise," said Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, one of Mr. Dinkins's most articulate defenders. "Giuliani is lobbing these tomatoes when they might well be thrown at him. The Mayor, amid tough times, has tried to steer a course, find a way, pull people together, get bills passed, squeeze out a new program. If Rudy Giuliani ever has specific answers, they strike most people as too facile to be believed."
At the same time, Ms. Messinger acknowledged, the Mayor often "couldn't do enough to make people feel as hopeful about their futures as everyone would want."
"This is an administration that because of tough options and the Mayor's style, has made a commitment to being deliberative," she said. "Very often, that doesn't please anyone."
The Mayor's style is often compared with that of Mr. Wagner's father, who in his years as Mayor was a phlegmatic presence at City Hall for three terms ending in 1965, and who was well known for temporizing so long in the face of some problems that they went away or diminished sufficiently to get him off the hook.
"There are definite similarities in personal qualities," Mr. Wagner said. "Probably my father's leadership style was more appropriate to the time in which he held office. But he was much more focused and informed. Even if my father chose to avoid eight of nine problems, he was aware of them and abreast of them."
This election will undoubtedly turn in part on whether voters believe Mr. Dinkins has been.

HEADLINE: VOTING IN CANADA CAN AFFECT NAFTA

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 23

 BODY:
If the Liberal Party leader, Jean Chretien, becomes Canada's Prime Minister, as is expected in general elections on Monday, the Clinton Administration could face new problems over the North American Free Trade Agreement as a vote nears on the pact in the American Congress.
In 1988 elections, the Liberals, under John Turner, vowed to tear up an earlier free-trade accord with the United States. Under Mr. Chretien, 59, a shrewd, folksy, pragmatic Quebecer who held high office in earlier Liberal Governments, the position on the broader accord with the United States and Mexico is more moderate. 
 The Liberal platform, and Mr. Chretien, have said that the pact would be canceled only as a last resort. But to placate the left wing of his party, Mr. Chretien says he wants a new round of negotiations to win greater protection for Canadian exporters.
"He's an old political animal trying to accommodate everyone, but renegotiation is a delicate business," cautioned Tom Velk, co-director of the North American Studies Program at McGill University in Montreal. The party's robust left wing draws much of its strength from antagonism toward the United States.
Should negotiations be reopened, Congress could demand concessions in return, like an end to the protections that Canada now enjoys for its cultural industries -- magazines, books, television and films. "It could be messy in the short term," warned Peter Morici, director of Canadian studies at the University of Maine.
 
Third and Fourth Parties
 In the latest opinion polls, Mr. Chretien's Liberals, showing strength particularly in Ontario and the Maritime provinces, stand a good chance of winning at least a plurality in Parliament and Mr. Chretien of becoming Canada's 20th Prime Minister.
But the polls also show heavy backing for two smaller parties, the separatist Bloc Quebecois, which is likely to sweep Quebec, and the Reform Party, a populist group powerful in the west.
The Progressive Conservatives, who have governed Canada for the last nine years, have stumbled politically -- reflecting popular disaffection over unemployment, budget deficits, credibility problems of those in office, and a series of campaign gaffes by Prime Minister Kim Campbell. She inherited the job from Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and is facing her first test with national voters. The personal popularity of Mr. Mulroney, who resigned in June, had been the lowest of any Canadian leader this century.
The Tories' popularity has hardly improved since. A Gallup poll released on Friday showed the Liberals supported by 44 percent of decided voters, a level of approval that usually translates into a majority in Parliament. The Reform Party was backed by 19 percent, and the recently governing Conservatives were down to 16 percent. The Bloc Quebecois, running candidates only in Quebec, had 12 percent. Half of those in Quebec who had made up their minds backed the separatists. The poll, taken Oct. 17-20, had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.
The strength of the regional parties could mean new pressures on Canadian federalism and again make Canada without Quebec a political option.
 
Pro-U.S. and Practical
 Although Liberal Governments in recent times have tended to be more adversarial than Conservative Governments in relations with the United States, Mr. Chretien leans to the more conservative side of his party and is considered unlikely to seek significant changes in relations with Washington.
He is a down-to-earth practical politician in the mold of politicians from small towns in the United States -- Mr. Clinton, for instance. Both share a belief in activist government.
The 18th of 19 children, Mr. Chretien used law school to cut himself away from small-town Quebec. He held Cabinet posts under Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and like Mr. Trudeau, strongly opposes Quebec separatism.
Charles F. Doran, director of the Center of Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, said Mr. Chretien would be "the most experienced of any politician to come to the prime ministership in my memory."
On Nafta, Mr. Chretien says he wants to talk with Mexico and the United States about a common code to define unfair trade practices to prevent Canadians from being targeted by Washington. Over the last year, the United States has used its trade laws to hit at exports of Canadian lumber, steel, pork and wheat. Duties are often set from the belief of American authorities that Canada uses unfair subsidies to increase sales.
During the election campaign, the Conservatives have derided as unrealistic the call for new negotiations, and Mr. Chretien has remained ambiguous about his specific aims. Neither the United States nor Mexico has indicated any willingness to reopen talks, but working groups could be set up to study the Liberal demands, a possible diplomatic way out of the imbroglio.

HEADLINE: Questions Raised About Children in Attic

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, N.J., Oct. 22

 BODY:
When detectives arrived at the home of Anthony and Shirley James on Oct. 8 after questioning two of the couple's six children in a shoplifting case, they found what they called clear-cut signs of abuse. The attic where the children stayed was like a virtual prison, they said, with only two small mattresses for four people, and there was no heating except for a chimney stack that the children would gather around for warmth.
But after a flurry of media reports about the case, family members and the couple's lawyer say that the real victims in the case are the parents. They say the Jameses opened their home to five adoptees, bringing them up in a loving manner. By their account, the children, caught shoplifting, wove a false tale for the police in order to avoid punishment. 
 "I think an injustice has been done," said Mr. James's mother, Hyacinth, a 58-year-old church minister in Far Rockaway, Queens. "It's tearing me up -- the degradation. We're a big family. Our family has been crushed, crushed to death. I just hope to God that this truth will break." Her son and his wife have refused to comment, on the advice of their lawyer, Joseph Contaldi.
Since the arrests, Englewood's Superintendent, Dr. Henry Oliver, and his aides have been poring over the children's files, trying to determine whether the home instruction program the children were in complied with New Jersey's education law.
 
Police Back Abuse Account
 For their part, Englewood detectives say that they believe the children's accounts of abuse, and that the children were apparently left in the attic as a way to keep them in line.
"The mother and father were disciplinarians, and this is how they disciplined them," said Detective Joseph Udina. "This is their way of life."
He and his colleagues in Englewood's youth bureau say they had never encountered the four children until the night of Oct. 8. While Mr. and Mrs. James were out for dinner with their two other children, an adopted girl of 12 and their biological son, 8, two of the children, a girl, 15, and a boy, 11, were caught stuffing bagels, bologna, candy, crackers and other food into book bags at a Shop Rite supermarket in a new mini-mall just off Palisades Avenue, said Detective Frank C. Jones.
The two children were taken to police headquarters on shoplifting charges. Detective Jones described them as frantic and hysterical at the thought of being returned home, and said that they told him that all four had been left locked in the attic when the parents left for dinner. The two caught shoplifting said they had escaped by prying open the lock bolt with a coat hanger and had taken the food because they were hungry.
 
Boy, 10, in Diapers
 Detective Jones said he returned to the home about 11 P.M. with the children and found the oldest child, a 16-year-old girl, sleeping on a mattress in the attic and the youngest, a 10-year-old boy, asleep on the floor in diapers. There was no bathroom accessible from the locked attic, the detective said.
The only furnishings he saw in the room, which measures about 30 feet by 12 feet, were two twin-sized mattresses on the floor, Detective Jones said. He said there were no lights, desks, tables or dressers in the room. In later questioning, the children said the room was sweltering in the summer and cold in the winter. The only heat in it, Detective Jones said, radiated from the house's main chimney, which passed through it.
The children told detectives they had to eat in the basement, away from the rest of the family. The two boys, Detective Jones said, told how they were often hit for taking food from the refrigerator and were allowed outdoors only when the Jameses' 8-year-old son wanted to play with them outdoors.
"They were kept in the attic most of the time every day," the detective said.
 
Police Version Disputed
 Mr. James's mother and his lawyer, Mr. Contaldi, denied the police version of life in the home. Mrs. James insisted the children had access to all the rooms in the house, to the refrigerator and to the above-ground pool and its deck in the backyard.
She said she visited the family here last summer for a cookout and the four children were teaching their mother to do a new dance. She described the attic room as a bedroom, with a television and Nintendo game, a smoke alarm, a lamp and a table, and beds, although she wasn't certain how many.
Furthermore, she said the children shoplifted and sometimes stole money from their parents. They had trouble getting along with peers, and for that reason, she said, all six children were taken from Englewood schools and taught at home by their mother.
Mr. Contaldi, the couple's lawyer, scoffed at the authorities' depiction of the attic as a prison. "It was a bedroom," he said. "We will blow that right out of the water -- that they were locked in the attic all the time."
 
Spanking 'Not a Crime'
 Mr. Contaldi did not dispute the charge that their father had hit the 10- and 11-year-old boys with a belt.
"At one time or another, most people have spanked their kids," he said. "It's not a crime. Corporal punishment is allowed. It's always a question of degree. It certainly cannot be excessive or cause harm to the child. They never needed any medical attention."
After the children were taken from the home, medical examinations found no serious physical ailments, the authorities say. The four children are now in the custody of New Jersey's Division of Youth and Family Services, which investigates cases of abuse and neglect of juveniles. On Oct. 13, a day after their arrests, the Jameses appeared in New Jersey Superior Court on charges of endangering the welfare of the children. They were released in their own recognizance on $10,000 bail each by Judge Arthur Minuskin.
The Bergen County Prosecutor, John J. Fahy, is preparing the case now for presentation to a grand jury. He and his aides have declined to comment on the issues.
 
Home-Teaching Inquiry
 Dr. Oliver and school officials here are trying to determine whether the Jameses complied with New Jersey's Compulsory Education Law. It requires that parents of children between the ages of 6 and 16 insure that the children attend either public or nonpublic schools or instruct them at home with a curriculum that is the academic equivalent of their grade level in a school. Such a home plan must be reviewed and approved annually by a school district's superintendent and board of education.
Dr. Oliver said this week that the Jameses did not have an approved home-study program in place. He said the children were withdrawn from Englewood schools in 1991 and 1992, and school officials learned that some of the children had attended a parochial school for a time and schools out of state.
Mr. Contaldi, the couple's lawyer, said Mrs. James was teaching all the children at home with an educational packet provided by the Calvert School, a private school in Baltimore. He said he did not know when she had started the home instruction or how many hours a day she taught the children in the house.
Besides taking custody of the four children, New Jersey has also taken control of the monthly subsidies the Jameses had received for each of the children under a federally run program for "special needs" adopted children deemed "hard to place," either because of a physical or emotional handicap or because they are older or are siblings.
 
Subsidies From New York
 The monthly subsidies are $579 for the 16-year-old girl, who was adopted by the couple in 1984 in New York City; $475 for the 15-year-old girl, and $489 for each of the two boys, officials close to the case said. They and the 15-year-old are natural brothers and sisters and were adopted in New York in 1987.
Mr. James is currently unemployed. He had worked as a manager of security guards but was laid off five months ago, Mr. Contaldi said. He declined to identify the former employer.
The family moved from Queens to their home on Howland Avenue here in early 1988, but New York continues providing the subsidies, New York officials said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Offers Help to Russians to Insure the Elections Are Fair

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 23

 BODY:
As part of its campaign to support President Boris N. Yeltsin in his efforts to change Russia, the United States offered technical help today to try to insure that parliamentary elections in December are free and fair.
"Our efforts -- if we are asked -- would focus on the nuts and bolts of free elections, from voter education to poll-watching," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in a speech to the Academy of the National Economy. 
 To avoid the impression that the United States was endorsing Mr. Yeltsin or his faction, Mr. Christopher added, "As in all countries where we support the electoral process, any assistance we would mobilize in Russia would be politically neutral, nonpartisan and available to all participating parties and groups."
But the Clinton Administration has gone out of its way to support Mr. Yeltsin in his recent political crisis, and Mr. Christopher sounded much like a politician passionately endorsing a candidate at a campaign whistle-stop, exhorting his audience to take its future into its hands and vote for democracy.
 
Cost Could Be $10 Million
 The United States has prepared what a senior Administration official called "a fairly comprehensive plan" for the Russian parliamentary elections in December and the presidential election in June.
Four American nongovernmental organizations, including three associated with the National Endowment of Democracy, would sponsor projects in political training in about a dozen cities. The United States could also train observers who would monitor campaign practices and voting practices on the day of the elections and train editors to make news coverage more objective and sophisticated.
Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Christopher briefly discussed the plan, which would probably cost the United States Government at least $10 million, during their 45-minute meeting on Friday, a senior Administration official said.
In his speech today, Mr. Christopher said that over the long term the United States was committed to helping Russia reform its judiciary, develop political parties and offer training programs in public administration to strengthen its democratic institutions.
Vice President Al Gore will visit Russia a few days after the parliamentary elections on Dec. 12, and Mr. Clinton will visit after a NATO summit meeting in Brussels in January. Senior Administration officials said today that Mr. Clinton might spend eight or nine days abroad on a trip that could include stops in Central and Eastern Europe and other countries of the former Soviet Union in addition to Russia.
 
'Extraordinary Times'
 As the site of his speech today, it was no accident that Mr. Christopher chose the institute founded by Yegor T. Gaidar, one of Mr. Yeltsin's Deputy Prime Ministers and the staunchest advocate of radical economic reform. Mr. Gaidar also heads Russia's Choice, the largest pro-Yeltsin bloc running in the election.
"I know that many of you may be tired of politics," Mr. Christopher said. "But I will ask of you what Bill Clinton asked of young Americans when he ran for President last year: do not let your healthy skepticism harden into cynicism, and do not let the promise of change wilt into apathy."
One of those in the audience, Anna Lysenko, an associate professor of international economics trained at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: "It is very nice that he came to our academy. We appreciate that he's totally supportive of Yeltsin's decision, even though some innocent people lost their lives."
Mr. Christopher's speech was the Administration's strongest explanation for its decision to stand by Mr. Yeltsin and his moves to abolish Parliament and then use force to crush the violent revolt against him. "The United States does not easily support the suspension of parliaments," he said. "But these are extraordinary times. The steps taken by President Yeltsin responded to exceptional circumstances.
"The Parliament and Constitution were vestiges of the Soviet Communist past, blocking movement to democratic reform. By calling elections, President Yeltsin was once again taking matters to the Russian people, to secure their participation in the transformation of Russia."
 
A Visit to Kazakhstan
 Mr. Christopher, who flew to Kazakhstan after his speech for meetings Sunday with President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev and other officials, portrayed the Russian political struggle of the last few weeks as the forces of Yeltsin the good Democrat against the desperate, doomed forces of reaction and repression.
"When those demagogues at your White House waved the hammer and sickle in the name of democracy," he said, referring to the Parliament building, "you saw the hypocrisy. When you heard the defenders of the old system calling for 'renewal,' you knew they meant a renewal of stagnation and a betrayal of Russia's youth. And you had the nerve to chase away both the gaunt specter of the Soviet past and the new extremists who wanted to win with bullets what they could not win with ballots."

HEADLINE: Roof Collapses in Harlem Building, Injuring 6 People

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The roof of a city building being rehabilitated for temporary housing for the homeless collapsed yesterday morning in Harlem, taking five workers down with it and injuring a passer-by.
A spokesman for the Buildings Department said the contractor, A.H.A. General Construction of Brooklyn, had violated city policy by not applying for a special permit to work on the weekend. The company also did not inform the City Housing Authority, which manages the site, that it was working, so the engineer and construction manager who usually monitor safety were not at the site, the department said. 
 Workers were trying to remove the roof of the five-story building at 356 124th Street, just east of Morningside Avenue, when the roof caved in and fell to the first floor. Five men on the roof fell, with three trapped under the rubble. Two were taken to the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center, where a spokeswoman said one was in critical condition with several fractures and the other was in fair condition.
A passer-by was also taken to St. Luke's, where he told doctors that debris hit him on the foot. Three workers were taken to Harlem Hospital, where they were listed in stable condition.
Today a demolition crew is to take down a wall that lost its supports and other parts of the building. The crew will use a crane to try to preserve as much of the building as possible, as well as Nos. 352 and 354, which are also part of the project and are connected to the damaged building.
Because of the collapse and demolition the Buildings Department has removed people from three adjacent buildings on Morningside Avenue, including the back of St. Luke Baptist Church. Thirteen families, with a total of 28 people, left their homes for a day or two.
 
Entrance Through Basement
 When rescuers arrived at 356 124th Street after receiving a call at 9:25 A.M. they had to enter the building from the basement and crawl up to the first floor to try to dislodge the trapped workers. One worker's boot was caught, and police officers and firefighters eventually cut open the boot and pulled the worker's fractured leg from the debris.
"He was yelling in Spanish, complaining about the pressure on his leg," Officer Juan Gonzalez said. "I was talking to him in Spanish, trying to get him to calm down."
As the roof fell it pulled down supports on a wall, and sections of the wall started falling on the rescuer. "It was pretty hairy in there," Officer Donald Costleigh said. "You could see that there was just one beam holding up two walls up there. If that beam would have given up the whole thing would have collapsed."
Mayor David N. Dinkins stopped at the site, put on a fire hat and rode a crane boom to survey the building. "From a layman's eyes that building is very dangerous," Mr. Dinkins said after viewing it for five minutes. "Obviously if a shell isn't sufficiently stable it has to come down, and that's got to come down."
 
'Ways to Do Things'
 Mr. Dinkins said he wanted engineers from the Buildings Department to inspect the other buildings in the project to determine whether they were sufficiently stable for work to continue.
A spokesman for the department, Vahe Tiryakian, said inspectors at the scene had told him that the building where the roof collapsed appeared to be stable. He said it appeared that the workers had not shored up the roof sufficiently before working on it. "It's very hard for a building to be in such unsafe condition that you can't do safe work in it," he said. "But there are acceptable ways to do things."
The Human Resources Administration is rehabilitating the buildings, with the Housing Authority overseeing the work, which began in June.
A construction worker who was on the roof when it collapsed, Jerome Garbutt, said that he saw that the roof was caving in and that he warned the other workers, who did not listen. "I could see this thing was going to drop in, but they wouldn't believe me," said Mr. Garbutt, who had been at the project about three weeks. "So I stepped back away from it. Just as we stepped away it fell. It felt like an earthquake. Everything was shaking."
A foreman at the site, Ricky Winfield, had just stepped out of the building to go to a trailer when the roof collapsed. "There was a big noise," Mr. Winfield said, "and then a lot of dust and a lot of people screaming."
Mr. Tiryakian said the Buildings Department did not have records on general contractors because the city did not license them. But he said the Mayor had recently proposed a bill to require general contractors to be licensed and to have licensed people at construction sites at all times.
"We feel this is an important bill, because it would give the city greater leverage than we have now to control this kind of work through licensing," Mr. Tiryakian said. "Perhaps what happened today proves this kind of legislation is necessary."

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN TRAIL;
Florio Faults Whitman on Spending

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio's campaign, which has spent part of the last two weeks defending itself against complaints of election law violations, has leveled accusations of its own against the campaign of his Republican opponent, Christine Todd Whitman.
The Florio campaign on Friday filed two complaints with the State Election Law Enforcement Commission asking that Mrs. Whitman's campaign be forced to pay for two brochures distributed in recent weeks by some of her supporters. 
 According to the Florio campaign, a brochure advocating Mrs. Whitman's economic plan was paid for by the re-election campaign of State Senator Gerald Cardinale, a Republican from Bergen County, and distributed at a fund-raiser for the gubernatorial candidate in Hackensack on Oct. 4. The second brochure was mailed by a Jersey City group known as Citizens for School Choice Inc. and it was in support of a school voucher program being pushed by Mrs. Whitman and Jersey City's Republican Mayor, Brent Schundler.
The Governor is alleging that the brochures violate the election law because they directly benefit Mrs. Whitman's candidacy and they therefore should be considered a campaign expense.
Mrs. Whitman argued that her rival's campaign should pay for visits that President Bill Clinton and members of his Cabinet made to New Jersey over the last six weeks. Mr. Florio has said the visits were official, but Mrs. Whitman has insisted they were political and intended to aid the Governor's re-election campaign.
She also has accused Mr. Florio's campaign of prematurely and illegally spending $225,000 in general election funds two months before the June 8 primary election.
An Administrative Law Court judge last week dismissed the complaint on the Oct. 8 visit by President Clinton, but there has been no ruling on the other complaints.
 
A Halloween Fright
 Go ahead, Governor Florio told a senior citizens rally in East Orange yesterday, spend the state's freshly printed homestead tax-rebate checks, and don't be frightened by Republicans.
"If you got the check, cash it," he admonished about 200 elderly people gathered in a gym at Upsala College. "Enjoy the money and put it to good use." Republicans, including his opponent, Mrs. Whitman, are creating anxiety by going around and telling people the checks were not good, the Governor said.
"Halloween is coming up, I know," the Governor said. "But it's not time to be out scaring people."
Two days ago, Republicans were accusing the Florio Administration of bungling distribution of this year's rebate checks and creating panic among thousands of elderly waiting for the checks, which can amount to up to $500 for low-income people. The Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Hayataian, suggested that the Florio administration had deliberately mailed checks to residents ineligible for them and then ordered them to be returned or not cashed and would then blame everything on Republicans.
The administration's timing for distribution of the checks was "sinister," Mr. Hayataian said.
The rebate flap arose after the administration mailed thousands of rebates, perhaps up to 50,000, to residents who were ruled to be ineligible by a state Tax Court last November because they lived in housing that is government subsidized or tax exempt. The ruling was made after the state's income tax booklet, which contains rebate applications and eligibility criteria, had apparently already been printed.
Few of the seniors who listened to Mr. Florio today seemed perturbed, befuddled or anxious about the checks.
"All politics," said James Dennis of East Orange. "Mine's already cashed and in the bank."
Ditto for Mrs. Verner Baker. "If it's a check and it's got my name on it, then I'm going to cash it and spend it, which I did," she said.
On Friday, Mrs. Whitman told residents at a senior citizens complex in Berkeley Township that, if elected, she would spare the elderly any more worry about the rebate checks. Simply mail them out in July, as they were in the late 1980's, instead of sending them on the eve of an election, Mrs. Whitman said.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
In the Coming Free-Agent Market, It Could Be a Whole New Ball Game

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 23

 BODY:
This is the off season that clubs are supposed to retard their rush to put free agents on the Forbes 400 roster. Television revenue will be slashed drastically beginning next season, small-market clubs say they won't spend because they are hurting badly, and large-market clubs say they have to trim their payrolls or at least practice their version of fiscal responsibility.
Owners have made similar noises in the past, but their promises -- or threats -- have often turned out to be empty and the players' pockets full. In other words, watch their actions; don't listen to their words. 
 A new element could be introduced into this free-agent season. One general manager even wondered out loud if it is something the Players Association has thought about as one reason to agree to the three-division format.
"There could be a hidden element in it that the association maybe recognizes and we are slow to recognize," the general manager said. "With the illusion that you're one player away, you may have a lot of clubs overreacting this winter. That perception may exceed the reality. A club could take the short-term view of trying to grab the brass ring."
 
A First-Time Champion
 He especially had in mind the teams that would play in the four-team divisions. Under the proposed new alignment, for example, the American League West would have four teams, two of which have never won a division championship.
The Texas Rangers and the Seattle Mariners, the general manager said still wondering out loud, would have the opportunity to win for the first time, playing in a division with Oakland, which finished last this season, and California, which faded into oblivion as the season progressed.
The Rangers finished second in a seven-team division this season, falling short primarily because of a lack of pitching. They haven't shown a penchant for spending lavishly on free agents, particularly with George W. Bush Jr. operating the club, but what if they decide to seize the moment and make a quick and expensive strike?
"Nope," Tom Grieve, the Rangers' general manager, said, quickly squelching that thought. "I think our feeling going into the winter is that we would do exactly the same thing even if there hadn't been realignment. To go out and try to do more or less because there's less competition doesn't enter into the equation. We'll make a sensible off-season plan based on the economic situation and the team we have, and try to be as good a team as we can be under our own parameters and our plan."
Although Grieve rejected the notion that the Rangers would do anything rash, they will have money to spend. They are anticipating a significant increase in revenue from their new park next year and they have money freed up by Nolan Ryan's retirement and their decision not to exercise options in the contracts of Charlie Leibrandt, Craig Lefferts and Bob Patterson.
The Rangers have two primary tasks: sign Rafael Palmeiro and solidify their pitching staff. That means finding a starting pitcher or two and shoring up the bullpen.
"One of the keys is whether we can sign Palmeiro," Grieve said. "We're going to make a strong effort to do that. We've made him a very competitive offer. But logically so, he'll look at the market and determine his value. I don't think we could make him an offer that would keep him from looking at the market. We'd like him to stay here and I think he'd like to stay here, but we'll see."
Palmeiro, who was offered five years for about $25 million, will be one of the most glamorous free agents available. His .295 batting average, 37 home runs and 105 runs batted in elevate him into that position. The Rangers had a formidable offensive machine this year in Palmeiro, Juan Gonzalez and Dean Palmer.
On the pitching end, the Rangers seek a fourth starter who can pitch between 180 and 200 innings and join Kevin Brown, Kenny Rogers and Roger Pavlik.
"We have some kids in our farm system," Grieve said, "but we would prefer to find a fifth there, not a fourth and fifth. We also need to retool our bullpen like a lot of teams do. If we can improve our pitching, we feel we have a good chance to win."
 
Still a Proposal
 The Rangers will have a better chance to achieve that aim in their proposed four-team division. The problem is, the three-division format remains just that -- a proposal. The clubs and the union have not reached agreement, and the method of determining post-season player shares remains the major obstacle to an agreement.
A couple of months ago, both sides said they had only a "small window of time" to change the division alignment and playoff system for next year. Now they say they still have time. The pane apparently has become larger.
But if any clubs plan to base their off-season strategy on next season's format, they will soon have to know what it is.
 
An Unhappy Henderson
 From the day -- Nov. 28, 1989 -- that Rickey Henderson signed a $3 million-a-year contract, he has been unhappy with it. He shouldn't expect to be any happier with the offers he will receive as a free agent this off season.
Sore hands or not, Henderson has not put himself in a potentially lucrative position by hitting .215 for Toronto the last two months of the season, then .120 in the league playoff. His bat stirred slightly in the World Series after a 1-for-6 start, but he will be 35 in September and not even George Steinbrenner is very likely to be seduced by Henderson at his most motivated.
Nevertheless, Henderson has taken steps to secure the big contract he has wanted for four years. He has hired as his agent Dennis Gilbert, who in the last two winters gained the richest free-agent contracts for Bobby Bonilla and Barry Bonds.
 
A Lack of Stars
 The group of players who can begin filing for free agency tomorrow is not as star-studded as the 1992 class. No Barry Bonds, Joe Carter, Kirby Puckett, Mark McGwire, Ruben Sierra, Greg Maddux or David Cone, who signed seven of the dozen richest contracts ever.
Standout eligibles among hitters this year are Rafael Palmeiro, Will Clark and Andres Galarraga, followed by Tim Raines, Harold Baines and Robby Thompson, then Tony Fernandez and Luis Polonia. Also on the list is Howard Johnson of the Mets.
Pitching is thin, too. Most intriguing is Mark Portugal, who blossomed belatedly but at a time most propitious for him. The right-hander, who will be 31 years old Saturday, will make millions because of his 18-4 record and 2.77 earned run average with the Astros. Sid Fernandez, Dennis Martinez and Tim Belcher follow on the list. Lee Smith heads the available relief pitchers.
Several players will learn or decide soon about their status. The Philadelphia Phillies, for example, have until Nov. 1 to exercise their 1994 option on Lenny Dykstra's contract. At $2.6 million, he will be a steal. The Toronto Blue Jays, on the other hand, will notify Jack Morris two days after the end of the World Series that they will buy out his option year for $1 million rather than pay him a $5.15 million salary.
Otis Nixon controls his own future. He must tell the Atlanta Braves by two days after the Series if he wants their $2.5 million salary for next season or if he wants to be a free agent. He most likely could do better elsewhere, like in left field for the Mets.
 
Hershiser, the Hitter
 With so much attention focused last week on pitchers' hitting in the World Series, it should be noted that Orel Hershiser of Los Angeles had by far the highest batting average among pitchers this season, .356. Hershiser had more hits (26) than teammates Darryl Strawberry (14), Mike Sharperson (23) and Carlos Hernandez (25).
Following Hershiser were Jose Rijo of Cincinnati, .268, and Bill Swift of San Francisco, .263. Tommy Greene of Philadelphia led in runs batted in with 10, followed by Dwight Gooden of the Mets with 9, and Rijo and Mark Portugal of Houston with 8 each. Greene, Gooden and two expansion-team pitchers, Chris Hammond of Florida and Armando Reynoso of Colorado, led in home runs with two each.

HEADLINE: Health Reform and the Lawyers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Harlan R. Ribnik, in "Health Reform? How About Lawyers?" (Viewpoints, Sept. 26), asked why lawyers aren't being asked to donate their services to the poor. Dr. Ribnik will be glad to know that lawyers are in fact being asked to do just that, and are responding in large numbers. 
 Volunteer lawyers in New York City provide counsel in housing court, handle basic legal matters for persons with AIDS, represent children in Family Court and represent victims of abuse and discrimination seeking protection. They help nonprofit organizations with corporate, tax and real estate issues and work on low-income housing and economic development transactions. In all, New York City's lawyers donated about $100 million in legal services to the poor last year -- none of it tax-deductible. That's pretty impressive.

HEADLINE: Tax-Cut Backlash Swelling in California and Oregon

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The tax revolt has come full circle on the West Coast, where two states are trying to make up for revenue they lost in earlier tax rollbacks, while another may pass sweeping restrictions on how government can raise money.
When residents of Washington, Oregon and California vote on pocketbook initiatives on their November ballots, they may send out a mixed message. 
 These tax measures are getting the most attention in an off-year election that features only a handful of other ballot measures in the election on Nov. 2 on such normally high-profile issues as gay rights and term limits.
There are two tax revolt measures in Washington State. One, backed heavily by the tobacco and liquor industries, would repeal levies imposed this year to help pay for this state's fledgling health care plan covering all residents. The other measure would limit the growth of state taxes to the rate of inflation and the growth of the population.
 
Strange Political Alliances
 The two proposals have made a mess of normal alliances. The coalition opposing the rollbacks includes Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft; a former Republican Governor, and teachers. Those organized to repeal the taxes include citizens' groups egged on by radio talk show hosts, cigarette and liquor companies and conservative Christians. .
The proponents of both measures say they were necessitated by the refusal of the state government, controlled by Democrats in both houses and the governor's office, to cut spending enough in this year's legislative session.
Voters in Oregon and California will decide if they want to raise taxes, in large part to recover from blows their states took after voters adopted tax restrictions.
Oregon's measure -- on the ballot on Nov. 9 -- would impose the state's first-ever sales tax, a 5 percent levy on most goods. Previous ballot measures to impose a sales tax failed, but now state officials say their schools and major institutions are in terrible shape because of the severe property tax cap that was narrowly approved in 1990.
California, which started the nationwide tax revolt in 1978 with its Proposition 13, has placed two measures before the electorate that would make it easier to raise taxes for schools and public safety.
The California ballot also includes the nation's most comprehensive attempt yet to set up a voucher system for children attending private schools. But Proposition 174, which would allow every one of California's nearly 6 million school children to receive $2,600 in tax money to help pay for tuition, has been declining in popularity in recent polls and is expected to fail by a wide margin.
 
Limited Vote on Term Limits
 Elsewhere around the nation, the term limits movement is taking a breather this year; Maine is the only state that will vote on whether to limit terms of state office-holders. New York City also has a proposal that would set term limits for local officials. Over the last four years, 16 states have approved limiting the terms of state and Federal office holders.
Gay rights is on the ballot in one city, Cincinnati, where voters will decide whether to repeal a city ordinance that protects homosexuals from discrimination.
In this state, an initiative to make life in prison without parole mandatory for people convicted of three consecutive felonies has received a great deal of outside attention and is expected to pass. Washington's Initiative 593, a measure called "Three Strikes and You're Out," comes at a time when the public's tolerance of violent crime appears to have reached its limit.
The initiative gathered more than 300,000 signatures, many more than needed to qualify for the Nov. 2 ballot. Opponents say it would crowd the prison system with thousands of aging felons, and it would make a mockery of the state's sentencing guidelines.
It would mean that any person convicted of a third felony in a category labeled "most serious" would go to jail for life without chance of parole. Qualifying offenses would include vehicular homicide, rape and molesting a child, but they would not be applied to juvenile crimes. Backers of the initiative, pointing to statistics showing that the majority of violent crimes are committed by 10 percent of all those arrested for such offenses, say the measure would target a group of repeat offenders and put them away for life.
 
Boosted by Talk Radio
 Beyond the judicial ramifications of the measure, Initiative 593 is noteworthy because it is one of three Washington State initiatives that have benefitted from nearly nonstop promotion by KVI, a Seattle talk radio station with conservative hosts.
Taking over a role that normally would have been handled by this state's Republican Party, KVI has served as the leading booster and organizer of the tax revolt and anti-crime initiatives. Particularly in the tax rollback measures, the radio station took initiatives that had been conceived by leading state Republicans and made them the centerpieces of the listening day. The audience was told where to go to sign initiative petitions, and it was bombarded with an endless litany of horror stories about state government excesses.
But voters, while initially embracing the tax restraint measures, now seem more cautious. Polls show that there is a huge pool -- more than 30 percent in some cases -- of undecided voters.
Recently, Mr. Gates, who was listed this month by Forbes as the second richest American, broke his longstanding silence on political issues and came out against the tax revolt measures in his home state. Mr. Gates said they would be "bad stuff" that would hurt the state's schools and ultimately effect the area's economic competitiveness. He has joined former Gov. Dan Evans, a popular three-term Republican, who is leading the opposition.
 
Taxes Being Phased In
 One of the tax measures, Initiative 602, has been financed in large part by tobacco and liquor interests. They are fighting the increases in cigarettes and alcohol, which are being phased in, that were set up to pay for the health care of nearly 200,000 Washington residents who currently lack coverage.
The other measure, Initiative 601, calling for the growth of state expenditures to be limited to the rate of inflation and the growth in population, would require people to vote for any tax that exceed the limit.
"Opponents of 601 don't think the people are intelligent enough to decide whether future taxes are really needed," the supporters wrote in the Washington voters' pamphlet. "They want us to trust politicians who consistently refuse to control spending."
These initiatives are part of the trend toward taking away the taxing power of elected representatives and turning it over to the electorate.
"The new wave for the tax revolt is to require voter approval for any new taxes," said David Keating, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, based in Washington, D.C. He said two states, Colorado and Oklahoma, had passed such legislation, while several others are considering it for next year's ballot.

HEADLINE: Substance Abuse Is Blamed for 500,000 Deaths

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The widespread use of cigarettes, alcohol and drugs is killing more than 500,000 Americans a year and generating a host of social problems, including street crime, homelessness and gang violence, a new study says.
Unless Americans stop abusing these substances, efforts to hold down soaring health costs are doomed to failure, the study's sponsors warned in a report made public on Thursday. 
 Three dozen organizations representing the nation's doctors, lawyers, employers and educators responded to the report with a call to make the prevention and treatment of substance abuse a top national priority.
The study, which was sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and conducted by researchers at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., estimated the total economic cost of smoking, drinking and drugs at $238 billion in 1990 alone. Alcohol abuse accounted for $99 billion of those costs; smoking, $72 billion, and drug abuse, $67 billion.
 
Strains on the System
 Joseph A. Califano Jr., president of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, said the habits outlined by the report were "destroying families, driving up health care costs, overwhelming the education, criminal justice and social systems of this nation and contributing to an unprecedented wave of violence and homelessness."
Substance abuse is also disrupting the workplace and driving people to crime, said Dr. Steven A. Schroeder, president of the Johnson Foundation. Half of the men arrested for homicide and violent assaults test positive for drugs, he said.
Mr. Califano, who was President Jimmy Carter's first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and is a longtime crusader against smoking, said, "Without an all-out attack on substance abuse and addiction, reforms designed to provide health care for all Americans at a reasonable cost are doomed to failure."
The report said many of the estimated 520,000 deaths each year linked to substance abuse "could be reduced, if not eliminated, by changing people's habits."
Cigarettes were blamed for 419,000 of those premature deaths, it said.
 
Other Findings Cited
 The Brandeis researchers drew their estimates from figures compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics for 1989 and 1990. These were among the report's findings:
*As many as two-thirds of homicides and serious assaults involve alcohol.
*Overall use of alcohol, illegal drugs and cigarettes has declined, but heavy use has not.
*Men are three times more likely than women to be heavy drinkers, and twice as likely to use marijuana frequently.
*By the time they reach the eighth grade, 70 percent of the nation's youths have tried alcohol, 44 percent have smoked cigarettes, 10 percent have tried marijuana and 2 percent have used cocaine.
*Twenty-five percent to 40 percent of all general hospital patients are there for alcoholism-related complications.

HEADLINE: A Second Term for Mayor Dinkins

 BODY:
At this point in the mayoral election, the cliches of disappointment are getting a real workout: Something must be badly wrong with a system that can't produce candidates better than David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani. The real issues are being oversimplified. It doesn't really matter who wins.
The first two statements may apply in this campaign, as they do in most. But it emphatically does matter that voters choose correctly between Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani. 
 It is not an easy choice, particularly for the swing voters who will determine which of these imperfect candidates will win. Either choice requires a leap of faith -- faith that Mr. Dinkins can govern more effectively, faith that Mr. Giuliani can think more judiciously about the city's problems.
We fully understand why some former Dinkins supporters have drifted to Mr. Giuliani and why others are wavering. His legal background appeals to those who believe Mr. Dinkins has been too relaxed about street crime and government corruption. Mr. Giuliani has made "quality of life" his central campaign theme. New Yorkers always hunger for candidates with a reasoned, coherent program to bring a higher degree of safety, civility and tolerance to everyday life.
But for reasons outlined below, we have concluded that Mr. Giuliani has not made the case for a change at the top. Indeed, he has convinced us that the risks of change are greater than the risks of staying with Mr. Dinkins and pushing him toward a higher standard of governance.
The Mayor is a person of humane intentions, calm temperament and sound judgment. Mr. Giuliani has presented himself as a man of hard attitudes, volatile temperament and variable judgment. He offers to take the city in hand and shake it. After four years on the job, Mr. Dinkins still has the capacity to take the city in hand and heal it.
Whether the Mayor can achieve his potential as a healer depends heavily on whether he understands why this election is so close. The voters are warning him that they want to see more discipline and diligence from him, that they want not only care but a higher order of competence as well.
We believe Mr. Dinkins can meet a loftier standard. His first two years were bumpy, in part because he was overwhelmed by the weight and complexity of the job. He is more at home now, both with the nitty-gritty of budget-making and with important decisions like the appointment of Raymond Kelly as Police Commissioner.
We know Mr. Dinkins's shortcomings. They have been recited so often as to have the feel of folklore. He is disengaged. He is more devoted to the costumes of office -- his tuxedos and dashing tennis togs -- than to the tasks of governing. He caved to the unions and let favoritism toward blacks cripple law enforcement in Crown Heights and at the Korean grocery store.
The real Dinkins record is not perfect, but it is better than this ossified caricature from the discontented. Contrary to his image of disengagement, Mr. Dinkins is among the handful of New Yorkers who understand the city budget. He has complied with the state budget-balancing law in four difficult years, and he has finally started wrestling with the built-in spending increases that produce deficits year after year.
A favorite charge against Mr. Dinkins -- that he failed to deliver as a racial healer -- has been parroted by the tabloids and by former Mayor Ed Koch in his grudge-nursing commentaries. It is an ingenious line of attack because Mr. Dinkins's skill in preventing localized racial flare-ups from becoming citywide conflagrations can be demonstrated only by noting that New York did not become Los Angeles.
What happened in Crown Heights was bad. The police gave the Mayor flawed information. He was far too slow to react. But he did not plunge in and make a bad situation worse, and when he did act, it was in the right direction.
In urban conflicts, damage controllers are appreciated only when they have been replaced by damage creators. The fear about Mr. Giuliani is that he might be such a person. Even the private assurances of Mr. Giuliani's friends that he is not as hot-headed as he used to be are disturbing.
Political leaders need an internal guidance system that allows them to dial down their own emotional temperature when people around them are dialing up theirs. Mr. Dinkins can be maddeningly phlegmatic. But Mr. Giuliani is prone to lurching behavior -- his barnyard language at the 1992 police demonstration, his strong-arm tactics during the insider-trading scandals of the 1980's -- that has to be explained away if we are to preserve faith in his leadership temperament.
After the 1989 election, it was possible to see Mr. Giuliani as a leader for the future. This campaign provided an opportunity for him to show that he had developed a balanced tough-love approach to civic problems. Instead, the vision that emerges is that of a civic Reaganism.
Faced with the most complex urban economy in America, he recommends David Stockman's silver-bullet cure-all of tax cuts that the city cannot afford and, in some cases, cannot even legislate. Louis Farrakhan wants to rent Yankee Stadium? Just say no and never mind the First Amendment. Homelessness? Ninety days and out. Authoritarianism and neglect do not add up to a social policy. There is plenty of tough in Mr. Giuliani's attitude toward the city, but where is the love?
While Mr. Giuliani has failed to offer any enlargement in his politics, there is enough in Mr. Dinkins's record to suggest that he has begun to grasp the breadth and complexity of his task. His economic development plan, while not entirely to our taste, does call for public-private partnerships in areas that can produce new jobs. His community policing initiative has added 6,070 police to the force, and the yearly number of major crimes against people and property has declined from 712,419 to 626,182 since Mr. Dinkins took office.
He has continued to build bridges to religious and ethnic communities even when he knew he would reap a scanty return in votes. He was slow to adopt Andrew Cuomo's creative proposals on homelessness, but he made a good-faith effort to meet an onerous court order demanding overnight housing for everyone. His promising effort to create a network of neighborhood-based health clinics and to expand primary health care coverage for poor New Yorkers is a model of mayoral responsibility.
On this last point, Mr. Dinkins deserves special credit. For over a decade now, there has been a sinister impulse afoot in this society to demonize the homeless, the sick and the poor. It is making itself felt in local politics in the person of candidates who want a coarser, meaner social contract. Under its hard surface, New York has a special place in American history as a citadel of humanitarian concern. Mr. Dinkins's political behavior has honored that history.
Mr. Giuliani has been stalled in the polls for several weeks now, while his strategists have tried one hot-button issue after another. Why has Mr. Giuliani stalled? Why has Mr. Dinkins confounded predictions that he would be 10 points or more out of contention by now?
Our answer is that slowly but surely New Yorkers have realized that this is an election about values. By that standard, one conclusion leaps out: In a choice between two imperfect candidates, Mr. Dinkins is clearly the more worthy.

HEADLINE: Requiem for the Supercollider

 BODY:
The death of the Superconducting Supercollider at the hands of Congress last week is a cause for sadness. Not because the huge project was the most important research on today's scientific frontiers -- it clearly wasn't. And not because it would have had an enormous impact on America's technological or economic growth -- those claims were always far-fetched.
But the supercollider was undeniably a worthy scientific project and was indispensable to the continued advance of the esoteric field of high-energy physics. It was science at its most pure and most costly, so fundamental and impractical that only the Federal Government could afford to support it. And now even the Government has concluded that the price is too high. 
 The supercollider was to be the next leap ahead in construction of particle accelerators, the giant machines that are used to study the tiniest particles of matter. It was to be housed in a huge oval tunnel, 54 miles in circumference, beneath the plains of Texas south of Dallas. The machine was designed to accelerate two beams of protons at enormously high speeds in opposite directions. When the protons collided, they would release showers of smaller particles that could be tracked and studied to shed light on the most fundamental forces and constituents of matter in the universe.
The supercollider would have accelerated particles to much higher energy ranges than now possible, in an effort to produce events and particles never before seen. Some of the world's leading physicists deemed it essential to further progress in understanding matter. But Congress was concerned about the mounting costs, which would have reached $11 billion by some estimates.
In a political climate that places great emphasis on deficit reduction, it's hard to argue that the supercollider deserved high priority for preservation. But it's even harder to believe there weren'tless-valuable programs that might have been eliminated. One could start with some of the excess planes, submarines and aircraft carriers still cherished by the Pentagon despite the end of the cold war. Or the annual subsidies of more than $10 billion to farmers. Or the hard-to-justify space station, which is more costly than the supercollider.
The supercollider expired largely because it had a relatively weak constituency and became a very visible symbol of high-cost projects -- right when Congress was looking for ways to demonstrate seriousness about deficit reduction.
The supercollider's death holds warnings for the future. On costly projects like this, it will be critical to enlist other nations as partners. And it will be imperative to project costs accurately from the start, to head off the kind of anger that developed as the supercollider's costs kept rising. The days of a blank check for science, however pathbreaking the research, are clearly over.

HEADLINE: Christopher, Resign

BYLINE: By Frank McCloskey; Frank McCloskey, Democrat of Indiana, is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As a loyal Democrat and supporter of President Clinton, I believe, with regret, that Secretary of State Warren Christopher should resign. He has severely damaged the national interest through failed leadership in difficult situations that have required a firm hand. These crises, in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Russia and Haiti, are likely to worsen because of the Administration's flawed policies.
Our Bosnia policy has been an utter failure. Mr. Christopher has vacillated and obfuscated the issue of Serbian aggression. In early February, he defined our strong strategic interests in the region and stated that our response to the war would serve as a test case of how we handled ethnic and minority concerns throughout the world. By June, he was saying we had no vital interests at stake and that our primary goal was to stop the killing. 
 The State Department has pressured the Bosnian parliament to accept a partition agreement that would ratify Serbian aggression, dismember Bosnia and lead to officially sanctioned "ethnic cleansing" and more fighting. Mr. Christopher steadfastly refused to describe Serbian atrocities in Bosnia as genocide. Why?
More than 200,000 Bosnians have been killed, and half of the rest have been driven into exile. More than 380,000 people are in the 18th month of the Sarajevo siege, but Mr. Christopher will not describe this situation as terrorism.
As for Somalia, America has no clear idea what Mr. Christopher believes our interests are and how he believes we should achieve our objectives. I still have no idea why he signed on to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's plans to capture Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid and to construct democratic institutions in Somalia out of thin air.
In a remarkable reversal prompted by public and Congressional pressure, the Administration has embraced the Bush policy toward Somalia: we will withdraw our forces and turn nation-building over to the U.N. Why did 18 Americans have to die?
In Russia, the Administration identifies Boris Yeltsin as the embodiment of democratic reform and is investing all of its faith and aid to Russia in his survival. Given his erratic behavior and his crackdown on his opponents and the press, I gravely doubt that he is a true democrat.
More important, we are encouraging violent ultra-nationalists and secessionists throughout the former Soviet Union, by failing to address Serbian aggression in the Balkans .
In Haiti, we allowed peacekeepers to be turned back by a theatrical display by a few hundred thugs. Mr. Christopher has defined the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide as a strategic interest. But as his elastic views of America's interest show, the use of "strategic" can really only refer to President Clinton's short-term domestic political interests.
So while it may have been fair in February for the Administration to suggest that it inherited the crisis in Bosnia, repeating this claim now and adding Somalia and Haiti suggest an expedient denial of responsibility.
Our allies do not see Mr. Christopher as effective internationally or as an adequate protector of U.S. interests. Largely because of his tacit acceptance of Serbian genocide, they do not see him as a spokesman for American values. And this lack of respect can be seen in our own Congress -- on both sides of the aisle.
In a recent editorial, The Economist called Mr. Christopher "the weakest link in Mr. Clinton's trio of foreign policy advisers," and added: "It is not too late to bring in a genuine enthusiast for foreign policy and one who understands, in the most hard-headed way, how the world works. The ideal candidate would be prepared to work out and articulate, not occasionally but regularly and forcefully, how America's principles apply to a given problem, where its interests in the matter lie, and how far it will go to defend them."
Warren Christopher has distinguished himself in other spheres. But if he continues on his present course, he will do further damage to our security and national interests.

The Things They Could Have Said

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Think of the opportunity that David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani had. Imagine how they could have campaigned, the things they could have talked about.
They could have described a vision of New York that would have placed a sense of hope in the path of our growing feelings of alienation and dread. They could have tempered the fears of many residents that New York is in a state of irreversible decline. 
 They could, for example, have talked to us about getting beyond discouragement to deal anew with the problem of homelessness. They could have explained why, after years of effort and the expenditure of millions of dollars, you still find people sleeping in all kinds of weather in our parks, on sidewalks and in doorways, some of them suffering in the shadows of the city's most elegant and expensive residences.
What are the implications of such problems? What can we do about them? How do we prevent them from becoming a permanent state of affairs, a growing municipal affliction, a glimpse of a crippled 21st-century New York?
The candidates could have talked about that.
They could have engaged us in a serious discussion of what it is like to be a child in New York. The city is especially hard on children. It's a place where a boy or a girl can win a science award at school in the morning, visit a world-class museum in the afternoon and then be shaken down for pocket money on the subway on the way home.
How do we enhance those things that are terrific for children and rid ourselves of the rest?
Nearly 40 percent of all children in New York live in poverty. More than 50,000 are in foster care. What can we do for those youngsters, and what kind of impact do their lives have on the rest of us? The candidates could have talked about that.
Most important, the candidates could have asked more of us, the voters. New Yorkers. They could have asked us to make a serious effort, despite our differences in life styles and backgrounds, to focus on the many things we have in common. The fight against crime. The desire for improved schools. The longing for a greater sense of community. They could have appealed to the best in us.
Instead, the candidates aimed low. What we got, in place of a stimulating campaign, was an appropriately absurd campaign symbol, a scrawny rubber chicken.
We can thank the Conservative Party candidate, George Marlin, for this dubious gift. Mr. Giuliani had made it clear that he would not participate in any debate that included Mr. Marlin. So last week, in a televised encounter with Mr. Dinkins and an empty chair, Mr. Marlin highlighted Mr. Giuliani's absence by producing the rubber chicken. Mr. Dinkins was delighted. The next day the Mayor was seen enthusiastically waving a rubber chicken at a campaign stop.
It didn't end there. All week Mr. Giuliani has been answering questions and making jokes about the chicken. On Thursday night, at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner, which all three candidates attended, Mr. Giuliani was asked what he had said when he spoke to Mr. Marlin.
He replied, "I asked him where he bought the chicken."
And what, Mr. Giuliani was asked, did Mr. Marlin say?
"He said he bought it in Bay Ridge. And he said he bought it on Saturday in Bay Ridge, when I was there, which really hurt a lot."
The most amazing thing about the chicken episode is the realization that it was an improvement over some other aspects of the campaign. We're better off listening to chicken talk, no matter how ludicrous, than to cheap and dangerous attempts to exploit racial or ethnic differences.
It's not too late for the candidates to aim a little higher. They can still debate. They still have an opportunity to level with the voters, to explain that what affects one segment of the population affects us all, and to ask us to pull together in a joint effort to turn the city around.
And they still have time to encourage an honest dialogue, even some friendships, that cut across racial, ethnic and economic lines. It's not impossible. This is not an ungovernable city and it's not a city full of haters.
Mostly it's a city starved for leadership.

VIRGIN TIME
By Patricia Hampl. Ballantine, $10.
The author journeys, materially and spiritually, to rediscover her Roman Catholic roots. On the way, she finds the need in her life not so much for God as for prayer and the capacity for wonder it requires. "There are wonderful passages in this book, buoyant, full of light," Barbara Grizzuti Harrison said here last year.
THROUGH THE IVORY GATE
By Rita Dove. Vintage Contemporaries, $11.
This first novel by the new Poet Laureate of the United States explores the relationships and memories of Virginia, a young black actress and musician who returns to Akron, Ohio, her hometown, to teach elementary school. Last year our reviewer, Geoff Ryman, said: "It is a happy book, about the pleasures of living. The author has a talent for sanguine observation." Vintage has also published Ms. Dove's SELECTED POEMS ($12), which includes three earlier volumes: "The Yellow House on the Corner," "Museum" and "Thomas and Beulah," which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987. One critic said, "Her poems exhibit the thrift that Yeats called the sign of a perfected manner." 

ON CLOWNS: The Dictator and the Artist
By Norman Manea. Grove/Atlantic Monthly, $12.
These five essays examine life in Romania under the Ceausescu regime. They illustrate the sheer tedium of the Communist bureaucracy, which the author sees as another expression of the banality of evil. One section is a censor's report on Mr. Manea's work, glossed by the author himself. "The pointless boredom of this report is almost unbelievable," John Bayley said here last year. Mr. Manea also reflects on his experiences in OCTOBER, EIGHT O'CLOCK (Grove/Atlantic Monthly, $12), short stories revealing his past as an adult under the Communist dictatorship and as a child in a Nazi concentration camp. In the same review Mr. Bayley said, "Mr. Ma nea's prose treads the edge of the poetry of nightmare."
IN MY PLACE
By Charlayne Hunter-Gault. Vintage, $11.
The author recalls her years as one of the first two black students ever enrolled at the University of Georgia. Last year our reviewer, Melissa Fay Greene, said this memoir "makes a whole, pure sound, like a musical note rising from that old segregated world."
UNDER THE FIFTH SUN: A Novel of Pancho Villa
By Earl Shorris. Norton, $11.95.
Now back in print, this tale of the Mexican outlaw-turned-revolutionary presents him as a Hispanic Robin Hood. "Mr. Shorris surrounds Villa with the magic of song," Jerome Charyn said here in 1980.
THEIR ANCIENT GLITTERING EYES: Remembering Poets and More Poets
By Donald Hall. Ticknor & Fields, $11.95.
The author captures the spirits of poets who have gone before him, from Robert Frost and T. S. Eliot to Marianne Moore and Ezra Pound. His memoir often underscores the difference between the writer and the work, concluding that the poems must stand for themselves. Last year Michiko Kakutani said in The New York Times that Mr. Hall's criticism is "humanized by the author's sympathy for his subjects' lives."
SELLING OUR SECURITY: The Erosion of America's Assets
By Martin Tolchin and Susan J. Tolchin.
Penguin, $12.50.
Martin Tolchin, a Washington correspondent for The New York Times, and Susan J. Tolchin, a professor of public administration, argue that America, in becoming the champion of foreign investment, has also become its victim. Last year our reviewer, Michael Lewis, took issue with their thesis, but noted that "they have accumulated an enormous amount of evidence that our markets are very open." The Tolchins' 1988 book BUYING INTO AMERICA: How Foreign Money Is Changing the Face of Our Nation (Farragut Publishing, $14.95) has also been reissued, with an introduction addressing recent economic developments. It is "a superb stimulus to further thought on a subject that has attracted surprisingly little debate," David Kuttner said here.
THE AFRICAN
By Harold Courlander. Owl/Holt, $12.95.
First published in 1967, this novel helped inspire Alex Haley, who was sued by the author for plagiarizing "The African" in his book "Roots." (The writers ultimately reached a settlement.) Reissued with a new preface, "The African" tells the story of Hwesuhunu, a young Dahomean boy sold into slavery in America. One critic called it "a novel of tremendous, moving proportions."
TRUE CRIME
By Michael Mewshaw. Fawcett Crest, $5.99.
A writer whose subject is family murders becomes embroiled in a case involving the deaths of his own father and the relatives of a long-lost love. In 1991 our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, said the novel "shows us how a mesmerizing storyteller works his morbid craft."
LA STORIA: Five Centuries of the Italian American
Experience.
By Jerre Mangione and Ben Morreale.
Harper Perennial, $15.
This history of Italian immigrants spans the period from the Colonies to the present day, touching on subjects from Columbus to the Cuomos. "It is a book that should be read by all Americans interested in what binds us together," Joseph V. Scelsa said here last year.
HERE TO GET MY BABY OUT OF JAIL
By Louise Shivers. Longstreet, $6.95.
In this first novel, set in North Carolina in 1937, a 20-year-old mother who passed from her childhood home to marriage falls in love with her husband's new farmhand. In 1983 our reviewer, David Quammen, praised the book's "focus, freedom from self-indulgence and clarity of purpose."

HEADLINE: Advertisements for Themselves: A Letter from Lewis Lapham

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Every publishing season sponsors at least one cause celebre, and in New York this fall the merchants of high-end literary opinion assigned the show window to a book that dwells, not surprisingly, on themselves. "New York Days" (review, Sept. 5) is a sentimental memoir in which the author, Willie Morris, describes his tenure as the editor of Harper's Magazine in the years 1967-71 as a lost golden age of American letters, when journalism was poetry and all the writers at all the tables at Elaine's were the natural children of William Faulkner or Henry James. 
 Preceded by a murmur of gossip in late August, the book made the promotional rounds in early September (appearing as display goods in New York magazine, Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and The New York Times Book Review), and on the radio talk show circuit Mr. Morris told his tale of genius thwarted and art betrayed in fragments cut to the measure of the retail trade. Faithful to the text, he didn't omit a single cliche -- sensitive but lionhearted son of the literary South travels north from Mississippi to rescue the lamp of American literature from the cave of the Philistines; heroic editor, providentially arrived on Manhattan's Upper East Side, rallies to the banners of conscience every famous journalist in New York and wages remorseless war against the enemies of innocence and truth; for a brief and shining moment the world is made of metaphors, but then the awful day dawns on which the rain comes to Camelot, and Mr. Morris is brought down by the hounds of finance capitalism.
Toward the end of "New York Days" Mr. Morris takes me to task for refusing to endorse his version of the events in question, and for neglecting to resign as one of the magazine's contributing writers when he resigned as its editor. Then as now, I thought his gesture foolish and unnecessary, but he talks about what was a difference of opinion as if it were a crime of lese-majeste. Although I didn't become editor of Harper's Magazine until 1976, five years after Mr. Morris returned to the South, he continues to imagine that somehow I arranged his abrupt exit from the New York literary stage. The suspicion is of a piece with the rest of his tale.
My own memory of the time and place so flatly contradicts his portrait in nostalgic pastel (in the specific instances as well as the general propositions) that on reading his book and its attendant publicity, I assumed that one of us was looking at the reverse images seen in a mirror. What Mr. Morris presents as a golden age I remember as an age of tinsel; his cast of fearless prophets I remember as a crowd of self-important pharisees; the books that he names as the last page proofs of authentic journalism (among them "In Cold Blood," by Truman Capote; "Miami and the Siege of Chicago," by Norman Mailer; and "The Best and the Brightest," by David Halberstam) I would name as the first spawn of the synthetic melodrama that leads, more or less directly, to Oprah and Geraldo and Joe McGinniss pretending to be Teddy Kennedy; what to Mr. Morris's mind appears as disinterested reporting appears to my mind as relentless self-promotion, and well before I had reached the end of "New York Days" I thought that it captured, all too perfectly, the spirit of an age that debased the currency of its idealism with the coinage of celebrity.
Given the prevailing rates of inflation cheapening the measures of value elsewhere in the society, the loss of definition and purpose in what used to be called the fourth estate was probably inevitable. Before 1960 most of the writers and editors working on newspapers in New York understood that they had more in common with carpenters or stone masons than they did with diplomats or poets. Many of them were self-educated, and they hired themselves out as journeymen, not as immortal artists. Having come of age in the 1930's and 40's, they were schooled in the lessons of poverty, and they tended to identify with the crowd in the bleachers rather than with the swells in the box seats. If asked to state their occupation, they would have said "reporter" or "newspaperman" (the term "journalist" pertained only to Englishmen and fops), and they sought to write a simple and translucent prose, the idea being to make more clearly visible the subject of the story.
I was attracted to the trade in the late 1950's because it seemed to offer a means of questioning the delusions of grandeur that were beginning to afflict the American oligarchy. As an apprentice member of that oligarchy, educated at a New England prep school and Yale University, I understood that in return for admission to the box seats the guests were expected to admire the benign wisdom of the corporations buying the golf balls or the salmon on toast. Not wanting to pay the price of a ticket, and admiring instead the skepticism of Ambrose Bierce, H. L. Mencken and I. F. Stone, I assumed that the newspaperman who did his job correctly couldn't expect to be welcomed with grateful applause at the nation's better country clubs.
So bleak a prospect didn't sit well with the temper of the times. The 60's were about having it both ways -- a reputation for principled objection and first-class hotel suites at the political conventions, a publisher's advance extended to six figures and a blue work shirt signifying the author's contempt for money. The voices of conscience decorated the dinner tables of power, and within a year of President John F. Kennedy's glamorous arrival in the White House, the suddenly respectable "profession of journalism" was attracting volunteers from Harvard and Princeton. The new recruits arrived with bound volumes of the absolute truth, comfortable in the assumption that the aura of academic entitlement conferred the badges of moral as well as intellectual superiority. The rates of pay kept pace with the expanding wealth of the communications industries, and by the end of the decade the higher-priced operatives found it easy to regard themselves as the peers of the political and theatrical figures about whom they composed their best-selling romances. The ambiguity of the Vietnam War compounded the confusion, and just as the moralists among them came to imagine that they were better qualified to govern the country than the candidates elected to public office, so also they dressed themselves in the mantles of self-righteousness.
IF before 1960 most people recognized irreducible differences among journalism, literature, politics and the movies, the distinctions dissolved under the technical and epistemological pressures of the next 10 years. The lines between fact and fiction became as irrelevant as they were difficult to distinguish, and the several forms of expression once known as the lively arts fused into the common alloy of the mass media. News was entertainment and entertainment was news, and everybody was staging his or her shows and special effects in the same theater of celebrity.
Under the rubric of what was beginning to be called the new journalism, magazine writers claimed the exemptions of novelists manque. The presumption allowed them to arrange the materials at hand (descriptions of scene, tones of voice, fragments of conversation, impressions of character, etc.) into whatever designs attracted the most applause and the highest fees. By substituting the veneer of a precocious style for the weight of fact, and making little or no distinction between subject and object (the interviewer being as important as, often more important than, the interviewee), they presented their own advertisements for reality as literal renderings of the world of historical event.
In the hands of a genuinely accomplished writer, the sleight of hand sometimes resulted in a genuinely good book (Tom Wolfe's "Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" or Norman Mailer's "Executioner's Song"), but mostly the license to invent dialogue and assign motive produced portentous tracts ("The Powers That Be," by David Halberstam; "Veil," by Bob Woodward) made of the same poor stuff as television docudrama.
The technique worked reasonably well on the margins of society -- among Hell's Angels and hopeful movie actresses, on tour with politicians, Jackie Onassis and other journalists. The technique didn't work so well among people who didn't need the publicity. Unless the journalist first translated himself into a sycophant, he had trouble gaining access to the higher tiers of authority. Who would talk to the fellow except in lies and half-truths? Certainly not newspaper publishers or network executives; nobody in the investment banks, the Pentagon, the influential law firms, the White House or the corporations. The high-priced journalists of the day resolved the dilemma by taking to heart the lessons of the Age of Aquarius and "Jesus Christ Superstar," and they began to write books -- ostensibly about war, or politics, or the Presidency -- that could have been uniformly entitled "All About Me."
As a corollary to the assertion of artistic temperament, the journalists coming to prominence in the late 1960's appropriated the pose of bohemianism. Mr. Morris strikes the pose throughout the whole length of "New York Days," placing much of the book's action at the tables in Elaine's and presenting himself and his companions as embattled artists who disdain the bribes and comforts of bourgeois success.
Nothing in the book seemed to me as false, or so plainly at odds with my own memory. Elaine's didn't achieve its notoriety during the 1960's because it was a refuge for the avant-garde. Then as now, the restaurant served a double purpose, both as a point of exit from the drawing rooms of polite convention and as a port of entry into the gossip columns and the big money. Mr. Morris and his friends appreciated the merit of the second purpose, paying assiduous court to the ranking magnificoes of the media establishment, collecting the acquaintance of well-known writers as eagerly as boys collecting autographed baseballs, saying whatever it was necessary to say to receive an invitation to East Hampton or Martha's Vineyard. Mostly they talked about the proofs of their own importance, about playing tennis with Ben Bradlee or eating oysters with Sophia Loren, about the effrontery of publishers who neglected to provide them with limousines when they toured their books through Texas.
Very little of the supposedly tough-minded journalism that appeared in Harper's Magazine during the late 1960's risked giving offense to the wisdom in office. The putative champions of liberty took up the cry of dissent only after it had become profitable and safe. The magazine published its denunciations of the Vietnam War when the crowds of angry students were already in the streets; the sentiments in favor of the civil rights movement appeared at a time when they had become the stuff of corporate advertising.
An air of conscience-stricken protest was in keeping with the spirit of the age, and most of the people who showed up in Elaine's in the years 1967-71 understood the joke. The humor and good feeling of the place was grounded in the tone of irony, but Mr. Morris was one of the people who believed their own press notices. He reproduces the effect in "New York Days" when he talks about Harper's Magazine as if his brief tenure as its editor encompassed the entire 143 years of its existence. Indifferent to the past and resentful of the future, he succeeds in writing a memoir almost utterly bereft of a sense of history.
Although I can understand why Mr. Morris would want to write the book, I'm less certain of the reasons for its polite reception in New York publishing circles. By and large the reviews were sympathetic, and although the book itself was hard to praise (the kindest adjective that anybody could come up with was "romantic"), the critics managed to fill the assigned space with the bibelots of their own nostalgia.
Maybe they have come to regret the trend toward solipsism that has afflicted American writing over the last 20 years, a trend that argues not so much for the lack of literary talent as for the loss of a standard by which people can judge the acts of the moral and artistic imagination. The bookstores resemble circuses and fairs, and the thousands of books so gaudily tricked up on the shelves clamor for attention in the wheedling voices of fortunetellers, money-changers, animal trainers, herbalists, cooks, sorcerers, augurs, gamblers, military captains and successful thieves. The author-who-would-be-king achieves expression in his life rather than his art, but as each new book becomes a further dramatization in the theater of self, nobody can decide whether the acts should be performed on a stage, in dumb show or on a trapeze.
Against the backdrop of celebrity biography, maybe Mr. Morris's exhibit of illusions preserved looks like a window decoration by Ralph Lauren. In place of shaving brushes and steamer trunks and English riding boots, Mr. Morris offers square-jawed writers in tweed coats, striking defiant poses against the establishment, smoking Lucky Strikes. Most of the critics perceived a resemblance to the dreams of their own youth, and with the conspicuous exception of Louis Menand in The New Yorker, they were glad of the chance to tell themselves a fairy tale.
Yes, dearly beloved, once upon a time in America, and not so very long ago, books still meant something and literature hadn't become a regional dialect spoken only in the universities. The merchants of truth and light apparently were so grateful for the romance of Peter Pan, still at large in Never-Never Land, that they, like Mr. Morris, missed the irony. Even as they deplored the shabbiness of the goods in their latter-day literary emporium, they gave thanks for the counterfeit coin in which they counted their losses.

HEADLINE: Two Worlds of Kurt Masur Collide in New York

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Ten minutes before curtain time in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center, Kurt Masur faced an unusual kind of dressing-room dilemma: Which set of tails to wear?
The choice was between the long black coat he always wears when he conducts the New York Philharmonic, or the long black coat he always wears when he conducts his other orchestra, the Leipzig Gewandhaus. 
 Downstairs, on the Philharmonic's home stage, the house lights were going down, but it was the Gewandhaus that was tuning up. Upstairs, Mr. Masur fretted. Isn't one long black coat about the same as another? Well, not quite: the Leipzig coat has two buttons above the waist on the side facing the audience. The New York coat has a plain back.
Finally Mr. Masur put on the Leipzig tails.
 
Venerable Families Reunite
 The decisions one has to make at a family reunion (which is what this amounted to). Instead of long-lost aunts and "can't stand each other" cousins crowding into the same room, Mr. Masur's two orchestras were in the same concert hall, two venerable ensembles linked by the bearded, bearish-looking music director. But this time, the Philharmonic was out in the audience, listening.
And then, after the rest of the audience had gone home, the two orchestras gathered for a classical-music version of what psychologists might call interpersonal bonding: a party on the Promenade at Avery Fisher Hall. Horn players from New York schmoozed with horn players from Leipzig, and string players from the Gewandhaus talked shop with string players from the Philharmonic. In English, mostly. And mostly without consulting the German-English dictionaries many had tucked away in pockets or purses.
So they could tell the two orchestras apart, the Philharmonic players pinned red carnations to their labels to identify themselves. The Gewandhaus players were given white ones. Christian Giger, the Gewandhaus's principal cellist, tucked a white flower into his shoulder-high instrument case. Then he asked Evangeline Benedetti, a Philharmonic cellist, to guard it while he went to the bar. Not until he returned, champagne in hand, did she find out just what was inside: a Baroque beauty made in Venice in 1710 by Matteo Goffriller. There are string players who put Goffriller more or less in the same category as Stradivari for violinists or Guarneri for violists.
"Pretty nice cello," Ms. Benedetti said.
 
Not Yet John Wayne
 Someone from the Gewandhaus wanted to know if Mr. Masur, with his trademark bolo tie, was the John Wayne of New York. (Not really, a New Yorker said.) Someone from the Philharmonic wanted to know if a Gewandhaus counterpart had got a telephone yet. "Yes," the Gewandhaus player said. "It only takes two years."
Unlike some family get-togethers, there were no "remember the time we dunked Uncle Clarence in the swimming pool" conversation-starters. But the two orchestras' first encounter, last spring in Leipzig, came up again and again. It too was a post-concert party, but in contrast to the stark 20th-century glass and marble of Avery Fisher Hall, it took place in a centuries-old castle. Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic's managing director, said it was a once-in-a-lifetime event. Some Gewandhaus musicians said they had one regret: it ended too soon, because the Philharmonic had a concert the next day.
This time, there was talk of Germany and the Gewandhaus in the post-Communist world and what unification will mean for the orchestra's financial underpinnings, which seem less sturdy than they were in a centralized economy. And there was speculation about whether Mr. Masur will be given yet another job, as President of Germany. He has said he is happy with the two jobs he already has, but rumors keep swirling. "Maybe he'd be a better candidate than the politicians, but as members of the Gewandhaus, we will be happy if he doesn't get the job," said Henrik Hochschild, the Gewandhaus's assistant concertmaster.
 
Out-of-Body Experience
 Inevitably, the conversation turned to the concert that had just ended. Mr. Masur had stabbed the air the way he always does. He had jumped around on the podium the way he always does and had shaken his corona of white hair the way he always does. He had swished his arms in big circles the way he always does. But something was different, so different that one Philharmonic player said the concert was like an out-of-body experience.
Maybe this was because the Philharmonic was out in the audience, with about 50 musicians in seats Mr. Masur had bought himself. Another 40 or 50 were in seats set aside by Lincoln Center Productions, which sponsored the concert. It was hard to tell which was more surprising to the New Yorkers: that the hard-boiled Philharmonic players would show up at Avery Fisher Hall when they had the night off, or that the same conductor conducting the same music they had played with him could get such different results.
"Interpretive-wise, he was the same, but we have a very different sound," Mr. Smith said. "It's like comparing football teams. What happens depends on the players."
David Finlayson, a trombonist in the Philharmonic, said that hearing the Gewandhaus had given him a new take on what Mr. Masur wants.
"It truly made clear the things he tries to get out of us," Mr. Finlayson said. "They understand him so well, it strikes you in the face: now I understand what he means about phrasing, balance, dynamics. To hear this orchestra moves us into one more level of understanding."
 
Strings' Darker Sound
 Even Mr. Masur was surprised. "It was more different than I expected," he said. The warm, mellow sound of the strings in the Gewandhaus was darker than he had figured it would be in Avery Fisher Hall, where he demanded, and got, baffles and risers on the stage to improve the long-criticized acoustics.
For their part, the Gewandhaus musicians said that playing in Mr. Masur's home-away-from-home underscored how he had changed since he decided to divide his time between the 251-year-old Gewandhaus and the 151-year-old Philharmonic. "Since he's been in New York, he does things somewhat differently," said Roderick MacDonald, the Gewandhaus's principal trumpet player. "We've done certain pieces over and over, and there's been an evolution."
Mr. Hochschild, the assistant concertmaster, said: "I have the feeling sometimes he comes to Leipzig with new ideas about pieces we played before. Maybe this is because now he has another orchestra. This is good for us. It helps keep your brain going."
Soon, it was time for good-byes: the Gewandhaus is on a 15-day, 12-concert tour that will take them as far west as Iowa City, Iowa, and the musicians had to get some sleep before their next concert, at the Tilles Center at C. W. Post College in Greenvale, L.I. Tonight they are scheduled to play at the United Nations. Tomorrow, it's on to Washington and a concert at the John F. Kennedy Center.

HEADLINE: 'May We Help You?': Downstairs at the Majestic

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
DOWN in the bowels of the Majestic apartment house, Allan Sorensen recalls his days at sea as a merchant mariner, when he savored the interior hum from machinery and passing ocean that signaled all was well aboard his ship.
"The Majestic is exactly like a ship," says Mr. Sorensen, the resident manager of the grand, double-towered building of 254 apartments, which is too complex to have someone termed a mere old-fashioned apartment superintendent at the helm as it cruises in place through urban time and tide on Central Park West at 72d Street. 
 "It feels good and absolutely secure in here when everything is going right and there are no emergencies," says the 55-year-old master of the Majestic, dressed crisply in a business suit and tie as he makes his rounds of the portals and corridors of the 32-story structure, with the day shift of his 49-member crew snapping to polite attention as he approaches.
"Very good, sir," replies a service elevator operator -- 10 of the 12 elevators are staffed -- when Mr. Sorensen greets him with the not-incidental question of how things are going.
"Lost something?" Mr. Sorensen suddenly asks, spying the required name plate absent from the man's immaculate uniform (temperate gray, with the blue-black winter uniform not due until November). "Check it out," Mr. Sorensen instructs, moving on to the next station as the elevator man ponders the reprimand.
"You look, you listen, you smell," says Mr. Sorensen, summarizing his executive art as he moves past the marble-and-wood turnings of the Moderne-styled building. Its lines rise in Art Deco contrast to the Gotham-Gothic rigging of the Dakota, moored in dark glory just north across the street. "You can smell leaks; you can hear some new sound in a wall," says the 20-year veteran of ankle-deep emergency leaks in the Majestic. "This all becomes a habit."
Mr. Sorensen is good enough at this habit of keeping a buildingful of affluent, demanding New Yorkers on an even keel that he is well known among the downstairs profession that underpins the city's better houses, and he is occasionally sought out for hire by some other posh apartment buildings.
"I like it here," he says, discreetly declining to discuss which co-op-board raiders have been rebuffed in paying him the compliment lately.
Part C.E.O., part engineer, part work-gang leader, Mr. Sorensen reigns in the backstairs world of affluent apartment dwelling where the prices are higher than elsewhere -- 13 Majestic apartments were resold for a total of $11.2 million this year through September -- but the problems are the same, just larger in scale.
He has six rooftop water tanks to be regularly drained and cleaned, and he manages 30 outside specialists who work on scaffolds recaulking and waterproofing the place, especially the storm-eroded towers. He has three different oil-burner and boiler complexes to run from the building's 20,000-gallon fuel tank. But he also has the standing option to switch over to natural gas, like a commodity broker, as he did during the Persian Gulf war, when the nine-member co-op board agreed that that was the more economical path.
He has to see to the purchase of every light bulb and can of wax; monitor the new high-gloss lobby off West 72d Street where an alternative to the traditional matte finish is being carefully tested; make sure the Majestic's own in-house mail clerk sorts and delivers the mail on time and puts away letters for absent tenants; check on the weekly renewal of floral arrangements; deal with seven different co-op subcommittees, from legal to lobby; and have each tenant's name at hand as he wanders, right down to the four different branches of the Herlands clan, each with a separate apartment.
"He's wonderful; he runs a good ship," says Jane Bressler, a trust and estate lawyer who has lived there 15 years. "Mr. Sorensen knows every nook and cranny, every wall and pipe, and he loves reminding us."
The building occupies the block front running beside the park from 71st to 72d Streets. Its U-shaped layout makes it the equivalent of three lower buildings plus the two towers, with three separate entrances and no easy way to move laterally among the five parts. This adds a maze-mastering touch to Mr. Sorensen's expertise.
He is the one staff member who gets a Majestic apartment, though not one of the $2 million flats, as part of his remuneration, which he otherwise declines to discuss. This puts him on 24-hour alert, with his doorbell a part of a communications system that includes beeper and walkie-talkie.
"You find out what the story is and then you either run or walk," Mr. Sorensen says. He has met some of his neighboring building superintendents but alibis like a true New Yorker: "Good people, but I don't have time to socialize."
He came from out of the East -- from 760 Park Avenue, directly across the park at East 72d Street. "I was staring at the Majestic all the while I worked there," he says, as if explaining fate. And from the East before that, having worked up an apprenticeship arc in Queens at Holliswood Gardens and other respected domiciles. And from the East before that, having quit the Danish merchant marine 28 years ago because he liked the Manhattan skyline and what it promised.
Mr. Sorensen came ashore at the urging of a shipmate, Henry Jacobson, who preceded him into building superintendency in the New World and later saw him rise to be president of the Scandinavian Superintendents Guild in the city. This is a group whose heyday has already yielded to the ascendancy of a new generation of Yugoslav and Russian apartment house handymen and supers. They sponsor one another for American citizenship, too, as Mr. Jacobson did for Mr. Sorensen in a noble immigrant tradition rooted in the apartment boiler rooms of the city.
"I've got Danny Hickey," Mr. Sorensen says reverentially about an earlier ethnic wave of apartment house toilers, the Irish, and more particularly about Mr. Hickey's 30 years of service at the Majestic. He is the head porter, known for never saying no to any request from residents, never shirking from the first flakes of snow shoveling. "Danny makes it easy to keep standards up," Mr. Sorensen said.
Mr. Hickey admits he now needs the Majestic's residents and staff more than they may need him. "Just walked in off the boat the same day I arrived," he says, still feeling fortunate. "If I didn't like it here I wouldn't have worked here that long, now would I?" asks Mr. Hickey, who lives in the Bronx.
THE Majestic is not quite a workers' utopia, as the staff proved in joining the 12-day apartment house strike in the city two years ago. But their membership responsibility to Employees Service International's action has not, they stress, altered the basic good relations with tenants.
Some staff members, like John Mulhall, the head captain, who is second in command to Mr. Sorensen, got into the business because their fathers were in it. "I think there's an advantage in being a native New Yorker in this line of work," Mr. Mulhall speculates with a Manhattanite's eye on the passing crowd. "I mean, born here, you've seen it all by a fairly early age and you learn to be wary, respectful."
After 18 years at the Majestic, Mr. Mulhall says: "It's not for everybody. You have to be tolerant and patient and understand where people are coming from, not take things on a personal basis. Be helpful. Things can go haywire at the drop of a hat. Guests arrive from abroad and the key's not there. Someone calls from the airport that they've forgotten their tickets. Pipes break. A relief man is stuck on the subway."
The Majestic's housing roll is heavy with professionals in finance, the law and medicine. Residents mention only one true celebrity tenant, Kathleen Battle, the soprano. "The Dakota and San Remo tend to attract the stars," says Ms. Bressler, hardly regretful. She is a co-op board member who works on a myriad of projects like reviving the building newsletter and, as a lawyer, volunteering 250 hours to a complicated shift in the building's cable-television contract.
"Very demanding, very rewarding," she says of being on the board.
The Majestic flashes like a dual beacon amid the park's western flank of wealth. Street mendicants are a regular but easily manageable problem, says Mr. Sorensen, whose technique is to have his doormen deny them full attention but firmly shunt them along in the great out-there. Entering the lobby, a stranger is instantly approached with a firm and smiling "May I help you?" that carries just the right implicit lacing of "What might you be doing here?" to keep the Majestic's aura intact.
"It's important you don't greet people on the edge, don't agitate them," says Mr. Sorensen, who celebrates the sightings of more police officers on foot patrol. The Majestic's security committee tries to be discreet, obtaining a list of current patients' names from a building dentist so doormen can weed out potential interlopers with a smile.
Mr. Sorensen declines to discuss details of criminal invasion except to recall one well-tailored man several years back, who robbed a resident in the elevator. He made an easy exit by urgently calling for help, as if a victim, and directing Mr. Sorensen and others to race down a corridor. "He even paused to have the doorman order him a taxi, then went over to rob an East Side building," Mr. Sorensen recalls of the intrusion with a certain appreciation for neighborhood class.
Humor, the only thing that threatens his Nordic-Majestic mask of relentless discretion, causes him to recall, in turn, an even classier cat burglar who climbed up an outside cable-television conduit merely, it turned out, to enter a suite and fry himself some eggs in the custom-designed kitchen. "But that was on the East Side," Mr. Sorensen reminds himself discreetly.
Mr. Sorensen meets with co-op board members at least once a week. "The board is on top of everything, very involved, working hard," says Gail Wainer of Wallack Management, the building's agent. She is a regular visitor, checking such details as the changeover to tenants' recycling of trash, which, Majestically, is picked up three times daily at each apartment by the elevator men.
SUCH touches may compound the air of Never-Never Land that less-endowed New Yorkers find wisping about the turrets, ramparts and penthouse orchards of the dowager buildings lining Central Park. But Bill Schwarz, 72, who is the dean of the Majestic staff with 38 years of service, takes a more complicated view when he finishes his tour as night captain and rides the subway home to Queens at 1 A.M.
"Quite a trip," he says. "There's 42d Street, the city's hellhole, with the cops and guard dogs, all characters and creatures imaginable along the way. The Majestic represents a certain tradition of neighborhood, a quality of neighborhood in the city that I think is still very much, 80 percent alive in a lot of plain neighborhoods, too. I've lived for years in Jackson Heights -- great place in its day -- and find the same truth there: fine homes, fine people, 80 percent holding up."
A new high-security service entrance is about to open at the Majestic, and for the staff its best virtue is an easy ramp in place of the 20 steps that the scores of daily delivery workers have to take with groceries and furniture. On a routine day, loads of masonry and lumber arrive, too, with a dozen major renovation projects going on in apartment suites as large as a triplex. "In the last year or so, more tenants have begun spending on renewal work again," Mr. Sorensen notes, taking this as a harbinger of the economy.
It's not the first time the Majestic has played fiscal barometer. Built in 1930 on the site of the turn-of-the-century Hotel Majestic, the apartment building was intended for a level of grand affluence that reigned before the Great Depression, with suites ranging from 11 to 24 rooms. But when the market crashed in mid-construction, designs were pruned back to single-bedroom apartments and suites up to 14-room maximums, alas.
The staff is divided into three sections in Mr. Sorensen's system: the front men, who staff the building entrances and lobbies, dealing directly with tenants; the service workers who run the elevators and clean above and below; and the six handymen, who, as elsewhere in city apartment dwelling, rank as a hybrid of domestic SWAT team and urban demigods among the klutzy masses.
"One thing we always have in our pocket is a special key for shutting off the water supply under apartment sinks," says Mike Pagan, the head handyman. He originally learned cabinetmaking, then branched into plumbing, masonry, glazing, lock repair, air-conditioning and assorted other specialties that have him ranging like a circuit marshal from the rooftop water towers to the basement water pumps, stopping regularly for hapless residents in between.
"I started in 1961 by helping a superintendent in the Bronx," he said. "Went to union school and community college to keep learning the details. I've got no complaints here." For all the Majestic staff's politesse, Mr. Pagan is gunslinger-terse in his work belt of pliers, screwdriver and flashlight.
Mr. Sorensen's definition of the Majestic is the same as for the city -- "the whole world in one." All moods, all people can manage, or be managed, within both places, he says, explaining the lure of the land for him. "I left the ocean behind for good," he affirms, listening for the interior hum of the Majestic.
 
 
 
A LANDMARK'S HISTORY
 The Majestic has a venerable past, beginning with the completion of the Hotel Majestic more than 100 years ago. Here is a chronology compiled by Christopher Gray, an architectural historian.
FALL 1884 -- The Dakota opens at the northwest corner of 72d Street and Central Park West, starting a new era on the street, hitherto largely undeveloped.
1894 -- The 12-story Hotel Majestic, at the southwest corner, is completed; by 1900 it is one of a string of blocklong apartments or apartment-hotels, like the San Remo, the Beresford and the Eldorado, where residents get maid service and have meals in a central dining room.
APRIL 1929 -- Irwin Chanin, a theater builder, files plans for a 45-story apartment-hotel on the site of the Majestic, which he would tear down. His scheme provides for apartments of 11 to 24 rooms.
OCT. 1, 1929 -- Chanin formally acquires the old Majestic for an undisclosed amount and begins demolition.
OCT. 23, 1929 -- Stock-market crash.
AUGUST 1930 -- In a troubled real-estate climate, Chanin files revised plans for the present 32-story building, with apartments of 4 to 14 rooms.
FALL 1931 -- The new Majestic opens. The Chanin Organization describes the streamlined exterior, designed by Jacques Delamarre, as "Modern American." Tenants are encouraged to rent "at 1931 prices," less than pre-crash rents. Special features include corner windows, a giant rooftop solarium, colored bathroom fixtures, a central radio antenna and, in every window, Vitaglass, designed to admit ultraviolet light.
FEBRUARY 1932 -- In lieu of foreclosure, rents are assigned directly to the Continental Bank and Trust. Foreclosures were to become common for luxury apartment buildings, especially new ones, by the mid-30's.
MARCH 1932 -- According to Peter Salwen's 1989 history, "Upper West Side Story," Bruno Hauptmann, who would be executed for the Lindbergh kidnapping, worked as a carpenter at the Majestic.
MARCH 1933 -- Chanin defaults on the mortgage and loses the building to Continental.
1937 -- The building is sold to the New York Majestic Corporation, which will own the Majestic for the next 21 years.
1957 -- The Majestic goes co-op, with apartments selling for the upscale price of about $2,000 a room. (On May 2, the gangster Frank Costello, a resident, is in the lobby when a gunman shouts, "This is for you, Frank." Costello is shot in the head but only wounded.)

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Bodega Life: Big Markups and Small Profits

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
MERENGUE plays continuously over the speakers at the Gelines Grocery in the western Bronx. Every so often Santos Montilla, the proprietor, gets caught up in the music and, while talking to a customer, drums out the beat with his hands on cartons of canned food and soft drinks stacked in the narrow aisles.
It is a nervous gesture. Mr. Montilla, only 20, was thrown prematurely into running the family bodega by the death of his father, Damaso, who was shot on Aug. 5. The shooting was one of numerous acts of violence that mar the lives of thousands of immigrants who, by opening small food stores, try to get a foothold in the New York economy. 
 Right now, the foothold is tenuous, not only at Gelines Grocery but at many small food stores owned by immigrant families, whether they are Koreans, Chinese or, like the Montillas, Dominican. The weak economy has made sales fall. And well before Damaso Montilla was killed as he returned home from the store -- by unknown assailants perhaps bent on robbery -- the family's take-home income had dropped from more than $600 a week in better times to nearly nothing.
"We don't make anything," the son said, explaining in Spanish that sales had shrunk to $17,000 a week -- a barely break-even level -- from more than $20,000 in the 1980's. "I have to squeeze out money from store funds for my car and for the family's expenses, but even this is hard."
For many New Yorkers, Korean greengrocers are the most familiar examples of immigrant entrepreneurs. Their stores are everywhere, while Hispanic bodegas stay mostly within Latin neighborhoods. But Dominicans have come in huge numbers in recent years and now operate more small stores in New York City than any other ethnic group -- over 6,000, according to the Dominican Association of Merchants and Professionals.
Despite the hard times, Mr. Montilla and his stepmother, Altagracia Montilla, talk of selling out at a handsome profit someday. Mr. Montilla would then be free, he says, to get a high-school equivalency diploma and go to college for computer engineering. Or he might skip college and buy a McDonald's franchise, "if I can find the right location."
Even as he talks hopefully of the future, Mr. Montilla admits he might never make it beyond the bodega at 179th Street and University Avenue. But surely, he says, his two younger stepbrothers and his stepsister will. They are in high school and are kept away from the store. One stepbrother, Albin, is a star high school baseball player and once traveled to Japan for a championship Little League playoff, Mr. Montilla says proudly.
Although he is tied to the store for 12- and 14-hour days, Mr. Montilla dresses more like a college student than a bodega owner, appearing on a recent day in a blue-and-red-striped rugby shirt, brown khaki pants and thin, oval glasses. He joined his father in the United States six years ago; like most owners, he speaks little English and relies on a bilingual accountant to deal with the city.
An outgoing, good-natured man, Mr. Montilla often greets his Dominican customers by name. But he keeps a revolver in the store for protection in a neighborhood where blacks, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans live uneasily together. And he and his half-dozen employees (none earns above the minimum wage) patrol the aisles for shoplifters.
Adding to the pressure, Mr. Montilla has borrowed $20,000 from a loan company at a rate of 30 percent a year. His father, in addition, left him years' worth of unpaid water bills, amounting to $38,000.
"The landlord took me to court and I have paid some of it, and I have planned to pay the rest, at $1,000 a month," Mr. Montilla said.
The pinched times are evident in the store's pricing strategy. The best-selling items are drinks: beer, bottled water, sodas and every flavor of fruit juice. These fill the refrigerated, self-service cases along one side of the store. And as Mr. Montilla and an employee, Manuel Badia, unpacked newly delivered cases, they stuck prices on each bottle that included a 40-percent markup.
Packaged food, household items and dairy products are different. Like many bodegas, the Gelines Grocery resembles a miniature supermarket in the variety of merchandise it carries. But it must compete with a supermarket three blocks away, and price markups are generally kept low.
"The bodega client, coming in here from the neighborhood or from the buses that stop outside the store, buys the items that he needs or wants right away, while the supermarket customer does a big shopping," said Mr. Badia, a former bodega owner whose own store failed.
Dairy products, the worst sellers at Gelines Grocery, return only 7 percent more than their cost, and many food or kitchen items can't be marked up more than 15 percent, which is very little in a business where larger markups are the norm to cover expenses and leave a profit.
Snacks like potato chips, on the other hand, sell well, and they are displayed on shelves near the front of the store. Mr. Montilla has to purchase them for cash. Other suppliers give him credit, but rarely for more than 30 days. To help make ends meet, Mr. Montilla, and many other owners, have allowed pinball machines into the store. Gelines has two.
But the worst problem for the city's small groceries may be the landlord. Commercial properties are free of rent control. A bodega owner can spend a half-dozen years furnishing a store and building up a business, then, at the end of the lease, face not only a sharply higher rent but also a fee for a new lease.
This has already happened once to the Montillas, and they expect it will happen again when their lease expires in 1996. A few months before Damaso Montilla's death, the landlord advised the Montillas that he would sign a 15-year lease with them at a rent of $3,500, a $500 increase. But the Montillas would have to pay the landlord $55,000.
Protesting such treatment, the Dominican Merchants Association is urging the City Council to enact a bill, already before the Council, that would provide for arbitration in rent disputes. But Mr. Montilla and his step-mother say they will pay the $55,000, and when times improve, they will sell the store, and the remaining years on the lease.
"What are you going to do?" Mr. Montilla said. "This is a valuable store on a good corner, near colleges, and people come here from other areas. Sales at least have not fallen below $17,000 a week, and when they pick up again, we'll be all right."

HEADLINE: The Snooty Dame at the Block Party

BYLINE: By Gerri Hirshey; Gerri Hirshey writes a column about popular culture for GQ.

 BODY:
We are Where America Shops -- at Sears, in Glendale, Calif. And Americans -- college students, Hispanic moms with toddlers, old people -- are gawking at a striking apparition poised on the stairway to the women's fitting room. Cindy Crawford, supermodel, Hollywood wife and hostess of MTV's fashion program "House of Style," is calling out her bra size -- off camera -- above the racks of industrial-gauge corsets. 
 Standing by, catalogue in hand, is Simon LeBon of the British rock group Duran Duran. He's pointing to a saucy black lace push-up bra. He mugs for the MTV camera and speaks loudly into the courtesy phone.
"Do you have that in a buxom 34-B?"
LeBon is wearing men's pajamas, his initial selection in a made-for-MTV shopping spree with the "House of Style" crew. Style chameleon David Bowie had been slated to lead the expedition; he bought himself a boxy stage suit at Sears before he was able to trade up to Versace and Savile Row. Alas, scheduling problems kept the soigne Mr. B elsewhere with his wife, the fashion model Iman. Rock and style have been keeping close company for years; more and more, they're making it legal.
LeBon, also married to a model, seems pleased, almost giddy to be at play in these fields of polyblend and rayon. Duran Duran began as one of the so-called haircut bands that surfaced in the fashion-mad 80's. Before Madonna hooked her first video bustier, these boys knew the business end of an eyeliner pencil. It was a mode of grooming uber alles. Dandies and ersatz pirates, french cuffs and bondage trousers -- the London club look sold whole cloth on MTV. For some bands, fashion stylists became as de rigueur as Jack Daniel's and roadies.
LeBon says he's still possessed of deep closet; here amid the garish racks he's a right puckish juxtaposeur, helping bandmate Nick Rhodes accessorize a pair of Dickies overalls with about two dozen polyester clip-on ties. LeBon's own clothes lie in a pile back in the Nintendo section: jaggedly cutoff white jeans, work boots, high white crew socks and a pricey ruffled shirt in flowered red silk by Vivienne Westwood, fashion consigliere to the Sex Pistols -- and to the kinkier Kensington debs.
"Rock-and-roll sportswear," LeBon explains in Robin Leach hypetones. "For the life style of utterly relentless chic!"
The black bra arrives; Crawford takes it into a dressing room and reappears in a moment wearing it beneath a little boy's black, see-through mesh T-shirt that LeBon chose for her. The shirt ends about six inches above the waistband of her jeans. There is scattered applause from smitten shoppers.
It's a Look -- probably best suited to a Duran Duran concert -- and attainable on a baby sitter's budget. This is the show given to featuring cheap chic -- Chanel knockoffs on a shoestring and so on. For style-struck vidkids, it's another object lesson in 90's found fashion.
"Fabooo, Cin, Madonna would have needed Gaultier to pull this off," snorts a wag in the crowd, referring to that pop diva's high-fashion corsetier. His friend seconds that emotion with the ultimate street endorsement:
"Yo, Cin-daaaay! Girl, you are large!"
LeBon is fingering a pair of baby doll pj's. He turns to a pair of stricken-looking boys.
"Understand something," cautions LeBon, mock serious. "When it comes to today's fashion, lads -- there are no rules!"
THIS WAS BURLESQUE. BUT AMERICA IS serious about its style dispatches. More than a million people watched this segment each time it was broadcast this summer. Since the show began four years ago, advertisers have fallen over themselves to sell home perms and surfer duds between interviews with Lucie de la Falaise, the Saint Laurent model, and thrift shop decorating tips from the designer Todd Oldham.
As I took cover from the Cindy clamor in the relative calm of Sears' purple Barney display, questions bristled from our style safari: How is it that an L.A. street kid knows the name of one of Madonna's Paris designers? How has it come to pass that the most successful new feature on this now-global cable network is about fashion, that couturiers like Karl Lagerfeld are willing, even eager, to share a spot on the dial with Humpty-Hump and Naughty by Nature? And what's happened to make our Cindy so large? Naomi. Christy. Kate. Please, how is it that subteens know the names of more models than of former Presidents?
Call it the preening of America. Style's the ascendant supernova, spinning off a new galaxy of celebrities for the ever-hungry infotainment maw. Designers, models, photographers, hairdressers and makeup artists make the people pages as often as actresses and politicians. Even the President risked approval rating points for a Hollywood hedgeclip by one of those boldface barbers.
The wide, blue skies are not safe from the style commandos. On a hot day in July, I thought my sun block had failed me when I looked up to see a 30-foot banner bearing the colossal grinning likeness of Calvin Klein's underwear poster boy. As it was towed through the skies above the Fire Island shoreline, the cotton-clad Bulge that has dominated thousands of bus stops threw a huge shadow over some toddlers making sand castles.
"Look, Mommy!" one bellowed. "It's Marky Mark in heaven!"
From Seventh Avenue to the mouths of babes, the transverse is complete. Fashion has rolled its pipe racks into the mass consciousness as never before. Ours is a style-savvy culture where Giorgio Armani shows up on "Saturday Night Live," where Roseanne dallies backstage at an Isaac Mizrahi show and Madonna begs a piggy nine seats for one of Gianni Versace's runway lollapaloozas in Milan. These are days when Bloomingdale's advertises Mizrahi's fall collection -- and his movie debut, with Michael J. Fox. It's a time when designers like Arnold Scaasi can sell $410,000 in outfits in just 45 minutes of air time on the home shopping channel QVC, pet project of the entertainment mogul Barry Diller.
Folksy, not frosty, is the QVC designer ethos. Diane Von Furstenberg, former princess, talks tacos with a call-in viewer who's just bought her palazzo pants in size extra-large. ("Well, black is perfect then.") D.V.F., who long ago closed her jewel-box boutique on Fifth Avenue, sold 3,000 pairs of her silk pants in less than two minutes for a tidy gross of $150,000. For two hours' work, the take was $1.2 million. The production values may be a hoot, all crackling fireplaces and tufted sofas forklifted into the hangarlike studios in a Pennsylvania industrial park. But retailers aren't laughing. Saks Fifth Avenue grossed $570,000 in orders on the debut of its Real Clothes Collection QVC spot. Other department stores are taking meetings; Calvin Klein does not rule it out.
On Saturday mornings, as those credit cards cool, one can sober up with a bracing half hour of Elsa Klensch, a real journalist who works the fashion beat for CNN. For the first half of her 13 years on air, she was a voice in the video wilderness, covering the collections, interviewing the likes of Blass, Kawakubo and Mugler with quiet authority. Now she is "Elsa" and no designer evades her inquiring mike. If Klensch is the Cronkite of the rag trade, Crawford is a game, albeit hipper, Kathie Lee, talking zits with fellow model Naomi Campbell, singing along with an ossified Don Ho during a Hawaiian segment.
"I don't present myself as a serious journalist," Crawford told me. Instead, she sees her role as fashion Demystifier. "We talk about how I've got to hold my stomach in when I'm shooting," she says. "That I don't walk around looking like a Cosmo cover. They see me in rollers, shlumping around after the shoot. I think that's part of the reason people do relate to me. I'm not afraid of showing that side."
The best from Bill Blass -- or Cindy in Sears deshabille -- you can conjure both sides with your Sony remote.
THIS NEW ACCESSIBLITY IS A PATENTLY populist trend, putting designers in the same service-oriented chatstream as the Frugal Gourmet and those Sheetrock gurus of "This Old House." Fashion -- that once-snooty uptown dame -- has been coaxed from the atelier down into the block party. The poor dear has been polka-ed around the malls, frightened a bit by the rough trade of leveraged buyouts and Chapter 11, has been a bit bouleversee as the big department stores fell like so many top-heavy politburos. No one will tell you that the fashion industry is robust, assailed as it's been by retail failures, general economic downturns and the artistic and personal devastation wrought by AIDS. But anyone working in it today will agree: Never has so much been available to so many -- with so few rules.
View it as a kind of democratization, if you will, a movement as inevitable as the end of the cold war and the revival of all-cotton sheets. Given today's climate -- economic and ecological -- it all just made sense.
The underclasses have always had clothes; they just never have had so much design. They have long had style, but until recently street fashion had never made it to the runway with such a swagger. If Coco Chanel's revolution was to translate easy, sensible street dressing to couture chic, Gloria Vanderbilt's was to fill the streets with denimed female rumps bearing the designer imprimatur. Two decades ago, the very term "designer jeans" would have been a laughable misfit. Now it's just a timely lambada of the practical and the privileged. And at a swell price.
How did the haughty crinoline crumple? In the half century that this magazine has regularly devoted pages to Fashions of The Times, successive style insurrections have loosened corsets and attitudes. It's happened in degrees, but overall the changes are vast. If in 1943 a Mainbocher-draped Wallis Simpson defined elegance, in 1993 it can be drag diva RuPaul in a snippet of to-die-for Alaia. Male fashions, traditionally conservative, have now embraced elements of "outsider" black and gay styles; even Joey Buttafuoco wears an earring. Today, muses come in all income brackets -- and cup sizes. "You can learn from Dolly Parton," insists Gianni Versace. "And from Marella Agnelli."
How does it translate on the racks? Toppled hierarchies, madly scrambled in a satellite dish, make for fashion over easy. Fussy ensemble dressing has given way to witty, comfortable juxtaposition: Calvins with cashmere, kente cloth with pin stripes, Gap T's beneath $2,000 suits. Foundations are worn on the outside, if at all. Classics have gone far beyond the little black dress as upscale outlaw togs lurch down the runways, making the formerly outre instant ooh-la-la. (How else could Chanel sell out its $1,000 biker boots?) The newest perennials are often the naughty made nice.
As Jean-Paul Gaultier has explained: "The motorcycle jacket that I always have in my collections, that is Marlon Brando in 'The Wild One.' Now a whole society of youth wears it, and it has become as much a classic for me as the navy blazer."
DOES ALL THIS MEAN THE COUTURE HAS been tossed into the tumbrels and hauled down that cobblestone path to oblivion? To be sure, some once-proud heads have rolled. But most have learned to look beyond the salon trade. Houses like Dior, Cardin and Givenchy have retrenched and reached out, pumping up revenues by licensing their names to fragrances, to T-shirts, to cookware. Of necessity, they're designing lower-priced lines of ready-to-wear, from expensive "bridge" clothes down to jeanswear. "Second lines" have given new life to flagging design houses. If fashion once depended on the kindness of the in-crowd, now its most stalwart support comes from those strangers below.
It all comes down to this: Few people live for fashion anymore. Fashion must survive by taking its cues from real life. Listen to that Wizard of Wearable, Calvin Klein, who made a fortune by understanding that the modern woman hasn't the time or the inclination to study fashion magazines like a breviary. He says his own revolution began in a dowdy wasteland of fussy frocks and "old lady coats." It was the late 60's, and he found the options unacceptable.
"Even at nonexpensive prices, [coats and dresses] tended to be influenced by couture," he says. "It was all coming from the top. That seemed like nonsense to me. It was just old."
So was the clubby fashion pack mind-set.
"It was lunch at La Grenouille," he says. "You just knew what fashion was supposed to be about. And I would think, This has nothing to do with life. I've always been looking at the way people live. Pieces and mixing and adding and subtracting just seemed to make sense. People call it sportswear. But to me, it's a jacket and pants and a blouse and a sweater and a skirt. And you take those pieces and wear them different ways."
Ask him the key to his astonishing success and he will tell you, simply, that he reaches America. All of America. He sells $10,000 dresses . . . and $5 briefs.
Did this make Calvin king? Certainly not. The major American designers claim to feel no competition from one another, each content with his or her band of loyalists. In fact, no one rules this sprawling new marketplace. Now that you can buy DKNY in Jidda, Versace in Kyoto, is Paris burning? Pas du tout. European, American and Japanese designers all know the score. Recalling a European vacation with his family, Ralph Lauren says his then-17-year-old daughter asked him what she might wear to a disco so as not to look so . . . well, American. "Wear a Polo shirt," he told her seriously. "You'll look Italian. Or French."
How best to take the measure of this half-century of fashion ferment? By its nature, fashion is a restless business. Borrowing often from eras past, jerking ahead with nanosecond technology and exuberance, the style history of the last 50 years constitutes a jumpy dialogue between what is and what's gone before. As Cyndi Lauper once said, "We all dress in versions now."
 
THE BONDAGE YEARS
"If there is a war, fashion will be different. But it doesn't mean that there will be no fashion. The most exciting fashion periods are often the years after a war -- 1947, the 20's. It's very interesting, how futility can make you survive in a difficult moment." -- Karl Lagerfeld
During World War II, the worst fashion faux pas was to be too fashionable. Ingenuity was chic and sometimes silly. Once rationing deprived them of silk stockings, women painted their legs. By 1943, as leather became scarcer, they tottered on wedged heels made of cork. L-85, an order designed to save 15 percent of the domestic fabric production, prohibited a host of fripperies: no cuffs, no double yokes, no patch pockets, no coat hoods.
"Buy American!" Forty years before that rallying cry was used to fend off the advances of Toyotas and Hondas, American department stores were campaigning for home-grown designers. The Germans rolled into Paris in 1940; fashion houses that stayed open were suspected of collaborating with the Occupation Government. Coco Chanel, living at the Ritz with a Nazi officer, had shuttered No. 31 rue Cambon a year before the war reached France.
In New York, the established designers shone brighter: Claire McCardell, Charles James, Norman Norell. Mainbocher worked on military uniforms for the United States Navy; Norell took wartime restrictions seriously and turned out waistless jersey shifts that used 50 percent less fabric.
Not surprisingly, there were no startling innovations during the war years and the look remained static: skirts below the knee, shoulders wide and padded, waist narrow, shoes clunky. World War II's most lasting fashion legacy may well be the T-shirt, developed when the Navy came up with specs for a "T-type" undershirt in white knitted cotton.
The fashion press was ever cautionary. If loose lips could sink ships, the truly full skirt was tantamount to treason. Reporting in 1945, this magazine predicted that once L-85 was lifted there would be "no violent change in fashion."
How wrong that was. Shortly after, fashion would impose a tyranny unknown since the days when a Scarlett O'Hara was trussed like a turkey for the sake of a 17-inch waist. It happened, as Lagerfeld said, in 1947, and for nearly a decade afterward, one female silhouette dominated millions of body shapes.
If there is a single defining example of fashion despotism -- and the complicated psychological pas de deux between woman and designer -- it was Christian Dior's New Look, unveiled in February of 1947. Dior himself announced it as "the corolla," or flower, for the way his skirts bloomed so fully from tightly corseted bodices -- up to 80 mad yards of fabric in the most extravagant ball gown. But the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow renamed it when she gushed in the post-show hysteria: "It's quite a revolution, dear Christian. Your dresses have such a new look."
Even Bugs Bunny lampooned it in cartoons. Photos depicting the fashion underpinnings of the day look like some S & M seraglio: Reed-thin models knee one another in the back for leverage as they lace up the requisite corsets. These come-hither foundation garments featured chunky shoulder pads hung from bra straps and triple-stitched, warheadlike bra cups.
Dior's "revolution" made for a willowy-looking figure -- and, judging from the hundreds of scary foundation ads that ran in this magazine alone, he cavalierly sentenced his devotees to nearly 10 years in bondage.
How did Dior's grand vision trickle down to the working class? For the first time, inexpensive knockoffs of Parisian fashions were widely available, thanks to wartime advances in mass production techniques. The proliferation of the New Look, which would be reflected even in June Cleaver's crisp sitcom shirtwaists, prefigured the rise of a la mode ready-to-wear. Soon, fast, cheap knockoff houses would have spies poised at the couture collections; stores like Ohrbach's in Manhattan would draw East Side matrons on the prowl for a Givenchy look at Herald Square prices. In France, as well, the ready-to-wear industry was tooling up.
Couture may have been contemptuous of these gauche imitators, but it was hardly threatened. The Europeans established a firm beachhead in New York. Dior opened his Fifth Avenue establishment in 1948; soon he was followed by Jacques Fath. By 1952, Pierre Balmain and the formidable Elsa Schiaparelli had steamed across the ocean with trunks full of silken pronouncements.
As the couture enjoyed its strongest decade, there was additional ferment below. A new fashion force arose that had been historically unheard from. Those eternal sans-culottes -- the kids -- were on the march in greater numbers, and with more spending power. In 1957, Newsweek reported that teen-agers had an estimated $9 billion in disposable income. And all that loose change jangled with a restless impulse that said "later" to the dorky versions of Mom's wardrobe that dominated teen fashion up to that point.
Shortly after Richard Nixon bragged of Pat's respectable Republican cloth coat in his Checkers speech, there was a new sound that brought with it a new new look. The song titles spelled it out: "High-Heeled Sneakers," "Blue Suede Shoes," "Venus in Bluejeans." Rock-and-roll kids had no use for those icky organdy confections called "date dresses." The Peter Pan collar was their yoke of oppression. As bobby soxers graduated into high heels, the next wave of girls and boys fell in thrall to fashion's bad boys, subversive dressers like Elvis and James Dean. Dungarees and sloppy shirts ruled these wild ones. And slightly sexy dressing began to keep subdivision Dads pacing nervously on date night. Off went Sweet Little Sixteen in tight calf-length capris, new "training bra" straining under a cloud of touchable angora.
The closet rebellion wasn't exclusively American. Young Britons began to wear their restive feelings on black leather sleeves. "Teddy Boys" slapped on a dollop of Murray's pommade and a lot more attitude as they scootered and slouched about. And the less adventuresome wanted to look different from Mum and Dad as well.
In 1955, the British designer Mary Quant had the foresight to address this new market. She opened her boutique, Bazaar, on King's Road in London, the first to offer stylish clothes affordable to the thousands of young women with low-paying jobs, bed-sitter lodgings and great yearnings for just a tiny bit of glamour.
Thirty years past her revolution, I had occasion to visit with Quant in her Chelsea headquarters. She explained that it all had to do with the war, with the fact things wouldn't, couldn't, ever return to the way they were. The Englishwoman who had helped in the war effort, or at the very least endured its hardships, had seen a good deal of life beyond the hearth. And for her daughter, the horizon was wider still.
"I was designing for me," Quant said, "for girls with a career or with a job. Until that stage, either women would be their father's little daughter, their clothes paid for by their father, or they were the wife of the doctor. This was probably the first time women had their own careers -- and therefore dressed for themselves."
At this point, little of this social change was touching the couture. Apart from Chanel, Schiaparelli and the American sportswear seer Claire McCardell, men were the arbiters of female style. In 1954, Chanel had reopened her house. Though privately it was hoped she could goose perfume revenues with a soupcon of fashion, Chanel announced that she had returned to save women from the "50's horrors" perpetrated by men.
From everywhere they came to Paris, young men arriving at the Gare du Nord with taffeta fancies and steely ambition. In 1953, a pale neurasthenic youth from French Algeria won the coveted International Wool Secretariat contest for dress design with a cocktail gown. Yves Saint Laurent was just 17. The same year, the son of a wealthy German industrialist won the coat division. Karl Lagerfeld and Saint Laurent were friends when they apprenticed, the German at Balmain, the other at Dior.
In 1961, another impatient young man took the train from Madrid to Paris with a portfolio of sketches under his arm. He, too, wanted to be a designer, to totally change his fate.
 
THE CONCORDE COUTURIER
Look at Oscar de la Renta now and you do not see the insurance adjuster his father had hoped for. Tall, elegant, his balding head tanned the color of toasted almonds by decades of resort sun, the designer stills his phones and settles in for a chat. The hustle and honk of Seventh Avenue does not invade his minimalist white and cream office. He works -- hard -- eight collections a year now: two each (spring and fall) for his own couture and ready-to-wear lines and the same in his new role as head designer for the old house of Balmain.
But he prefers this mad regime to hauling actuarial tables around the steamy tropic neighborhoods of his native Santo Domingo. Entering the family business was expected for the only son out of seven children. Somehow, his softhearted mother secured permission for him to go to art school in Spain, and his sketches landed him a job in Madrid at the house of Balenciaga. When the great man would not let him work in his Paris house, young Oscar went there on his two-week vacation and was hired by Lanvin on the basis of his portfolio. It was a dizzying pace. Press, clients, designers -- everyone relied on the talents of the sketch artist then.
Shuttered with clients who made him doodle at alterations and variations, he says he was not a courtly presence in the fitting room, a character flaw that persists today. These women can be very needy, terribly demanding. They are paying -- handsomely -- for fealty. Better, he says today, to sell to friends on that level. This past spring, a flock of Oscar loyalists Concorded to Paris for his first Balmain show and behaved as though those dreaded letters "S & L" meant "spend -- and lavishly." The names read like the lunch reservation book at Mortimer's: Nan Kempner, Mica Ertegun, Barbara Walters. . . .
He concedes that his reviews are sometimes tepid, even faintly dismissive. The terms revolutionary or innovative do not pepper his notices. He takes it with the equanimity of a very successful man. But recently the critics sniped at his ladies, which really got his ruffles up.
"This year, Bill Blass, myself and somebody else were in Women's Wear Daily," he says. "They criticized our collections by saying we were designing clothes for the forgotten woman."
Understand, these loyalists, these forgotten types, the ladies who lunch and underwrite foundling hospitals, have long relied on the quiet, sporty elegance of Blass, the ruffled dramatics of Scaasi, the safe little Adolfo suits. De la Renta, along with these others, is still a darling of the carriage set. Fashion may well be more democratic these days, but not everyone is comfy on the black-clad, see-through, bell-bottomed Edge. Doubtless, you would not see Nan Kempner clomping into Le Cirque in a pair of Lagerfeld's giant white mukluks with Chanel in huge leather lettering. Even the cerebral seaming and innovative textiles of that established American artist Geoffrey Beene can be a bit too avant-garde for this crowd. Attention must be paid to the less-adventurous constituency, which is why de la Renta lectured editor Anna Wintour that her coverage in Vogue has been "too downtown."
He is warming up now to the subject of his far-out competitors, the almond forehead burnished by a flush of indignation: "I should perhaps take a double page in The New York Times. Make a list of every woman I know who dresses beautifully, who works, who is a contributor to society and say, 'This is the forgotten woman!' " He smiles. "This is what I call the real world. I think what we are seeing today is clothes for freaks."
Quietly, Oscar de la Renta does a huge business, up to half a billion a year by his own estimation. Grafting spreadsheet savvy onto couture tradition, De la Renta's is an operation that has its heart in the 50's and its business plan looking at the 21st century. Ladies and licensing: it's a combination that has weathered the recent economic storms.
The high-end business is probably, at retail, about $25 million, he says pleasantly. "And we are doing about $500 million of Oscar de la Renta products around the world. About $150 would be in fragrances. Over $100 million in Japan."
Japan bears some watching as its economy continues its downturn and status-mad consumers curb their Gucci habits. And currently de la Renta is re-evaluating his entire licensing program. He is acknowledged as one of the most successful players in this high-stakes game. In 1991, licensing sales, of items from Dior to the Chicago Bulls to Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles, totaled a robust $63.5 billion. Nearly a third of that was apparel and accessory related. But if the future of licensing seems assured in this celebrity-mad world, the track record of designer licensing has been somewhat spotty of late.
"Designers: Endangered or Extinct?" asked WWD, noting that "Armani's doing basics and the Gap is on the cover of Vogue." Are they being "democratized" out of the marketplace? Or do they take the blame for diluting the product? Worried about lack of control over quality and distribution, many designers have pulled back in recent years, rewriting contracts as safer joint ventures, imposing stricter quality control methods.
Since designers began licensing voraciously in the 70's, there have been several cautionary tales. The once grand name of Cardin was devalued by being stamped on everything from chocolate to sausage machines. As of last year, Cardin had sold 840 licenses. Halston, blithely declaring that a licensing agreement with J. C. Penney would allow him to "dress America," watched his business disintegrate as horrified high-end stores like Bergdorf's dropped his line. Corporate takeovers of the business he had sold to Norton Simon further divided his empire. By 1987, Halston's name became the property of the Revlon Group -- the sixth company to hold his trademark in just four years. At the time of death from AIDS in 1990, he was virtually prohibited from selling fashion items of his own design under his own name.
This will not do for Oscar de la Renta. He says he is shoring up his defenses, setting up a cozy but serious international licensing seminar. Over coffee and brioches, he'll be talking quality to his licensees. Servicing! He'll be talking global.
Even discussing his plans for publication can be touchy, he says. It costs so much to protect a name these days. Potential licensees must be investigated; product quality policed. He's already being sued. The lawsuits are inevitable when you must divorce yourself from a sleazy licensee. But the name is such currency, such a huge part of the franchise. It's a lot different from when he first came to America and it had been Halston for Bergdorf's, Bill Blass for Maurice Rentner -- so clearly employees. Now, fashion designers may be "owned" by huge companies like Murjani, Dunhill, Gruppo GFT and Revlon. But corporate logos do not appear on the lapels, the pockets, the sunglass frames. Designers' signatures do.
Oscar de la Renta says he will take no foolish chances, will do everything he can to protect that loopy bit of longhand with the big fat "O." Yes, he wants . . . insurance. "I am very conscious that you cannot take a name and divide it into hundreds of different particles," he says. "Because by the end, there is no name."
 
EAUTIES AND BEASTIE BOYS
In 1965, this magazine carried a kicky two-page ad for Mary Quant clothes:
"How do you dress for a Happening, a frug jamboree, an opening of a drugstore, a six-hour movie, a daytime drive-in, a water pistol duel? These London designers know. They're in charge of the Youthquake."
The couture men didn't know what even young girls understood: Fun was creeping into fashion. And it sold: miniskirts and tights, short vinyl slickers, ribbed poor-boy sweaters, pale lipstick and eyelashes sold by the yard. Much of the hullabaloo came from across the Atlantic, where the Beatles' call to "Shake it up, baby!" echoed well beyond the dance floor.
"Stop! The English HAVE ARRIVED!" Vogue editor Diana Vreeland shrieked to her staff when Cockney photographer David Bailey motioned model and then-girlfriend Jean Shrimpton onto Vreeland's faux leopard-skin rug one rainy day in 1965. Vreeland was also mad for Bailey's photos of his 22-year-old friend Mick Jagger. Shrimpton was what English kids were calling a dolly bird: huge eyes, porcelain complexion, hemlines way above the knees, Shirley Temple style. The first "waifs," big sisters to today's crop, began to make it out of Seventeen and into Vogue. Twiggy became a bony, knock-kneed caricature of this glorious gamine.
The youth movement, so irrelevant to the pressed-linen world of couture ladies, had begun to infect one very influential atelier. Yves Saint Laurent had been only 21 in 1958 when he set the fashion press buzzing about his "childishly pretty" high-waisted dresses and the "look of extreme youth and femininity" embodied in his famous figure-skimming trapeze dresses. Within a few years, he was chafing at Dior's fusty imperatives. He understood that high fashion could benefit from the noise and bustle coming out of the new little shops.
In 1960, he left Dior and started his own house. And in contrast to his reclusive habits today, Saint Laurent often left that house, to check the pulse in the streets. He was a habitue of the King's Road shops, where Biba, with its sensible 7 price limit on dresses, had joined Mary Quant's boutique revolution. And far above this ready-to-wear "youthquake," Saint Laurent decided to create an outlet for his more youthful, less expensive designs. He opened his Rive Gauche boutique chain in 1966 and soon had 160 branches around the world.
By then, Vogue was regularly slumming with the young and the vestless. That same year, Town & Country's debutante issue featured one Miss Alexandra Chace on its cover in the scruffy company of the Rolling Stones. She wore ostrich plumes; Brian Jones, ignoring the Girl of the Moment, was deep in conversation with his bandmates -- and holding a cigarette. Bad boys, bad manners: quel kick! Ask Mick Jagger how he and his paisleyed ilk got invited to Fashion's garden party and he'll tell you it was just good business. The photographers were the brokers.
It was not as though they were shooting a bunch of naifs. Many of the British rockers had art school backgrounds. And they had been studying style, Jagger noted, since Buddy Holly made nerd glasses cool. "Rock-and-roll is not only about music, it's about style," Jagger said. "It's all about what clothes and hair you have and what makeup. When we were growing up, we perceived the Everly Brothers as a sound. And look at that hair, you know? That was really important."
Dating models sealed the deal. The 60's rock mannequins performed an essential function; they made fashion hip. Prancing through editorial pages normally reserved for horsy-set philanthropists and debs, they would create a new, alternative aristocracy. The era of beauties and beastie boys had begun. Chrissie Shrimpton and Mick Jagger, Pattie Boyd and George Harrison, Jane Asher and Paul McCartney were the precursors of the rock-runway stairway to heaven: Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, David Bowie and Iman, Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley, Rod Stewart and Rachel Hunter, Simon LeBon and Yasmin, Keith Richards and Patti Hansen, Naomi Campbell and (U2's) Adam Clayton, Madonna and John Enos.
As style-setters, rockers soon had the clout of film stars and socialites. And from the beginning, clothing merchants knew the value of hanging their wares on solid-gold idols. The kids would follow them anywhere -- especially to the shops. It could be luvlier still, should the dolly birds agree to a spot of shilling. Chrissie Shrimpton had her own gossip column in the American fanzine Tiger Beat. It was called "From London With Luv," and it was often about clothes -- like this fab report on the Who drummer, Keith Moon:
"Keith wore a beautiful red shirt that evening. It was all sort of silky with red roses on it. He said it had been made for him at a boutique called 'Granny Takes A Trip.' This is hidden away in the depths of darkest Chelsea. But it's worth looking for."
 
'IT'S LIKE A COSTUME PARTY'
Manhattan, SoHo, summer of '93.
A Lincoln Town Car idles on Prince Street outside Phat Farm, a clothing emporium conceived and bankrolled by the rap impresario Russell Simmons. Inside, the decor is homeboy-meets-Polo: rough wood fencing, pitchforks, conservative, well-made shirts. One shirt, a soft cotton plaid, looks like something you'd find on Woody Allen, not Dr. Dre. Cutting-edge street stuff has gone conservative; Timberland boots and parkas, classic ball caps. Ralph Lauren says he is amazed by news clippings reporting that some urban street gangs are now boosting his Polo knit shirts.
While the Lincoln's occupants -- two young Japanese tourists in 555 Soul ski caps -- browse at Phat Farm, a chauffeur rearranges bags in the trunk. I've seen young women like this before: in Paris, poking about the small shops in the Marais district; in London, negotiating the tilted floor of Vivienne Westwood's tiny shop on King's Road. They are a tribe that dates back to the siren call of Chrissie Shrimpton's breathless style dispatches.
They're energetic, and deep into the hunt, but they're thrilled when stores like Union on Spring Street pull it all together: the right knit cap, hip-hugging bell-bottoms, a gold and white Ban-Lon shirt that fairly bellows Troy Donahue! They buy a look, whole cloth, even if it does look like pan-generational flea marketing.
On a Saturday afternoon in SoHo, the shops are full of these prospectors. Wandering among them is the retail equivalent of channel surfing. "There used to be one trend that ran and another to replace it," notes the editor of Details, James Truman. "But now you see 10 subcultures walking down lower Broadway side by side. Punks, skinheads, new romantics, hip-hop kids. Everything's going on at once -- it's like a costume party out there."
Get your Mary Quant hosiery and Doc Martens boots at Na Na; your reggae-striped knit T's at Stussy. Here at Phat Farm, the Japanese women are giving some baggy shorts intense study. Few shoppers have the global savvy or the budgets of this pair from Osaka. They decline to give names, citing their wealthy parents' fears of ostentation -- and kidnapping. But they are voluble about their prizes, especially a boxy polyblend work jacket by Dickies, a line of work clothes sold at Sears. The zip-in lining is missing, but for the $78 price one gets a glowing orange patch bearing the design company's logo, a cutesy obscene pun.
Whose joke is it, selling industrial chic and retread Ban-Lon -- recycling Sears at boutique prices? It's the logical, rather cynical end game of the Adidas Esthetic that in the late 80's prompted young black men to shave that shoe manufacturer's "a" logo into their hair, to wear its satiny warm-up suits with the easy aplomb of Astaire in tails. The ultimate antifashion may not be in some Martin Margiela "deconstructionist" frock artfully flung at the press in a vacant lot -- but in the creative co-opting of the corporate and tame.
As a fashion force, this street style is certainly less elitist, less precious than designer shredded waistcoats. Customizing mass-produced fashion may have been the only avenue open to hip-hop kids on a budget. But thanks in large part to the global reach of "Yo! MTV Raps," the lure of "outlaw," or outsider, fashion has reached beyond the street corners and clubs. Already, sympatico Oradell moms are cruising Prince Street in their Taurus station wagons, armed with wish lists from the sons of suburbia.
This new youthquake was not announced in mainstream ads, but its influence has certainly reached Madison Avenue. Why else would Ralph Lauren run ads with a dreadlocked young black girl in a boy's funky-mixed Polo? How perfect for Calvin Klein that the street penchant for baggy pants worn below the underwear waistband showcases the designer's stitched name. Use a white rapper (Marky Mark) who's long relied on a black style consultant (Boston-based Patrick Petty). Add a topless babe (model waif Kate Moss) -- Whoa, just like a rap video! -- and you pull in some def demographics. The reach is surprising: This summer, Details was in the streets shooting a story on preppie hip-hop -- private-school princes wearing their ball caps backward and their Bermudas B-I-G.
"We like the things of the black people," one of the Japanese women tells me at Phat Farm. And while that's long been true, while Japanese kids were torturing their heads with Afros back in the 70's, never before has black street style gotten its propers, with entrepreneurs like Simmons and Spike Lee making and selling the stuff of the nabe.
Long before Elvis took his pink-jacketed cues from black Memphis street dandies, black elegance, especially in male dressing, was a deep-rooted source of community pride. This belies the tendencies of the media and Hollywood to showcase only the more extreme examples, from zoot suits to those 70's Superfly threads with more vents than a fast-food fry station. The appreciation for quality, both conservative and cutting edge, goes way back -- just listen closely to the Coasters' hilarious 1960 passion play, "Shoppin' for Clothes." And think about it: For every cartoony Mr. T, there is a soigne Duke Ellington, a preternaturally stylish Miles Davis.
"Is very fresh, I think."
After much deliberation, one of the Osaka Two has decided on that standout plaid shirt. She fondles it as the clerk rings it up. Another customer, a young black man in an Orlando Magic shirt, leans over. "Got the same one myself," he says. "So soft it hugs you like your mamma."
 
DRESS YOUR HEART, NOT YOUR TAX BRACKET
Uptown, Madison Avenue.
"Let me take you to another world," says Ralph Lauren. And he is off, clicking down the corridor of his mahogany-paneled headquarters in small, round-toed pumps with grosgrain bows -- worn sockless. "This is what I love," he tosses over his shoulder. Startingly tan against his snowy linen suit, he shoots ahead like a pinball off the spring -- at a salesman's pace. All week long, Lauren lieutenants have been leading store buyers down this long paneled hallway to show them retail's bright future with Ralph.
"It's just behind this door. . . ."
Leapin' lamb's wool! It even smells like another world, another time! The scent is a potpourri of old Shetland and laundered cotton, woodsy cabin and a sharp note or two of -- Churchill Downs? Lauren's essence elves have created another breathtaking stage set to sell his newest Double RL line, this time a countrified unthrift shop. Planked floor, old display cases, jeans, utility pants, bulky sweaters, unconstructed tweed jackets. The hook: new clothes, distressed with more detail than the Paramount prop closet.
"We call this one 'Dances With Wolves,' " Lauren says, pointing to a blue cavalry vest on a headless dummy. He is smiling broadly, seems a genuinely content man in here, patting folded flannel shirts, smoothing lapels, offering up a pair of new jeans with the command, "Just feel."
"Amazing," I must tell him. "You've even got that y--"
"Yellow color around the worn seams, right?"
Right. It's an impressive piece of distress-tech, far beyond the ersatz verite of most stone-washed fare. He says he's patented the process. These jeans are soft as a baby's bottom, worn in contours that conjure long hard rides on a Harley -- or on a 16-hand hunter. Nineties activewear -- it's already lived a fuller life than you have.
"But brand new," Lauren keeps saying. How does he know when artfully worn gets too close to Salvation Army?
"It's all a secret. But I'm the one who decides."
He is the undisputed master of instant patina, and as such he has suffered the slings and arrows of press types who would call him snippy names like "life style purveyor" and "the Wee Haberdasher." He admits it's made him cranky. Before we tour his other "worlds" -- the recreated St. Tropez beach club displaying resort wear, the chintz-and-tartan hives where the vast Home collection is conceived -- Lauren says that he wants it made clear that he sells aspirations, yes. But not to the regatta-and-lawn croquet echelons.
"In the last few years, I get this, 'Well, Ralph represents the WASP life,' " he says. "That's not what it's about. It's never been that."
It's upscale, sure. His own promotional copy suggests that his new Active Trainer clothes are "for the gym or a cappuccino on the way home." And he doesn't mean a go-cup from Dunkin' Donuts. Still, it's not all rich people who have pumped the worldwide revenues of Polo/Ralph Lauren Products, a privately held company, to $3.7 billion in retail volume. He has 140 stores worldwide, from Palm Beach to Kuala Lumpur.
Despite a few profitability problems in the women's division, Lauren is still opening stores, most notably Polo Sport, across from his flagship store-cum-gallery in the Rhinelander Mansion at Madison and 72d Street. And Laurenization, from khaki pants to all-cotton turtlenecks, has spread beyond and below his price points, of course. The Gap, Banana Republic and J. Crew, to name a few, have successfully marketed his look at a lower price. It's a kind of piggyback populism, this rush to things basic and essentially conservative, worn, in Gap ad campaigns, by the unassailably edgy and hip. They are photographed in minimalist black and white: actors, painters, musicians.
This is, in its way, a rebirth of the Whitmanesque longing that caused the jeaning of America in the late 60's and went so wonky. On the ramparts and on campus, we looked earnest, but so sloppy -- so very Goodwill. Ralph knew how to do it right. What he dragged back into the American marketplace was the thing that Time and Technology forgot. Good stuff, with roots deeper than a 60-second spot on the "Sonny and Cher Show."
Over and over, he says it's about quality, and he means it. He says that he is tired of being misunderstood, weary of barbed profiles that paint him as some pretender to the Windsor line by way of the Lifshitz branch from the Bronx. Sure, he was a hustling tie salesman in the late 60's. But that's the beauty of it. Humping along with his sample cases, he refused to muffle himself in some Willy Loman quitter's suit; he wore a leather jacket and drove a cream-colored Morgan with a leather strap across the hood. Lauren is one of those dyed-in-the-diaper dandies, like Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, who found himself a good tailor before he worried about his first girlfriend. Dress your heart, not your ZIP code or tax bracket, he has long believed. He's as moony, as cinematic about clothes as Woody Allen is about Manhattan.
"Sometimes you can't explain clothes unless you put it in the environment that sets it up the right way," Lauren is saying. "It doesn't mean that you're trying to give them the good life or the status life. It means that people do have aspirations, to have a good life, to have a home with an extra bedroom, decorate it the right way. They want the best school for their kids. They want to go on vacation."
Lauren's naturally soft voice lowers still, to the soothing interrogative of a $125-an-hour Freudian: "Why do you go on vacation? Why do you buy this dress? Who do you think you are when you're putting it on? What does it make you feel like?"
He holds this truth to be self-evident: That all men -- and women -- are created with shoulders equal to what the Coasters called "pure, pure herrin'bone." After all, historically, we are a nation of upstarts, ever eager to clamber off that barren polyester hardscrabble. Why else would American department stores entice customers with sections that read "Better Sportswear?"
Get into some classy tweeds, that riding look, Lauren says, and it just gives you "a spirit of that country look. Sort of sets you up with a world that's nice." So you're not out in Bridgehampton waiting to jump the final round of Working Hunter. Maybe you're just driving the twins to the orthodondist. But Lauren says you get his Feeling:
"Hey, that's nice. I didn't know I could do that."
Feelings. Nothing more than feelings. It's no accident that designers do so well in fragrance. Pheromones and longings are all of a piece. And feelings, longings, are what Ralph Lauren says his clothes are all about. Feelings that are primarily his own. All his companies, he says, "are a part of my life. My designing comes from what I do. I live it, I wear it, I love it. I don't sit there and say, 'I think we should do big sleeves this year.' "
He says that all of his divisions started off with these words:
Why can't I have . . . ?
Just fill in the blanks. Men's wear (Why can't I have a pair of khakis like my dad's in the 50's?). Women's wear (Why can't I have a jacket cut and tailored as well as my husband's?). Ralph Lauren Home (Why can't I have a towel that will dry all of me?).
He's given them 400-count all-cotton sheets. Real wool tweed. Potpourri that doesn't smell like a melted Mars bar.
Why can't I have . . . ?
It is a class question, born of a very basic itch. "Why is it," the late designer Willi Smith once roared at me over chicken salad, "that if someone without a lot of money wants a shower curtain, it has to have huge yellow flowers all over it?"
Why can't I have . . . ? Hear Lauren's tweedy cri de coeur as the mantra of the upwardly mobile, or just those seeking equality in design. Giving middle-class people what was formerly available only to their lawyers, undertakers and heart surgeons has made Ralph Lauren a very wealthy man. But he wants you to understand this one thing: When he started out, it was weird. You may think of Ralph Lauren as silver loving cups and hacking jackets and more tradition than the Queen's Regiment, but he insists he started off as the Alternative Guy. Please, he says, remember the times.
"America was very traditional, somewhat preppy," Lauren says. "The Carnaby Street revolution came out of England and that faded out. Pierre Cardin was just moving. You'd hear something about a designer name. But there was no such thing as designers in the United States."
In 1969, hair was a helmet by Kenneth or a fop crop by Vidal Sassoon. Fashion designers were at play in fields of paisley, granny prints and gauze. The Europeans were off on their own flights of fancy. Courreges had turned to rocket suits, Cardin to Op Art. Karl Lagerfeld, designing for Chloe, indulged his obsession for collecting Art Deco. Balenciaga retired, declaring that the age of couture was over.
Amid this classless hodgepodge, the time was absolutely right for a gentleman of consistency, a man with a slow hand. It was a fortuitous moment for the salesman to quit hauling around sample cases of boring rep ties "to go with I.B.M. suits" and start cutting his own wide flashy affairs out of suiting fabric, gabardine, Indian prints. Lauren's ties were big, beefy things that made a knot the size of a plum tomato. Ralph Lauren started doing it because he couldn't find a decent tie for himself.
Why can't I have . . . ?
"Whered'ya get it?" they kept asking about his ties. He quit his job and hawked them around to department stores. They sold out.
He went from men's wear to a women's collection that started just with simple, man-tailored shirts cut slim and sold in the narrow boutiques of Bloomingdale's and Bendel's. They were selling, but not to the plaid-and-chino masses who buy them today. "I had a cult following," he says. "It was the hippest customers, young models, thin, antifashion girls."
As Lauren explained back then to an inquiring press, "I think it looks chic now to look straight." He kept adding to the collection: flannel slacks, man-tailored blazers, tuxedos, tuxedo vests. Some people, he says, called it "dykey" -- it was that off-center. In fact, Ralph Lauren was about a decade and a half ahead of the back-to-basics mania that's still with us. Slowly, it grew, until hordes of tiny polo players thundered across the oxford cloth plains.
As with many things, the cultish became the commonplace. And the niche marketer widened his sliver to engulf the world. Today, his is a vision so broad, so larger than life that insiders in his mahogany warren call it "the Movie." Indeed, no print profile of Lauren has neglected to emphasize the cinematic aspects of his world, the movie references in his speech, the trend-setting costumes Diane Keaton wore in Woody Allen's "Annie Hall." Fashion and fantasy have long been a compatible double bill. And in this costume drama, anyone can be a star.
To dismiss Ralph Lauren as simply faux elitist, then, is to miss the point. A vision that appeals to the Prince of Wales and his estranged wife, to hip-hop kids in Flatbush, to purdah ladies in Bombay reaches far beyond wannabe WASPism. Unless you posit some international movement to restore the Raj, Ralph Lauren has to be right: They just want quiet, somewhat better, less disposable stuff. It's a global longing now.

A MULTICULT MYSTERY TOUR
As September school bells tolled, Ralph Lauren fitted out a special tractor-trailer and hauled his Double RL retail crypt downtown to the campus of N.Y.U. for a little "point of sale" education. Uptown, another, less commercial institution was mounting its next show, encapsulating the way we were.
Below the mummies and sarcophagi of the Metropolitan Museum's Egyptian Wing, thousands of garments lie in storage or restoration, in drawer after drawer of epochal chic. On a table, a seated mannequin is being eased into the tweedy comforts of an early 70's Anne Klein suit for the current exhibit of the museum's Costume Institute, "Versailles 1973." It is centered around a famous French show two decades ago that featured five American designers: Anne Klein, Bill Blass, Stephen Burrows, Halston and Oscar de la Renta.
"It's the signal event when American designers were taken seriously by the Europeans," explains Richard Martin, curator of the institute. "It's really the triumph of American sportswear."
Casting about for traits distinctive to American fashion, Martin and his co-curator, Harold Koda, are strong on pragmatism -- the American hankering for comfort, wearability, durability. And sportswear -- the abandonment of the total look for a mix-and-match mutability. By the early 70's, the fussy chapeau-to-shoe ensemble look was all but spaded under, along with big-finned cars and Jackie O. pageboys.
Extravagant display felt unseemly, much as it does in these recession-bound times. One dressed down for sweaty hours on the gas lines. As the 70's wore on, mortgage rates rose to unprecedented double figures. America's inner cities still bore the sooty scars of the 60's riots. For many depressed and defeated activists, the fatigues went into the attic and "work clothes" now meant leaving the thrift stores for Hickey-Freeman and Anne Klein.
Fashion was not immune to the times. Soothing, quality classics flowed from ready-to-wear designers like Sonia Rykiel, Jean Muir and Karl Lagerfeld for Chloe. Diane Von Furstenberg had an instant hit with her short, go-anywhere wrap dress, which had a touch of Dido -- with a car-pooler's comforts.
But predictably, there were those who prefered not to stay at home. In an age still itchy with spiritual quests, from the Beatles' pilgrimages to India to Carlos Castaneda's "Teachings of Don Juan," fashion set off on its own beads-and-burnoose odysseys. As a word, multiculturalism was hardly in use yet, but fashion designers, like questing rock stars and suburban swami followers, were having their passports stamped at more and more exotic ports of call. Yves Saint Laurent was seen scouting in Denver and Albuquerque in 1976, poking in the same cafes and trading posts that had sparked Ralph Lauren's blanket jackets and prairie skirts.
"In the mid- to late-70's, fashion was really wandering," Richard Martin says. "It was looking at the world for inspiration. That's one of the reasons Japanese fashion became important."
Hailing the asymmetrical hemlines of Yohji Yamamoto, the fluid draping genius of Issey Miyake, the dark, minimalist lines of Rei Kawakubo for Comme des Garcons or the amusing forays of the peripatetic Kenzo, the fashion world, Martin says, "was realizing that the monolithic Western tradition was breaking apart."
Multiculturalism arrived on the runway in another form. It first made waves at that Versailles show in 1973, when the American designers brought over a number of black models, blessedly unbowed by Parisian traditions. Once the music started, the clothes began to come alive as they never had before. Europeans, used to a very static, pivot-and-pose kind of show, cheered the loudest.
Even on the New York runways of that time, "the black models steal the shows," Eli Evans reported in this magazine. "At the shows of the major black designers -- Scott Barrie, Stephen Burrows and Willi Smith -- the models are unrestrained enough to skip down the runways and occasionally toss off an all-out, high-stepping, syncopated wipe-out step, turning an ordinary jersey dress into two hound dogs in a burlap bag."
The black models reminded people that clothes were meant to be worn, that the body was in fact the key accessory. Customers were easily convinced. On Saks' seventh floor, Kal Ruttenstein, then a merchandise manager, watched the dresses fly out the door when the models Bethann Hardison, Billie Blair and Norma Jean Darden did it to death during store promotions for designers like Clovis Ruffin.
"The audience went nuts," Ruttenstein recalls. "And the minute the show was over, they were trying clothes on and buying them like wildfire."
There have been waves of standout black models since then: Beverly Johnson and Iman, Naomi Campbell, Beverly Peele, Veronica Webb. Visit a few European ateliers and you now see many stunning women of color among the house models, rustling about in muslin tailles.
It's an achievement burlesqued -- but reverently -- in those late 80's vogue-ing balls so popular with gay black and Hispanic men who organized themselves into fashion "houses" and walked it, talked it, wore it with an esprit that could make you holler and weep.
Long before Madonna mined her platinum CD's from that Shake 'n' Bake subculture, a friend took me to a vogue-ing ball the night he was being inducted into the House of Africa. We stood by apprehensively as one of the judges, the towering transvestite Pepper Labeija, set down the prescriptives for the "Fem Realness" competition. A skinny boy in lame platforms and very tacky shirred Qiana had the misfortune to catch the regal eye.
"Lord, girl," Her Spiciness scolded through the mike. "You look like some 'Brady Bunch' car wreck. I'd say about 1975!"

THE GROOVINESS HANGOVER
Pepper had a point. Things did get ugly for a while there. Despite the cooled-down classicism at the higher price points -- the zipless, buttonless minimalism of a Halston, the simple linens and cashmeres of Calvin Klein -- there was a good deal of unsightliness in Junior and Misses Sportswear. Even in men's wear, our collective grooviness hangover collided with disco, punk, you name it -- and the knockoff men hauled the whole mess to Bloomingdale's second floor.
In a decade that had embraced the dashiki, hot pants, the denim jacket and the leisure suit, more than a few closets developed multiple personalities. Cinema offered style-setters from "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" to "Annie Hall." As a Presidency fell and ugly things skittered from beneath the Oval Office rug, as China opened and the Shah was closed down, the floodgates to bad taste were flung wide.
If you have any doubts that "mainstream" 70's fashions could be truly bizarre, just watch a "Brady Bunch" rerun, a riot of light-blue polyester, kicky icky bell-bottoms, gaudy ties, platform oxfords -- and much of this perpetrated on children. Despite the gas shortages, there seemed to be no dearth of petroleum-based fashion. In 1974, three years before they celebrated the Queen's Silver Jubilee by selling T-shirts with a safety pin stuck through the royal face, British style tricksters Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren turned out a swell line of bondage wear in sweaty, snappy rubber.
Into this valley of gaucherie and misshapen Corfam shoes rode Giorgio Armani, the quiet tailor. In men's wear, and in men's-styled women's wear, he put the European designers' imprimatur on the casual revolution the Americans had begun. Quietly, insistently, he would banish the crass imperatives of Fashion for the classy impulses of Style.
Always a person of particular tastes -- he says he probably styled his sandbox -- Armani confessed that he had been chafing against the unnecessarily ugly in fashion since he designed window displays in the Italian department store La Rinascente in the mid-60's. Things weren't much prettier in 1975 when Armani started his own label with less than $10,000 and a belief that the antifashion of the late 60's needed a firm hand to get it back on track. The Italian felt that modernity should go beyond the faddish, toward the timeless. He tilted his scissors, spurred his fledgling work force and drove hard at the suit jacket, that ages-old coat of mail that had recently been discoed, denimed, tortured with Naugahyde elbow patches, yoked and topstitched in Ultrasuede -- or worse, left stiff and unbending in that tired old box, the business suit. Armani cut his new shape, bold as the mark of Zorro.
"Though it was the spirit of casualness, it was the spirit of the new era of the 70's," he says. The thing he loosed would be "a little used, not absolutely perfect." It would have some classic lines, but feel modern and comfy as a running shoe. It was the Armani Jacket.
Armani had taken the suit jacket and torn its guts out; though he kept some classic lines, he deep-sixed the glued-on, stiffening lining, risking rumple for the sake of ease. He dropped the lapels and moved the top button down to a level that was cardiovascular friendly. Shoulders were dropped and extended. And when he was done with this handsome sedition, one that would change men's wear so profoundly, Armani extended his tailoring in a softer version to women.
There were, of course, widely divergent interpretations of Haberdashery for Her, from Armani's suave suits to the funkier newsboy "garconne" looks bouncing out of European houses. Even male terrorist chic hit the Paris runways in 1978 as Daniel Hechter's I.R.A.-tweed look jackbooted along. Black beret, leather jacket, man's shirt and tie, shades, crepe-soled brogues and rolled-down ankle socks. All that was missing was the ultimate accessory, an AK-47 -- in basic black.
By the late 70's, the names of American designers were firmly stitched in the American consciousness -- and on countless products: Bill Blass. Geoffrey Beene. Calvin Klein. Halston. Ralph Lauren. Perry Ellis opened his firm in 1978 and would make the grade in record time. Thanks in large part to frequent profiles and party coverage in Women's Wear Daily, the designer loomed larger as a personality. No consortium of P.R. wizards could have done what the WWD publisher, John Fairchild, did to glamorize the job.
Given the growth of these names, licensing boomed in the shaky 70's. Industry experts have long believed that licensed products do well in downturned economies because the customer believes a licensed product has a higher value than a generic item. A perfect example: designer jeans.
 
'YOU OUGHT TO DO JEANS'
Fashion moment, 1978.
Calvin Klein is at the bar in Studio 54, the very spot where his good friend Steve Rubell had informed him, one mad Halston/Calvin/Liza night, that fashion designers had become celebrities. How strange, he thinks. He's just having fun. It's 4 A.M and he's decided to stay up all night and cruise straight to the airport for a business trip to Frankfurt in the morning. It's that time in his life when he's not thinking marriage and evenings by a crackling mesquite hearth -- feelings that would inspire his Eternity fragrance a decade later. No, he's having an Obsession kind of sensation, a heady frisson he'd eventually communicate to the chemists who helped him develop his signature fragrances. Recalling all-nighters like this, he'd talk to the scientists as though they were a team of shrinks:
"You know, I'm feeling really strong, very sexy. Like life is wild and I'm up all night and you just don't have sex with one person, you have sex with a group. . . ."
They'd suggest musk notes -- the kind that assailed you at 54 when uptown girls brushed up against Christopher Street on the dance floor.
So here he is, having one of those nothing-is-beyond-you nights, when suddenly a man walks up and introduces himself to Klein.
"You ought to do jeans," the stranger tells him. His name is Peter King, he's got a company, could do the licensing. . . .
Oh, what an idea, what a damned fine idea! "What Levis does is fantastic," Klein is thinking. "But I'm a designer. I can do things with cut, silhouette, shape that they can't. To create attitude. An image. . . . It could be really fun."
After dawn, the notion is still with him. It has Calvin Klein, well, obsessed. On the way to the airport, he picks up his car phone and directs his business partner, Barry Schwartz, to look into this guy, have an agreement ready when he gets back.
Fifteen years later, there is thunderous applause in the Hollywood Bowl as Brooke Shields smiles from a huge video screen and says that nothing comes between her and her Calvins. After the seven-minute montage of Klein's most arresting ads over the years, they are all on their feet: 350 models, Barry Diller, Tina Turner, David Geffen, Warren Beatty, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the whole fashion/Hollywood arc -- here to celebrate the World of Calvin Klein and benefit AIDS Project Los Angeles. It's normally a tough crowd, but there is plenty of oozing mascara.
Bloomingdale's fashion czar, Kal Ruttenstein, who remembers a young Calvin pushing pipe racks of his coats down Seventh Avenue, is nearly overcome. Here is Calvin, reclaimed -- from substance abuse, from financial uncertainty -- so strong now. Out in the crowd, a much younger man is surprised at his own, rather emotional reaction. Details editor James Truman is a tough-minded Brit, a man who has just banned the word style from his fashion magazine, despising its "tyranny." But Calvin's montage hits square between his oh-so-slim lapels. "It brought a lump to your throat," Truman recalls. "It had such power to the heart. It was like seeing Greta Garbo. I think advertising appropriated the emotional style that the movies had before. And I think that anyone who's grown up with that cannot help but think this is so emotional. And so important -- that they have to be a part of it. With clothes."
Calvins, instead of that Proustian madeleine. Amazing, the impact of a topstitched pair of pants.
Remembering the moment himself, Klein smiles. "This is about the democratization of fashion," he says. "It used to come from Babe Paley. Now it comes from stone-washing denim to make it look like you've owned it a long time."
Within a year after Klein indulged his denim dreams, there were more than 30 brands of designer jeans on the market, signaling a slide toward casual that now suits airplane travelers in jogging outfits and dentists in Birkenstocks. Tourists who once wore their Sunday best to visit big cities now dress as though they're headed for a Kiwanis barbecue -- all tube socks and fanny packs.
On the designer level, the 80's found Lauren, Ellis, Armani and Klein solidifying their market positions with assured understatement. What the fashion copy called "easy elegance." Smooth, casual lines that don't change drastically from season to season, a quiet confidence that eschews haggling over hemlines and the color of the season. All their palettes were natural, muted, heavily anchored by navy, gray and black. They offered clothes that were safe but not snore-inducing. They were cut well and closer to the Edge. Designers were getting out more. Shopping. Spying. And having a little fun.
Even the monk of Milan went to check out Madonna; Armani's nephew took him to a concert in Turin. Often Calvin Klein calls his daughter, Marci, a talent coordinator at "Saturday Night Live." "Honey, what's goin' on?" he needs to know. Retailers order buyers to stay out late and look at club kids. Kal Ruttenstein says that in his late 50's he would rather be home watering the roses on his terrace. But he is out almost every night getting to know disk jockey Johnny Dynell, transvestite diva RuPaul.
"I want to see what Ru is wearing," Ruttenstein says. "I watch MTV constantly. I have to know what's going on everywhere. . . ."
 
THE UNDERWEAR THING
Calvin Klein is excited.
"Wait'll you see, guys. You've gotta check this out."
Klein is barefoot, in a stunning Italian summer-weight suit, a soft white T-shirt (Calvin, of course) underneath. As the design team for his women's Collection line waits around the conference table, the boss rummages through a shopping bag full of shoes: woven leather slip-ons, huarache-type weaves, plain slippers. He bought them all from street vendors in Rio last week, shopping with his wife, Kelly. And he has an idea.
"So? Huh? What? Is it cool?"
He's slipped on a pair of the woven shoes and there is no doubt, even if you ignore his beaming face -- almost goofy in its enthusiasm -- that the look is very cool. The fine double-breasted tailoring against the soft cotton T, the long, narrow street shoes, plainly made, but with an elegant tapered shape. He wants to make the shoes for next year. Summer, resort, whatever. Men, women.
"Chic," says the Collection head, Susan Sokol. "Really chic."
"They're not primitive," someone else ventures. "I think they're chic as hell."
Klein grins. They're getting it. "We're thinking refined," he says. "We're tired of how tough and street everything looks. All those big boots. Every kid is wearing them."
Never mind that as he says this Vogue's August cover is proclaiming this "The Year of the Boot," that his own fall collection is being shown with more clodhoppers than Dogpatch, with knee-high black leather combat boots for $325.
Boom. He's over big feet. Time to move. And if Calvin says so, you bet his loyalists will. He will tell them, not in so many words, but in attitude, in clothes that just look right with the shoes, in carefully styled ads. It doesn't mean they'll have to kick those clunkers to the back of the closet; Calvin will simply give them options. He says he's never been about planned obsolesence. Take these fabric swatches he's been poring over for next spring. Some look almost antique, others stretchy and now, but none of them is wear-dated.
"Amazing. Hell of a job. I'm stunned."
He is congratulating his design team, many of whom have been wrangling with fabric houses for months to produce the tiny swatches taped and pinned to sketches: soft damasks and georgettes, silks and linens in gray, white, "souris" and bone. As he fingers a gorgeous damask, custom-made in an Italian mill, a sudden grimace passes across his face. "Oh God, I'm thinking about the economy," he says. But then he grins. "I mean, I could get really aggressive about this stuff, it's so beautiful."
Klein says he's learning to rein himself in, on many fronts. He is out of the musks now and into the florals and woodsy tones of "more traditional values." After the 1991 restructuring of his business with the help of his best friend, David Geffen, who bought up $55 million in long-term debt notes, he says he learned "one hell of a lesson." He finds himself more introspective -- and receptive.
"I listen to people and I watch people," he says. "What I love about fashion is that it's so tied into psychology and sociology."
He says he's had the privilege of assisting in a quiet but profound revolution. "Women have really evolved about clothes," he says. "So have men, incidentally. It's about confidence. It's about asking for help and advice, having someone (close to you) say these things are for you or aren't -- regardless of what Bazaar says. No one really needs fashion. The point is, clothes are supposed to make you feel good. For not a lot of money you can find something that makes you feel sexy, sporty, sophisticated, hip."
Of his ultrastylized ads, all that face slapping in the name of Obsession, those Bruce Weber-photographed friezes of naked boys and girls together, of those crotch-grabbing Marky Mark ads -- the ones that talk about safe sex -- he says: "People will say that I'll do something just to get attention. But that's not what I try to do. I try to take risks. Sometimes it's boring, sometimes you go too far. But at least it makes you think."
Take this "underwear thing." Klein gulps some cold coffee and says that he and Kelly made it up together. Men's-inspired briefs and shirts for women. Underwear as loungewear for men. He says it gets you where you live.
"It's sexy. It's fun. A man takes off his suit and shirt and he's just watching TV, reading. In all kinds of shorts. They're clothing. And they're not expensive."
No, they're prole -- but designed. When Marlon Brando bellowed "Ayyyy, Stellaaaaa" and tossed a chunk of meat up to Kim Hunter, no one ran out and bought sleeveless undershirts. Now, when a former Boston gangbanger named Marky Mark snaps his waistband, consumers snap to.
Ask Klein about those spots, or spawts, as this charming son of the Bronx calls them, and he says that while he hires the best photographers and talent, "It's all in my imagination. It's all me. And that's what people are paying for."
Sure, he's learned plenty of lessons, sobered up in every way since the days of musk and Stoli. But there is an element of the 70's, the decade that so launched him, that remains his driving wheel.
"I like to live in the moment. There were designers that were so rarefied in their ateliers. Come on. How could you be modern and know what's going on in the world unless you're out there?"
 
LA GRANDE BOUFFE
In January 1988, Giorgio Armani stood in a gale of air kisses and photo flashes, wondering if he had just made a business blunder. He was about to open one of his minimalist stores in Beverly Hills. At a party in his honor, le tout Hollywood embraced the man who had dressed Richard Gere in "American Gigolo" and Robert De Niro in "The Untouchables." That night, Armani was in their hearts and on their backs as the mighty tucked into a Spago-catered meal. Michael Eisner, Steven Spielberg, David Hockney, Martin Scorsese.
It was the women who frightened the quiet tailor that night. So many of them were strapped and bustiered into those 80's excess outfits, clothes that screamed more about one's credit line than about good taste. It was the brief but splashy moment of Christian Lacroix's glorious immoderations, of bustles the size of beer kegs, killer crinolines. These clothes bellowed "FASHION!" Armani's whispered "style." Here was a man who made clothes as noiseless as the rustle of old bank notes. Would these people buy what he called his "nothing" elegance?
"I always had certain ideas about Los Angeles," Armani recalled when we spoke shortly afterward. "And when I was at the party, I continued to be worried. Here I was, looking at these people, overdressed, with these big dresses. . . ."
Big hair. Big junk bond portfolios. In the 80's, fashion, like finance, went to extremes. At one end were the platoons marching forth to the workplace in those ghastly women's power suits worn with faux bow ties and commuter Reeboks. It was the 70's men's-wear trend taken to numbing uniformity. Horrified, Vivienne Westwood parried with her "mini-crini's" -- short, feminine and fanciful. Lacroix unloosed les poufs -- fat, floaty confections that belled and bunched when madame tried to sit down to her blinis.
The forces in many women's lives seemed to be duking it out on the runway and in the closet. Just who was she, the veep or the vamp? And what was "feminine"? If those boxy gray suits camouflaged the figure, 80's body-conscious fashion required a high tolerance for Soloflex reps. In the early 80's, Lagerfeld revived the mini; Norma Kamali did a "sweats" collection; Azzedine Alaia trussed fannies in tight leather and stretch fabrics; Thierry Mugler's hourglass shapes could be positively Valkyrian. Claude Montana shoulders were the envy of the N.F.L., his leathers masterworks of snug engineering. Gaultier burlesqued it all with his conical, nuclear warhead bra tops and his outside-in corsets, an inspiration from his childhood, he declared, watching his grandmother sip vinegar to shrink her stomach -- the better to lace up her corset.
Fashion's dichotomy did reflect the growing gap in Reagan-era economic groups. Those who pouffed also had reservations at la grande bouffe, as restaurant madness seized the nation and the sun-dried tomato rose high over the land. But with the Subaru set, staying at home acquired its own media-certified cachet. Trendmeisters like Faith Popcorn announced that Americans were "cocooning," snuggling in with upscale takeout and a video. Food and shelter magazines boomed. Conran's and Ikea megastores sprouted along interstates. The aisles were crammed with determined life-stylers, paint chips clicking merrily in the pockets of their matching khakis from Lands' End. Or from Ralph Lauren.
This is not to say there was no comfortable, witty middle ground. Perry Ellis had arrived by 1980 and, as the decade went on, refined his lively two-step of the classic and the quirky. Until his death in 1986, Ellis was the least conservative of the American consortium that solidified its base in the 80's -- Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan.
Despite his worries, Armani continued to sell -- from Beverly Hills to Bangkok. The well-cut Armani jacket or suit became an anchor in power wardrobes for both sexes. Milan emerged as a greater force (Gianfranco Ferre, the Fendi sisters, Gianni Versace, Romeo Gigli). Japan was still well represented, with Miyake and with the dark, edgy silhouettes of Kawakubo's Comme des Garcons.
Wherever a woman found herself in the 80's -- dancing at Nell's or prowling Home Depot -- at least she had options. She could wear jeans to the ball or browse produce in sequins without raising an eyebrow. Despite the sometimes cartoony aspects wrought by this freedom of choice, she had come a long way from Dior's unilateral imperatives.

THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN
What do women want now? Designers are asking Freud's hoary question -- and listening to the answers -- as never before. It's the most rudimentary form of market research. But applying it assiduously has helped create two of the last decade's biggest, most high-tech fashion successes.
"I am very comfortable working in this age," Gianni Versace says. "The women today are so spectacular. They are modern, they work and they relate."
He is sitting down to breakfast in his St. Regis suite at the outset of a short vacation. He says he takes quite a few these days -- most permissible for a man whose family-held business is doing about $800 million a year in men's and women's wear, with 130 stores worldwide.
With robust appetite, he breaks the yolks on a pair of fried eggs. A fax machine beeps discreetly; on the desk in the living room, there is a sheaf of late-night sketches made for this fall's couture. Back in Milan, the men's-wear show is just weeks away. He says this is all light years from the way they did things in the Calabrian fitting rooms overseen by his dressmaker mother in the 50's and 60's. The phone trills and the designer picks up.
"Bruce. Dahhhrling. How you make me suffer with these pictures. They are TOO BEAUTIFUL."
The photographer Bruce Weber is calling for input on his latest campaign for Versace's fall men's wear. They had agreed on all but one point: the maestro would not make a kilt for the male models as Weber had requested.
"Not me. No the skirt."
You do not appropriate women's things, make jokes. Have rispetto. The media can say what they like, call some of his work vulgar, vampish. He says they only show his "crazy" things, the men's studmuffin leatherware, the "bondage" dresses with more straps than the harness on a Budweiser Clydesdale. Never mind that he also makes cashmere separates and suits quiet enough for the Princess of Wales.
"Never mind. I know who I am, I promise you."
He says he is a man who loves women. And, from Jane Fonda to Michelle Pfeiffer, they seem to embrace his visions of Woman. When he signed copies of his coffee-table book, "South Beach Stories," this spring at Bloomingdale's, a woman had herself wheeled up to him in a hospital bed.
"Women!" he says. "I live my life in an atelier and there were 45 girls working all the time there. I can be the Truman Capote of the atelier."
He laughs, remembering the seamstresses' love affairs, wayward husbands, fat, gorgeous babies. The working women talked to him. And the wealthy women trusted him; by the time he was 15, the clients were telling his mother, "Let Gianni choose the fabric."
"The universe of women around me was so . . . so beautiful," he says. "Then, today, you relate with the women who are stronger than men. I try to understand what they want. When I'm in the fitting, I'm surrounded by five or six women. I never do a dress just by myself. I say, 'Will you wear that?' "
He says that he still sees the old stereotypes sometimes, the designers who lose themselves too deeply in the world of women. "There are some designers who transfer their personality into women. Not me."
It's not that simple anymore; her personality is too strong, too resistant. Instead, he says, he makes clothes for different tastes and needs, clothes for the contemporary Faces of Eve:
"She's mother, she's lover, she's madonna, she's beetch. . . . "
To all of them he listens. And should he ever forget how to listen to Woman?
"She keek my behind."

SEVEN EASY PIECES
Before she can say hello over the speakerphone from her New York office, Donna Karan must issue some last-minute orders on this lingerie thing. O.K. No. HOLD THAT ONE! Oh, come on!
"Since I've been designing," she begins, "it always has been for me. As a woman. I know that some designers, mostly men, have models who -- what do they call it? Their muse?"
Right. Saint Laurent is now using the niece of his longtime inspiration, LouLou de la Falaise. Lagerfeld had Italian Vogue's Anna Piaggi. Donna Karan says she had a good relationship with her former employer, the late Anne Klein. But though they worked well together, she says they argued a lot. Klein designed for herself and Karan couldn't wear the stuff she herself was making. Armholes too small, pants didn't fit right. Comfort level not quite there for the working woman. When she started her own company in 1984, she knew what to do.
"I was living that life," she says. "Not only was I designing it, I was wearing it."
She is known best for her body-friendly wrap dressing, seven easy pieces to take you from the board room to catching Bobby at the Carlyle. Many of her own innovations -- the bodysuit beneath skirts and pants, the sophisticated but kind draping -- came out of black moments in front of her own mirror. Just moments before our talk, she is staring at prototypes, thinking:
What is the ultimate bra for me?
Karan is a big-boned woman, in good shape, but never skinny. Desiging for herself has its own set of imperatives. "It has a lot to do with body type," she says, laughing. "What I want to cover and what I don't!"
Karan has now covered the market, with 14 companies, from children's wear to accessories, and men's wear, with price points "from caviar to pizza." When it was announced that her firm would go public, one industry analyst predicted, "This will be another Snapple." All of the companies, she says, came from her life.
"I see myself as, No. 1, a mother," she says. "So this mother thinks about her children, what my daughter wants to wear. I think about what my son, my husband wants to wear. I basically have taken this mother role" -- she is laughing -- "and expanded it into a business!"
They're buying it in a big way, the sons and daughters and moms and dads. And when she meets her constituency, as she does often in store appearances, she says she loves it, even relishes the haggling when she pushes little changes at them and they balk a bit. Always, they speak their minds:
"Please, give us more of these, more colors."
"Donna, please, accessories. With this -- WHAT?"
"You expect me to wear that?"

'CAN I PUT My PANTS ON?'
"Drop your pants, please. Just -- boom -- right there on the ground."
Leslie Navajas stands knock-kneed on the photographer's no-seam, wondering if she has heard right. The model's pretty mouth has formed an inquiring "O" as she stares at Brana Wolf, a stylist hired to vamp the product of Club Monaco, an up-and-coming Canadian company that produces clothes at Gap prices -- with a lot more panache.
"Trust me," Wolf says. "Let 'em go."
Navajas drops the navy wool pants and stands there, unspeakably lovely, in just the suit jacket, handsome indeed in its new solitude. Photographer Mario Sorrenti goes to work. Standing by is Joe Mimran, Club Monaco president, nodding approval. He has come to New York with a small team -- just a designer and ad director. Apart from shoots like this, he says, everything -- design, press, packaging, store design -- is done in-house, in Toronto.
Club Monaco is a young, lean, 90's fashion company. It's small enough to move quickly, independent enough to cut its "basics" on the edgy side for that sizable clientele ready to move on past the turtleneck-and-pocket-T mode. Begun in 1985, Club Monaco has 60 stores in Canada, six in Japan and four in California. Philosophy: "approachable design." Volume: $55 million.
As with most fashion shoots, this one is a team effort. But ad director Christine Ralphs says she relies especially heavily on the eye and input of two people: Lloyd Douglas, the art director, and Wolf, who suggested the photographer, the pieces to highlight, the accessories. A good stylist is plugged in, can give you a Look and deep Rolodex -- the best makeup, hair, antique car rental. She knows which model wilts fastest, which is allergic to dogs.
Wolf, an Australian who lived and worked in Europe before she came to New York, is wearing the usual stylist gear: black pants; big white shirt stuck with straight and safety pins; rubber bands around her wrists; cigarettes in her pocket; worn, scuffed leather sneaks. No makeup, hair pulled back, all business.
As a fashion stylist, Wolf is part of a growing corps of style interpreters -- people who can translate a look, evoke a feeling with the turn of a cuff, a maribou mule, an empty McDonald's wrapper tossed beside a couture redingote. A contributing editor to Vogue, she has a client list that takes in editorial and advertising -- at many price levels. She's worked with the film director David Lynch to style Armani's TV ad for his fragrance, Gio, and has styled for Valentino, Dolce & Gabbana, Perry Ellis, Gianfranco Ferre, Hermes, as well as for Esprit and the Gap. Jobs are so different, she says, "even my own mother doesn't know what I do."
Unlike some top stylists who stick with couture or expensive ready-to-wear, she says she's best known for her rescue operations at the lower level. "I don't think I'm a trend-setter as much as" -- she laughs -- "as a fixer-upper of things."
The clothes for this shoot are nice enough -- no limping bunnies here. But the budget and the minimalism constitute a challenge. "This is very market researched," Wolf says of the Club Monaco line. "The customer is 18 to 35, style conscious, a little bit more so than someone who'd go to the Gap."
They have decided to keep it simple, she says -- a sign of the times. The pieces are pared down; the feeling needs to be the same. "All of this," she says, "is still a reaction to the 80's when everything was so overdone, so overaccessorized."
From the kitchen area, Navajas calls out, a tad plaintively: "Uh, Brana? Can I put these pants on now?"
Wolf is scrutinizing the rack for the next idea. "It's about choices," she says of her work. "If you can just choose the right things and put them together properly, then you can help the woman out there who can't afford one look or isn't interested in those top lines. It's spreading the style down the line -- and teaching people how to do it."
Navajas is asked to don a long, straight jersey dress. She comes out with suede clogs on beneath it and Wolf shakes her head. The stylist ducks behind the pipe rack and comes up with a huge pair of basketball shoes. Grinning, Navajas slips them on, unlaced like the downest homeboy's, and clomps back to her place before the lens.
"Yeaaah, we got it." Sorrenti is clicking. The clients say they love the look. And here is the message: Minimal is maxi. But darling -- have fun.

'YOU DON'T SUFFER FOR DRESSES'
"Want a hot dog?"
Four floors above the rue Cambon, Karl Lagerfeld holds up a fat, flesh-colored saucisson, plucked from a plate of what look like Nathan's finest. He plunges it into a mound of mustard and makes short work of it, with a Diet Coke chaser. Urbane, saturnine in his trademark baggy black suit and dark glasses, he's chatting like a multilingual magpie from behind his huge desk. It's 7:30 P.M. and he's just begun supervising fittings for 25 suits, dresses and evening gowns -- part of the Chanel winter collection -- due to be shown in just a month's time.
Lagerfeld is easily the busiest designer on the planet with his own KL line, Chanel's couture and ready-to-wear and his fur designs for the Fendi sisters. And two collections for Chloe. "This work allows no time to be civilized, you know?" Lagerfeld says, reaching for another hot dog. "This must be dinner. Eat. We will be here all night."
As a bare-torsoed model is fitted for a bra top to go with her floaty evening skirt, the couturier is discussing "Achy Breaky Heart." That country hit was made popular by one Billy Ray Cyrus, a smug, mall-cut galoot now given to wearing $1,500 Versace shirts with his blue jeans. The song has been recommended, a bit behind the curve, by a good friend and couture client sitting atLagerfeld's right hand. Tonight she is dressed, toe to earlobe, in sea-green Chanel.
"Oh, Karl, 'Achy Breaky's' kinda cute," says Susan Gutfreund, the high-profile wife of the deposed Salomon Brothers chief, John Gutfreund.
"It is," Lagerfeld snaps, "a HORRIBLE thing. Surely you know this."
He turns to his left and asks me, smiling: "You were expecting maybe Mozart up here? Mahler?"
Not at all. Guns 'n' Roses, maybe, from the looks of things. Tattoos have invaded the atelier -- a bold heart on the bicep of the black-clad assistant rushing about with fabric bolts. Those four-figure biker boots clunk beneath the models' half-finished velveteen gowns. Like the other dark princes of fashion -- Mugler, Gaultier, Versace -- Lagerfeld has not been loath to loose scurrying bits of gutter chic on Chanel's exalted runways. He admits to being a bit perverse -- and egotistical. But to call him aristocratic is to invite a burning Nosferatu gaze through those oversized smoked lenses. He insists he's a tradesman.
When, at age 16, he informed his wealthy mother of his career choice, she said, "You are not snobbish, my son."
The signature ponytail shakes. "Some designers tell you how much they suffer, and then you have every six months the same dress. Please, no! This bull -- we've heard before. I don't have to give you names, you know what I'm talking about. But no, no, no, no. You don't suffer for dresses!"
While Saint Laurent has periodic nervous breakdowns and rereads Proust obsessively, Lagerfeld will settle in with an Italian design magazine, a Sotheby's catalogue and plan a dinner party. This is a designer who does jokes -- albeit pricey ones. Velvet Mickey Mouse ears on the runway; precious purses in the shape of baguettes; hundred-dollar Chanel T-shirts. By having a hoot, he made the moribund relics of Mademoiselle's House hip again.
"For me, the atelier is not a temple," he says, as he polishes off another hot dog. "It is my playroom."
A model pirouettes in a muslin taille that will soon be a ball gown. It has been penciled in for black velveteen. The fabric bolt is rolled out against her hip but Lagerfeld is frowning.
"Nah, NEIN, pas le noir, all WRONG," snorts the couturier.
"Tweed!" he yells, and a bolt of tweedy wool gauze, light and soft as a cobweb, is wrapped around the muslin.
"Sexy, extremely sexy, the tweed on bare skin," he says in French. "We do it."
"Oh, ravissante, Karl," Gutfreund is murmuring. "Just ravissante."
Lagerfeld does not seem to hear her. "The most important thing is to give the mood of the moment," he is saying. "It's part of the expression of our times. Chanel, from the beginning, took ideas from the street and put it on the runway and made it fashionable. But Chanel was fated to outlive her revolution and grew cliched in the end.
"Designers are only as good as the next collection," he continues. "You can have the biggest name in the world, but nobody will wait for you. Classic? What is classic? Forget it."

HEADLINE: Savoring Memories of Asmara In Downtown New Haven

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
ONE night recently at Caffe Adulis in New Haven, the chef, Ficre Gebreysus, prepared his special of the evening by spooning butter into a saute pan, then tossing in a small bagful of plump shrimp. A ghostly pillar of flames exploded from the pan, then vanished. "It's like magic, you know?" he said without losing his rhythm. He sprinkled in a few spoonfuls of unsweetened coconut, then stirred in some chopped dates and an herb sauce.
"A little bit of dates, some coconut, some nice herbs and voila," he exclaimed, arranging the dish on a round platter. "You have a symphony." 
 Out on the floor, his brothers, Gideon and Sahle, glided through a full house and stopped at tables to welcome customers and show newcomers the art of Eritrean cuisine. To demonstrate to one young couple, Gideon Gebreysus tore off a piece of injera, the sourdough crepe that accompanies each meal, scooped up some shah'ani ful (a salad of fava beans, tomatoes and feta cheese), folded it over like a dumpling and popped it into his mouth.
"This is probably the only restaurant you'll ever go to where the host helps you to eat your meal," Mr. Gebreysus said with a wide smile.
The brothers, who were raised in Asmara, Eritrea, and came to New Haven within the last 15 years to escape the devastation of their homeland, opened the restaurant a year ago in a trendy neighborhood skirting the Yale campus.
Situated between a French restaurant and a Japanese one, Caffe Adulis's salonlike space features large bay windows that frame the scene on College Street and 20-foot ceilings that give the place an airy feeling. Bright turquoise hats from Eritrea decorate the walls along with impressionist paintings by Ficre Gebreysus, who often describes his method of cooking in musical metaphors.
"Whenever you use spices," he said while stirring a powdered mixture of hot peppers from the Eritrean highlands, ginger, sun-dried onion, cumin and coriander, "you strive to achieve a melodic harmony, a perfect contrapuntal balance."
 
Sharing the Culture of Eritrea
 In May, Eritrea won independence from Ethiopia after a long struggle, which precipitated a famine during the 1980's and caused hundreds of thousands of Eritreans to go abroad. The Gebreysuses, who lost family and friends to the war, said recently that they opened the restaurant -- named after an ancient city in a region that later became Eritrea -- to share their culture and cuisine and to celebrate the spirit and determination of the Eritrean people.
Regulars at Caffe Adulis note the delicate yet exotic flavors of the food, which resembles Middle Eastern and Indian cuisine without the pungency and is served on round platters to be shared by everyone at the table and eaten with injera. Diners say they like the intimacy of eating Eritrean food, the adventure of trying new specials and the attention given to them by the Gebreysus brothers. "When someone told me about this restaurant that served Eritrean and Ethiopian food, I couldn't even imagine what was in store," Evelyn Martinez said. Mrs. Martinez, along with her husband, Bob, often introduces friends to the restaurant. "I come here and want to order everything on the menu.
 
Spices Shipped from Asmara
 Most of the spices the brothers use come from Eritrea, including berbere and their mother's homemade curry powder, which she ships to her sons from Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. A photograph of their mother's beadwork was featured on the summer menu.
All three sons apprenticed at several New Haven restaurants before making the decision to open their own. Gideon Gebreysus, 33 years old and the manager of Caffe Adulis, was the first to come to the United States in the late 1970's following the overthrow of Haile Selassie.
Eritrea, in northern Africa along the Red Sea, is about the size of Pennsylvania. Its chief language is Tigrinya and most of its 3 million inhabitants are either Muslim or Christian. Over the centuries the region was overrun by Portuguese, Turks, Egyptians and finally Italians, who gained control from 1890 to 1941.
In 1952, Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia and was annexed 10 years later. After the annexation, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front began a long and bloody struggle to secede from Ethiopia. Kebede Gebreysus, the oldest brother, was a soldier in the rebel army who died in battle in 1978.
 
Short-Order Cook
 Through family connections, Gideon Gebreysus came to New Haven in 1981 and started out as a short-order cook for a local restaurant while studying for a bachelor's degree in public health at Southern Connecticut State University.
He gradually worked his way up to management positions at Bruxelles and Scozzi's before opening a steakhouse with some partners in 1989. But hard economic times forced the restaurant to close within a year, he said. Meanwhile, the situation at Eritrea continued to worsen. In 1981, Ficre Gebreysus, 30 years old, was among thousands of Eritrean refugees who fled on foot to Sudan, he said. Soon after, he joined his older brother in New Haven, working at some of the same restaurants and attending school at Southern Connecticut State University, where he received his bachelor's degree in liberal studies in 1988.
During the height of the Ethiopian famine in the early to middle 1980's, he worked as a counselor in New York for the Eritrean Relief Committee. As the cook for dozens of Eritrean events and gatherings, he said, he developed some of the dishes that he would later introduce at Caffe Adulis.
 
Restaurant Opened in 1992
 Sahle Gebreysus, 23 years old, came over in 1986 after living in Nairobi and now is working toward a business degree at Southern Connecticut State University while helping his brothers run the restaurant. After receiving encouragement from friends and colleagues in the restaurant business including Joel Schiavone, the New Haven entrepreneur who owns the building where Caffe Adulis resides, the Gebreysus brothers opened their doors in October 1992.
The support and enthusiasm they have received from other Eritreans is a characteristic common to their people, Gideon Gebreysus said, and one that helped the former province win independence on May 24, making it one of the world's youngest nations.
"Eritrea survived because we all joined together to work for its freedom," he said. "We are like one big family."
A sister, Sara Gebreysus, who works as a research associate under James Comer, the Yale University educator, also lives in New Haven. They were recently visited by an older sister from Nairobi, Mehret Gebreysus. She came with her two young children after attending a conference in North Carolina for the All African Conference of Churches, for which she works as the head of training and communication. She had not seen her siblings in three years.
 
Family Suffered Hardships
 "This is a pride to us all," Mehret Gebreysus said after touring Caffe Adulis for the first time and eating a meal. Later, in her brother Sahle's apartment across the street, she talked about the hardships her family endured and how proud her father would have been to see her brothers' business. The former Eritrean judge died last November.
In the 1970's and 1980's, Mehret Gebreysus said, death squads roamed the highlands burning villages and trucks of Ethiopian soldiers rode routinely through the streets of Asmara firing weapons at civilians. During the coup d'etat of 1974 a bullet grazed the back of her father's head while he walked down a street in Asmara toward home, she said. Because of the chaos of the times, the Gebreysus family did not learn definitely of their brother's death until last year, 14 years after he was killed.
Once we learned the truth, she said, "It was not an issue of crying and weeping. We grew up with politics. It is a commitment that is passed from generation to generation. If the soldiers would not have died we would not have independence. And all of this history has stayed with every Eritrean."
Back in the kitchen, her brother Ficre described his love for Asmara, which he called "a magical city, shimmering in pastels, with white boulevards, Italian-style villas and palm trees." His mother had a large garden and peach trees, where he loved to play and where he developed his love of natural foods.
 
Dishes Allow Improvisation
 He prepared an order of swordfish Asmara with French tarragon, basil, oregano, garlic and tomato. "All the herbs are organic," he emphasized. He shook the saute pan, listened to rap music on the radio and joked with his sous chef, Jacob Mann. "I once learned from my painting teacher that art has a way of guiding you, it teaches you to never force anything," he said. "That's what I love about African cooking. It's highly individualized. It leaves room for improvisation."
The chef tossed the fish into the air and onto a plate. "Voila," he exclaimed. "To make art you must complete the moment."

HEADLINE: The Season's Outlook At the Emelin Theater

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: MAMARONECK

 BODY:
"A TRUE performing arts center offers everything and we have come a long way since we used to book in a regional company for one or two nights."
In fulfillment of "everything" that he says a true performing arts center offers, Norman Kline, producing director of the Emelin Theater here, was talking about theater, real theater, not only speakers (the Emelin has engaged 6 this season), films (8), jazz (5) and classical (16 concerts) and variety shows (7) from Spalding Gray to the Russian Clowns and the Peking Acrobats, not to mention bluegrass concerts, children's programs, up-and-coming classical musicians and free classic films on Wednesday afternoons. 
 What then are the chances of theater, real theater, when the Emelin stars, its real stars this season, as measured by the Sold Out signs, include Geraldine Ferraro, Jean Harris and Serge Khrushchev -- all in what is called the "high profile" speakers series. Not far behind in popularity are the performers in the Emelin's first cabaret lineup, which began with Julie Wilson on Oct. 2 and continues with Ann Hampton Callaway, Margaret Whiting and Mary Cleere Haran.
Yes, but how about theater? "Fewer and fewer people are attending theater and the are getting older and older. And the costs are 30 percent more than when we started, so producing drama adds another risk," Mr. Kline said. "The Emelin is known for eclectic programming. At the country-western concerts, I don't recognize a face among the flannel shirts and jeans -- and that's when we get more calls for directions from the Bronx, from New Jersey, from Rockland County. If we just produced theater, we might not be around at all."
The Emelin, now in its 21st year of arts programming, began producing its own plays, as opposed to booking the itinerant attraction, in 1986 with eight performances of "Painting Churches" by Tina Howe. "The Substance of Fire" by Jon Robin Baitz, which opened Oct. 13 and runs through next Sunday for a total of 21 performances, is the 15th homegrown Emelin production. Such recent Emelin anomalies -- "Forbidden Broadway," "Smiling Through," "Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah!" -- do not count as they represent rentals of the theater by outside producers.
While performances of homegrown productions have increased, volume has diminished, from two a season -- "A Delicate Balance" by Edward Albee and "The Cocktail Hour" by A. R. Gurney in 1990 -- to one this season.
For all the tenuousness of theater producing, Mr. Kline adheres to his criterion for choosing plays: works that are literate, interesting and challenging. The theater plays to 70 percent capacity, he said. The Emelin has 270 seats, and there is no telling whether a play by Arthur Miller will be a bigger draw than a play by John Patrick Shanley. One wasn't, in fact. "Italian American Reconciliation," a romantic comedy by Mr. Shanley, has been the Emelin's best-selling play thus far, drawing 20 percent more business than "All My Sons," Mr. Kline said. How to explain it? Mr. Kline figured that the popularity of Mr. Shanley's screenplay "Moonstruck" has something to do with it.
To enhance the Emelin's theater aspect, in what Mr. Kline called a cost-effective way, "From Page to Stage," a series of one-Monday-night-only staged readings of new plays is to begin tomorrow at 7:30 with "Leo and Ellie," a two-character musical by Gil Pelroth about a middle-aged couple -- he (Matt Conley) is divorced, she (Meg Bussert) is widowed. They fall in love. Under another title, "Good Friends," the show had workshop performances at the Eugene O'Neill Musical Theater in Waterford, Conn.
The purpose of the staged reading series, which is being offered free of charge to Emelin donors -- $10 for outsiders -- is, Mr. Kline said, "to test the waters with new works away from commercial pressures."
Produced by Lester Oesterman, a Broadway veteran with such estimable co-producing credits as "Da" and "The Shadow Box," and directed by Mark Graham, an advertising executive, the staged readings will also consist of:
"The Equator," the third title change for a play by Doug Taylor about Japan's economic takeover of the United States after World War II. The play was originally called "The Old Soldier" and was recently advertised as "The Tanaka Memorandum." The play will be read on Nov. 29.
"The Supper of the Heart" by Marjorie Oesterman, which is about a "thirtysomething widow," Mr. Oesterman said. who is playing the dating game, and her 10-year-old son. Scheduled forJan. 24.
The last play, to be announced, will take place on March 21. Discussions with cast and playwrights will follow all readings.
"We hope the readings can be beneficial and that we can be its beneficiaries," Mr. Oesterman said. "And God knows the price is right."

HEADLINE: Biking the Adirondacks

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN; KEN BROWN, an editor on the makeup desk of The Times, has bicycled throughout the Northeast.

 BODY:
RAIN sounds much softer in the country than in the city, so when I awoke on the first morning of a weeklong bicycle trip through the Adirondacks in late June, what I mistook for a rustling of leaves in the breeze was a fairly heavy rain. My fears were confirmed by our bed and breakfast host, who had nothing but sympathy for my wife, Abby Schultz, and I, yet refused to give us a weather forecast. "You're going to ride anyway, right?" he said.
We plugged along for two days and 110 miles in the rain as our rear wheels relentlessly kicked road grit up on our backs. Grinning and bearing it seemed appropriate for the Adirondacks, six million acres of stunning lakes, forests and mountains where the climate and the economy can be harsh. Life in the Adirondacks is not easy, residents like to say, but they add that the joy of living in the largest wilderness area east of the Mississippi far outweighs the pain. 
 Our trip began and ended at the Country Road Lodge near Warrensburg, an uninspiring if convenient gateway in the southeast corner of the Adirondacks. Three hundred miles later we had covered much of Adirondack Park, including the lakes region in the west, the Lake Champlain and Lake George coasts in the east and the High Peaks region due north. While the park, which is a mixture of public and private lands, is best known for its mountains, the High Peaks are concentrated in one region.
Although my wife and I ride several times a week and make 30-mile jaunts on weekends, we did no special training for the journey. We carried a couple of changes of clothes, raingear, a few tools and spare parts and little else on our road bikes.
From Warrensburg we headed northwest toward Long Lake 58 miles away, riding on Route 28, one of about 10 main roads in the park. The rain turned into a downpour after a few miles. Even though late June is supposed to be the end of the black-fly season, heavy snows last winter and a wet spring kept them hatching and biting into late June. The wet weather also caused an explosion of growth, and at times it felt like we were riding through a deep green tunnel trimmed with the purple, gold, yellow and blue of blooming wildflowers.
The rain eased by midday as we hit North Creek, where the road begins to parallel the not too mighty Hudson River, which has its source about 30 miles to the north on the slopes of Mount Marcy, the state's highest peak. Fishermen were the only ones out besides us, but they appeared comfortable in hip boots and big rain jackets. Up here you can wade across the Hudson in summer, but in spring the water flows fast and rough, making it popular for whitewater rafting.
From North Creek the road climbed gradually for about 15 miles as we entered the Western Lakes region, passing first through Indian Lake, where we stopped at one of the ubiquitous diners for a huge lunch that included 35-cent bottomless cups of coffee.
The lakes made the steady climbing worth it, especially as the rain began to ease. Low clouds clung to islands in Blue Mountain Lake as we cycled by. We climbed steeply away from the lake, passing the highly regarded Adirondack Museum, which covers all aspects of the park and its history. In fall the view is stunning, with each island turning a different combination of colors. We cruised the final 10 miles to our destination, the Inn on the Hill in Long Lake, where we were greeted by dozens of chiming clocks, tea and cookies and an offer to throw our wet clothes into the dryer.
We awoke again to steady rain. The day's 55-mile ride from Long Lake to Saranac Lake was easy, with few hills, miles of daisies and black-eyed Susans and only one stretch of heavy rain. Around midday we passed our first fellow rider. The main routes, which are often the cylist's only option, can get fairly busy on summer weekends.
NEW YORK STATE is creating a small but growing system of bike routes, with wide, smooth shoulders and signs alerting motorists to the presence of cyclists. The current bike route begins on Route 28 in North Creek and extends about 30 miles to Long Lake, where it disappears, then picks up again 12 miles later at the Franklin County line.
Rain kept us off our bikes and inside the Porches Bed and Breakfast in Saranac Lake, an old tuberculosis cure house that hasn't changed much since patients went there in the early decades of the century to breathe the fresh air on the building's seven porches. We spent much of the day reading on our porch. When a strong wind helped brighten the skies late in the afternoon, we rode three miles to Lower Saranac Lake and rented a small motorboat (the water was too rough for a canoe) and toured the 10-mile long lake. We circled dozens of rocky islands, crashing through whitecaps and splashing along the heavily wooded shoreline, which is dotted with vacation homes of all sizes. There are three Saranac Lakes (Middle and Upper are the other two) and dozens of other lakes in the area; the park itself has 2,800 lakes.
The shock of bright sunshine on our fourth day on the road was overshadowed by the surprise of flat roads. In the heart of the High Peaks region, surrounded by some of the most famous mountains in the Northeast -- Whiteface, Mount Marcy and Giant of the Valley -- we climbed nary a hill on the 40-mile ride from Saranac Lake to Keene. Every road we pedaled somehow found a valley to pass through, usually next to a river. For much of the day that river was the clear and quick flowing Ausable, as famous for its fishing as for its rapids and waterfalls.
The day took us through Lake Placid, a pretty tourist town on Mirror Lake that has retained the same Olympic spirit (and souvenir shops) it had in 1980 for the Winter Games. The High Peaks Cyclery bike shop recommended a ride along Riverside Drive (County Route 21), just outside town, to watch the West Branch of the Ausable flow through a blaze of autumn colors. Next we passed through Jay, which has two Adirondack rarities, a town green and a covered bridge. We ended the day in the Keene Valley, an eclectic region surrounded by mountains, where we watched horses galloping through the fields of the Bark Eater Inn. The inn is best known for riding and cross-country skiing, but for us its shaded lawn and cold orange juice were enough.
From Keene we headed north out of the High Peaks, a long steady downhill stretch, planning to follow Lake Champlain and Lake George south to Westport, a 60-mile trip. The assumption was that since we left the mountains and were now next to the lakes, there would be no hills for the remainder of the trip and the miles would fly by. But our hill-climbing had just begun. The mountains fall steeply into the lakes, so every time the road leaves the shoreline, it goes up, and sometimes up a lot.
But the rewards are great. To the left, Vermont's Green Mountains rise abruptly across Lake Champlain, like an army ready to cross the lake and march on New York. To the right, the Adirondack High Peaks pass in a procession behind farmers' fields.
The proximity to Vermont and the many farms in the area has influenced several towns along the lake, and for a time it seemed as if we had entered New England. Essex, which was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, is a pretty town with many early 19th-century Federal-style and Greek Revival buildings. Up the road, on a hill above Lake Champlain, was Westport and our destination, the Inn on Library Lawn, a hotel and antique store built in 1875. The region is full of history; key battles in the French and Indian and Revolutionary wars were fought there.
Our longest day turned out to be the hilliest as well. With our final destination only 68 miles away we had several steady climbs that offered views of the undeveloped upper half of Lake George. In the fall, the brightly colored leaves create an almost shocking contrast with the deep blue water in this part of the lake. Progress was good until we hit the Tongue Mountains, several peaks that jut into Lake George and rise to more than 2,200 feet in less than a mile. It was one of the steepest climbs I have made, and I had not changed the gears on my racing bike to touring gears, which would have made turning the pedals over much easier. There was an incentive to keep going, though. Road signs warned us that we were in rattlesnake country.
We neither saw nor heard any, but we were told later that in the spring, when the road surface is warmer than the air, the snakes crawl out onto the pavement to warm themselves. Not comforting news for a slow moving cyclist.
Once over Tongue Mountain we flew downhill into Bolton Landing on the southern end of Lake George, where traffic increased and colonies of small lakeside cabins with barbecues and little porches monopolized the shoreline.
Our tired legs climbed a few more hills, but the fatique was outweighed by euphoria as the last miles disappeared under our tires.
We rounded the final turn onto the driveway of the Country Road Lodge, and the mud I remembered from the first day had turned to sand, not a good surface for a heavily laden bike with a ragged rider. A few zigs and zags and I lost it, ending our trip in a pile of dust about 20 feet from our parked car.

HEADLINE: Sports Wouldn't Be the Same Without the View from a Blimp

BYLINE: By JOYCE JONES

 BODY:
"BLIMP, I like that shot. Hold it." It is a command that Sandy Grossman, the lead CBS sports director, often makes as he selects shots to be broadcast during National Football League games. The command is made to a camera technician who is situated in the blimp's gondola some 1,000 feet above the stadium.
Blimps are a common sight in the skies above New Jersey and much of the rest of the country, and their presence at all manner of sporting events is only expected to increase. 
 Craig Janoff, the director of ABC's "Monday Night Football," said, "Blimps have become tools that provide outstanding visual sensations."
Mr. Grossman was at the Meadowlands recently working with the CBS sportscasters John Madden and Pat Summerall in a broadcast of a Giants game that used shots taken from the Met Life blimp.
Mike Fitzpatrick, the Met Life airship's captain, maneuvered the 194-foot blimp, which also carries a co-pilot and 450 pounds of camera equipment. When aloft, the pilot hears a stream of directions in the right side of his headphones from air traffic controllers. On the left side, he listens to the blimp's camera technician, who shoots pictures of the stadium below and the surrounding area.
During those conversations, "I am asking the pilot to position the blimp so that I can do what the director wants," said Bob Mikkelson, the blimp's camera technician. A microwave transmitter sends the camera's signal to a receiver on the ground, which then feeds the signal live into the production truck, where the shot can be broadcast over the airwaves or kept on videotape for replay.
"When the stadium is rocking with the crowd, you want a big shot of the whole place," Mr. Grossman said. "From a blimp you are able to get a perspective of a sporting event that no other camera can give."
Goodyear has been building blimps and balloons for the military and for its own use since 1917. It first used a blimp as an advertising vehicle in 1925, but it wasn't until 1964 that the company formed a public relations department to oversee the blimp's operation.
In 1960, Goodyear installed a camera in one of its blimps and used the shots to cover a sporting event at the Orange Bowl, the first time shots from a blimp were broadcast on national television. (The company no longer knows what sport was being played that day in Miami.)
The blimp's usefulness as a broadcast tool drastically increased in 1984 when the airships began to be outfitted with a gyrostabilized camera mount that could carry the largest broadcast lens. The mount was introcudes by Winged Vision, Mr. Mikkelson's company. Cameras stationed in blimps can now pick up the numbers on a player's jersey or a golf ball in the grass.
 
'Terrific Overhead Shots'
 At the U.S. Open at the Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield last June, the blimp's camera was an integral part of ABC's coverage. Dennis Lewin, the senior vice president of production for ABC Sports, said: "Goodyear gave us terrific overhead shots of the course direction. We used the blimp to identify players and their strokes; people enjoyed seeing the Baltusrol course and the surrounding area from the air."
Along with the public's fondness for blimps, Mr. Mikkelson said, "when a crowd sees a blimp over a stadium, it adds a sense of importance to the event."
The blimp gives a sense of place, Mr. Grossman said. "If you are familiar with Giants Stadium, you've seen the sports complex, the Brendan Byrne Arena and the Meadowlands Race Track. But for those who don't know the area, showing this from the air gives it identity, just as do the shots of the bay when covering a game at Candlestick Park in San Francisco."
The blimp also can provide some comic relief. "John Madden has fun with it," Mr. Grossman said of the CBS sportscaster. At one football game when it started to rain, the Fuji blimp started to leave.
"Where's the blimp going?" Mr. Madden is said to have asked as he traced its flight on the chalkboard, something he usually reserves for diagramming a game play.
Even fans' displeasure can be registered from the blimp. Last year, during a particularly bad game for the Giants, Mr. Grossman called for a shot from the blimp of people emptying out of the stadium into the parking lot. "You didn't even have to show the scoreboard to sense their unhappiness."
Eddie Ogden, the public relations manager of one of Goodyear's blimps, the Spirit of Akron, said that Roone Arledge, when he was president of ABC Sports, said that "Monday Night Football" was not only football, but also entertainment. "When we cover an event for one of the networks or cable, we think we are part of the show, not an added concession," Mr. Ogden said.
As the football season progresses, Mr. Janoff said he plans to use the blimp in more game action on "Monday Night Football." He said that "we'll take a chance using its line camera" to cover play-by-play action, and not just use the blimp camera for beauty shots.
 
Eight Large Blimps
 Currently, the number of large blimps in the United States is up to eight. Only two smaller blimps, 130 feet long, operated by Blockbuster Video and the Family Channel, are equipped with cameras and in use for sporting and other events. The smaller blimps are called Lightships, as they are illuminated internally, from nose to tail.
August A. Busch 4th, the vice president of Budweiser Brands, said one of its large airships, Bud One, is extending its bookings east, whereas last year it mainly stayed in California. Another company blimp, Shamu, promotes its four Sea World parks, in Orlando, San Diego, San Antonio and Ora, Ohio.
With only one blimp needed to be part of any particular telecast, who decides which blimp will cover the event?
"It's simply sponsor-driven," said Jim Harrington, a vice president of production at CBS. "Decisions are made by the sales and marketing people based on which blimp's company has bought the most advertising time. The blimp that is chosen is there for economic reasons."
The deal also includes an arrangement with the television and cable companies that the blimp be shown on the air and mentioned by company name. During one such shot, the announcer usually identifies the airship's captain. At one mention per hour, the blimp's sponsor can expect up to 30 seconds of free on-air advertising, which can cost from $50,000 during the regular football season to $800,000 at the Super Bowl.
A Met Life airship captain, Maurice Mylemans, said: "When the camera technician hears the director ask, 'Who's got the blimp?' we know that they're about to show us on camera. We move fast to get the blimp and its logo in the best position for the shot."
 
Always an Objective in Mind
 Tom Riley, Goodyear's manager of airship operations, said, "Whether covering a network affair or flying over the beach, there is an objective in mind for every moment of flight time."
Companies seek to sponsor events that are in keeping with their services or product. "For example, Met Life does not wish to sponsor auto races, racing being a high-risk sport," said Bob Pizzute, director of blimp promotion at Met Life. But it is a venue that appeals to companies like Goodyear and Anheuser-Busch.
Blimps are made of polyester fabric, and its "lifting gas" is nonflammable helium. The blimp's shape is maintained by the internal pressure of the lifting gas. Only licensed commercial pilots may enroll in a training program to fly a blimp, and the program can last as long as six months, largely beause of the unavailability of blimps for training.
Phil Engle, the manager of Teterboro Airport, said Goodyear has a letter of agreement with Teterboro to use its single blimp parking space when a Goodyear blimp is covering an event in the metropolitan area. Goodyear has already reserved Teterboro's space for the 1994 World Cup soccer games.
 
'They Attract a Crowd'
 Linden Airport can also service the large airships. "When the blimps are here, they attract a crowd," said Paul Dudley, the president of Linden Air Services Corporation. Generally, Linden also houses one blimp at a time.
Blimps are usually serviced by a full-time crew of about 25, which includes four pilots, a company representative and crewmen. Ground support vehicles include a bus transporting the crew, a mobile mooring mast and trailers that house maintenance shops. Generally in the fall, airships head south and west, preferring moderate temperatures to operate effectively.
Goodyear owns and operates its three blimps. Several other companies lease blimps from Airship International Limited; the rental fee for a new client averages $300,000 to $400,000 a month. A large airship can cost more than $6 million to build.
The newest blimp to take to the air is Gulf Oil's blue and orange airship, which was launched last June. Steve Rattner, manager of airship operations at Gulf, said the blimp has 97 miles of exterior wiring that produces signs of colored, animated graphics.
As for its schedule, Mr. Rattner said, "There are enough sporting events going on in this country to keep all eight large airships busy every day of the year."

HEADLINE: New Haven Symphony Marks Its Centennial With New Music

BYLINE: By VALERIE CRUICE

 BODY:
IN 1863, when Morris Steinert attempted to organize an orchestra in New Haven, the "woods were not full of musicians who could play upon orchestral instruments," he later recalled.
The first rehearsals were "simply frightful," he said, and generated such noises "as to frighten the horses which were kept in a livery stable next door, and which immediately signified their displeasure by violently kicking against their stalls in rhythm with the scraping of the fiddles, the windy tones of the flutes, the squeaky harmonics emitted from the yellow clarionets." 
 According to Mr. Steinert's "Reminiscences" from 1900, New Haven was the recipient of "a pandemonium of tones that has never been equaled in any cultural city of the globe."
Nevertheless in 1894 -- not long after the New York Philharmonic (1842), the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1881) and the Chicago Symphony (1891) were founded -- Mr. Steinert brought together 60 musicians as the New Haven Symphony.
In 100 years the New Haven Symphony has come a long way from frightening horses. On Jan. 21, the orchestra will perform at Carnegie Hall, where the clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, a Yale School of Music and Symphony alumnus, will be soloist in a concerto by Mozart.
 
A Bruch Concerto
 The orchestra begins its centennial celebration, however, on Tuesday at Woolsey Hall in New Haven with the guest soloist Itzhak Perlman, who will perform Max Bruch's Concerto No. 1 for Violin in G minor. The Bruch concerto was performed by the orchestra during its very first season. Stravinsky's "Greeting Prelude" and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 4 in F minor will also be on the program.
Michael Palmer, who was appointed the orchestra's eighth conductor in 1988, will be on the podium Tuesday. (Horacio William Parker, David Stanley Smith, Hugo Hortschak, Richard R. Donovan, Frank Brieff, Erich Kunzel and Murry Sidlin were the earlier conductors.)
What drew Mr. Palmer to New Haven?
"The New Haven Symphony has always been a well-established orchestra with a fine reputation," he said. "It had a solid reputation -- just to have survived as long as it has as well as it has."
 
Personality and Identity
 "What we have now," he continued, "is an orchestra that is well developed artistically and which continues to develop its personality and identity within the repertoire."
Mr. Palmer, who is 48 years old, described that personality as "very warm, communicative but flexible." He explained that the orchestra "can be lean, combined with a precision of ensemble."
Mr. Palmer said he hoped he had given the orchestra more focus. He has worked on what he calls "a unity of approach," to whatever style the musicians are playing. He said the approach results in "the way in which the orchestra enunciates the music and the way it projects the interpretation of that particular work that's being performed.
 
History of Premieres
 Mr. Palmer has a particular task in programming. "The New Haven Symphony has a history of commissioning new works," he said. "We have a responsibility to perform American music. We must keep pace with what is going on across the country."
In 1959 the orchestra performed the premiere of its first commissioned work through the William Inglis Morse trust for music, called "Fragments for the Song of Songs" by John La Montaine. Since that time, through the trust, the orchestra has commissioned and performed the premieres of 16 new compositions.
The tradition continues with a composition by Ezra Laderman, dean of the Yale School of Music, who has been commissioned to compose his eighth symphony for the 100th anniversary season. It will be performed on Jan. 18.
For the 1994-95 season, Jacob Druckman's Piano Concerto is to receive its premiere performance by Emanuel Ax. In the 1995-96 season, Martin Bresnick's Concerto Grosso will feature members of the orchestra. Both Mr. Druckman and Mr. Bresnick are on the faculty of the Yale School of Music.
Such ambitious promotion of contemporary compositions has earned the orchestra the ASCAP award for the New Music Programming in the regional orchestra category for 1980, 1985 and 1986.
 
Raising Eyebrows
 Some new works have raised a few eyebrows, said two of the orchestra's musicians, Sid Rhein, a bassist, and Bill D'Amato, a cellist, both of whom have been with the orchestra since the 1930's. They recalled one piece in particular: "We were scattered all over Woolsey Hall -- down in the basement, up in the balcony, three conductors, two pianos," said Mr. D'Amato, 77. "The looks we got were something like 'Are you kidding?' " Mr. Rhein, also 77, said that it was the most unusual concert he'd ever done, and that it was a "weird composition."
When it comes to guest soloists, however, the symphony has always attracted the best. "There have been no second-rate performers," said Mr. Rhein. Van Cliburn's first stop after becoming the first American pianist to win the Tchaikovsky prize in Moscow was New Haven in 1958. Other guest artists have included Artur Rubenstein, Glenn Gould, Mstislav Rostropovich, to name a few. The violin prodigy Midori played with the orchestra "when she was coming up," Mr. Rhein said.
Programs to reach young audiences have been held since 1932; currently the Symphony offers a six-concert series in Woolsey Hall for 7- to 12-year-olds. A series for preschoolers features exposure to small ensembles and then to the whole orchestra.
For grown-up patrons, in addition to its seven-concert subscription series (which offers informal discussions prior to each concert), the New Haven Symphony has a Saturday Night Pops Series, a Valley Pops Series held in Shelton, Concerts on the Green that are free, summer concerts held throughout the greater New Haven area, Picnic in the Park in June, and the Merrill Lynch Great Performers Series. A biannual competition for artists under the age of 26 (the Marcia Polayes National Young Violinist Competition) provides the winner with an honorarium and the chance to perform with the orchestra.
Despite the activity, musicians and conductor alike expressed the need for greater exposure for the orchestra through recordings and more concerts.
 
Pairs of Concerts
 Their first wish is to give more than one performance of a particular program. "It's frustrating to do only one concert," said Mr. Palmer. "Ultimately we would want to do pairs of concerts in our home hall. If you do pairs, the total number you have reached is going to be greater. In the long run it doesn't make sense economically to do one," he said.
"We spend a lot of money in rehearsal, then we give one concert for all that time," concurred Mr. Rhein.
Part of the problem is lack of financial support from corporations, a challenge arts organizations are facing nationally. While individual contributions have held steady and ticket sales are up, the outreach programs and other projects have dried up. "We've had to cut back," Mr. Palmer said. "The economic problems have affected the orchestra in terms of moving quickly. We've had to make changes in our approach."
But the conductor is upbeat about the future, and his orchestra is enthusiastic about him. "We're anticipating moving into the next century by bringing the sound of the orchestra to a wider region and the country -- to the nation. I'm happy in New Haven, there's a lot of potential here," Mr. Palmer said.
The New Haven Colony Historical Society (114 Whitney Avenue, New Haven; 562-4183) will commemorate the New Haven Symphony's centennial with "100 Years of Music" through Jan. 31. The free exhibition consists of photographs, programs, original scores and other memorabilia.

HEADLINE: New Activism Over Breast Cancer

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
WHEN Helen M. Ciaffa first felt a lump in her right breast, she ignored it. When a lesion on the breast began to bleed, she tried not to be concerned. When her arm started to enlarge, she bought long-sleeve blouses to cover the swelling.
"I was petrified, but I couldn't deal with it," explained the 72-year-old retired clerical worker from New Rochelle. "Then my husband looked at me one day and said, 'Helen, why don't you just jump out of the window, because you're already killing yourself this way.' " 
 Shortly after, Mrs. Ciaffa sought medical help, and she said recently that she is "coming along well," after 12 radiation treatments and continuing chemotherapy for cancer in her breast, hips and one leg.
From behind her tears, which she said come frequently since her illness, Mrs. Ciaffa had a message for other women. "Go to the doctor right away if you suspect something," she said, "so you don't end up like me."
Many breast-cancer victims, like Mrs. Ciaffa -- who say that early detection is the best defense against the disease -- are quick to point to the following statistics: this year alone, 182,000 women in the country will be diagnosed with the disease, and 46,000 will die from it. Moreover, they say, 1 in 9 women by age 85 will become a breast cancer victim.
 
Searching for Answers
 Armed with those statistics from the American Cancer Society -- and taking a cue from AIDS activists -- breast cancer survivors are pressing Washington to find answers to a disease that to date has no known cause or cure. In Westchester and nationwide, their grass-roots effort is being joined by doctors, husbands and children weary of the statistics and the toll that breast cancer takes on families.
Bette Slutsky, a 53-year-old Hebrew-school teacher from Ossining, is one of those survivors-turned-activists. She has become part of a battalion of victims wearing pink ribbons on their lapels and lobbying Congress and the White House for more money for breast cancer research.
"We've learned that we have to make noise to be heard," Mrs. Slutsky said. "Like the AIDS activists, we need answers too."
Mrs. Slutsky, the mother of two grown children, was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago and had a mastectomy. "I never considered myself a vain woman," she said. "But the first time I looked down and saw that my chest was gone, I was shocked. There was nothing there."
Like many other survivors of breast cancer, Mrs. Slutsky remembered the sense of despair she felt after losing part of her body and the pain of the treatment that followed. She recalled the hair loss from chemotherapy, the kerchiefs she wore during the hot summer months to cover her baldness and feelings of "Why me?"
She also remembered the first time she and her husband, Gary, made love after the surgery, and the bonds between them that grew stronger during the ensuing months, despite the disfigurement and worry about her health, she said.
Mrs. Slutsky is now a co-chairwoman of the local American Cancer Society's Reach to Recovery volunteer unit in White Plains, counseling other women who have been treated for the disease. Reach to Recovery began in 1952 in Manhattan and has since become an extensive network of volunteers who are active in most cancer society chapters worldwide. Doctors often request that the volunteers visit breast cancer patients in the hospital shortly after their surgery.
"We have to ban together to help each other through this," said Debbie Schreibman, the other co-chairwoman of the program and one of 90 Reach to Recovery volunteers working in the county. "I tell other victims that we cannot feel a sense of shame, because this disease is not our fault."
Earlier this month representatives of the Westchester division of the American Cancer Society and the National Breast Cancer Coalition presented Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from Harrison, with a petition bearing 8,002 signatures. The document, which was delivered to Ms. Lowey's White Plains office, calls on President Clinton to increase aid for breast-cancer research and to insure that his national health-care-reform plan provides access for all women to services for early detection, diagnosis and care of the disease.
 
'No One Knows Why'
 October has been designated Breast Cancer Awareness Month by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke and other officials nationwide. The local petition drive was part of a national effort to collect 2.6 million signatures -- representing the 1.6 million women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and the 1 million women who have the disease but do not yet know it. In all, 2.8 million signatures were gathered and presented to the President last Monday.
"The incidence of breast cancer has been rising since the 1940's, and no one knows why," Mrs. Lowey wrote to President Clinton recently. "There is no known cause or cure of breast cancer and unlike many other diseases, there is nothing a woman can do to prevent breast cancer. We cannot tolerate this any longer."
Ms. Lowey also told the President that the growing number of women in power is changing the face of politics, and that women will "no longer be bystanders to a debate that affects our very lives."
In Westchester, the incidence of breast cancer from 1984 through 1988, the most recent period for which statistics are available, was 98.4 cases for every 100,000 women, said Faith L. Schottenfeld, a spokeswoman for the State Health Department.
 
Free Legal Counsel
 Statewide, the incidence rate was 93.9 for every 100,000. And in Nassau County, the rate during that four-year period was 111.4. Ms. Schottenfeld said, however, that not just Nassau but other counties in the state had very high rates, with Monroe County of which Rochester is the county seat, for example, reporting 109.8 cases for 100,000 women.
In addition to the American Cancer Society's lobbying efforts, representatives of the legal profession in New York last year founded Judges and Lawyers Breast Cancer Alert to promote awareness of the disease and reach women who may lack access to breast cancer services. Its projects include a training program for volunteers who furnish pro bono legal services to breast cancer patients and their families, along with other outreach efforts.
"For too long, women have suffered in silence," said Judge Sondra Miller, an Appellate Division judge for the Second Division in Brooklyn and White Plains and a founding member of the organization. "Let's face it, if this were a disease that affects penises at the rate that it affects women's breasts, overnight the Pentagon would have been turned into a center for research."
But Dr. Martin G. Wertkin, a surgeon in Tarrytown and the immediate past president of the American Cancer Society's Westchester division, said that many doctors resent some of the advocates' focus on sexist issues surrounding breast cancer.
 
The Risk Factors
 "The anti-male aspect of this does the movement a disservice," he said. "Sure, some male doctors may be cold or seemingly unfeeling, but some female doctors are, too. Basically, what I have seen is an increased awareness and sensitivity among all doctors, and a trend in surgery toward more breast conservation compared with 20 years ago when there was one way to go -- a mastectomy, and that was the end of the discussion."
Dr. Bernard Bernhardt, an oncologist in New Rochelle, said there had been a "profound change from the radical 'mutilectomies' of the past to current surgical methods like lumpectomies that can preserve much of the breast."
Because the causes of breast cancer remain unknown, the State Health Department has published risk factors for the disease. They include:
*A family history of breast cancer, especially on the mother's side, and particularly when it occurred before menopause.
*High social and economic level, especially among Jewish women.
*Early onset of menstruation and late menopause.
*Late age at first childbearing.
*Urban or suburban residence.
*Obesity during post-menopausal years.
*Previous breast disease.
*Advancing age.
The department said that not all women who fit the profile get the disease, and conversely, many who have no known risk factors do contract it.
 
Free Examinations Offered
 Survival rates for women who find and treat breast cancer in its early stages approach 93 percent, compared with an overall 78 percent survival rate for the disease after five years, statistics show.
The County Department of Health is urging all women to take advantage of free breast cancer examinations and instruction in breast self-examination along with low-cost mammograms at several sites this month. (At present, doctors recommend that women have their first mammogram between 38 and 40. After 40, a mammogram is recommended every two years and after 50, yearly.)
Clinics will be held tomorrow at the Warner Library, 121 North Broadway in Tarrytown; Tuesday at the County Health Department's Mount Kisco District Office, 25 Moore Avenue in Mount Kisco; Wednesday at the Port Chester District Office, 11 Rye Ridge Road in Port Chester, and Thursday at the Greenburgh Neighborhood Health Center, 330 Tarrytown Road in Greenburgh.
The numbers to call for more information, to schedule an appointment (although walk-ins are accepted) or for other clinic dates are 593-5100 or 593-5094.
The American Cancer Society maintains a list of mammography clinics accredited by the American College of Radiology and clinics offering reduced-cost mammograms. For more information, the number to call is 949-4800.

THE Oneida Community in upstate New York was one of the most intriguing of the 40-odd utopian communities that sprang up in 19th-century America. Most such communities were short-lived experiments based loosely on the theories of the French socialist Charles Fourier. Oneida, in contrast, lasted over three decades, from 1848 to 1880, and was guided by the idiosyncratic religious views of its founder and leader, John Humphrey Noyes.
Controversial in its day and unduly neglected in ours, the Oneida Community is described skillfully by Spencer Klaw, who makes use of rare documents relating to the community to provide the first full account of it. Mr. Klaw, the author as well of "The New Brahmins: Scientific Life in America," delves into virtually every aspect of life at Oneida, including its most distinctive feature, a communal sexual arrangement known as complex marriage.
As Mr. Klaw explains it, the Vermont-born John Humphrey Noyes, having experienced a conversion during a religious revival in 1831, preached a Perfectionist brand of Christianity according to which he believed he could do no wrong. Noyes became the hub of a group of men and women, eventually numbering about 300, who saw monogamy as impure and group love as the means of ushering in the millennium. They thought God demanded variety in every facet of life, including sex. To overcome what they regarded as the sin of monogamy, they called for the continual change of partners under the supervision of Noyes.
Noyes took advantage of his position as sexual arbiter. Although he was married, his main gratification came from elsewhere. He indoctrinated his followers with the idea of "ascending fellowship," whereby community elders, considered especially godly, led younger believers heavenward by introducing them to what they saw as the holy pleasures of sex. Shortly after puberty, boys and girls were assigned a succession of older love partners. Teen-agers commonly slept with people in their 50's or 60's, though they got to choose partners their own age as time passed. Mr. Klaw cites sources that suggest Noyes often assigned himself 12- and 13-year-old girls.
All the men at Oneida were thought to be linked in divine marriage to all the women. Many community members had two or three different partners a week. To avoid unwanted pregnancies and to insure maximum pleasure for women, the Oneidans practiced coitus reservatus, or, as Noyes called it, male continence -- intercourse without ejaculation. Couples who drifted toward "idolatrous" (that is, monogamous) love or who broke the rule of male continence were chastised publicly at group discussion meetings. Child rearing was also a group matter. Couples could request to have a child, but children lived in separate quarters, apart from their parents, and were raised communally.
Mr. Klaw judiciously sorts out the rewards and the anxieties of these unusual living arrangements. Parents and children sometimes felt the strain of being separated from one another. He gives the affecting example of a mother who in her rare moments alone with her son asked, "Darling, do you love me?" The son recalled later: "I always melted. My marbles and blocks were forgotten. I would reach up and put my arms about her neck. I remember how tightly she held me and how long, as though she would never let me go."
Possessiveness and jealousy inevitably arose among competing sex partners. The problems surrounding complex marriage contributed to the community's demise. Young people, in particular, grew tired of being assigned older lovers they often found undesirable. "I wish," one woman lamented, "it were more popular than it is for the young to love the old, the handsome to love the less so, the educated the less educated, in short, that love might be truly free, permeating and pervading all hearts."
As Mr. Klaw points out, the surprising thing is not that Oneida failed but that it lasted as long as it did. Communal living apparently had its blessings, other than the mixed ones of sexual variety and group parenting. Music, painting and poetry were among the many cultural interests cultivated by the group. Games and sports enlivened everyday life. Work was looked on as a joyous, shared activity. Community leaders put the cooperative spirit to good economic use. They established a variety of businesses, the most successful of which, a tableware company, is today the world's largest manufacturer of stainless steel knives, forks and spoons.
MR. KLAW makes brief comparisons between Oneida and the free-love communities on Long Island and in Berlin Heights, Ohio, where monogamy was banned for secular rather than religious reasons. Such comparisons are suggestive. One wishes Mr. Klaw had expanded on them and had gone on to discuss the social contexts of Oneida in greater detail.
But he gives a vivid picture of Oneida and thus contributes a useful chapter to American cultural history. Not only does he recount shifting developments within the community, but he traces outside responses to it, ranging from the titillated curiosity of tourists who visited it to the moral outrage of puritanical ministers who tried to stamp it out. The latter attitude eventually sealed its fate. In late June 1879, John Humphrey Noyes secretly left for Canada under threats of prosecution by local clergymen. With its leader gone and internal disputes intensifying, the community abandoned complex marriage and emphasized its business interests.
Tourists still visit the imposing three-story brick mansion house at Oneida, where they contemplate fading photographs of men and women who once made an unconventional attempt at creating heaven on earth.

HEADLINE: Strong Sports Agency Key in Yankee Saga

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
In 1971, when the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority set out to build its huge entertainment complex in the swamps of East Rutherford, it had one overarching priority: luring the New York Yankees away from the Bronx.
Two decades later, after enticing New York's two professional football teams, a Long Island basketball team and a Denver hockey franchise to the Meadowlands complex, the sports authority is still without its ultimate prize, the nation's most valuable and storied franchise in sports. 
 How long things will remain that way is another matter.
Although Yankees fans are tempted to blame the team's owner, George M. Steinbrenner, for repeated hints that the franchise would abandon the Bronx when the team's lease expires in 2002, and its problems with crime and parking, New York's real enemy is New Jersey.
And while officials of the New Jersey sports empire say they have not made a specific proposal to Mr. Steinbrenner, the agency's history and its not-so-secret desire to have a major-league baseball team are largely responsible for the crusade that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is waging.
"I don't doubt they've made an offer for a moment," Mr. Cuomo said in an interview last week. "I haven't seen a document. I haven't seen the details. I can't say there's proof. But it's absolutely clear they've been making suggestions for a long time."
To keep the Yankees, Mr. Cuomo has proposed spending $150 million to improve Yankee Stadium, or to build a grandiose $530 million waterfront field (and garage) of dreams on the West Side.
But the plan was not well received by local community groups and some city officials. And yesterday, during a gubernatorial campaign debate, Gov. Jim Florio said of the Yankees: "If they leave the Bronx, they'll come to New Jersey. They're not going anywhere else."
Mr. Cuomo stepped into the Yankees sweepstakes as a surrogate for Mayor David N. Dinkins, who has been in the midst of a difficult re-election campaign. And he insists that despite his personal input, any offer to Mr. Steinbrenner must come from the city. In fact, since the spring, city officials have spent considerable time trying to satisfy Mr. Steinbrenner's complaints about parking, traffic, security and sanitation problems in the Bronx.
The Governor and the Mayor have reason to fret about what the city would lose if the Yankees decamped in New Jersey. Economically, the city Comptroller's office recently estimated that the Yankees generated $151 million in revenue in 1992. Psychically, losing the Yankees to New Jersey would constitute a blow on a scale with the California migration of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1958.
And politically, Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Cuomo would prefer to be known as the politicians who kept the Yankees from crossing the Hudson, rather than be remembered like Mayor Robert F. Wagner, who lost the Dodgers and the Giants baseball clubs.
Moreover, the bi-state romancing of the Yankees is part of a national fabric of municipalities trying to lure teams or keep the ones they have. Only a few years ago, Illinois had to fight hard to keep the Chicago White Sox from moving to Florida, ultimately building a new stadium. New stadiums have been built or are under construction in Baltimore, Cleveland and the Dallas area.
The New Jersey authority has had an official policy of seeking a baseball team since 1984. It sponsored and lost a referendum vote, 2 to 1, to build a $185 million, taxpayer-supported ball park in 1987, but has never publicly offered anything concrete to Mr. Steinbrenner. Pursuing the Yankees energized the state even before the authority began in 1971. "Our original financing was based on getting the Yankees," said Robert Mulcahy 3d, the authority president.
In fact, the possibility that the Yankees would depart for New Jersey was among the reasons that Mayor John V. Lindsay decided to renovate Yankee Stadium, which was done in 1974 and 1975, when Mr. Lindsay was out of office.
Richard Aurelio, a Deputy Mayor under Mr. Lindsay, recalled how Michael Burke, the ex-Yankees president, had received feelers from New Jersey and New Orleans. "He really wanted the city to fix up Yankee Stadium," Mr. Aurelio said, "because it had spent 25 or 30 million dollars to build Shea Stadium."
Theft of teams is a recurring theme in New York's perception of the authority's successful history. A few years ago, Mr. Mulcahy said he saw former Mayor Edward I. Koch in an elevator. Mr. Koch asked, "What are you going to steal next?"
And last month Vincent Tese, chairman of the state Urban Development Corporation, said, "They steal teams in the dead of night."
Theft, or not, here are four reasons for Mr. Cuomo to worry:
*The New York Giants football team departed Yankee Stadium for a new home named for itself in the Meadowlands in 1976.
*The New York Jets left behind an unsatisfactory lease with New York City and the swirling winds of a deteriorating Shea Stadium in 1984 to cohabit with the Giants in football-only Giants Stadium.
*The New York Nets basketball team left Long Island's Nassau Coliseum to play in the Meadowlands Arena in 1981.
*The New Jersey Devils, the former Colorado Rockies, started playing on the ice of Byrne Meadowlands Arena in 1982.
"We've never stolen any team," Mr. Mulcahy said. "Each team's problems were well-chronicled."
 
Fears of an Offer
Cozy Friendship Feeds Speculation
 There's been no darkness of night about the friendship between Mr. Steinbrenner and Jon Hanson, a member of the sports authority's board, and the state official most closely identified with bringing baseball to New Jersey.
"I've seen them regularly at '21' and the Columbus Club," Mr. Tese said.
Yes, Mr. Hanson said, he has dined with Mr. Steinbrenner. Yes, they have watched Mr. Steinbrenner's horses compete at the Meadowlands Race Track. Yes, they've been to football games together at Giants Stadium.
"Friends get together," Mr. Hanson, a real-estate developer, said recently. "I've been to restaurants with him and I've been to his house."
But if an offer has passed from Mr. Hanson to Mr. Steinbrenner, both have kept the secret very well.
"Having seen and observed them together, I can say that Jon has the confidence and respect of George Steinbrenner," said Peter Levine, a board member. "Jon's relationship to George is equal in importance to his relationship with the authority. Jon will play the key role."
Whether a formal, written proposal has been made may be irrelevant. Sites inside the Meadowlands and two nearby, north and south of the New Jersey Turnpike, are under consideration, as is another in Jersey City. All are well known to Mr. Steinbrenner.
Well known, too, are the fundamentals of a likely bid: a 48,000-seat stadium with the nostalgic appeal of Baltimore's new ball park at Camden Yards; at least 75 high-priced luxury boxes, and guarantees to reimburse Mr. Steinbrenner financially if attendance falls below 2.5 million.
"Is there a plan?" said Mr. Levine, who succeeded Mr. Hanson as chairman for two years. "Of course there is. Jon has been empowered since he was chairman to deliver proposals to George. And discussions with the Yankess have been ongoing. But we're totally pliable and flexible. The plan is an evolving formula which can be tailored to George. It's the real thing."
 
Loss of the Giants
The Courtship And the Conquest
 Despite Mr. Tese's contention that the authority does its work in the dark of the night, the experience of the New York Giants football team suggests otherwise, and points to at least one similarity to the Yankees' situation: the condition of Yankee Stadium. The Giants spent several years mulling a move out of Yankee Stadium, said Wellington Mara, who owns 50 percent of the team. "We'd stagnated there," he said. "There were so many obstructed-view seats. Our waiting list was growing. Late in the baseball season we didn't have a place to work out," because of the Yankees' penchant for being in the World Series.
Bids for the Giants came from Long Island, Connecticut, Westchester and New Jersey. One man, Mr. Mara said, wanted a revolving stadium "so that twice a game, everybody would be at the 50-yard line."
Finally, what cinched the move was the Meadowlands' proximity to New York City -- four miles west of the Lincoln Tunnel.
"All we asked was that the stadium be no less than 70,000," Mr. Mara said, "and no more than 80,000. They made a great effort to please us." They receive 15 percent of the revenues from luxury box rentals.
"We really have the same lease we had in Yankee Stadium, paying 15 percent of our gate receipts," he said, "only here we have a cut of the parking and concessions. Being here is even better than we expected."
 
Dreams of Expansion
How the Authority Shaped a Dynasty
 Mr. Mulcahy, a former chief of staff to Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, has run the authority since 1979 with quiet fervor and foresight that have made it one of the nation's most successful sports and entertainment complexes.
"I've tried to focus the role of the authority on ego, excitement and economic impact," he said, adding that a study found that the authority generates $1 billion in economic impact annually to the state.
In addition to football, racing, hockey and basketball, the Meadowlands complex is used for college football and basketball, the National Horse Show, the Ice Capades, and rock concerts. Next year, World Cup soccer games will be played in the stadium.
Also in the authority's domain are the Monmouth Race Track in Oceanport and the Atlantic City Convention Center, which is being expanded.
"The authority has epitomized New Jersey's renaissance and its ability to go head to head with New York City," said Assemblyman Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of Morristown. "It has a reputation for epitomizing what's good about New Jersey."
But all has not been perfect with the authority, particularly its recent financial health. Despite the authority's original goal of snaring a baseball team, horse racing was the cash cow, producing $49.6 million at its peak in 1977. But competition from casino gambling and other entertainment options ravaged racing's bottom line to the point where last year it produced only $14.3 million.
The gloomier financial picture led the authority to refinance its debt nearly two years ago, a move that also allowed for the construction of a new Atlantic City Convention Center and upgrading of Rutgers Stadium.
But the bond measure also, for the first time, obliged the state -- and its taxpayers -- to shoulder about one-third of the annual payments on the bonds issued in the authority's name.
Although the refinancing passed with broad bipartisan support, the vote occurred before Republicans took control of the Legislature.
"The outgoing legislative leaders basically committed the state budget for the next 20-25 years to backing the financial plan," Mr. Frelinghuysen said. "In 1992, we paid $12 million, and in 1993, we'll pay $18 million."
State Sen. Henry McNamara, a Franklin Lakes Republican and a critic of the refinancing, said: "The people voted down a stadium in 1987 because they didn't want to spend taxpayer money. Now they're paying to support the authority."
With the authority's finances revived, how easy would it be to bankroll a new stadium, whose cost is estimated at $250 million? Clearly, it cannot go to the voters, particularly after the rejection of the 1987 referendum, and not in the current climate of hypersensitivity to taxation.
Many financing techniques would be available to sell bonds backed by revenues from lotteries, hotel taxes, venture capital, luxury box sales or proceeds from the state's Casino Reinvestment Development Fund.
Despite all the concern from Governor Cuomo, Mr. Steinbrenner has not joined in the debate over where his team would go next. In a chance encounter at an East Side restaurant with a reporter last week, he refused to give any insight into his plans. Why aren't you talking, George?
"I'm in hiding," he said.
When will you talk?
"After I've seen New York's plan."
When will he decide? Perhaps after Election Day. Perhaps next year. He wouldn't say. But because the Yankees' lease expires in nine years, he has time -- but not much, if he wants to have a new stadium.
The authority's Mr. Levine said: "The bride knows the groom is wealthy and when she says yes, she'll receive the ring and we'll talk about a new address."

HEADLINE: Politics Mirrors Diversity's Drive In the Suburbs

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER with JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
For decades Westchester and Nassau Counties have flourished as places of escape. And just as people left behind the frenzied harshness of city life, they also turned their backs on Democratic politics. In this century, Westchester and Nassau have each selected only one Democratic county executive, and Westchester has never had a Democratic district attorney.
But all that could change soon. For the first time in years, both of these Republican strongholds face formidable Democratic challenges for the job of county executive, and Westchester has a tight race for district attorney.
 
Urban-Like Cynicism
 Those contests say as much about the changing character of the suburbs -- the growing ethnic and racial diversity, the faltering economies and a rising urban-like cynicism about politicians -- as they say about the character of the candidates. 
 "Republican strength in the suburbs can no longer be taken for granted just as Democratic strength in the city is no longer assured," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University.
In Westchester, Richard L. Brodsky, a bright, scrappy six-term Assemblyman, is challenging Andrew P. O'Rourke, the avuncular pragmatist who has run the county for 11 years. The campaign has been dominated by debate over the county's sluggish economy and the integrity of its government. In Nassau, Benjamin L. Zwirn, a blunt, sometimes volatile member of Nassau's Board of Supervisors, is attacking Thomas S. Gulotta, that county's executive for the last six years, for having mismanaged the fiscal house.
The challengers' prospects should not be overstated. Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Gulotta command strong loyalties, can boast of genuine successes, and have the ultimate political advantage: incumbency.
But one reason that Republicans can no longer sit back complacently is that the suburbs are not as homogeneous as they once were believed to be. The Cheeveresque myth of white Protestant gray-suited men who sip martinis before catching the 6:38 home to housewives in Bronxville has evolved into a more motley picture.
The suburbs of the 1990's are older, have many more commuting women and are not as lily white. By 1990, Nassau's white population had declined to 86.7 percent from 91.1 percent while Westchester's dipped to 79.5 percent from 84.2 percent, both in 1980, largely as a result of a doubling of the Hispanic population and a somewhat slower growth in the black population. Both minorities have long supported Democrats.
 
Mirroring a Pattern
 Even the white population is not what it used to be. That two Jewish candidates are challenging both county executives and a Jew is running for Westchester district attorney is a demographic milestone that mirrors, at least a generation later, the pattern in New York City of Jewish politicians supplanting Irish and Italian politicians who had supplanted Protestants.
"The suburbs of today are the urban neighborhoods of yesterday," said Kenneth T. Jackson, a history professor at Columbia University who wrote "Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States" (Oxford University).
The Republicans have also had to grapple with a halt to the ever growing affluence of both counties and the appearance of enclaves of poverty that have brought along crime, drug abuse, AIDS and other largely unfamiliar problems.
"The Republican Party's ticket to voters was the assurance that Nassau wouldn't be like New York," said Howard Scarrow, a political science professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. "When thousands of people moved from New York to Long Island after World War II, they often switched from Democrat to Republican because they didn't want to bring with them New York City and all of its problems. But with Long Island's situation today, that distinction may no longer be so clear."
Both Westchester and Nassau suffered in the recession that followed the 1987 stock market crash, and Nassau sustained an added blow by the shrinkage of the nation's defense industry. Executives who lost their good-as-gold jobs at I.B.M. and Grumman may be transferring much of their resentment to the Republicans.
 
Loss of Jobs
 "The Republican message of tough love may not be as appealing when you're out on the streets," Professor Jackson said.
A refrain of Mr. Brodsky is that Westchester has lost 40,000 jobs since 1989, a figure that Mr. O'Rourke attributes to a statewide recession that cost New York 622,000 jobs. Mr. O'Rourke chooses to emphasize Westchester's still relatively low unemployment rate of 5.7 percent.
Still, in Westchester and Nassau property values have declined, sales-tax collections have fallen, and the need to pay for rising mandated expenses like Medicaid have undercut the Republican promise to keep property taxes low.
Although Mr. O'Rourke has been able to weather the bad economic times without raising taxes in the last two years or making significant job cuts, his counterpart in Nassau has not been so fortunate. Mr. Gulotta had to cut 2,000 government jobs, the lifeblood of the Republicans' patronage machine, just to hold the deficit on the county's $1.07 billion general-fund budget at $119.9 million. Nassau's bonds are now rated BAA, at a little better than junk bonds, while Westchester has kept its AAA rating.
In both places, Republicans have been touched by corruption, belying the rectitude they have sometimes projected as a contrast to shady urban politics.
 
Revelations of Abuses
 In Nassau, a number of party officials in the 1970's and 1980's were found guilty of taking kickbacks. "They have abused the system," said Steve Sabbeth, chairman of the Nassau Democratic Party. "That could be hidden under the rug in good times, but when things become tougher, those abuses hit you between the eyes."
In Westchester, a state commission revealed in 1989 that concessionaires at the county-run Playland Amusement Park in Rye were asked to make $80,000 worth of contributions to the Republican Party. Mr. O'Rourke escaped direct blame, but some Democrats believe he may be hurt by disclosures this year that he recommended his live-in companion and others for jobs with county contractors. A grand jury has cleared him of any conflict-of-interest violations.
Nassau, with 1.3 million people, burgeoned after World War II as transplants from Brooklyn and Queens flocked there to snatch the American dream of a detached house in a safe, tranquil place. They went to villages like Levittown that sprang up overnight with Federal inducements like loans for veterans and subsidized highways.
Westchester, whose older towns had long been bedroom communities for New York City, surged yet again after the 1950's as major corporations like General Foods moved headquarters there along with thousands of executives and white-collar workers. Its population is now 875,000.
New migrants often arrived with a resentment of the liberal policies of the Democratic cities. Others linked up with the dominant Republicans, figuring such an alliance could be useful for obtaining zoning variances and other civic favors. In 1980, Ronald Reagan achieved higher pluralities on Long Island than almost anywhere else.
In Westchester and Nassau, this Republican electoral dominance was aided by party machines with roots in the governing charters both counties received in the 1930's. These charters tailored local governments to make sure the reigning party stayed in power, said Gerald Benjamin, local government director at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government.
 
Cracking G.O.P. Monolith
 Nassau's vaunted Republican machine maintained virtual one-party rule through an elaborate patronage apparatus that used government jobs and contracts to gain political contributions and woo voters. Weighted voting on the six-member Board of Supervisors, a system which has since been declared unconstitutional, essentially gave heavily Republican Hempstead a veto over all county legislation.
In Westchester, Mr. Benjamin said, the Republicans filled the district attorney's office with Republican prosecutors, making it virtually impossible for a Democrat to gain sufficient trial publicity to mount a race for district attorney. It is no accident that Michael G. Cherkasky, the Democrat challenging the Republican, Jeanine Pirro, for the district attorney's job held for 25 years by Carl A. Vergari, made his fame as a prosecutor in Manhattan.
But the Republican monolith has begun to crack. In 1989, a Democrat, Mr. Zwirn, became supervisor of the town of North Hempstead for the first time in 73 years. Last year the Republicans lost the county clerk's race and, in a far more worrisome sign, Bill Clinton became the first Democratic Presidential candidate to win Nassau since Lyndon B. Johnson.
In Westchester, Democrats slipped ahead of Republicans in party registration sometime in the 1980's and now have an edge of 181,360 to 157,774. The Republican ratio in Nassau is roughly 3 to 2.
As elsewhere, party labels in both counties have lost their magic and the power of a strong machine has been overwhelmed by the power of television advertising and polls.
"You don't need the organization of a party because you can create your own organization," Professor Scarrow said.
Mr. Gulotta has built an extensive campaign organization independent of the party, and Mr. O'Rourke is said to have something less than a close relationship with his party's chairman, Anthony J. Colavita.
Increasingly, said Lee M. Miringoff, director of Marist College's Institute of Public Opinion, suburbanites, like their city cousins, appear to be concerned with issues like health care that the Democrats have seized upon. Many Republicans, Mr. Brodsky said, disown their party's stance on abortion, approving of greater choice for women.
"They're reachable on issues I consider my issues," Mr. Brodsky said.
Perhaps the most important factor in tightening races this year, say Mr. Moss and Mr. Miringoff, is that incumbents seem to be more vulnerable everywhere. In New York City, the Democratic Mayor, David N. Dinkins, may be on the receiving end, but in the suburbs that mood hurts the Republicans.
"In the suburbs it's the mirror image, but for the same reason," Mr. Miringoff said.
 
LOCAL ELECTIONS: Assessing the Candidates and the Issues
 
WESTCHESTER COUNTY
 
The Candidates:
Andrew P. O'Rourke, 59, Republican, has been County Executive for 11 years. He was raised in Hell Kitchen in Manhattan in a family that received welfare. Mr. O'Rourke he has written two novels and he had been a government official for more than 25 years.
 
Richard L. Brodsky, 47, Democrat and a graduate of the Harvard Law School, has been an assemblyman for six terms and leads the Environmental Conservation Committee. He is a son of a steel engineer from Ardsley and is known in Albany for his quick mind and blunt manner.
 
The Issues:
Mr. Brodsky contends that Mr. O'Rourke is tired and has lost the imagination to revive the slumping economy. He has accused Mr. O'Rourke of running a corrupt administration. Mr. O'Rourke says Mr. Brodsky lacks the temperament to manage people and has called him a hack Albany politician. He faults Albany for taxes and programs that have hurt Westschester and says a loss of 40,000 jobs is part of a statewide recession.
 
NASSAU COUNTY
 
The Candidates:
Thomas S. Gulotta, 50, a Repulican, has been County Executive for six years. The son of a prominent Nassau political family, he has run successfully for office nine times. An impeccable dresser, he prides himself on understanding the suburban mentality.
 
Benjamin L. Zwirn, 42, defied expectations by twice winning the North Hempstead Supervisor race. Temperamental and aggressive, he has redefined what it means to be a suburban Democrat by strongly advocating fiscal restraint.
 
The Issues:
Mr. Zwirn says Mr. Gulotta has presided over the fiscal decline of the county government decline and faults him for high taxes. Mr. Gulotta's ties to the Republic patronage machine, he says, have prevented him from scaling down government. Mr. Gulotta says many economic problems were outside his control and calls Mr. Zwirn a tax-and-spend liberal Democrat.

HEADLINE: Campaign Stop: A periodic report on neighborhood reaction to the mayoral race. -- 4. St. Albans, Queens;
In St. Albans, Black Voters Express Faith in Dinkins, Wariness of Giuliani

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
When police stepped up patrols recently in St. Albans, Queens, Rodney Williams, a 20-year-old college student, was pleased, believing it would help reduce the selling of crack in the neighborhood.
But Mr. Williams, who in his limited free time likes to hang out on the corner with friends, soon had another perspective. "The guys who live around here, we all know each other, we talk," he said. "The cops say, 'Where do you live?' and 'You've got to get off this corner.' We have all lived here for years." 
 Mr. Williams, who lives with his parents and studies data processing at Queensborough Community College, believes his experience symbolizes the peculiar pressures facing the black middle class. Residents want a greater police presence, but know that blacks, in both tony and struggling neighborhoods, are more often targets of police harassment than whites. A desire for leadership sensitive to the raw intersection of race and class is one reason why many here say they plan to vote for the re-election of David N. Dinkins.
In this neighborhood, a bulwark of the black middle class for more than 30 years, people said they were galvanized by both the fear of Rudolph W. Giuliani's conservatism and their feeling that the Mayor has done the best job he can during bad times for big cities.
 
Dinkins's Empathy
 They are also motivated by racial pride and the feeling that Mr. Dinkins has tried to empathize with their concerns, even though some complain that his voice has been too muted. They said they knew that if the Mayor stood incognito on many street corners, he too would have trouble hailing a taxi because of his race.
Dozens were interviewed for this story; no one said they would vote for Mr. Giuliani. This is still very much Dinkins country, as it was in 1989 when almost all voters here flicked the lever next to this name.
Mr. Dinkins is counting on that kind of support. With a tight race forecast, the Mayor's backers in St. Albans intend to insure a strong turnout by knocking on doors, taking people to the polls and telling friends and others of the urgency of this election.
 
A Bastion of Black Progress
 Much like the election four years ago of the city's first black mayor, this community connotes black progress. Settled around the turn of the century by Irish and English immigrants, blacks began moving in after World War II. By the 1950's, most whites had left, leaving black people as key players in virtually every aspect of life in St. Albans.
Mr. Williams and his neighbors were interviewed in a roughly 19-block area of tidy brick homes and well-tended lawns defined by Baisley and Merrick Boulevards, Leslie Road and 180th Street. They concede that things have not dramatically improved since 99 percent of voters there went for Mr. Dinkins in 1989, but say the Mayor inherited a mess that will take years to make right.
"It's not his fault," said James McCarthy, a retired police detective who has lived across the street from Mr. Williams for 35 years. "This man would have to be a miracle worker to reverse all the decline. The country as a whole is in a downswing."
 
'Both Men Are Good Men'
 "Both men are good men," he said of the mayoral candidates. "Both would do a good job. But race is going to play a part. Naturally, being a black man, I want to see my own person in there.
"I would vote, though, for the person I think would do a better job," Mr. NcCarthy hastened to add. "Giuliani has been a crime fighter, but he doesn't have the political savvy or experience the Mayor has."
The level of education here is higher than the average for New York City or Queens, and household income exceeds the city average by over $15,000. Many people have lived here for more than 30 years. In the hush of one recent Indian summer afternoon, children played in the streets and a man in a Volvo talking on a cellular phone pulled into a nearby driveway.
Most of those interviewed said they believed that Mr. Dinkins kept the peace when Los Angeles exploded and contained the Crown Heights disturbances. They like the Beacon program, which operates schools as community centers. They also like the set-asides for women and minority contractors.
They say the crack problem that invaded St. Albans in the 80's has improved, part of a general decline in crime. At the time of the last mayoral election, this corner of the borough had become the center of the city's crack trade.
Most people still think that property taxes are too high, that unemployment has eased only a bit and that they need better transportation and recreational programs.
Yet these voters say they have faith that in his second term Mr. Dinkins will make things better. Some fear that Mr. Giuliani's election could undermine already fragile race relations and the delicate balance between haves and have-nots.
 
Police Rally Recalled
 In particular, they cite his plans to limit the amount of time homeless families can stay in shelters. They say he pushes law and order, but lacks social welfare programs that could attack crime at its roots. And they point worriedly to Mr. Giuliani's presence at a City Hall police rally last year at which some police officers directed racial slurs at Mr. Dinkins.
"Giuliani never did anything for us but go in front of a bunch of drunk cops who were calling the Mayor of this city names," said Thomas Graham, a 20-year-old cousin of Mr. Williams who lives across the street. "Is that how it's going to be if he becomes mayor?"
Marilyn Jones, who lives on the same block, said she would like to see more recreational centers for her 10-year-old son, Rahsaan. She also worries about crime. Mrs. Jones, who grew up in St. Albans, frets that she has to escort Rahsaan to school and that her car was stolen right in front of her home. Still, she supports Mr. Dinkins and said that some people active in her Catholic church, St. Catherine of Siena, planned to get out the vote for the Mayor.
"I think he's done the best he can do," Mrs. Jones said.
"A lot of the crime areas are in black neighborhoods and a lot of the crime victims are black," she added. "I don't think Giuliani would have as much heart as the Mayor in trying to correct problems."
Bill Scarborough, who has lived in St. Albans for 30 years and heads Community Board 12, said he and many people believe that Mr. Dinkins's color means he is held to a different standard by voters and journalists.
 
'People Want More Cops'
 "A lot of people are tremendously angry about the way he has been treated," Mr. Scarborough said. "There is a sense that has been building since this summer that the Mayor has been under siege by the media. There are people who say he should have done more for Queens, but they support him.
"Certainly, they think this community will fare worse under Giuliani. They think about his actions at the police rally at City Hall, his statement about pushing people out of shelters, his comments about the civilian review board.
"People want more cops," said Mr. Scarborough, the father of two daughters. "There is a large problem with crime, but everyone knows someone who has been subjected to police brutality, so it is a real issue. Giuliani's position on set-asides in city contracts worries people because black entrepreneurs know that for years they have been shut out. When Giuliani talks about the good old days, a lot of us think of the bad old days."
Solomon Goodrich, executive director of the Southern Queens Park Association, said he and supporters will have to "go to every street, every house," to turn such sentiments into votes.
"It's going to be a life-and-death struggle for the soul of New York," Mr. Goodrich said. "Not because Giuliani is white, but because he is a dyed-in-the-wool conservative. Those of us who are committed to the Mayor will have to work 10 times as hard. As well as pointing out our commitment, we have to point out the alternative."
Jerolyn Minter, a retired college professor who lives a block away from Mr. Graham, said she is a big fan of the Mayor's. She said that crime is down and she is an active participant in Increase the Peace, a group established by the Mayor dedicated to defusing confrontations. She said the Mayor took a beating from the press on Crown Heights.
 
Unfair Expectations
 "In no way can we condone the taking of a life," Mrs. Minter said of the Crown Heights disturbances, in which a rabbinical student was killed. "But the press focused in on that one incident and kept calling for increased investigations. My question is, what's behind that push?
"Any nonwhite person in an elective office is going to be expected to be a super person and to do in a shorter period of time things that were never done before," said Mrs. Minter, answering her own question. She has lived in St. Albans for 37 years and raised three sons. "I don't think we as a society allow our elected officials ample time to put through changes."
David V. Hodge, who owns the American Roots art gallery and trophy shop and is executive director of the St. Albans Chamber of Commerce, said he would not hesitate to vote for a Republican if there were a Republican President, because that relationship could enhance the city's fortunes. Mr. Hodge said that Mr. Dinkins has a strong supporter in President Clinton and that Mr. Giuliani lacks business experience.
"Race is no issue when everyone is working," said Mr. Hodge who has lived in St. Albans since 1954 and started his business in his mother's garage. "And race really won't matter in the voting booth. Anyone with any common sense knows who's the best candidate."

Pressure Mounts on Contributions

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The president of the National Association of State Treasurers says there is growing momentum for limiting the acceptance or soliciting of political contributions.
"I think there is going to be public pressure for people to not ask" for contributions, said Lucille Maurer, the State Treasurer of Maryland. 
 But she said she did not expect the association, which has established a task force to study this and other campaign topics, to take a specific position on the issue of accepting contributions from municipal bond underwriters and others who do business with state and local governments.
Instead, she said, public "pressure will be on, and treasurers will ultimately realize that if they accept and ask for contributions, that will give their opponents the opportunity to say, 'See, I don't accept them.' "
For Mrs. Maurer, who has been the Maryland treasurer since 1987, this may be a little easier to say than for many of her colleagues. She is one of the four state treasurers elected by the state legislature and she does not need to collect political contributions.
 
A Shift in Focus
 Yet this disengagement does not preclude her from saying that the public perception of impropriety created by the acceptance of contributions "presents a problem to me."
The focus has shifted to the recipients of contributions since the big Wall Street underwriters endorsed a moratorium on contributions two weeks ago and last week backed a voluntary ban on political contributions to state and local officials and candidates who could award them underwriting business.
Mrs. Maurer's comments, in an interview on Friday, came after her return from a meeting of the Western States Treasurers Association. At the meeting in San Diego, the association adopted a resolution that urges the national group to consider a ban on accepting political contributions as part of its broad look at campaign reform.
At the same meeting, the group also commended California's State Treasurer, Kathleen Brown, for her efforts at campaign finance reform, which included the decision to refuse political contributions from companies and individuals involved in the municipal bond business.
 
A 'Stronger Statement'
 Mrs. Maurer's views and the position taken by the Western group reflect how sentiment on contributions is moving. It does not mean that politicians will begin to refuse contributions across the board. But it shows that the appearance of impropriety, created by the acceptance of contributions from individuals and companies who get business from elected officials, is driving issuers of municipal bonds and underwriters toward positions that they probably would not have considered possible a few months ago.
As Mrs. Maurer noted, the position taken by the Western treasurers' group is a "stronger statement" than the one written in August in response to the proposed rule of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which is the self-regulating body for municipal dealers.
The board's proposal would ban contributions from municipal dealers that are made in an effort to win underwriting business. After some modifications, the rule is expected to go into effect early next year and will effectively make mandatory the voluntary ban endorsed last week by the Wall Street firms.
 
Disclosure Endorsed
 In response to the rule-making board's proposal, the National Association of State Treasurers endorsed disclosure of campaign contributions as "the basis for monitoring and regulating the relationship between elected public officials and the municipal securities industry."
The association also raised a long list of objections to the ban on political contributions, including conflicts with the First Amendment, problems with equal protection and vagueness.
But the recommendation of the Western group has now taken the treasurers into new territory. "In August this was an emerging rule," Mrs. Maurer said, "and here we are in October and things have moved rather rapidly."
The statement by the Western treasurers also points up another important issue: There are a lot of other problems in the municipal markets beyond political contributions. And as Milton Wells, the director of Federal operations of the National Association of State Treasurers noted, the focus on political contributions may be diverting attention from them.
These include fee splitting, conflicts of interest between financial advisers to an issuer and the bond underwriters who want the business, finders' fees and the use of consultants. Neither the rule-making board's rule nor the voluntary ban endorsed by the Wall Street firms directly addresses these problem areas.
 
Fears About Growth Prompt Bond Selloff
 The selloff on Thursday and Friday in the bond market has pushed the yield on the 30-year bond back to 5.98 percent, renewing the question of whether the rally at the long end of the bond market is over.
The market backed off quickly after the yield on the 30-year bond finally breached 6 percent in early September. But it faltered even faster after the yield was swept to a new 25-year low of 5.78 percent after the Labor Department reported on Oct. 15 that consumer prices were unchanged in September.
The selloff was caused by concern that the economy was picking up momentum in the second half of the year, and fears that the October report on consumer prices would rise as much as four-tenths of 1 percent, although much of that would be caused by seasonal adjustment factors rather than lasting price increases.
What seems to be clear, however, is that the basic picture of the economy is not changing. Growth may be faster, but just about anything would be faster than the 1.3 percent pace in the first half of the year.
 
G.D.P. Report on Thursday
 The first view of the second half of the year will come on Thursday, when the Commerce Department reports the initial reading for the gross domestic product in the third quarter. The market forecasts seem to average slightly less than 3 percent. The forecasts for the fourth quarter are higher, some up to 4 percent.
But even if the economy picks up, tax increases included in the President's deficit-reduction package begin to bite next year, and many economists said they expected growth to slow at the start of the year as a result.
So, there is still a chance for long-term rates to move lower in the months ahead, And, at worst, it appears that long-term interest rates will hold steady in a trading range that could be up to 6.25 percent and down to 5.75 percent.
What seems sure is that the uncertainty about the outlook will make for a lot of volatility. In the last 32 trading days, according to Matthew Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston Corporation, the price of the long bond has moved three-quarters of a point or more 12 times.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Networks Gain Riches From News Magazines

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
On Sunday, more Americans turn to "60 Minutes" than any other television show. By Monday, if they haven't had their fill of news magazines, they can turn to "Day One," ABC's newest entrant to the genre. And on Tuesday, there's more with "Dateline NBC"
So it goes throughout the week. Every day except Saturday there is a network news magazine to choose from: "Eye-to-Eye," "Now," "48 Hours," "20/20" and "Prime Time Live." Often indistinguishable from one another, each seeks a niche in an increasingly crowded field. 
 But the accelerating growth of these programs is not just a sign of a hearty appetite by television viewers. It is really a tale of the rich economics that news magazines can deliver for the networks that create them.
"It's like owning your own mint," said Richard Campbell, a professor of communications at the University of Michigan and the author of "60 Minutes and the News: A Mythology for Middle America" (University of Illinois Press, 1991). "There is no question the news magazine phenomenon is almost completely driven by economics and, only somewhat, by a desire to serve the public interest."
 
'Fussy Baby Syndrome'
 This season, eight hours a week of network prime-time programming are devoted to news magazines; two more programs are on the way. This does not include the so-called tabloid TV news magazines that appear on cable channels and respected programs like "Frontline" on PBS.
"I call it the 'fussy baby' syndrome," said Peter Tortorici, an executive vice president at CBS Entertainment. "Once you find what the viewing public likes -- just like finding out what the fussy baby likes to eat -- you keep feeding them that, again and again."
But it's more than viewer demand. News magazines, while not cheap to produce, are often more profitable in the long run than entertainment shows. In a magazine, the network pays to produce the program -- generally $500,000 an episode -- and recoups by selling commercials.
By contrast, the networks pay far higher licensing fees to the Hollywood production companies that make entertainment shows. These fees range from $500,000 to about $2 million an episode for, say, "Northern Exposure" or "Home Improvement."
 
Control Over Costs
 But far more important is the fact that the news magazines, unlike the entertainment shows, are owned by the networks that produce them. This gives the networks better control over costs. When an entertainment show is a hit, its producers typically come back to the network year after year, demanding higher licensing fees.
"With a news magazine show, we control our own destiny," Alan Wurtzel, a senior vice president for news magazines at ABC, said. "We own it. It's ours, and if successful we have a franchise that won't come back and ask for more money."
And when a steady viewing audience and these economics combine, news magazines can give a powerful bottom-line boost to a network.
"Broadcast networks are beginning to realize the enormous earnings potential of news magazines and they are running to them," said Forrest Sawyer, the anchor of ABC's "Day One" news magazine, said. "Even though there are high expenses in starting one of these shows, once you find an audience and people stay, it's a tremendous franchise -- it keeps going like the Energizer rabbit."
 
Legendary Success
 The economic success of "60 Minutes," now in its 25th year, is the stuff of legend. It is the most lucrative program in network history, having made more than $1 billion for CBS. The program generates $50 million to $70 million a year, and in some years has accounted for as much as half of CBS's entire broadcast revenues.
"All of television looked at the enormous success of '60 Minutes' and decided to clone it," said Don Hewitt, the executive producer of the program. "But they're not trying to clone the broadcast quality, just the profit-and-loss statement."
Adding to the rosy economics is the ability of network news operations to recycle their magazines -- repeating segments two or three times a year. The networks also make more money by repackaging the programs and selling them overseas or to cable stations. For instance, "60 Minutes" runs 52 weeks a year, but produces programs for only 36 weeks and recycles the rest, Mr. Hewitt said.
Moreover, CBS airs "60 Minutes" segments on Australian, English and European news magazines. ABC's "20/20" has repackaged some programs for the Discovery Channel on cable. Now that ABC and NBC are starting new cable channels, "they need programs as a way of creating slots to sell ads," Mr. Campbell said.
"Once you own the material, it can work for you," Steve Friedman, a former executive in charge of "Dateline NBC," said. "You can recycle it. You can re-package it in another format."
Magazines also give the networks a way to amortize the costs of news operations and underwrite a stable of producers and correspondents.
"There is no question that the profitability of news magazines helps pay for the rest of the news division and helps the viability of the news operation," said Andrew Heyward, the executive producer of CBS's "Eye-to-Eye with Connie Chung."
The magazines take advantage of the networks' resources around the world. For instance, in a crisis in Russia, a magazine can televise a discussion with a network correspondent there at a marginal additional cost.
News magazines have also displayed a remarkable ability to outlast their entertainment competition. "20/20" has already reached its 15th year, compared with seven years for popular entertainment shows like "The Cosby Show."
No news magazine opened to more ridicule, perhaps, than ABC's "Prime Time Live," for questionable episodes like a live broadcast of a dying tree. But the shows it initially competed against -- "L.A. Law" and "Knot's Landing" -- have faded, while "Prime Time Live" is now a ratings hit. Similarly, "20/20" had trouble initially against "Hill Street Blues."
Yet those responsible for the magazines say there are limitations. Many say there is a dearth of correspondents and producers skilled at working in the longer format of news magazines.
"Like anything else, there are diminishing returns when there are too many," said Mr. Friedman of NBC. "The downside right now is that too many magazines are doing the same stories."
Added Mr. Tortorici of CBS: "Looking at these shows is like looking at real estate in the late 1980's. The market is wild and this might be the time to sell. I think that's the case with news magazines, and that we've already seen the best of their days."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Ethnic Shifts in Electorate Play Part in the Mayoral Riddle of Who Will Win

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
How can David N. Dinkins possibly win again when his margin over Rudolph W. Giuliani four years ago was less than 50,000 votes and when public opinion polls suggest that Hispanic and white liberal Dinkins voters are defecting?
The most tantalizing mathematical riddle of the New York City mayoral campaign might be answered, in part, by changes in the city's complexion: the proportion of older whites has shrunk; the share of black and Hispanic registered voters appears to have climbed. 
 Just how big a factor this will be remains to be seen. While blacks overwhelmingly favor Mr. Dinkins and many older whites prefer Mr. Giuliani, according to the polls, the key to any election is not only who is registered to vote but also who among the nearly 3.3 million registered voters turns out.
"It's not the kind of thing that creates landslides," Dr. Lee M. Miringoff of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion said of Mr. Dinkins's possible demographic edge among registered voters. "But in a close race, it could be significant by compensating to some degree for the people who voted for Dinkins in 1989 and who now say they're voting for Giuliani."
The Dinkins and Giuliani camps differ not only about how much the electorate has changed since 1989 but also about how much it matters.
"I disagree with the basic premise that the ball game is going to be determined by white flight, if there is such a thing, and by an increase in minority registration," said Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader and a Giuliani adviser. "The election will be determined by voter turnout, and in terms of intensity Giuliani has it over Dinkins this year."
Strategy aside, Dinkins supporters say the apparent population shift gives the Mayor some of the wiggle room he needs to compensate for expected Democratic defections to Mr. Giuliani.
"If you conclude that no one who voted for Giuliani the last time is voting for Dinkins," said Norman Adler, a Democratic political consultant, "Giuliani still has to offset the outmigration among older whites and a voter registration effort that was conducted in most of the city, but with minorities the bulk of those registered."
Registration drives conducted in conjunction with the Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns laid the foundation for Mr. Dinkins's victory four years ago. Gains since then have been less dramatic. But Dr. Miringoff agreed that despite some pockets like the Upper East Side of Manhattan where Republicans aggressively recruited, voters registered within the last year or so have been disproportionately young, black and Hispanic. In polls conducted by the Marist Institute this fall, Mr. Dinkins was leading slightly among people who said they had signed up to vote within the last year.
 
Calculating Defections
 Juggling several variables in what he acknowledges is a very rough calculation, Mr. Adler concludes that for Mr. Giuliani to win, 65,000 voters would have to abandon Mr. Dinkins.
Few analysts dispute that the city is more diverse than ever before. But no one knows precisely how much New York's population has shifted since the late 1980's. Population usually changes more rapidly than the electorate since children and recent immigrants are ineligible to vote. Many Hispanic New Yorkers are not yet citizens, and nearly half the city's native-born black residents are too young. It is also unclear to what degree a voter's economic and social condition can command greater claim on political loyalties than either ethnicity or race.
Extrapolating from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, Terry Rosenberg, who directs the population studies unit of the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit research and advocacy group for the poor, estimates that in 1988, 52 percent of the city's adult population age 18 and older was non-Hispanic white, 20 percent was black and 22 percent was of Hispanic heritage. Four years later, she found, the proportion of whites had declined to 47 percent while blacks had increased to 24 percent. That the Hispanic share did not also rise she attributed to probable sampling error.
Relying on census results and a survey of individual surnames, Mark Lapidus, a researcher for the Dinkins campaign, reported a similar shift among registered voters -- a universe that seesawed from about 3,180,000 in 1989 to below 3 million two years later and then rebounded to 3,297,000 at last count when the rolls closed earlier this month.
 
Declining Number of Whites
 The proportion of whites among the potential voters dipped from 56 percent to about 53 percent, Mr. Lapidus estimates, while the proportion of blacks inched up from about 28 percent to 29 percent.
During the 1980's the number of white New Yorkers declined by 540,000, according to the 1990 census. If the decline continued at the same rate, the city's white population could have decreased by more than 200,000 in the last four years alone.
A study by Prof. John H. Mollenkopf of the City University of New York Graduate Center, found that the heaviest defections of the normally Democratic vote during the 1989 general election was in Jewish and white Catholic neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens.
"It appears that Democratic registration has continued to shift toward the black and Latino parts of New York City," he writes in "New York City in the 1980's: A Social, Economic and Political Atlas" (Simon & Schuster).
"This will favor Mayor Dinkins, although the larger issues of the relative turnout among various groups and which candidate these groups favor will ultimately determine the outcome of the 1993 elections."

HEADLINE: Is the Economy Strengthening? White House Officials, Cautiously, Say Yes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
After puzzling for months over why lower interest rates have not produced faster growth, Clinton Administration officials say they are now confident that the economy has turned the corner and is finally on a path of steady recovery.
News this month that showed housing construction finally picking up, business investment strong and consumer spending humming along has convinced President Clinton's economic team that it can shelve new proposals for stimulating the economy. 
 "The anticipated pickup in growth is occurring," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
 
Cautious Crowing
 Reaching that conclusion -- which is contested by some skeptical economists -- has important consequences for the Administration, both in terms of economic policy and in planning for the 1996 campaign. But this is one piece of good news that the President is being very cautious about spreading.
But unemployment remains relatively high, at 6.7 percent, even as the economy revs up. So even though Mr. Clinton and his advisers contend that the economy is on a respectable 3 percent growth path, aides say the President is reluctant to crow about it for fear that he will sound out of touch with millions of Americans who are unemployed or fear they could receive pink slips this month or next.
President George Bush made that mistake during last year's campaign, Mr. Clinton's advisers remember, and they do not want their man to repeat it.
"There's a real dilemma here," said Gene Sperling, an assistant to the President for economic policy. "The economy is starting to move in the right direction. We think it's good to tell people that, because it helps increase confidence, but when so many people and communities are still hurting, you also don't want to sound out of touch with their plight."
 
Cautious Note
 In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Mr. Clinton sounded a cautiously upbeat note.
"After a long struggle, we are finally seeing signs of hope in our economy," he said. "We have moved to significantly lower our Federal deficit. And now we have the lowest interest rates in 30 years. That's bringing back business investment, housing starts, purchases of expensive capital equipment."
The President added, "We've still got a long way to go," with the nation needing "more jobs that pay living wages."
The stream of good economic news is causing the Administration to rethink some policies. It has quietly shelved proposals for a new stimulus program that would not have required additional spending. One idea had been to speed up military spending that had already been authorized.
 
Trouble in California
 Despite its growing confidence, the Administration is pushing ahead with plans to help California's troubled economy. That state's residents constantly remind Mr. Clinton that they do not think he has done enough to end California's recession and cut its 9.4 percent unemployment rate, and he does not need reminding about California's clout in the 1996 elections.
Early next year the Administration plans to announce a multibillion-dollar program to retrain laid-off workers. And the Administration will certainly promote this as a program that was developed with California in mind, since cuts in Pentagon spending there have devastated many communities. But Mr. Clinton's economic team does not want to appear as if they are favoring California.
With the economy on surer footing in recent weeks, some Administration officials even see clear sailing through 1996, which in theory would give the President strong momentum in that year's campaign. "It looks like we're on the road to growth of 2.5 to 3 percent a year," said one senior Administration economist. "Inflation should remain low. Unemployment is coming down. We're reducing the deficit. That should give us a good record to run on."
 
Is It a Real Recovery?
 Some within the Administration are already thinking of ways to translate statistics about the recovery into campaign slogans for 1996. Ms. Tyson is quick to boast that more private-sector jobs have been created in Mr. Clinton's first nine months in office than in George Bush's four years.
But many outside economists say it is far too early for the Administration to declare victory. "They're right -- things have picked up over the past month or two, but this has happened at least five times since the recession ended in March of 1991," said Lawrence Chimerine, a senior economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm. "The consensus would be that we've turned the corner, and then things would slow down again."
What has made the Administration far more confident this time around was this month's news that housing starts rose 2.8 percent in September, to their highest level in more than three years. Officials have been pleased that two other areas sensitive to low interest rates -- business investment in equipment and spending on big-ticket items like cars -- have risen strongly, but they were dismayed that housing construction remained flat, despite the lowest long-term interest rates in more than 20 years.
"Housing starts was the piece of the puzzle that was worrying us," said Alan Blinder, a White House economist. "A low-interest-rate strategy to boost the economy fires on three engines. The other two engines have been firing, and now it's good to see housing starts starting to fire up the economy, too."
Mr. Clinton's deficit reduction plan was instrumental in pushing down long-term interest rates, Administration officials say, although many economists argue that the Federal Reserve's success in holding down inflation deserves more credit for the fall in rates. But Mr. Blinder said it would be unwise for the Administration to declare that a strong recovery was here to stay, recognizing that during the current saw-toothed recovery there were numerous false springs and dips.
Indeed, Mr. Clinton's economic team experienced a sobering winter and spring because growth plunged from a robust 5.7 percent in the fall of 1993 -- Mr. Bush's last quarter in office -- to an anemic eight-tenths of 1 percent last winter and 1.9 percent in the spring quarter.
 
Split Interpretations
 In the view of Republicans, there was a simple reason for the drop: American consumers stopped spending because they feared that President Clinton would raise taxes.
"Under President Bush, we had growth of close to 4 percent last year," said John Taylor, a Stanford University professor who was an economic adviser to Mr. Bush. "Then the economy sagged early this year. There were concerns that we would get a tax increase and we did."
Mr. Taylor said the 3 percent growth that the Administration predicted was not terribly impressive. But Administration officials responded that 3 percent growth would be very respectable when exports are weak because of sluggish economies in Europe and Japan and when the deficit-reduction plan is starting to bite.
In an argument over interpreting economic history, Ms. Tyson says the slowdown in the first quarter was inevitable because President Bush sped up military spending late last year to stimulate output, a decision that made a huge drop in such production inevitable early this year. In addition, the Bush Administration reduced tax withholding in the second half of 1992 to speed growth, and that held down growth last spring because it meant lower-than-normal tax refunds.
Now that these bumps are past, the Administration sees growth of around 3 percent in the second half of this year and for all of next year.
"Our reading of the economy suggests a path of low inflation, low interest rates and steady recovery," Ms. Tyson said.

HEADLINE: Chicago Gangs, Extending Turf, Turn to Politics

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 24

 BODY:
On a gray afternoon not long ago, Lu Palmer stood in the city's downtown business district watching thousands of young blacks march past, circle City Hall and stall traffic for blocks. They were ostensibly protesting Chicago's troubled school system, but a few also carried signs declaring it was time for another black mayor.
The marchers were as disciplined as an army. Or a street gang. 
 Mr. Palmer, at 71 a veteran of Chicago's black politics, said the scene reminded him of the 1960's and filled him with hope; maybe black Chicago was back on the move, with young lions leading the way.
 
Official View
 Mayor Richard M. Daley saw something else as he watched the same legions, the same jam of traffic and commerce down Clark Street as rush hour began.
The demonstration, he said, was infested with gang members trying to cloak their real agenda in political protest and the rhetoric of empowerment. He doubted they were interested in voting rights or improving education.
Whatever their motivations or affiliations, thousands of young black people have trooped into the Loop on at least three occasions since summer, promising to turn protest into votes and numbers into political power. And the people of Chicago -- especially their elected officials -- have taken notice.
"These guys have extraordinary numbers," Mr. Palmer said. "That's making a lot of politicians, black and white, nervous." Whatever their other flaws, politicians can count, he said.
While not all the marchers were gang members, many were. And both their presence and organizational discipline suggested that the city's black gangs -- or "street organizations" as they prefer to be known -- are moving into politics, just as white ethnic street gangs did generations before them.
 
Voter Registration
 In the last few months, gang members have registered new voters, marched in protests about health care and the school system, conducted voter education classes, backed candidates in school council elections and courted politicians in a failed campaign to win parole for a gang leader who has been in prison for 20 years for murder.
Autry Harrison, the director of a gang intervention program for the Chicago Boys and Girls Club, said: "If you can control that anger that so many kids have, and get young adults focused, then they can be a powerful force for something positive. If we can make the kids politically aware, what's wrong with that? It's much better than them killing each other or innocent people."
While politicizing gangs has been talked about here since at least the 1960's, the idea now appears to be spreading to other cities, including Los Angeles, Cleveland and Kansas City.
In a sign that it may be taking root, political empowerment was a main topic this weekend at the fourth national United in/for Peace Summit, a meeting of gang members that is scheduled to end here on Monday.
But as gangs talk of exchanging bullets for ballots, many people wonder if their cry is sincere or a sinister camouflage for a criminal agenda.
 
'Peace Is Crucial'
 It is probably too early to tell whether Mr. Palmer is right to be hopeful or Mayor Daley's suspicions are justified. But Carl Upchurch, an organizer of a gang peace effort known as the National Urban Peace and Justice Movement, said one thing was clear: "There's no question we're trying to get political power so we can enjoy economic power in this society," he said. "No one is trying to hide that."
Until the fighting in the inner city over drugs and turf and pride is stopped, Mr. Upchurch said, talk of political empowerment will amount to little more than rhetoric. "Peace," he said, "is crucial. Otherwise, nothing else will happen."
Most news reports here of the gang meeting have been negative, and Mayor Daley, Representative Mel Reynolds, aldermen and local organizers have called the peace effort a joke because the gangs have done nothing to stop their 24-hour-a-day drug business.
But the meeting and peace movement have also drawn a number of prominent black politicians and religious leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Eugene Sawyer, who succeeded Harold Washington as Mayor.
Today the participants gathered at the mosque in Chicago, where Louis Farrakhan, the minister of the Nation of Islam, and Mr. Chavis embraced. Mr. Farrakhan told the audience: "We've had enough of violence. We've had enough of crime."
 
Defending Meeting
 Gang members and neighborhood organizers from Ohio, Pennsylvania and California attended the gang meeting, but most were from Chicago, which drew several local officials.
Alderman Allan Streeter, who is running for Mr. Reynolds seat in Congress, spoke at the meeting about political empowerment. In an interview before his speech, he defended his decision to speak at the meeting, saying: "These young people are not aliens from outer space; they are our sons and daughters. The Daley administration is afraid of these young people who are mobilizing into a political force. It should be."
One organization at the forefront of harnessing the potential power of Chicago's street gangs is 21st Century V.O.T.E, a group that the police say has close ties with the state's largest gang, the Gangster Disciples.
The chairman of the group, Dwayne Harris, a 26-year-old former high school football star, denies any ties with the gang. He said his group had helped to register thousands of voters, including many who were probably gang members. And he said the group was also entering into "negotiations" with Arab and Korean merchants about economic development in Chicago's black neighborhoods.
"Everybody is quick to label us a lost generation," Mr. Harris said. "Well, we're finding ourselves now."
Street gangs have haunted Chicago for generations, and have been used and abused by politicians of many stripes. The Democratic machine used them for years to keep independent candidates at bay. And when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. came to Chicago in 1966 to battle slum lords and segregated public schools, he enlisted gang members in his cause, preaching nonviolence and voter registration.
 
Recalling King's Effort
 According to a new book about Dr. King's Chicago campaign, "Northern Protest" (Harvard University Press) by James R. Ralph Jr., Dr. King recognized that the gangs represented some of the "strongest grass-roots organizations in the ghetto."
But Dr. King's larger hope for the gangs was to put a stop to their civil warfare. His efforts received mostly negative attention, and he left Chicago with few real successes.
Alderwoman Dorothy Tillman called the new movement to politicize gang members a scam and a front for the Gangster Disciples. Her announced opponent in the 1995 City Council elections is Wallace Bradley, a former member of the Gangster Disciples.
"Dope is still on the corner," Ms. Tillman said. "They haven't told people to stop selling. The kids are being used. They're not really being educated about politics or the system. If that was happening, I'd support it. Right now, these young brothers and sisters are told when to go to demonstrations, what to say, what to do. That's not politics. That's brain washing. That's intimidation."
Far from the gang meeting, two teen-age members of the Gangster Disciples stood in a parking lot, smoking cigarettes. They said the gang had a new code of conduct that made school mandatory because, as one boy put it, "they don't want no illiterate people."
He said that several weeks ago the members were asked to attend a protest march in the Loop to help "get the little kids back in school."
"I didn't go down to march," he said. "I didn't want to miss school. I'm going to get my education and get out of here."

HEADLINE: After Talks, Haitian Aides Hope for a Break in the Impasse

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 24

 BODY:
With two American warships visible less than a mile offshore to help enforce an economic embargo against Haiti, Haitian officials expressed cautious optimism today that the army and the Prime Minister would break a stalemate that is blocking the return of the country's ousted President.
Participants in negotiations held on Saturday between Prime Minister Robert Malval and the head of the Haitian armed forces, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, said the issue of amnesty for military officers remained a stumbling block. The two sides plan to resume the talks on Monday. 
 "They don't have an alternative, but we fear these might be yet dilatory tactics," said a senior aide to Mr. Malval, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "From our side we will make a good-faith effort to test them."
A group of Haitian legislators outlined an 11-point proposal on Saturday in the hope of resolving the crisis that has gripped Haiti since security forces refused to let foreign troops dock here two weeks ago. The troops were to pave the way for the reinstatement of Haiti's first democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was deposed in a military coup in September 1991.
A senior diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had decided to keep a minimum of two warships for the next few days near the Port-au-Prince harbor, within Haiti's territorial limits. The goal, he said, was to turn up the pressure on General Cedras to abide by an agreement that he signed in July to let Father Aristide return to power by Oct. 30.
 
Threat of Wider Embargo
 The United Nations has threatened to widen an embargo on fuel and weapons for Haiti to all commercial goods unless General Cedras complies with that agreement, which was signed on Governors Island in New York.
But Haitian lawmakers and other officials said they doubted that Father Aristide could be reinstated by the deadline.
"Aristide is definitely not coming back by Saturday," a Malval aide familiar with the talks said. "It's just impossible to do what is needed in one week."
While Father Aristide has issued an amnesty for the army high command by executive order, lawmakers close to the military said the command was insisting on an act of Parliament to insure that the order would be binding.
Facing the threat of complete economic isolation, a group of Haitian lawmakers proposed Saturday the Parliament simultaneously approve laws separating the police from the army and guaranteeing broad amnesty for officers involved in the 1991 coup.
 
Army and Police Mingle
 Haiti's police and army are mingled to such an extent that the Port-au-Prince police chief, Lieut. Col. Joseph Michel Francois, controls much of the country's heavy weaponry and is considered the most powerful officer in the country.
Mr. Malval is acting as Father Aristide's Prime Minister under the terms of the accord signed in July. If he and General Cedras agree Monday on a plan of action, lawmakers hope to start meeting on Tuesday and to vote on the two measures by Wednesday.
Under the legislators' proposal, the Chamber of Deputies would discuss one law while the Senate was debating the other; each law would then pass to the other chamber, and lawmakers would finally vote on both issues at the same time.
Supporters of Father Aristide want the lawmakers to ratify the law separating the police from the army first, and then take up the law that would guarantee that General Cedras and the soldiers would not be prosecuted.
 
Aristide Wary of Lawmakers
 Father Aristide is wary of the intentions of many of the lawmakers, who were elected on Jan. 18 in military-sponsored voting that was declared illegal by the United Nations. The legislators, meanwhile, have asked Mr. Malval to enlarge his Government to include more pro-military political parties.
[At a news conference in Braintree, Mass., Father Aristide called for the immediate removal of the military leaders who ousted him in 1991. "By the light of the accord we demand their departure," he said.
[ The exiled leader appeared to balk at suggestions that General Cedras's meeting with officials of the Government was a positive sign. "We heard something like that on July 3 on Governors Island," Father Aristide said."]
Diplomats here in Port-au-Prince said they generally supported the lawmakers' proposal because it was in agreement with the accord.
"I don't think we're there yet," Eric Falt, a United Nations spokesman here, said of the legislative proposal. "It's an important first step which gets things moving in the right direction again. It's a Haitian solution, which already involves a large chunk of the players."
Asked if the parliamentary proposal was just another stalling tactic by the military leaders, Dante Caputo, the United Nations special envoy here, replied: "We will see. If it does not become a reality, sanctions will continue."
 
8 Lawmakers Fear to Return
 Questions remain even on whether the Haitian Parliament can get the quorum needed to pass any laws. Four senators and four deputies aligned with Father Aristide are now in the United States and are said to be afraid to return to Haiti because of the disappearance of one of their colleagues here last week.
"They won't gather until they get some security for themselves," a Western diplomat said. "That is the No. 1 obstacle. The underlying problem is establishing security so people can go and do their job. We've had a pretty bad week of terrorism here."
Under the legislators' proposal, once the assembly passed the two measures, General Cedras and Colonel Francois would resign, as required by the accord.
If the two military leaders stepped down, the next move would be for Father Aristide to appoint new commanders and to return to Haiti, which would lead to a lifting of sanctions and open the way for foreign aid.
Although shooting could be heard on Saturday in a middle-class neighborhood, the streets of the capital were calm today. But attaches, as paramilitary police auxiliaries are known, searched cars heading downtown or on roads leading to the suburbs.

Losing Jobs and Hope In 'The Great Depression'

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Experiences burned into the memories of those who endured America's toughest times are at the heart of "The Great Depression," a gritty seven-hour documentary that begins tonight on PBS. The producers, led by Henry E. Hampton ("Eyes on the Prize"), also make effective use of strong black-and-white newsreel clips from the 1920's and 30's, zesty folk songs and an intelligent narration, but it is the memories that give this history its punch and drive.
The first hour, "A Job at Ford's," focuses on the automobile company that drew tens of thousands of European immigrants, Mexicans and Southern blacks to Detroit after World War I to produce the Model T, then the most popular car in the world. 
 Remarkable overhead shots of the robotic assembly line are accompanied by the refrain of a protest song of the period: "Hurry, hurry, hurry/ Production rush is on." Douglas Fraser, the United Automobile Workers leader, who started in the factory, recalls, "The job controls you."
Henry Ford is presented as a control freak who tried to inflict a horse-and-buggy innocence on workers even while his product and methods of production were making his dream world obsolete. This paternalistic authoritarian, who offered high pay ($5 an hour) and other benefits to those who went uncomplainingly about their jobs, cracked down mercilessly on anyone deemed to be a troublemaker.
As former Ford workers and their children recall painfully, the good days at Ford ended after the 1929 stock market crash. Now the refrain became "Soo-oo-oop, soo-oo-oop/ They give me a bowl of soup." By 1931 people were starving. (There were bright spots: Ford made $30 million in 1930.) Jobless workers in their ethnic enclaves shared the little they had; many Mexicans went back home.
Particular attention is paid to black workers, not with any implication of racism either among employers or employees but by way of drawing belated attention to their considerable presence at Ford's big River Rouge plant. By 1931 Detroit, like other cities, was staggering under the burden of its unemployed, black and white, for whom there seemed to be no hope. A woman, one of eight children of a jobless worker, sums up the general despair: "I felt we weren't going to make it." President Herbert Hoover is shown delivering a passionless Thanksgiving Day speech in the bleak year of 1931, expressing faith that the nation's spiritual life would be enriched by adversity.
As the narrator notes, there was no national relief or unemployment insurance for the laid-off workers and their families, and the scenes of demonstrations bring back the brief period when the American Communist Party was a significant force on the front lines of industrial unionism.
Tonight's second hour of this view from below turns to the desperate plight of farmers, with disproportionate attention to the career of Charles (Pretty Boy) Floyd, the celebrated Oklahoma bank robber. It ends with a dramatic account of the bonus march on Washington by World War I veterans, a near revolutionary moment in the nation's history. Over the next three weeks, the story is carried from the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the innovations of the New Deal to the arms buildup for World War II, which finally ended the Depression.
There is no comfort here about America's present economic troubles, but the hard memories that still bring tears from those who were there offer some perspective to those who were not.

HEADLINE: Re-elect Governor Florio

 BODY:
America's politicians are seeking an answer from next week's election in New Jersey. Is it possible to survive after raising taxes? New Jersey, meanwhile, seeks a capable governor. We recommend re-electing the one they have.
In 1990, newly installed Gov. Jim Florio put through the biggest tax increase in the state's history, having said in his campaign that he saw no need for any increase. In light of the prevailing anti-tax sentiment, it was a brave move. And it was absolutely necessary for New Jersey, as it has been for other states and for the Federal Government, Republican supply-side nostrums notwithstanding. The added revenue solved the problems at hand -- balancing the budget while boosting school aid. 
 But in the tax revolt that followed, the Republicans won control of both houses of the Legislature with veto-proof majorities. At that point, Jim Florio became so accommodating -- on many things, but not taxes -- that recent opinion polls indicate people have forgotten how angry they were. That's one skillful politician.
Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican challenger, makes a good impression -- articulate, intelligent, sensitive to popular concerns. But her political skills need honing. Her campaign blunders cast doubt on her credibility as a candidate and her ability as a potential governor.
Mrs. Whitman's candidacy was created by Governor Florio's tax increase. Having almost toppled Senator Bill Bradley in 1990 by hammering at his silence on the Florio package, she was a natural to tackle Mr. Florio on the package itself. But she misfired with a promise to cut the personal income tax by 30 percent, a pledge so extreme and so late in the game that it strained belief. Indeed, she just fed the public's cynicism about politicians.
Mrs. Whitman would also weaken Governor Florio's toughness on gun control. New Jersey has the nation's toughest ban on semiautomatic weapons, thanks to Mr. Florio's courage in taking on the National Rifle Association. When Republicans won control of the Legislature they tried to repeal the ban, but he stopped them cold. Yet Mrs. Whitman wants to modify the ban, and had the poor judgment to make a campaign stop at a gun shop.
For his part, Mr. Florio shows poor judgment in insisting there was nothing wrong in the fact that a small investment firm half-owned by his chief of staff handled an extraordinary volume of state bond dealings. The Governor argues that investigators have not brought charges of anything illegal. True, but the appearance of Wall Street favors for a Florio insider is a bad sign.
Whoever wins will face difficult program cuts, to avoid raising taxes again. Neither candidate has laid out a convincing plan. The state is still feeling the recession more than most; its unemployment rate has risen to 7.9 percent. Recovery won't come easily and it won't come from magic tricks like Mrs. Whitman's incredible tax cut. It needs the experience, determination and doggedness of Jim Florio.

HEADLINE: Congress Defends Religious Freedom

 BODY:
Three years ago the Supreme Court threw away decades of precedent and watered down the religious liberty of all Americans. In a case involving the religious use of peyote by American Indians, the Court declared that states could criminalize all consumption of the substance without considering their laws' impact on the free exercise of religion.
By radically changing the ground rules for deciding claims of religious liberty, the Court alarmed organized religion, civil liberties organizations of all stripes and Senators as different in outlook as Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Orrin Hatch of Utah. The House has passed a bill aimed at correcting the situation and now the Senate is expected to pass it overwhelmingly. 
 The Religious Freedom Restoration Act reasserts a broadly accepted American concept of giving wide latitude to religious practices that many might regard as odd or unconventional. The bill deserves passage.
Before 1990, when law and religion collided, the Court had required government to show a compelling interest and to use the least intrusive method of enforcement. For example, a state could not deny unemployment compensation to a Seventh Day Adventist for refusing work on Saturday, her Sabbath. Not every religious claim was honored. The Court never recognized a religious refusal to pay taxes, but in many cases it gave breathing room to individual faith and conscience.
Then suddenly, and unnecessarily, the Court declared in the peyote case that states could enforce generally applicable laws, even if they trampled on serious religious claims, so long as the laws weren't deliberately aimed at religion.
Several unfortunate applications of this new test followed. For example, a general law routinely requiring autopsies in traffic deaths was enforced despite some relatives' claims that their religious beliefs were deeply offended.
The bill, which President Clinton says he will gladly sign, would instruct government not to "burden a person's exercise of religion," even if the "burden" results from a law that is aimed at everyone and not meant to interfere with religious practice -- unless there is a "compelling interest." If religious exercise must be limited, the bill says it must be done in the least restrictive way possible.
With the Restoration Act, Congress asserts its own interest in protecting religious liberty. It's a welcome antidote to the official insensitivity to religion the Court spawned in 1990.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: Staten Island Fights City Hall;
Alone, We're Better Off

BYLINE: By Guy V. Molinari; Guy V. Molinari is Staten Island Borough President.

 BODY:
In the 1894 referendum that approved the consolidation of the City of New York, the strongest support -- 78 percent -- came from Staten Island. How times have changed! This Election Day, Staten Islanders will vote on a proposal to ask the State Legislature to let them form a separate city, and I will be voting yes.
In recent years the interests of the people of Staten Island have become lost among the interests of the four larger boroughs. Staten Island has become a dumping ground, literally and figuratively -- first on the list for the most undesirable aspects of city government and last when it comes to desirable services rendered. 
 Although we represent only 5 percent of the city's population, for example, we receive virtually 100 percent of its garbage in our Fresh Kills landfill. Our plea for each borough to carry its fair share of this municipal burden falls on deaf ears. Just two weeks before Election Day, Mayor David Dinkins announced that plans for a sludge-composting plant in Queens would be squashed; meanwhile, plans for an equally unwanted plant on Staten Island move forward.
Or consider the city shelters and housing for the homeless. Right now more than 5,000 people are living in such housing on Staten Island; no more than 100 of them are Staten Islanders.
Clearly, whenever New York City plays politics, Staten Island loses.
When Staten Island is budgeted to receive services, those services are either inadequate or inappropriate. Of the city's 16 public health-care facilities, only a single small one is housed on Staten Island, and it does not offer basic health services. Unlike the other boroughs, Staten Island has no sewer maintenance crew of its own and must wait for a crew from another borough. A "citywide" program to immunize schoolchildren completely bypassed Staten Island.
And when the city does deliver services, it is often at inappropriate levels. It may make sense to have two officers in every police car in Washington Heights; does it make sense in a low-crime area like southern Staten Island? Should the same firefighting policies that apply to Manhattan with its skyscrapers apply to a borough in which the tallest building is nine stories high? Should Board of Education policies like the "rainbow curriculum," drafted to placate special interests in Manhattan, apply to Staten Island, where community standards are so different?
Not only is secession desirable, it is also economically feasible. Staten Island's location, educated work force and high household income make it highly appealing to new businesses. Since 1978 employment on Staten Island has grown more than twice as fast as employment citywide (62.5 percent to 27.1 percent). The island's population is expected to grow 20 percent by the year 2010, with employment growing 23 percent. These figures stand in stark contrast to the city's loss of 350,000 jobs in less than four years. There are no signs that this trend will be reversed, so it seems certain that a heavier tax burden will fall on those who remain.
Much has been said of the risk of big increases in real estate taxes if Staten Island secedes. But if we do not secede, we can certainly expect large increases in all forms of taxes. The Real Property Tax Reform Commission is likely to recommend large increases in property taxes on one- , two- and three-family homes. Seventy percent of our residents own such homes; 30 percent rent. For the rest of the city, practically the reverse is true.
So a big property-tax increase would disproportionately increase the average Staten Islander's tax bill. The only real question is where those tax dollars go and how they will be spent. Will we pay those taxes to a city in decline, a city that virtually ignores our pleas for a fair share? Or will we pay them to a smaller city governed by our friends and neighbors, responsive to our unique needs and priorities, and accountable to the governed?

HEADLINE: Committed to 'New Forestry' in Montana

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Some important facts were ignored in your Oct. 19 front-page article on the Champion International land transaction in Montana and the role of the Plum Creek Timber Company, to which Champion sold 867,000 acres at $300 an acre. 
 One of our fundamental principles is that we must be responsible and prudent stewards of the land if we intend to stay in business for generations to come. Over the last four years, Plum Creek has acted on that principle, becoming a leader in progressive forest management.
Beginning in 1990 we began experimenting with harvest practices modeled after the "new forestry" methods advocated by Dr. Jerry Franklin, a noted professor of ecosystem analysis at the University of Washington. these methods call for retaining valuable timber on the harvest sites to provide habitat for wildlife and to protect water and air quality.
In 1991 we took new forestry one step further, adopting environmental principles to guide all of our foresters and managers. Those principles govern replanting, wildlife management, stream and wetland protection, soil productivity, esthetics and other issues of concern to all of us, including the environmental community.
No company can achieve perfection in the eyes of everyone. But we believe that fairness dictates that our progress should be acknowledged. And it has been. Perhaps the best insight comes from Montanans who follow the company closely. When we announced this transaction, The Missoulian, one of Montana's leading newspapers editorialized:
"Plum Creek deserves more credit than it gets. It has worked to improve its logging practices and it has invested heavily and wisely in its plants and equipment. The most important thing is that the 867,000 acres of forest now owned by Champion would remain in the timber base and be actively managed for timber production."
With most of Plum Creek's present timberland holdings in Montana -- more than 600,000 of our 1.2 million acres -- and almost 1,400 of our 1,700 employees living and working there, our future is inextricably bound to the state's economic well-being. That is why we took the unprecedented step of entering into a 10-year timber supply agreement with Stimson Lumber Company, the purchaser of Champion's mills, to help assure that a significant number of Champion's employees can be hired back by Stimson.
There are many factors involved in the economic future of Montana and other timber states. However, declining timber supply has already left many timber workers unemployed. Appeals of timber sales and changing Federal forest management mandates continue to reduce timber supply available to Champion, Plum Creek and many smaller mill owners in Montana and throughout the region.

HEADLINE: Kazakh Uses America To Enhance His Stature

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The President of Kazakhstan played politics with the United States today and won.
President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev and Secretary of State Warren Christopher were scheduled to sign and celebrate an excruciatingly technical agreement detailing how Kazakhstan would spend $85 million of American aid to dismantle its nuclear weapons. 
 But when Mr. Christopher arrived at Mr. Nazarbayev's office this morning, the Kazakh leader told him to put away his pen. Of course Kazakhstan was willing to sign the agreement, he said, but only at a pomp-filled, face-to-face ceremony with President Clinton.
No matter that the funds will be stalled until after the agreement is signed. The 53-year-old former engineer is eager to look like a first-rank leader, both at home and abroad, and he considers the photo opportunity more important.
 
No Second Fiddle to Russia
 Mr. Nazarbayev delivered his message over a lunch of lamb dumplings and horsemeat pate, and a senior Administration official paraphrased it this way: "We think we've been responsible on the international stage. I don't want to be overlooked. I don't want to be considered an afterthought after Russia and the Ukraine."
Kazakhstan, the former Soviet Union's second-largest republic, is crucial for American security because it has roughly 100 Soviet-era nuclear weapons and the largest Soviet-era nuclear test site on its territory. Russia, Ukraine and Belarus also inherited Soviet nuclear weapons.
The Central Asian country also has one of the largest oil fields outside the Persian Gulf, so important that the San Francisco-based Chevron Corporation is willing to put up 80 percent of the $20 billion capital investment required to develop it. Kazakhstan is also rich in chrome, gold, silver, zinc, lead and iron ore deposits and a major exporter of coal and wheat.
For the moment, however, Kazakhstan is poor, so poor that people line the streets to barter whatever they have -- a single bar of soap, a tin of tea. Its economy shrank 14 percent last year after shrinking 10 percent the year before, while inflation was 2,000 percent in 1992.
 
Quest for Economic Muscle

Mr. Nazarbayev, who began his career as a steelworker and rose through the ranks of the Communist Party, has aggressively sought foreign investment in his stated quest to transform his country into the driving economic force in the former Soviet Union.
That attitude fits nicely with Mr. Clinton's determination to promote American business abroad. To help push private enterprise in Kazakhstan, Mr. Christopher today announced an economic aid package of $140 million.
To encourage the relationship, Mr. Nazarbayev invited Mr. Clinton to Almaty, the Kazakh capital of 1.2 million people nestled at the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains, near the border with China. (A few months ago, the Government of Kazakhstan changed the name from the Russian, Alma-Ata, to its Kazakh form, Almaty. The name means City of Apples.)
After all, Mr. Clinton announced last week that he will visit Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow in mid-January, just four and a half hours away by plane. To encourage a Clinton visit, Mr. Nazarbayev offered a gesture to prove that unlike his Ukrainian counterpart, President Leonid M. Kravchuk, he did not want to appear to be using his nuclear weapons to gain leverage over the West. Mr. Kravchuk, who promised last year to give up all of Ukraine's nuclear weapons, now says his country might keep some of them.
 
A Non-Nuclear Pledge
 When Mr. Nazarbayev appeared at a joint news conference with Mr. Christopher, he announced that he would ask his Parliament to approve the 1970 treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons before the end of the year. Although Kazakhstan had already pledged to adhere to the treaty, Mr. Christopher called that announcement a "very, very important development."
Last year, Kazakhstan signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty known as START-1, which commits it to reduce its strategic nuclear warheads, and Mr. Nazarbayev has pledged to make his country a non-nuclear state.
But he wants to make sure that if he gives up his nuclear weapons, the West in return will help guarantee the security of his million-square-mile country, which borders Russia, China, the Caspian Sea and three of the other Central Asian republics -- Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. In one of his meetings with Mr. Christopher, Mr. Nazarbayev spread out a map and described in detail the "dangers" that exist on his border, said one American participant.
Whether Almaty, with its bleak Soviet-style hotels, limited international phone lines and scant taxi service, could handle the American President and the White House press corps is another matter.
 
'Welcome President Rafsanjani'
 But Mr. Nazarbayev knows how to treat a head of state. Iran's President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, flew into town for a three-day visit just hours after Mr. Christopher left, and the main thoroughfares were lined with Iranian flags. In fact, when Mr. Christopher arrived on Saturday night, he was greeted by a huge sign that read, "Welcome President Rafsanjani."
All in all, today was a good day for Mr. Christopher, the smoothest so far in a bumpy, eight-day ride that includes stops in Hungary, the four nuclear powers of the former Soviet Union and Latvia.
En route to Budapest on Wednesday, Mr. Christopher decided not to announce a new initiative on NATO himself. Instead, he ceded the spotlight to Defense Secretary Les Aspin who briefed reporters at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Germany.
When the message came out muddled, Mr. Christopher's aides admitted that he should have done it himself.
 
Confusion on Foreign Policy
 In Budapest on Thursday, Mr. Christopher was verbally assaulted by a Texas businessman who wanted to know why American foreign policy was in disarray.
On Monday in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, Mr. Christopher is expected to have a testy meeting with Mr. Kravchuk over his country's failure to ratify START-1 and adhere to the nuclear treaty.
Even today, Mr. Christopher suffered a mild mishap. For the sake of politesse, he violated the first rule of politics: When you're given a hat, never put it on.
The Kazakhs presented Mr. Christopher with an embroidered camel-hair shapan and kalpan, the national coat and hat of Kazakhstan. Mr. Christopher, who was featured in last week's People magazine as one of the best dressed men in America, struggled to retain a statesman-like demeanor and he donned the clothing, quickly whipping the elf-like hat on and off his head.
"We told them no gifts," said one unhappy American diplomat. "They promised no gifts. This was an unwelcome surprise."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Eastern Europe and Central Asia mistranslated Almaty, the new official name for the capital of Kazakhstan, a city formerly known by the Russified name Alma-Ata. Almaty means Father of Apples, not City of Apples.

Customized Radio Services Find More Air Time

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Two companies best known for supplying traffic reports for radio station listeners, Shadow Broadcasting Service Inc. and its larger rival, Metro Networks Inc., are expanding their scope by offering customized news, weather and sports broadcasts to a growing number of radio stations.
Such ventures are unusual in the highly fragmented radio industry. While stations can supplement their own programming with syndicated segments like Casey Kasem's Top 40, Rush Limbaugh's talk show, or ABC News, more topical local information typically had to be produced by each station's news staff.
 
'A Logical Extension'
 Even The Associated Press's broadcast wire, used by more than half of all radio stations, generally carries only regional, national and foreign, not local, news. 
 "We're seeing sharing at the local level the way we've done at the national level," said David Bartlett, the president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association, a trade group in Washington. "The number of stations has doubled in the last 10 years, so we now have mass. It's a logical extension to see it in news."
To make their broadcasts seamless with the station's own, Shadow and Metro let the station dictate how many newscasts it wants, when it wants them, in what tone they are delivered and the mix of local and national news. The service is offered on a barter basis, with Shadow and Metro selling commercial time to advertisers on their own broadcasts.
"We set up the format," said Dave Clark, the program director of KOOJ-FM, a modern country station in Riverside, Calif., which receives eight 3-minute news broadcasts on weekdays from Metro's studio in Los Angeles. "If we want more up, more down, more human interest, they are right on it the next day. They nail it."
Mark Elliott, the program director of KMGX-FM in Granada Hills, Calif., a Shadow news affiliate, said its professional sound and use of San Fernando Valley news helped his station compete. "I'd much rather have this than me doing the news or a jock who tells jokes all morning. He loses credibility doing the news."
The new rivalry between Shadow and Metro is gaining ground because of the deregulation in 1981 that made news coverage by radio stations optional; the liberalization of station ownership rules last year, and a soured economy. When radio revenue began shrinking, so did news operations, particularly at stations with music formats. Jobs in radio news declined 22 percent, to 15,600 in 1992, according to the news directors' group, from the peak in 1990.
Music stations once commonly had two and three-person news divisions. More typical now is a station with one staff member. But a one-person operation can still cost about $100,000 a year in salaries, benefits, wire services and other overhead.
The contract news services try to offer cost savings to affiliates. Shadow offers what it calls "news protection" to stations, insuring coverage of breaking stories after the morning drive and on weekends. Some stations, like WOR-AM in New York, rely on Metro only for overnight news coverage to back up their own daytime news staff.
Lee Marshal, the vice president of news and sports at Shadow, said his service also addressed a common failing of radio news broadcasts; they are often at odds with a station's format. "I can't tell a 16-year-old Megadeth fan about soybean futures. But if I tell him, 'The cost of a date just went up,' then I can get through."
David Saperstein, a former used-car salesman from Baltimore who founded Metro in 1978, agreed. "We're giving listeners of music stations a reason not to leave," he said.
Shadow and Metro traffic broadcasters provide information on hundreds of stations in cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. On the air, both services often remain anonymous.
Metro, based in Houston, has 1,200 traffic affiliates in 50 cities, and 32 news, weather or sports affiliates in 11 cities. In New York, WOR is Metro's only news affiliate, though the service provides traffic to 20 radio and 2 television stations.
Shadow has 186 traffic affiliates in eight cities, and 52 news, weather or sports affiliates in six cities. In New York, Shadow has at least a dozen traffic outlets, five sports outlets, including WINS-AM, and one news outlet, dance station WMXV-FM. The company, based in Philadelphia, is owned by Michael D'Ambrose, Alan Markowitz and Len Lodish.
 
'The Next Rush Limbaugh'
 Industry executives credit Curtis Beckman with pioneering the local radio network concept. Mr. Beckman, a longtime news director of WCCO-AM, founded Radio City Network News of Minneapolis in 1988.
"What I heard on music stations in this marketplace was below-average, inexperienced people reading wire copy," he said. "The people I'm replacing are almost always not journalists, but people who want to be the next Rush Limbaugh."
Critics of contract news services say the services compete for advertising revenue with stations and contribute to the diminution of voices and opinions heard on the radio. John Lynch, the chairman of Noble Broadcasting Inc., which has 16 stations and is based in San Diego, said, "Anyone who tries to rely on them for real news is kidding themselves."
Radio's historical source of news, The Associated Press's broadcast wire, may have the most to lose. "If they put radio news people out of business, that's bad for us," said Jim R. Williams, The A.P.'s vice president and broadcast director.
In June, The Associated Press began offering format-specific copy to music and all-news stations. Mr. Williams denied that the move was a response to the new services.
"The day they are in the pool in Somalia or on the courthouse steps covering a story, then I'll say they're in our business," he said.

HEADLINE: Japan Officials Move to Open The Construction Market

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct. 26

 BODY:
In what could prove to be the first breakthrough in tense trade negotiations between the Clinton Administration and the new Japanese Government, the chief Cabinet secretary announced this morning the outlines of a program for opening Japan's scandal-tainted construction market.
The outlines of the program -- which were negotiated at the end of last week -- were sketchy, and they did not meet some of the basic American demands for concrete actions. But some American officials indicated they would probably be enough to halt the United States from imposing sanctions against Japanese construction companies in the United States because they suggested a commitment to real change. 
 However, the final American response, which is likely to come later this week, remains uncertain.
The deal would be significant since it would indicate an unusual degree of flexibility on both sides. Construction has been one of the most acrimonious areas of disagreement between the United States and Japan for the past seven years.
As the first trade agreement between Tokyo and Washington, it could give some indication of how other deals might be struck.
The "action plan," as it is being called, would make the bidding system more transparent, provide foreign companies equal access to information about projects and strengthen enforcement against collusive bidding practices, which a recent series of scandals have shown to be rampant in Japan. However, the program would only open bidding on projects above a certain size, which was not specified.
Japan faces a Nov. 1 deadline to either meet demands that it permit foreign construction companies, consultants and subcontractors to bid on public works projects on equal terms with Japanese companies, or have the rights of Japanese companies in the United States curbed.
The construction talks are separate from broader trade negotiations between Japan and the United States known as the framework talks. Those talks, which face a January deadline, are currently focused on opening Japan's insurance, auto, auto parts and Government procurement markets.
If the terms of the outline are accepted, officials indicated, they would amount to a down payment and would have to be followed with tangible measures by the time Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets President Clinton in January.
The Clinton Administration has been extremely tough in demanding that Japan not just open various markets, but that it guarantee tangible results. This deal, if it goes through, would indicate that the White House is willing to accept less concrete commitments of results.
American officials have said that the flexibility is a product of the fact that Mr. Hosokawa is perceived as a sincere reformer, bent on opening the collusive Japanese economy. But Mr. Hosokawa will remain weak until his Government can pass a long-promised electoral reform bill.
An agreement on the terms announced this morning would give Mr. Hosokawa time to enact that legislation before having to do battle with the powerful lobby that supports the construction industry.

HEADLINE: Can Whitman Win as the Anti-Florio?

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
If the race for governor of New Jersey were simply a personality contest, Christine Todd Whitman would win hands down. Affable, charming and impressive in person, she is her campaign's second-best asset (the first being Gov. Jim Florio himself). People who know her like her. People who meet her like her. Even people who may not be inclined to vote for her find her a lot easier to talk to than her opponent, a man so naturally guarded he spent a few minutes before the second debate practicing his smile.
But with a week to go before the election, Mrs. Whitman finds herself down in the polls, if gaining quickly, against one of the most harshly vilified governors in New Jersey's history. She has staked her campaign more on anti-Florio sentiment and Republican party doctrine, largely obscuring the woman behind the campaign and leaving many voters with a sense that they still do not know who she is. 
 With Mr. Florio furiously trying to fill that void by painting her as an out-of-touch heiress ill-equipped to manage the state, Mrs. Whitman's challenge has been to give voters more reason to vote for her than the bare fact that she is not Mr. Florio.
"It used to be it was always the nice person who won and the nasty one who lost," said Vernon Noble, an admirer of Mrs. Whitman who served with her on the Somerset County Board of Chosen Freeholders. "You can't put labels like that on people anymore. Now it's the one who works the hardest and gets the best issues and sticks to their guns and makes a point."
 
A Republican From the Cradle
 By now, every voter in New Jersey who has paid any attention knows Mrs. Whitman's history. She was born into one of the state's wealthiest and most politically well-connected families. Her father, the late Webster B. Todd, was a major figure in the national Republican Party, an adviser and friend to President Eisenhower and a builder whose projects included Rockefeller Center. Her mother, the late Eleanor Schley Todd, was a member of the Republican National Committee.
Mrs. Whitman, who is 47, was steeped in Republican philosophy from birth. At age 9 she stood on the dais during Mr. Eisenhower's speech to the Republican National Convention. At age 14, she sold lemonade to raise money for Richard Nixon's 1960 Presidential campaign.
She has held only one elected office, that of Somerset County Freeholder, and one appointed position, that of president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. But her political star rocketed in 1990 when she nearly upset the popular United States Senator Bill Bradley by tarring him with his refusal to comment on the record $2.8 billion tax increase orchestrated by his fellow Democrat, Mr. Florio.
Mrs. Whitman has tried to play upon her relative lack of experience, seeking to portray herself as a political outsider who will clean up the mess created by career politicians in Trenton. "For Jim Florio to call me an amateur is a compliment," she said. "It's true I haven't spent the last 25 or 28 years running for office."
But Mrs. Whitman is politician enough to be personable without ever being personal, to give scripted answers to many questions. Asked whether she likes or despises the rough-and-tumble world of politics, she said: "I like the part of politics that's meeting people. I hate the distortions. I hate the negativism. People really do care about the issues. The part of campaigning I hate is the 30- and 60-second sound bites. I'm not good at it. Maybe that's because I'm a mother and you can't discuss big issues with the kids in 30 and 60 seconds."
Asked whether, as the first woman to run as a major party candidate for governor of New Jersey, her sex should be a campaign issue, she said:
"I don't run on that, but, yes, it is more important that we have more women in positions of authority because they do prioritize differently, they do problem-solve differently. There should be a balance there. But that's not a case for me to make." (And to date, appreciably more women say they favor Mr. Florio.)
 
'I Want to Make A Difference'
 During the Republican primary, Mrs. Whitman defused attacks on her wealth by asserting that her opponents were trying to paint her as a "rich bitch from the hills." But she left the question open: Who is Christie Whitman?
Why does Christine Todd Whitman want to be governor? Why would she place herself and her family in the position of having their tax returns make headlines, their hiring practices examined, their family farm videotaped by Mr. Florio's campaign?
"Because I want to make a difference," she said this week between stops on a three-day bus tour of the state. She was accompanied by several supporters, including her husband, John Whitman, a financier and grandson of a former governor of New York.
"I love this state," Mrs. Whitman said. "The ability to hold that office to make those changes that I think are necessary to make life better here, it's worth it."
This answer may sound like so much boilerplate to jaded voters, but those who know the candidate insist she truly believes that, having lived a privileged life, she is obliged to give back to the community.
"Our parents felt very strongly about politics as a good vehicle to do something for the people of the state," said her sister, Kate Beach, who like many members of Mrs. Whitman's campaign wore a small golden pin that said "Christie, 93."
 
College, Children, Then a Campaign
 Mrs. Whitman began her political career after graduating from Wheaton College in Massachusetts with a degree in government. She went to work for the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity and later the Republican National Committee.
She waited until her two children, Kate, now 16, and Taylor, now 14, were old enough for preschool before seeking elected office, running in 1982 for a seat on the Somerset County Board of Chosen Freeholders.
Mrs. Whitman's fellow freeholders described her as hard-working and goal-oriented. John Kitchen said Mrs. Whitman's drive and determination helped them defeat an incumbent Democrat and former Democratic board member during that first election.
"She is very organized," Mr. Kitchen said. "She did her homework. She didn't let the problems stand in the way of the solutions. I can't see any flaw in the way she governs."
In 1988 Gov. Thomas H. Kean appointed her president of the State Board of Public Utilities, where she oversaw one of the most controversial actions of her career.
Under Mrs. Whitman's leadership, the utilities panel approved a deal that allowed Hackensack Water Company to transfer 290 acres of watershed property to the company's development subsidiary. Local environmental and community groups strongly opposed the transfer.
But the Appellate Division of Superior Court reversed the board's decision after finding that the language of the transfer did allow development of the property under some circumstances. The court also criticized the board for acting without adequate public input. The board approved the transfer at a meeting in January 1990, only two days after it had given public notice of the meeting and four days before Mr. Florio took office.
Carl Golden, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, said Mrs. Whitman stands by her vote on the issue.
"Her understanding at the time was that this would keep the land in that kind of protected position and it was on that basis and assurance that she voted," he said.
 
Social Liberal, Fiscal Conservative
 Mrs. Whitman is a moderate Republican, conservative on fiscal issues, liberal on social concerns. Like Ronald Reagan, she says lower taxes will stimulate the economy, and has proposed cutting income taxes in New Jersey 30 percent over three years. She supports abortion rights, as does Mr. Florio. Like Janet Reno, the United States Attorney General, she has questioned the effectiveness of mandatory sentencing laws, although she has moderated that stance by proposing that third-time violent offenders go to prison for life.
Mr. Florio has used her questioning of mandatory sentences to paint Mrs. Whitman as soft on crime, and his own leadership in enacting New Jersey's ban on semiautomatic weapons to tout his toughness on the issue. Mrs. Whitman has replied that his emphasis on guns simplifies the issue without significantly reducing violent crime or addressing its root causes.
"We've got to understand the problems are much more than just crime per se," she said. "The problems are things like, what do we do in our inner cities, how do we keep them from dying, how do we improve the education system and housing? If I grew up in the inner city in one of those high-rise projects, I'd break windows too. What else is there to do?"
Mrs. Whitman's attempt to support mothers on welfare led to the strange sight of a Republican accusing a Democrat of "extreme right-wing radicalism" after Mr. Florio proposed denying benefits to mothers who refuse to identify the fathers of their children.
"What is the Governor's next idea?" asked a statement released by the Whitman campaign. "A program of tattoos for welfare mothers? A badge sewn onto their clothing identifying them as welfare recipients? Creation colonies, like leper colonies, where welfare recipients would be forced to live? How about an involuntary relocation program into camps?"
Mr. Florio leaped upon the statement, calling it insulting to the victims of the Holocaust, and held two news conferences with angry Jewish and black leaders.
 
A Bumpy Campaign Settles Down
 Although it is unclear whether the squabble cost Mrs. Whitman support among Jewish voters, it is indicative of the missteps that have plagued her candidacy and given critics ammunition to argue that a bumpy campaign would produce a bumbling administration. From hiring and firing the man responsible for the infamous Willie Horton advertisement to stating that tens of thousands of dollars were being spent buying Adidas sneakers for inmates, Mrs. Whitman handed Mr. Florio opportunity after opportunity to attack her.
By not taking the initiative to define herself, she allowed Mr. Florio to define her as indecisive, pro-guns and soft on crime.
But over the last week, Mrs. Whitman has managed to steady her campaign. Ed Rollins, the Republican consultant, has taken over daily operations from Mrs. Whitman's brother, Webster B. Todd Jr., and made it clear that he is willing to engage in negative campaigning despite Mrs. Whitman's insistence that it was against her nature. She released her 1990 tax returns returns after months of stalling that allowed Mr. Florio to suggest she was hiding something, then left the Florio campaign scrambling to justify its innuendo.
Her campaign put Mr. Florio on the defensive by filing a complaint with the State Election Law Enforcement Commission accusing Mr. Florio of violating campaign finance laws. Then she turned in a solid performance during the second debate on Tuesday.
Mrs. Whitman said that while she expected Mr. Florio to be a tough campaigner, she was taken aback by how he has chosen to attack her.
Fighting back in the debate Sunday, she interrupted the Governor at one point to say:
"Jim, as a mother, I find that totally insulting. This is what the Governor has done throughout this campaign. He has taken positions of mine, twisted them and tried to create fear tactics."
Still, Mrs. Whitman says she would not have done anything differently.
"I still believe in doing it what I consider to be the right way," she said. "I want to be governor, but the desire to be governor does not consume me. I just won't push it that far."

Casting the Star Roles at Bell Atlantic

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Raymond W. Smith, the chief executive of Bell Atlantic, has seen to the cutting of 20,000 jobs. He has confronted his regulators in hearing rooms and the courts, usually winning. And to press John C. Malone to strike a deal for the sale of Tele-Communications Inc., he had an aide spread the word that competing cable companies were eager to sign up.
But it's Mr. Malone they call a prince of darkness. "He has been referred to as Darth Vader outside, in the press," Mr. Smith told a Bell Atlantic executive training class a few days ago. "I have only been referred to as Darth Vader inside." 
 His executives quickly glanced at each other, then roared with laughter.
Bell Atlantic's agreement last week to buy the Tele-Communications cable television company for $33 billion set off speculation about how long Mr. Malone would stay with a local phone company, or how soon he would overthrow Mr. Smith. Mr. Malone has been cast as a multimedia mobster, extracting payments from every rival and cable viewer in the nation. Mr. Smith was just a faceless Baby Bell administrator, as menacing as a 96-pound operator.
 
 
Some Shared Passions
 But the two have far more in common than their images suggest. Their shared passions include corporate economizing, fending off regulators and taking calculated but highly leveraged risks. They hate bureaucracy. They agree that Mr. Malone's position at the new Bell Atlantic -- as billionaire vice chairman, strategist and cable programming boss with five board seats under his control -- will beat the drudgery Mr. Smith faces in running the phone service and the broader corporation.
Their contrasting reputations, however, result in large part from their contrasting approaches to the public. Mr. Malone, the Tele-Communications president, has scant patience for politicians or press, and it shows. In-house, Mr. Smith's temper might be shorter than a speed-dial, but outside he is the consummate diplomat.
An experienced actor, director and playwright in local theater, Mr. Smith is alert to his audience of the moment, able to change roles in an instant. With Mr. Malone out of the spotlight and Mr. Smith taking center stage to explain the combined company's motives and strategy, Mr. Malone could enjoy even more latitude.
"If I know Ray," said Anton Campanella, Bell Atlantic's recently retired president, "Ray will let John Malone be John Malone."
Despite Washington's generally favorable response to the deal, some lawmakers and many competitors quake at that thought. "Malone has not only the control he was able to exercise in the past," said Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, "but now he has unlimited financial resources." As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator Metzenbaum plans a hearing on the deal tomorrow.
At his own company, mounting political pressure was making it more difficult for Malone to be Malone. With each acquisition or increase in cable fees, more regulators and Congressmen demanded greater public control over what had become the nation's largest cable empire.
Now, Mr. Malone, who is 52, speaks more of changing his visibility than his goals. "The one thing in life I don't want to be is Mr. Outside," he said in an interview. "I don't particularly like the publicity and the hassle." As an escape, he spends his summers sailing off the coast of Maine.
Let others accuse him of wielding unchecked power. Mr. Malone says he actually feels pinched by Tele-Communications, despite a stock market value of $13 billion and borrowing of $10 billion. Mr. Malone's ambitions require the added cash flow of a telephone company that has more than 18 million subscribers. "It's part of growing up to realize you've built more opportunities than you have resources," he said.
 
A Tough-Guy Reputation
 His dossier, long and well known, dates back to his arrival at Tele-Communications, near Denver, in 1972, back when the cable industry existed mainly for remote towns beyond the reach of broadcast signals. Mr. Malone relished the tough-guy reputation he gained in making cable a big business. When Vail, Colo., refused to meet fee demands, the company left viewers with nothing to watch one weekend but the home phone numbers of the mayor and city manager. The city gave in.
Through about 500 acquisitions, Tele-Communications now has about 20 percent of all cable subscribers. Mr. Malone's ability to control access to millions of homes has helped him build a vast network of investments in cable program producers.
For all Ted Turner's braggadocio, he must now clear his actions with Mr. Malone, who sits on his board and controls a 23 percent stake in Turner Broadcasting System. Mr. Turner's hopes of entering the current bidding war for Paramount were reportedly blocked by Mr. Malone.
 
 
Dueling With Viacom
 Mr. Malone's current nemesis is Sumner M. Redstone, chairman of Viacom Inc. Mr. Malone is backing a bid by the QVC Network to break up Viacom's plans for buying Paramount Communications. In an antitrust suit, Viacom has accused Mr. Malone of using "bully boy tactics," and said, "The consumer has paid -- and will continue to pay -- a monopoly tax to John Malone." He dismisses the suit as a petty strategem.
He also remains scornful of government. "If there were just a few guys in Washington who ever had to meet a payroll, who ever had to build a company, we wouldn't be in the situation we're in," he said recently. "Sending me off to settle the company's regulatory issues is not a good move."
Enter Mr. Smith, who has spent his 33-year Bell career dealing profitably with regulators. "They are not bad people," Mr. Smith said in an interview. "They work very hard." Although his company is based in Philadelphia, he has a second set of offices, and another home, in Washington.
Mr. Smith's friendly attention is rewarded. Federal lawmakers, regulators and judges have given Bell Atlantic broad rights to expand into television. At the state level, Mr. Smith has persuaded regulators to watch his prices, not his profits -- increasing the company's incentives to economize and add services.
 
 
Image and a 'Dumpy' Office
 Of all the regional phone companies, regulators have treated Bell Atlantic the best, said Steven R. Yanis, an analyst at Kidder Peabody. "It's not by chance," he said. "They've worked at it."
Mr. Smith is frank about the importance of image. He knew that regulators, shareholders and workers would cheer when in 1991 he turned a planned 50th-floor executive dining room at the Philadelphia headquarters into an employee cafeteria, and gave himself a modest office. "I have that dumpy little office there for symbolic reasons," he said. With no receptionist, his secretary seems to get the equivalent of a daily aerobics class by jumping up repeatedly to see who's buzzing at the floor's locked glass door.
Inside, visitors see a list of 25 cost-saving mandates. No. 24: "Use backs of paper due for recycling for notes, calculations, etc., before recycling."
Mr. Smith greets his guests in an Armani double-breasted suit. But in the presence of a newspaper photographer, or the executive trainees, the jacket comes off and the shirtsleeves are rolled up.
Mr. Smith says he achieved most of his staff reductions through attrition and incentives for employees to leave voluntarily. Although other Baby Bells have cut back as well, Bell Atlantic has become the most efficient, with only 35 employees per 10,000 local telephone lines, compared with the industry average of 40.
Mr. Smith's aides speak of his volcanic impatience. "He gets tremendously exercised over bureaucratic fluff," said Stuart C. Johnson, a group president. Recently, when the company's advertising executives came in to discuss their planning process for publicizing the merger, Mr. Smith bristled. "Forget about the plan," he ordered. "Do the work."
He has never had much regard for bureaucracies -- the military, the Bell System before the breakup -- that value spotless records much more than imagination. Mr. Smith, who is 56, traces his maverick ways to his childhood. In his Pittsburgh parochial school, the nun teaching his second-grade class likened the soul to a white ribbon. "I already had an impure thought," he said with a smirk. "My ribbon was already soiled."
To agitate the Bell Atlantic bureaucracy, he is pursuing a decadelong campaign of motivational seminars and exercises. Posters and signs -- everything from "Be Here Now" to "Empowered to Delight the Customer" -- can make Bell Atlantic seem like a Boy Scout troop taken over by New Age cultists.
Mr. Smith's continuing experience as a writer, director and actor in local theater has enhanced his ability to judge his audience and vary his approach. He studied at night to earn master's degrees in business and in literature. He can recite Chaucer as readily as he can break into song. His favorite plays, like "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," by Tom Stoppard, turn conventional thinking upside down -- in this case, by devoting a whole play to the antics of some marginal characters from "Hamlet."
 
 
Reasons for His Roles
 He makes no apologies for his ability to play roles ranging from conciliatory statesman to relentless taskmaster. "It's not manipulative," he said. "It's a sales skill. If you're selling a concept to a group of scientists, you don't present it the same as you would to a group of schoolchildren."
Having told everyone in the company to write down their worst faults on cards and scold themselves always, he recited his: "I will be more patient and I will listen to your point of view and recognize it."
That is, up to a point. "There's nobody who gets to the top of a big business without a sense of impatience," he added.
But Mr. Malone, as a billion-dollar shareholder on the Bell Atlantic board, might win Mr. Smith's forbearance. And envy.
"I told him if I had a choice of having the exciting new areas to deal with and get a billion dollars," Mr. Smith said, "or all the horsefeathers I have to deal with, I think he got the better deal."
Just the sort of thing Ray Smith must have said to persuade John Malone to sign.

HEADLINE: More Banks Nationwide Are Urged

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration favors giving banks the right to operate more freely across state lines, but has decided not to push the issue until other banking and economic legislation clears Congress, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said today.
Current restrictions on interstate banking require banks to create separate subsidiaries to operate in more than one state, a cumbersome and costly deterrent to expansion. 
 In a speech here to the Center for National Policy, a public affairs research institute, Mr. Bentsen said removing these barriers would ease credit nationwide and strengthen banks by unhitching them from the economies of individual states.
The American Bankers Association, the largest industry trade organization, generally welcomed the approach he outlined, but consumer groups expressed reservations.
In a letter to Mr. Bentsen, nine groups said interstate deregulation would harm consumers and communities, especially poorer ones, by allowing deposits to be drained away into loans in other regions. Among those signing the letter were the United States Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, Public Citizen, Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America.
Several versions of interstate branching legislation are moving through Congress, which has tried and failed to enact such a bill in the past. Administration officials are to testify on Tuesday about their goals for any such bill.
The approach favored by the Administration, Mr. Bentsen said, would allow bank holding companies that now maintain separate operating subsidiaries in more than one state to merge their operations into a single bank with branches in each state, as long as the states permit it. Banks that now operate in only one state would be able to open branches in another, also only if the states agreed.
"This would continue to leave it entirely to the states, and that's a major point, to decide if they don't want out-of-state banks doing business within their borders," he said.
 
What Kind of Legislation?
 It remained unclear whether the Administration favored an approach that would require each state to pass new legislation to join the national system, or one that would require that a state enact a new law if it wanted to opt out of the system.
Mr. Bentsen's remarks were the clearest signal to date that the Administration intends to support broader freedom for banks to operate nationwide, an approach Administration officials believe would make them healthier and increase the availability of credit.
But it also made clear that the Administration does not want other provisions combined with those involving interstate banking, a pattern that has often doomed banking legislation in the past. "Overreaching, polarization, and piling on can only lead to failure," he said.
Two major banking bills are before Congress, one to provide money to complete the cleanup of the savings-and-loan crisis, the other to help financial institutions that focus on lending in poor areas. The Administration does not want either weighed down by interstate banking.
On another topic, Mr. Bentsen said the Administration would act more assertively to open foreign markets to American banks and other financial institutions.
He said negotiators would push this demand in the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and to back this up, it would support legislation before Congress to deny new benefits to financial institutions based in countries that deny open access to Americans. That threat would become more important to foreign financial institutions if, as the Administration intends, banks operating in the United States are granted new powers, like interstate branching.

Clinic Chain Seeks a Deal With a Rival

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Surgical Care Affiliates Inc., bidding to build a nationwide network of 146 walk-in surgery centers, said yesterday that it had offered to merge with Medical Care America, a troubled competitor, in a stock swap valued at $941 million.
"The urge to merge continues," said John F. Hindelong, a health care analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. 
 Hospitals and other medical services companies have been wooing partners to gain negotiating strength as they face the regional health alliances that would be a centerpiece of President Clinton's health plan.
Surgical Care Affiliates, based in Nashville, has 55 surgery centers in 21 states; Medical Care America, based in Dallas, has 91 surgery centers and 47 home infusion centers in 32 states. The infusion centers supervise intravenous treatments in the home.
 
Shares Jump 30 Percent
 Medical Care America shares jumped 30 percent yesterday on news of the offer, closing at $24.625, up $5.625 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the largest percentage gain of the day. Surgical Care Affiliates slipped 87.5 cents, to close at $19 on the Big Board.
Showing little eagerness for the offer, of which it was informed in an Oct. 14 letter from Joel C. Gordon, chairman of Surgical Care Affiliates, Medical Care America said yesterday that its board would respond "in due course."
Mr. Gordon said yesterday he was "disappointed" by the reaction. He hinted he might raise the bid if the Dallas company opened its books.
Surgical Care Affiliates offered to convert each Medical Care share to 1.35 shares of S.C.A. common stock. Medical Care had 36.7 million shares outstanding on June 30.
 
Possibility of a Counteroffer
 Randall S. Huyser at Furman Selz said the proposed merger would be "a good fit," but Mr. Hindelong suggested it might attract a counteroffer from the Columbia Healthcare Corporation, the aquisition-minded hospital chain based in Louisville, Ky.
Columbia already has joint ventures with both Surgical Care Affiliates and Medical Care America, offering "one-stop shopping" to managed-care customers. Columbia Healthcare, awaiting Federal antitrust approval for its planned merger with the HCA-Hospital Corporation, had no comment yesterday on the surgery center offer.
Economy-minded payers often direct patients to surgery centers, which do not keep them overnight and typically have lower overhead and charges than hospitals.
Joyce Albers at CS First Boston said Medical Care America "became a target" after disappointing results in the home infusion business that it acquired 13 months ago in a poorly timed merger with Critical Care America. Insurers that pay for home care were driving down prices. Medical Care's profits faded, sending the Dallas company's shares plunging from the 1992 high of $64.
Growth in surgery center business has also slowed to single digits, Mr. Hindelong said, although the long-term outlook seems relatively strong. Many hospitals have established their own ambulatory surgical units.
Mr. Gordon said he would try to rebuild Medical Care America's troubled home infusion business if the merger wents through. "We cannot get rid of it or sell it for two years," he said, to preserve the tax-free "pooling" accounting advantages in the stock swap.
Bear, Stearns & Company and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom are advising Surgical Care Affiliates.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Boeing Profit Falls 45.2% As Airlines Stay Weak

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25

 BODY:
The Boeing Company today reported a 45.2 percent decline in third-quarter earnings, citing continuing weakness in the airline industry and soft military and space business.
Boeing, based in Seattle, said earnings fell to $189 million, or 56 cents a share, from the third quarter last year. Sales fell 25.3 percent, to $5.15 billion. 
 Analysts said the lower results indicated the company had not returned to growth and might not for some time despite a recent decision to retain some workers previously scheduled for layoffs.
"What the results are telling you is the bottom is still some distance off in the future and cannot be identified as yet," said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. He said Boeing appeared to be willing to sacrifice some sales to keep profit margins higher. "Boeing would rather hold price rather than rate, so rates will come down while prices remain constant," he said, referring to profit margin rates.
 
Shares Are Lower
 Boeing shares dropped 87.5 cents today to close at $37.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sales and earnings for the fourth quarter, the company said, will be well above the third quarter based on current programs and schedules. Sales for the year are expected to be in the $25.5 billion range. But a trend to lower sales would continue through 1994, the company said.
Production is being slowed to reduce the rate of building 737's to 10 a month, the 757 to 5 a month and the 767 to 3 a month. In early 1994, the 747 production rate will be reduced to three from five a month.
"Economic growth in the major airline traffic markets worldwide continues to be weak, particularly in Western Europe and Japan," Frank A. Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "Consequently, airline industry profitability, although improving in the aggregate, is expected to remain below historical levels in the near term. In this environment, the company continues to review airline requirements and associated production rates for late 1994 and beyond."
Boeing said 142 new orders valued at $9.8 billion were announced by customers during the first nine months, down from 158 aircraft valued at $11.5 billion for the corresponding period last year.
"Although new-order activity in the present environment remains depressed, the company has been successful at maintaining its historical market share," Mr. Shrontz said.

HEADLINE: In a Gritty Town, Hope Outlives the Prosperity

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHAMOKIN, Pa.

 BODY:
Against all odds, pine trees have taken root on the black mountain of coal mining waste that looms above this small city in central Pennsylvania. The people of Shamokin have also put down deep roots, holding fast to a bleak place despite a harsh economic climate. It is a triumph of time over adversity.
By objective measures, Shamokin (pronounced shuh-MO-kin) is a dying town. The coal and textile industries folded up years ago, unemployment rose, and most of the young people fled. 
 A quarter of the 9,200 residents here are over 65, a demographic fact apparent on any street on any weekday, making Shamokin's population the second oldest of any Pennsylvania city's, after Monongahela's. And except for Florida, Pennsylvania has the oldest population in the country, with 15.4 percent of its residents over 65, a fact the state recognizes by spending its lottery revenues on programs for people over 65.
 
A Prison Is Good News
 One of the few bits of good economic news lately was Shamokin's victory over a dozen other communities in the competition for a new state prison. The city sold bonds to build the institution, which opened a year ago just outside of town, and is leasing it back to the state. "Last October we had a job fair for 400 jobs at the prison, and 4,300 to 4,500 people came and applied," said David F. Matash, manager of the Shamokin Job Agency, a state employment office.
It is not clear how much the prison will mean to businesses in Shamokin, since many of the institution's supplies are bought elsewhere. But there are hopes that the utilities installed to serve the prison can make it easier to lure industry to the community.
To visit Shamokin (or any one of dozens of small towns like it) is to see a Pennsylvania a world away from the vitality of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and just as far removed from the prosperity it once enjoyed from the mines and mills. To visit Shamokin is to be reminded, too, of how the bonds of place and family can sustain a community as it grows old and stares into a bleak future.
During the day, after many of the people of working age have driven to jobs as far away as Harrisburg, 55 miles to the south, or even Philadelphia, 125 miles away, Shamokin looks like a retirement community. But the gathering places are not golf courses but church basements.
 
Getting By, Thank You
 Many of the elderly in Shamokin say they lack for nothing they can't do without. But there are only a half-dozen doctors in town -- too few, the state says, to serve Shamokin and surrounding Northumberland County. The city does not have a pediatrician.
On a recent morning, a dozen elderly women sat around a table in the St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church basement, peeling potatoes and onions to make pirogi, or dumplings, to sell to benefit the church school.
A 79-year-old widow, Vi Golden, said that on a typical weekday she went to 8 A.M. Mass, then helped out at a nursing home. Dinner is often a spaghetti or chicken plate at church. Her parents immigrated from Poland to work in the mines, and she has lived in Shamokin all her life. Her seven children all moved away to find work. "I do miss them," she said.
Mrs. Golden, who worked in factories and as a cook, retired with no pension and lives on a $517 monthly Social Security check. She lives in a frame house, next to her 87-year-old sister-in-law. "The house needs everything," she said, especially a new furnace.
People dismiss the notion that their city could wither away. They talk about living in homes built by their grandparents and attending churches their families helped build.
Their city is poor: the median household income is $14,500, and 21 percent of its residents live in poverty.
"It is disheartening when our youth have to go elsewhere for employment," said James E. Yurick, a city councilman and carpentry instructor at the regional vocational school. But he added, "I don't look at Shamokin as a dying city, and I don't look at Shamokin as a depressed, older community."
The biggest concern for many people is the Catholic Church's recent proposal to close five of the city's eight churches. "I have a lot of sorrow in my heart with all this talk of church mergers," said Dolores Demas, 63, a secretary at St. Stephen's Church.
Shamokin started as a mining camp in the early 1800's and reached its peak population of 21,200 in 1920. The coal mines gave out in the 1930's, and the textile mills and shoe factories began losing out to foreign mills in the 1970's.
In August, the last of the city's dress makers closed, laying off about 200 workers and pushing the local jobless rate to about 12 percent, compared with 6.7 percent nationally.
The city's biggest employer is the school district, but just outside the city limits, in an industrial park, several large companies employ a total of about 1,000 workers. They build mobile homes, package greeting cards and print tickets for theaters.
After being unemployed most of the last three years, Michael J. Canfield, 31, just started working for one of these companies as a part-time machinist at $9.60 an hour. He said that he had worked in Orlando, Fla., for five years but that he preferred the coal region. "It's more peaceful around here, and people know everybody," he said.
Ms. Demas, the church secretary, says that she and her husband moved away from Shamokin to Baltimore in 1950, so he could find work as a truck driver. They missed Shamokin so much that she recalls the date they were able to come back: July 25, 1986. "We couldn't wait to return," she said.
Shamokin is a sleepy place where people sit for hours on their porches. The most prominent building downtown is an abandoned shoe factory with a copper clock tower and six stories of broken windows. There used to be an empty textile factory across the street, but it recently burned down. The business district has several blocks of small shops, restaurants and medical supply businesses.
 
Pressures From Outside
 Shopping malls 20 miles away have taken their toll. Some Shamokin storefronts are vacant, two clothing stores are closing, and the largest store, J.C. Penney, had only a few customers one recent afternoon. Next door to Penney's, "Sleepless in Seattle" was playing in the only movie theater.
Residential streets, with names like Anthracite, Carbon and Coal, fan off the downtown area, up into the hills whose coal has scarcely been worth mining for decades. The mines and mills were not locally owned, so there are few big houses in town.
But no matter what it looks like, no matter what it is, Shamokin is home to some people. After going to Harvard College and Medical School, Dr. Wayne Miller returned to Shamokin to care for the elderly. They include his grandfather, Robert Evans, a retired miner who has black lung disease.
"I've always enjoyed living here," said Dr. Miller, who is 31 and practices internal medicine. "I grew up here seeing that the medical care was substandard, and I've always planned to come back."
Mr. Evans, who is 81, said he was not surprised by the decision. "We're doing pretty good here," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on Expectation Of More German Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher against most major currencies yesterday as traders anticipated more cuts in German interest rates and further improvement in the American economy.
Gold prices fell after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery settled at $370.50 an ounce, down 80 cents from late Friday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for spot gold of $369.30 an ounce, off 70 cents. 
 Trevor Woodland, chief corporate trader for Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said the currency market remained bullish on the dollar after Thursday's cut in two important interest rates by the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank.
The surprise move -- which was intended to prop up the weak German economy -- prompted several other European countries to follow suit last week.
Lower interest rates abroad tend to drive the dollar higher, as investors shift money into dollar-denominated investments to capture higher yields.
At the same time, currency traders were banking on stable to higher interest rates in the United States, Mr. Woodland said.
"The market is looking for some reasonably good numbers for America's gross domestic product for the third quarter," he said. "Some feel it will be in excess of 3 percent" growth.
The Commerce Department is expected to release its third-quarter report on the nation's G.D.P. on Thursday.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.6855 marks, from 1.6755 marks on Friday. It also rose to 108.58 Japanese yen, from 108.05 yen on Friday.
But the dollar was weaker against the British pound. In New York, sterling was quoted at $1.4790, up from $1.4735.
Other late New York dollar rates compared with late Friday rates, included: 1.4855 Swiss francs, up from 1.4755; 5.8690 French francs, up from 5.8539; 1,616 Italian lire, up from 1,613, and $1.3123 Canadian, up from $1.3043 Canadian.

HEADLINE: GOVERNING TORIES IN CANADA ROUTED BY LIBERAL PARTY

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Tuesday, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The Liberal Party, led by Jean Chretien, a Quebec lawyer and former Cabinet minister, steamrolled to victory in elections Monday that foreshadowed major changes in Canada's political landscape.
The Liberals swept Ontario and the eastern provinces, crushing the Progressive Conservatives, who have led the country for nine years. A preliminary count gave the Liberals 177 seats in the House of Commons, a clear majority of the total of 295, to just 2 for the Conservatives, who had held the majority. 
 "The time has come to put the country back on the right track," Mr. Chretien told cheering supporters early this morning.
Bloc Quebecois took 54 of the 75 Commons seats contested in Quebec. The Bloc, whose main platform is to prepare for Quebec's secession from Canada, is expected to become the official parliamentary opposition.
 
Opposes Secession of Quebec
 "I say to our friends in English Canada that our victory tonight represents a unique occasion to begin a new relationship founded on honesty and respect," the Bloc's leader, Lucien Bouchard, said Monday night.
Although Mr. Chretien, 59, the 18th of 19 children, was born in a paper-mill town in central Quebec where the sentiment for separation is strong, he passionately supports keeping Quebec within Canada.
In western Canada the populist Reform Party, made up chiefly of disaffected Tories, picked up 52 seats, becoming the third-ranking party.
The results could end the political career of the Conservative Prime Minister, Kim Campbell, the first woman to hold the office. She took over last June from Brian Mulroney, who left office with the lowest popularity ratings of any Canadian leader in this century.
 
A Brutal Defeat
 The Tories, with their 2 seats, and the New Democrats, who won 9, both lost their official party status, which requires at least 12 seats. One seat went to an independent.
Never in history has a governing party been so punished.
Ms. Campbell, who lost her seat in Vancouver, said in her concession speech that she accepted the judgment of the people "with disappointment but without reservation." She added with a smile: "I'm glad I didn't sell my car."
In the past, the Liberal Party has had strained relations with the United States. But although Mr. Chretien has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement and has said he would seek some changes, there have been signs that he would seek some accommodation with Washington.
 
Ties With U.S. Seem Firm
 Although Liberal governments have tended to be more adversarial than the Tories in relations with the United States, Mr. Chretien is unlikely to alter the existing close links between the two countries, analysts said.
The election caught Canadians in a state of enduring petulance, anxious for politicians who could offer help but distrustful of their promises. "There is a fury in the land," said a broadcaster and professor, Keith Spicer, in a national report in 1991. "Canada looks to Canadians like a pessimist's nightmare from hell."
Little has changed since then. Joblessness has been stuck at around 11 percent, or 1.6 million people, and hundreds of thousands of Canadians are on welfare.
One of the few Conservative victories was that of Jean Charest, in Sherbrooke, Quebec. He was the runner-up to Ms. Campbell at the Conservative leadership convention last June.
Mr. Chretien saved his seat in St. Maurice, Quebec, in the Bloc Quebecois surge. Although he ran a low-key campaign, he could not undo his image among many Quebecers as one of those responsible for isolating the province when he served in Pierre Elliott Trudeau's Cabinet and blunting Quebec's demands for more power.
The Bloc also made headway against warnings by the Quebec Premier, Robert Bourassa, and Mr. Trudeau that a victory by the separatists would carve a dangerous faultline in Quebec unity.
There are still hurdles to jump before Quebec goes off on its own. First the provincial separatist party, the Parti Quebecois, must win an election next year. Then a majority of Quebecers must vote "yes" in a referendum; in a referendum on separation in 1980, 60 percent voted "no."
There were a record 2,155 candidates from 14 registered parties running for the 295 seats. Before today's vote, Conservatives held 153 seats, Liberals 79, New Democrats 43 and Bloc Quebecois 8. The Reform Party and the Independent Conservatives each held one. There were 10 vacancies.
Mr. Chretien and President Clinton share a belief in activist government and face similar problems of increasing economic growth and cutting budget deficits. Both are more practical than ideological and hew to the more conservative policies of their parties.
 
'Bad Old Days' Are Over
 "The excellent relations with the United States will continue virtually unchanged," predicted Robert H. Pines, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Canada for three years in the Bush Administration and a friend of Mr. Chretien. "There is no going back to the bad old days of the 1970's."
Mr. Pines was referring to the strains that existed under Mr. Trudeau, the last Liberal Prime Minister, an urbane, leftist intellectual whose nationalistic policies on energy and investment provoked a series of crises with Washington.
Still, the Liberal victory could present the Clinton Administration with some new problems with the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would lower tariffs imposed by Canada, the United States and Mexico on one another's goods. Mr. Chretien said during the seven-week campaign that he wanted new talks with Washington to win greater protection for Canadian exporters.
 
What to Do About Nafta
 The trade agreement can be amended after it goes into force, and its provisions are also subject to interpretation by the three governments. Officials in Washington have said they would prefer a Liberal Government to pursue one of these options rather than demand to reopen the original pact, a tactic the Clinton Administration has said it would rebuff.
Robert Rubin, head of the National Economic Council at the White House, said Monday evening that the Administration was confident Canadian concerns could be addressed, but he refused to discuss details.
A Canadian withdrawal from Nafta would have little economic effect on the United States because the two countries already have a separate trade agreement. If Canada rejects Nafta, free trade would remain in effect between Canada and the United States and between Mexico and the United States, but not between Canada and Mexico.
Mr. Chretien, derided by the Tories as "yesterday's man," was able to bring more than 30 years' experience to bear in what even Ms. Campbell agreed was an excellent campaign.
"I'm quite prepared to give Mr. Chretien the gold star," she said last week, after polls showed the Tories falling to fourth place behind the Liberals, Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, a western regional party that has attracted disenchanted Tories.
Ms. Campbell, a lawyer and teacher who was elected to the House of Commons for the first time in 1988, made a number of tactical and strategic errors during the campaign. She also had to carry the baggage of nine years of Tory rule under her predecessor, Brian Mulroney, who left office with the lowest popularity rating for any Canadian leader this century.
For Canada's left-leaning New Democrats, the vote was also a disaster. All the party's Ontario seats were lost. A leading member of the party, Bob Rae, is the Premier of Ontario but he has become highly unpopular.
 
Advertisement Gone Awry
 Mr. Chretien sensed early that the key issue was jobs. Ms. Campbell focused initially on the ballooning budget deficit and the need to cut it. But her presentation tended to bog down in details and her points were hard to follow for many Canadians.
Ms. Campbell also stumbled when she appeared in early comments to abandon hope of dramatically reducing unemployment before the end of the century. Another gaffe occurred when she remarked that an election campaign was not the time to discuss Canada's social programs.
A final blow was a series of advertisements taken out by the Tories that appeared to ridicule Mr. Chretien's facial paralysis. Mr. Chretien stood his ground with dignity. "It's true I have a physical defect," he said. "God gave it to me." Ms. Campbell pulled the ads.
Canadians complain that they are over-taxed. Yet there is a federal budget deficit of $35 billion ($27 billion United States), and interest on the mushrooming debt takes an ever larger share of expenditures.
Mr. Chretien wooed voters at least partly with the promise of a $6 billion ($4.5 billion) public-works program to upgrade roads, sewers and bridges. Ms. Campbell was highly critical of the program, asking where the money would come from and what people would do once the funds ran out.

THE GOVERNMENT: Canada is a constitutional monarchy, a self-governing dominion in the British Commonwealth. Queen Elizabeth II of England is also Canada's Queen. She delegates her largely ceremonial powers to the Governor General, Ramon J. Hnatyshyn. Its powers to the Governor General, Ramon J. Hnatyshyn. Its constitution was initially a British statute, the jBritish North America Act of 1867. Until 1982 its amendment required action by the British Parliament. In that year tghe Consitution was "patriated," meaning that Canadians obtained the right to amend the Constitution in Canada. Canada has two official languages, English and French, and two systems of law: Civil Law (in Quebec) and Common Law (in English Canada).
 
YESTERDAY'S VOTE: There were 2,155 candidates running in the 295 districts or ridings from 14 officially registered political parties.

HEADLINE: SWING VOTE SEEMS TO DRIFT TO MAYOR, BUT POLL IS CLOSE

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Hispanic New Yorkers, women and other vital swing voters appear to have drifted back toward Mayor David N. Dinkins in the last three weeks, but his overall support remains below 50 percent and voters continue to express enduring reservations about him in a close and unpredictable race, the latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll shows.
At the same time, Rudolph W. Giuliani's negative ratings on qualities like trustworthiness and leadership have crept up and his positive ratings have slipped a bit, though voters still overwhelmingly view him as the tougher candidate on crime, the No. 1 issue they say they want the next Mayor to address. 
 Just one week before Election Day, a majority of New Yorkers believe both candidates have spent more time attacking each other than explaining what they would do if elected. Four in 10 said Mr. Giuliani has been more responsible for the negative tone while just under one-quarter of voters surveyed blamed the Mayor.
 
Debate as a Requirement
 With little apparent prospect of a face-to-face debate between the two candidates, nearly 60 percent of voters said they should be required to debate, and nearly two-thirds said any debate should include the Conservative Party candidate, George J. Marlin, as Mr. Dinkins has insisted. Mr. Giuliani has refused to debate if Mr. Marlin is included.
Voters were evenly split over a ballot proposal to limit municipal officeholders to two consecutive four-year terms, with 47 percent favoring that idea and 47 percent opposing it.
Over all, the Democratic Mayor holds a slight edge, leading his Republican-Liberal challenger among registered voters 46 percent to 40 percent, which is just within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for each candidate. Another 1 percent supported Mr. Marlin -- a drop from past polls, despite his increased exposure in two televised debates with Mr. Dinkins. Two percent said they favored no one and 11 percent were undecided. The telephone poll, taken Wednesday through Sunday, interviewed 1,721 adults, of whom 1,147 said they were registered voters.
In other contests, Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi, the Democratic nominee for Comptroller, led Herman Badillo, the Republican-Liberal nominee, by 43 percent to 30 percent, while Mark Green, the Democratic candidate for Public Advocate held a commanding lead of 53 percent to 22 percent over Susan D. Alter, the Republican-Liberal candidate.
But there were signs that the mayoral race may be even closer than it seems. When undecided voters were pressed to say which way they were leaning, the contest tightened to 48 to 43, and among those who said they would definitely vote, Mr. Dinkins led 49 to 45. When, following the method used in a 1991 study by the Gallup Organization, the remaining undecided voters were allocated to the candidate of their own race, Mr. Dinkins led 49 to 48.
Moreover, past polls have substantially overstated support for black candidates, and a nationwide study of contests in which black and white candidates faced each other suggests that unless the black candidate holds a lead of 8 percentage points in pre-election polls, chances are he has no lead at all. That is because undecided voters -- most of whom are white -- tend to vote ultimately for the white candidate, instead of splitting evenly between the candidates.
In 1989, late polls showed double- digit leads for Mr. Dinkins, and he ended up defeating Mr. Giuliani by just 2 percentage points.
Still, the poll showed recent trends boding comparatively well for the Mayor. He now leads among Hispanic voters 51 percent to 31 percent, a much better standing than in earlier polls this year but still short of his 2 to 1 advantage among this group in 1989. He leads among women 49 percent to 34 percent, while his overall white support has edged up to 25 percent -- the minimum that Dinkins advisers have long said is necessary to win -- though his support among Jewish voters is hovering just below 25 percent, considerably less than the 35 percent he won in the last election.
By contrast, Mr. Giuliani appears to have stalled in his effort to improve his image with voters since the previous New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll at the beginning of the month, and his negative ratings have risen slightly, while Mr. Dinkins's have held steady, if decidedly mixed, with voters evenly divided over whether the Mayor shows strong qualities of leadership.
 
Criticizing Lapses
 In the last month, a prominent Dinkins supporter has accused Mr. Giuliani of attracting fascist elements, Dinkins campaign commercials have attacked his past equivocation on abortion rights, and Mr. Giuliani has responded by criticizing Mr. Dinkins for a litany of lapses beginning with his failure to file income-tax returns two decades ago.
All that fighting seems to have had an impact. For example, 31 percent of voters now say Mr. Giuliani does not have strong qualities of leadership, compared to 25 percent three weeks ago.
Thirty percent said he does not care about the needs and problems of average New Yorkers, compared to 26 percent three weeks ago, while 52 percent said he does care, down from 58 percent at the start of the month. Among Hispanic voters, 45 percent said Mr. Giuliani cared about the needs and problems of average New Yorkers, down from 58 percent at the beginning of the month, and well below the 73 percent of Hispanic New Yorkers who said Mr. Dinkins cared.
One-third of voters said Mr. Giuliani can be trusted to deal with the city's problems, down from 38 percent, and 50 percent said he might make serious mistakes, up from 46 percent.
The survey found that Mr. Giuliani's supporters are overwhelmingly motivated by their dissatisfaction with Mr. Dinkins, rather than by any attribute of Mr. Giuliani's that they could think of, with 44 percent of Giuliani voters citing unhappiness with the current administration as the main reason for backing him. In contrast, one-quarter of Dinkins voters said they backed him because he was the best man, four times the rate for Mr. Giuliani's supporters.
The poll also suggests that Mr. Giuliani has failed to make stick his charge that the Mayor is responsible for a steady decline in the conditions in the city. Nearly 6 in 10 voters said life has gotten worse in the city in the last four years, but just 15 percent of those who said conditions had worsened held the Mayor "mostly responsible."
Crime and drugs remain New Yorkers' top concern, with about half of voters citing those as the problems they wanted the next Mayor to concentrate on, and half saying the city is less safe than it was four years ago. But it is less clear how that plays out as a campaign issue, since a plurality of voters said they saw more police officers walking in their neighborhoods, nearly two-thirds said they had not seen anyone in their neighborhoods selling drugs and three-quarters said neither they nor anyone in their family had been the victim of a crime in the last year.
In the latest poll this month, black New Yorkers were about 10 percentage points less likely than white and Hispanic residents to say they had been the victim of a crime, breaking past patterns and confounding the statistical reality that blacks are more likely than others to be crime victims. That may suggest that with crime a major issue and the political future of the first black to be the city's Mayor at stake, blacks are reluctant to stress the issue.
Crime remains Mr. Giuliani's most potent issue, with 69 percent of voters saying he is tough enough to deal with it, compared with just 38 percent for the Mayor.
By contrast, the Mayor is perceived as the more caring. For example, 57 percent of white voters say people in their neighborhood would be treated fairly if Mr. Dinkins won re-election, while 56 percent of black voters said people in their neighborhoods would not be treated fairly if Mr. Giuliani won.
 
Looking Toward Turnout
 Bill Lynch, the Mayor's campaign manager, said the poll seemed to vindicate his strategy that core Democratic voters like women and Hispanic New Yorkers would return to the Dinkins camp once the candidates' records and philosophies were compared. But he expressed concern about complacency in drawing voters to the polls, and he plans a busy week of stumping, highlighted by a Thursday visit from President Clinton.
"Where I'm focused now is not on polls but on turning out the vote on Nov. 2," he said. "This helps us to be a little bit more optimistic that where we're headed is the right direction." "
Mr. Giuliani's top strategist, David Garth, said he was not surprised at the poll's findings. "That's the result of negative attacks that painted us unfairly, and a combination of the paid media ads and the free media that corroborated it," he said. "But I think we'll win because there are enough people out there that we can bring together."
While the contest remains volatile, 79 percent of each candidate's supporters said they had made up their minds, compared to 19 percent who said they might yet change their minds, down sharply from the 35 percent of Giuliani supporters who said they might change their minds three weeks ago.
A plurality of voters said that such problems as race relations and the economy would remain about the same whoever won, though the Mayor won slightly higher marks for race relations.
But Mr. Dinkins appeared to have substantially more intense support, with 59 percent of his backers strongly favoring him, compared to just 35 percent of Mr. Giuliani's supporters. Voters were evenly divided on the available candidates, with half expressing satisfaction at the choices and nearly half wishing they had other options.
Fifty-three percent now say President Clinton's suggestion that "too many of us are still to unwilling to vote for people who are different than we are" was not true, while 39 percent said it was true. That contrasts to early this month, just after the President spoke, when voters were evenly divided.
Mayor Edward I. Koch's endorsement of Mr. Giuliani was apparently a wash, with 69 percent of voters saying it would not influence them, while 14 percent said it would make them more likely to pick Mr. Giuliani and another 14 percent said it made them less likely to do so.
As has been true all year, voters' views of the candidates remained starkly polarized along racial lines, with just 18 percent of white voters having an over all favorable opinion of the Mayor and only 3 percent of blacks having a favorable view of Mr. Giuliani.
 
 
 
HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED
 The latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 20 to 24 in all parts of New York City with 1,721 adults, of whom 1,147 said they were registered voters. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of city exchanges. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each area in the city was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Yorkers.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus 4 percentage points for white registered voters, 6 points for black registered voters, and 8 points for Hispanic registered voters.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.
And in a poll conducted more than a week before an election, like this one, there are additional potential difficulties, like dramatic events, debates, or campaign appeals that occur after the interviewing, unusual patterns of voter turnout, and the ultimate decisions made by those voters who were undecided at the time of the poll or who said they might change their mind before Election Day.

Economic Outlaw: American Health Care

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
In health care today, fundamental principles of the marketplace do not apply.
Prices are not determined by supply and demand or by competition among producers. Comparison shopping is impossible. Greater productivity does not lower costs. 
 Sometimes, in fact, the system works exactly opposite of the way of the normal marketplace. For example, the providers of the service -- doctors and hospitals -- determine how much of their service their customers will buy. Their customers, the patients, can rarely evaluate the quality of the service they are receiving.
This is one reason medical costs are rising out of control -- and one reason almost every plan being considered for overhauling the system would try to introduce some basic economic principles.
Under President Clinton's plan, for instance, most Americans would be offered more choice than they now have about what kind of medical insurance coverage they carry. And competition among insurance companies and comparison shopping by consumers would be theoretically enhanced because most Americans would buy their medical insurance through large cooperatives that would negotiate for the best price and quality.
 
Insurance: Hiding the Costs
 Economists agree that the health care industry can never work entirely according to the rules of the marketplace. Unlike almost every other thing consumers spend money for, good health is priceless; people place no limit on what they will pay.
But economists also agree that medicine does not have to stray as far outside the marketplace as it does now. Here are some examples of how the American health care system operates with almost total disregard for basic economic principles.
The single most important deviation from the normal rules of economics involves the way medical insurance insulates consumers from the cost of the product they are purchasing. Insurance covers more than 90 percent of the hospital charges and more than 75 percent of the doctor bills Americans pay. This is why doctors normally do not post their rates and why patients generally do not take the trouble to find out the cost of treatment in advance.
Other forms of insurance that most people carry protect them against rare, costly occurrences like an automobile accident or a fire. Medical insurance, on the other hand, covers routine expenses. If people's car insurance paid 80 percent of the cost of normal maintenance and repairs, it is a safe bet that their cars would spend more time in the shop.
By the same token, Americans have every incentive to seek additional medical care, even if the benefit they stand to gain is modest compared with the total cost. It is not like deciding whether to take a suit to the cleaners to have a small spot removed or whether to order push-button windows on a new car.
Of course, health insurance is expensive. But mostly the premiums are paid by employers, and workers often have no idea how much they cost. Nor do most workers have any reason to believe that their paychecks would be larger if their medical insurance premiums and coverage were reduced.
Further masking the cost of health care is the fact that insurance premiums are tax-free. So workers often seek more generous insurance with lower deductibles and broader coverage rather than asking for the money in wages.
 
Consumerism
System Impedes Shopping for Value
 In contrast to the way people buy most products and services, they do little comparison shopping for medical treatments. One reason is that because of health insurance money is no object. Another obvious one is that people who are really sick are in no position to shop around.
Perhaps most important, a patient depends on a doctor to decide what treatment is needed. And a patient does not have the information or expertise to evaluate the quality of a doctor or the services being provided, as someone would judge, say, the ability and performance of a barber or even a lawyer.
Generally, a patient does not choose a hospital either; the selection is made by the patient's doctor on the basis of where the doctor practices, not on the basis of the quality of the hospital or the prices it charges.
Comparison shopping is further hindered by the fact that a consumer rarely knows the full range of alternative treatments available or the pluses and minuses of the various treatments.
To illustrate that point, researchers at Dartmouth Medical School tried to determine how patients would respond if they were thoroughly informed about various possible treatments. The researchers found, for example, that when they used videotapes and other techniques to explain carefully the advantages and disadvantages of prostate surgery, the number of patients at the Veterans Administration hospital in White River Junction, Vt., who decided against having such surgery increased significantly.
A study by Abt Associates, a consulting firm, found that doctors who performed and charged for their own radiological tests prescribed such tests at least four times as often and charged higher fees than did doctors who referred their patients to radiologists.
Pharmaceutical companies advertise heavily to persuade doctors to prescribe their products. When the patent expires on a profitable drug, the company owning the patent usually does not reduce the price of the medicine to compete with identical, lower-cost generic drugs that immediately come on the market. Instead, drug companies generally raise the price to pay for more advertising to persuade doctors to keep prescribing their product.
For example, since 1987, according to Senate testimony this year, McNeil Consumer Products Company, a division of Johnson & Johnson, has doubled the average price it charges wholesalers for Tylenol No. 3, a prescription painkiller, even though the generic drug cost one-third as much.
Consumers delegate decision-making authority in many fields other than medicine. For example, they generally rely on a mechanic to determine what work needs to be done on their car. The difference is that in markets other than medicine, there is a limit to what consumers are willing to pay. A mechanic gives a cost estimate in advance, and the customer makes an informed judgment on whether the work is worth the price.
 
Economics
Health Care Defies Laws of the Market
 The fundamental law of the marketplace is that of supply and demand. When the supply of a product exceeds the demand for it, the price should fall. This is the main reason peanut butter costs less than caviar.
But that law does not apply to medicine. If it did, prices would drop and doctors and hospitals would make less money when they were in oversupply. Instead, doctors and hospitals create their own demand.
Studies have repeatedly shown that the level of use of hospital beds in a community is determined largely by how many beds the community has. Clinton Administration officials often cite a study that compared hospital use in Boston and New Haven. Boston has 4.5 hospital beds for each 1,000 people in the area. New Haven has 2.9 beds per 1,000. The rate of hospital admissions are 50 percent higher in Boston than in New Haven. The hospitals in Boston did not reduce their prices; they admitted more patients.
In the same vein, Dr. John E. Wennberg, director of the Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences at Dartmouth, found a correlation between the number of surgeons in a community and the number of operations performed there. That helped explain why tonsillectomies were performed nine times more often in one Vermont town than in another, and why prostate surgery was four times more likely and hysterectomies three times more likely in some cities than in others.
One industry in which the law of supply and demand is often followed is pharmaceuticals. In one case that has received considerable attention recently, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic discovered that a drug made by Johnson & Johnson that had been used for 30 years as a deworming medicine for sheep at a cost of 6 cents a dose helped reduce the recurrence of colon cancer in people.
The Government and the Mayo Clinic performed all the research at no cost to the manufacturer and determined that the drug, levamisole, was safe and effective for human use. That meant a big rise in demand.
So when Johnson & Johnson marketed the drug for colon cancer, it raised the price a hundredfold, to $6 a dose.
 
Technology
Invention Becomes Mother of Necessity
 In the normal marketplace, new technology is introduced to improve productivity and lower costs. That is what happened, for example, when the steam engine replaced the horse and again when the internal combustion engine replaced steam. But in medicine, new technology seems to lower productivity. It certainly raises costs.
Productivity is usually defined in terms of units of output per worker. It is difficult to measure in medicine because a unit of health care is not so easily identifiable as a unit of a product that comes off an assembly line. But statistics compiled by the American Hospital Association seem to indicate that hospital productivity has dropped in the last decade.
The number of patients admitted to hospitals in the United States fell to 31 million in 1991 from 36 million in 1981, a decline of more than 14 percent. During the same decade, the average length of a hospital stay fell to 7.2 days from 7.6 days. But the number of positions on hospital staffs rose during that period by 17 percent, to 3.5 million from 3 million.
In other industries, technology often displaces workers. There could be many reasons for the decrease in productivity in hospitals, but administrators say new health care technologies have increased the demand for technicians to operate the advanced equipment.
 
The High Cost of Oversupply
 As for cost, new devices that have become parts of day-to-day medicine -- like magnetic resonance imagers, which permit doctors to see abnormalities in the brain, spine and other parts of the body, and lithotripters, which crush kidney stones with sound waves -- are expensive to purchase and operate.
They are made more expensive by the fact that they are in oversupply in many communities. Hospitals and clinics compete to have the latest equipment, often as a matter of prestige and to attract better doctors. The oversupply increases the prices charged for each use of the machine.
Researchers at the National Institutes of Health and at the Food and Drug Administration found, for instance, that the nation has three times more mammography machines than it would if each machine operated at capacity. But the doctors and hospitals that own the machines have not cut prices to attract customers. Instead, they have kept the price higher than necessary for each mammogram so they can amortize the cost of the machine.
Patients often demand that their doctors use the latest techniques. "In most things we buy," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office and the chief staff economist of Congress, "necessity is the mother of invention. In the health care world, invention is the mother of necessity. Once we discover something, we decide we need it."

HEADLINE: Met Opera Planning Summer Season In New Jersey in '96

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Opera has signed a letter of intent to make a planned $50 million theater at Waterloo Village in New Jersey its summer home beginning in 1996. The New York Philharmonic and American Ballet Theater, which also have no permanent summer locations, confirmed yesterday they are also in discussions with officials at Waterloo Village.
The plans for the Metropolitan, the Philharmonic and Ballet Theater, which were reported on Sunday in The Star-Ledger, are all contingent on the completion of the theater, to be built about half a mile from Waterloo Village in Allamuchy Mountain State Park, a town restored as a historic village for tourists and arts patrons. 
 "We hope that this will be New Jersey's Tanglewood," said Percival H. E. Leach, the chairman of the Waterloo Center for the Performing Arts, a nonprofit group. Waterloo Village, near Stanhope, N.J., has sponsored smaller arts events and a school of music, about an hour's drive west of Manhattan, since 1976.
Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey said yesterday that he approved release on Friday of $6 million in Economic Development Authority funds to pay for planning and development studies for the proposed theater, and Mr. Leach said that ground breaking could take place as soon as December. A design for the theater, by the architect Alexander Cooper of Cooper, Robertson & Partners in New York, was made public over the weekend.
 
Private Funds Needed
 The rest of the funds for the project are not in hand. Governor Florio said he supported a $21 million bond issue to help pay for the project, but even if the bond issue is approved, another $23 million in private funds would be needed. Mr. Leach, an interior designer who is a co-founder of Waterloo Village and has been working to build the project for decades, said the money would be supplied by corporate, foundation and individual donors.
In a letter of intent signed last Thursday by Joseph Volpe, the Metropolitan's general manager, the Met agreed to offer fully staged productions regularly at the arts center starting in 1996.
David Reuben, a spokesman for the Met, said that if the arts center were built, the Met would be most likely to perform there in the month of June, and would still keep its international performing commitments during the summer.
 
9,000 Seats Planned
 The theater is to be designed as an open-sided opera house, with a 135-foot-high fly loft, to accommodate set changes. There would be 4,000 covered seats and an additional 5,000 seats outside the theater for those on lawn chairs and blankets.
Mr. Cooper said he hoped the theater could be enclosed by movable panels, similar to the design of the Glimmerglass Opera House in Cooperstown, N.Y. Some opera performers prefer not to sing in unenclosed spaces.
"We feel that the performing-arts center will not only enhance cultural activities in New Jersey," said Governor Florio in an interview yesterday, "but will be an economic benefit to the region as well."
Unlike the possible departure of the New York Yankees to the Meadowlands, the summer flight of three distinguished arts organizations to New Jersey does not seem to pose a cultural threat to New York State. New York already has summer arts programming at Saratoga, and the Met, the Philharmonic and Ballet Theater would not be leaving their regular season homes in Manhattan.
Juanita Scarlett, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, said yesterday that "I'm sure the Governor would think it's wonderful that the people of New Jersey will be able to enjoy those institutions that make New York the cultural capital of the planet. We show off the Yankees around the country, and these are other superior assets that can help people appreciate all that New York has to offer."
 
A Marriage of Convenience
 Mr. Leach estimated the yearly operating budget for the planned summer series of the Met, the Philharmonic and Ballet Theater to be between $10 million and $15 million, which would be provided by the Waterloo center, not by the companies themselves, he said. The money would come from operating revenues and additional contributions, he said. Marketing studies have shown a strong demand for presentations of such top-caliber companies, he added, especially given the center's proximity to suburban New Jersey, Rockland County and New York City.
If the Waterloo plan is realized, it will be a marriage of convenience. The Met and the Philharmonic have year-round contracts with their artists, and are constantly seeking to expand the number of summer play dates. And the Waterloo project needs big-name talent to attract the kind of fund-raising that will be needed to complete the project.
Deborah Borda, the executive director of the New York Philharmonic, said: "It's been no secret that the Philharmonic has been reconsidering its summer activities. Waterloo looks like a very exciting plan." She said, however, that the Philharmonic, which is one of the few major orchestras that has no regular summer home, was exploring a number of other options besides the Waterloo center, including several in New York City and Westchester County, though she would not specify them.
American Ballet Theater has also not yet made any commitment to perform at Waterloo. "We look forward to it and we hope it's going forward," said Robert Pontarelli, the company's public relations director. "But there is no signed contract and no financial agreement."
Mr. Pontarelli said that if Ballet Theater appeared at Waterloo, "we would perform our regular programs with the full company." Last summer the company did not have a regular engagement after its six-week season at the Metropolitan Opera that ended on June 12.
Mr. Leach said yesterday that the pianist Byron Janis would be the artistic director of the proposed arts center. Mr. Janis said yesterday that the idea of the arts center was "exciting," and expressed confidence that the Philharmonic and Ballet Theater would come to terms with the organization.
In a related matter, the critic and magazine publisher Samuel Lipman said yesterday that he had been discharged as artistic director of the Waterloo Music Festival and School. Since 1985 Mr. Lipman, the publisher of The New Criterion and music critic for Commentary magazine, had been coordinating the programming of the festival, a six-week program of classical music, from July to the second week in August.
Mr. Lipman said he was "quite surprised" to have been dismissed when he received a call yesterday afternoon from Carol Delaire, the administrative director of the Waterloo Festival. Mr. Lipman said he believed the festival school had been a success, and the festival programming "had managed to change the repertory of American music." Mr. Lipman said the festival owed him $11,000 for his services during previous summers, and said he had been told that the festival had no money to continue this summer.
But Mr. Leach denied that Mr. Lipman had been released. "I hope to continue our relationship with Sam," he said, "but I haven't decided in what capacity." He said the festival will be reorganized under the arts-center management under Mr. Janis, and that he hoped Mr. Lipman would "make a contribution."

Getting Your Feet Wet In a Sea Called Internet

BYLINE: By L. R. SHANNON

 BODY:
"THE government always discovers a technology after its moment is passing," the economist and author George Gilder says in an interview in the September/October issue of Wired. "It's not going to change with Clinton and Gore. The dog technologies run to Washington, decked out like poodles. The politician is always the dog's best friend."
One of the technologies Vice President Al Gore is pushing is the information superhighway, which will link everyone at home or office to everything else -- movies and television shows, shopping services, electronic mail and huge collections of data -- starting perhaps with the elaborate structure envisioned by Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications. But the Internet, already linking 10 million to 15 million people in a version of the data superhighway (albeit without movies and shopping), shows, in Mr. Gilder's words, that "to have a very rich fabric of services you don't need a regimented system of control." 
 No one is in charge of the Internet. You do not visit a retail outlet to buy the sign-up software or fill out a card that flutters out of a magazine. Yet the Internet, which grew out of a 1969 Department of Defense contract to connect university, military and defense contractors, keeps growing; no one really knows how much or how fast. Paul Gilster, in "The Internet Navigator: The Essential Guide to Network Exploration for the Individual Dial-Up User" (John Wiley & Sons; $24.95), writes that by 1985, "approximately 100 networks formed the Internet." He continues:
"By 1989, that number had risen to 500. The Network Information Center of the Defense Data Network Information Center found 2,218 networks connected as of January 1990. By June 1991, the National Science Foundation Network Information Center pegged it at close to 4,000, and connections have more than doubled within the last two years. If we extrapolate based on current numbers, the Internet could reach 40 million people by 1995, 100 million by 1998. Its current growth rate is 15 percent monthly."
Most individual users have formal or informal connections to a network linked to the Internet. "Formal" means working for or attending a member company or university; "informal" means having worked for a member or being able to ingratiate oneself with a strategically placed officer. Michael Fraase, in his breezy "The Mac Internet Tour Guide" (Ventana Press; $27.95 with disk), devotes four sections to general instructions "about who to befriend and what arcane terms to utter so you'll sound like a seasoned expert." Commercial on-line services like Compuserve, America Online and Delphi have begun to add Internet links, some limited to sending and receiving electronic mail, others with full service. A host of so-called service providers, providing gateways to the Internet, have also sprung up -- probably three or four hosts if you do not read this first thing in the morning.
Connecting a business to the Internet can cost thousands of dollars, depending on its size; an individual without a real or feigned relationship to a member organization can seek a service provider. Rates are reasonable, considering what the money buys. For instance, the Pipeline, a service provider getting under way in New York City, charges $15 a month for five hours on the Internet and $2 for each additional hour. A $20 fee is good for 20 hours a month, and $35 buys unlimited access.
Without even trying, I have gathered eight new or recently updated books on the Internet. With, say, MCI Mail or Prodigy, you can learn as you go along. The Internet not only deserves preparation, it absolutely demands it. One reason is that, as noted, nobody is in charge. Another is that the Internet prefers to speak UNIX, an unfriendly language in which your address might be "hildyj.chi.il.us." You can get by, as you can in most other foreign countries, by speaking English and learning the UNIX equivalent of "Where is the bathroom, please?" and a few other stock lines. But to be completely comfortable, you will have to be able to say, in UNIX, "It seems to me and to most of my peers, epistemologically speaking, that Forster is flaccid." Ordinary people will applaud Windows and Macintosh software.
 
More Books on Internet
 "Internet: Getting Started" (PTR Prentice Hall; $28), edited by April Marine, Susan Kirkpatrick and Vivian Neou, and "Internet: Mailing Lists" (PTR Prentice Hall; $29), edited by Edward T. L. Hardie and Vivian Neou, have been updated. "The Internet Guide for New Users" (McGraw-Hill; $40 hardcover, $27.95 paperback), by Daniel P. Dern, goes into more detail than the books already mentioned, which can be viewed as an advantage or not. Mr. Dern is also the editor of a new bimonthly magazine, Internet World, $4.95. "Navigating the Internet" (Sams; $24.95), by Mark Gibbs and Richard J. Smith, also gains, or loses, points for comprehensiveness. O'Reilly & Associates of Sebastopol, Calif., publishes both a slim and a fat volume. "Connecting to the Internet" ($15.95), by Susan Estrada, is the first; "The Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog" ($24.95), by Ed Krol, is the second.

HEADLINE: UKRAINE MISSILES: TERMS ARE TOUGH

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Reflecting the ambivalence and political pressures involved in becoming a non-nuclear state, Ukraine's leaders told Secretary of State Warren Christopher today that they were committed to ridding the country of nuclear weapons, but wanted billions of dollars and pledges of Western military protection to do it.
Even then, Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko told reporters at a joint news conference with Mr. Christopher, there was no guarantee that Ukraine's Parliament would approve the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, as demanded by the United States. 
 "I cannot give you any promises," he said, adding that the decision was in the hands of the Parliament.
For his part, Mr. Christopher said both Mr. Kravchuk and members of the Parliament "gave a clear commitment to me that they desire a non-nuclear furture for Ukraine." But when pressed, Mr. Christopher acknowledged that there was one issue to be resolved: "Timing."
 
Stiffened Its Conditions
 In the last several months, Ukraine, whose missiles and bombers make it the world's third largest nuclear power after the United States and Russia, has stiffened its conditions for destroying them, largely because of a growing pro-nuclear lobby in its Parliament. The United States has responded by trying to moderate Ukraine's behavior by offering it economic incentives, which Mr. Zlenko suggested today were woefully inadequate.
At dinner tonight, Mr. Kravchuk and Mr. Christopher hammered out the final details of a complicated technical agreement that spells out how Ukraine intends to spend $175 million in American funds to begin the dismantling of its nuclear weapons. Mr. Christopher and Mr. Zlenko signed the agreement, the main obstacle in unfreezing the money earmarked for dismantlement.
The United States has also recently pledged to give Ukraine $155 million in economic aid and loan guarantees in the 1994 fiscal year.
But Mr. Zlenko told reporters that Ukraine needed $2.8 billion to dismantle and destroy its nuclear weapons. He also complained about Russia's failure to compensate Ukraine for the highly enriched uranium in the missiles that were sent to Moscow last year, adding that the uranium contained in the weapons still on Ukrainian soil had a commercial value of $5 billion.
 
Praise for Ukrainian
 As part of its strategy to embrace, rather than criticize Ukraine's behavior, Mr. Christopher lauded Mr. Kravchuk, saying he promised today to try to persuade the Parliament to approve both the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start I, and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a package.
Last week Mr. Kravchuk told reporters that Ukraine might want to keep its SS-24's, but today he told Mr. Christopher that he had been misquoted, a senior State Department official said.
Mr. Christopher was so concerned about extracting a clear commitment on nuclear disarmament from Mr. Kravchuk that more than a third of their 55-minute meeting was devoted to the subject, a senior Administration official said. Mr. Christopher told reporters that Mr. Kravchuk assured him that an agreement signed in Lisbon last November in which Ukraine -- along with Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus -- agreed to become non-nuclear powers "applies to all strategic offensive arms" in Ukraine, including the SS-19's and the SS-24's, the most advanced missiles in the old Soviet arsenal..
Earlier in the day Mr. Christopher met with influential members of Parliament, who rejected his appeal to get rid of all of its long-range nuclear weapons and join the nonproliferation treaty, the 1968 treaty that prohibits the development, maintenance or traffic in nuclear weapons.
Dmytro Pavlychko, who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview that the Parliament could ratify Start I as early as next month, but added that the nonproliferation treaty could not be ratified until next year at the earliest, and only then with at least $2 billion to help dismantle Ukraine's nuclear weapons.
Mr. Pavlychko said he told Mr. Christopher that Ukraine must have a formal Western pledge of military protection before the former Soviet republic could dismantle all of its 130 SS-19 missiles under Start I.
"It is not enough for the United States to say, 'I guarantee your security,' and then say goodbye," he said.

HEADLINE: Ukraine's Wasting Nuclear Asset

 BODY:
It's two down and one to go among the republics that inherited nuclear arms when the Soviet Union broke up. Kazakhstan is about to follow Belarus's lead and get rid of its nuclear legacy. That leaves a lone holdout: stubborn Ukraine.
Ukraine has turned its tactical nuclear arms over to Russia for dismantling. And it's removing the warheads from aging SS-19 missiles. But President Leonid Kravchuk, who last year pledged to give up all of Ukraine's arms, now wants to keep some. The ones he has in mind, 46 intercontinental-range SS-24 missiles, were designed to target the U.S., and fly too far to strike most of Russia. 
 Ostensibly, Mr. Kravchuk is driving a hard bargain in an effort to win financial aid from the West. But his eagerness to appease Ukrainian nationalists could be a deal-stopper.
The nationalists see nuclear arms as a symbol of power and don't want to give them up. But nuclear weapons won't put food on the table. They're an expensive distraction from the true threat: the social unrest that's sure to follow if Ukraine's economy collapses. Unless Ukraine is prepared to spend billions it can't afford to pay for the infrastructure to control, re-target and maintain the warheads, they are a wasting asset.
Belarus and Kazakhstan understood that and knew the time had come to cut a deal. Belarus has begun to send its nuclear missiles back to Russia for dismantling. Washington has already provided financial inducements. The U.S. could also help things along by supporting Belarus's bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. That would provide an important reminder to Ukraine and others that nuclear arms do not assure a seat at the head table.
Kazakhstan has agreed to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by year's end. For its troubles it will get $140 million in economic aid and much, much more, like investment to develop its oil and natural gas, $85 million to help dismantle its nuclear arsenal and millions more to clean up the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk.
Kazakhstan's President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, wants a face-to-face meeting with President Clinton to clinch the deal. President Kravchuk of Ukraine also wants a summit soiree in Washington before facing the electorate back home. But why give him one now? Rewarding Mr. Nazarbayev with a photo opportunity while denying one to Mr. Kravchuk would allow Mr. Clinton to show that the way to win Washington's favors is to disarm.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
On Civil Respect

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
In the end, the mayoralty election in New York City will depend on how many New Yorkers vote for civil respect as their first priority.
Civil respect is based on civil liberty. But it goes beyond, to problems that affect our lives and cannot be decided simply by law. Easing these problems depends on the government's respect for the citizens and the citizens' respect for each other -- voluntary or imposed. 
 Civil respect includes some specific freedoms: freedom from street crime and street harassment, freedom from local regulations and taxes that drive business out and turn hamburger-flipping into the career future, freedom from sloppy, inefficient government, freedom from neglect for the mentally wounded, freedom from pushers, freedom from users, freedom from schools that don't teach children and from children who shoot other children.
Civil respect and the quality of democratic life are part of each other, rising or falling together.
During the Dinkins administration the quality of life became worse. We live here, we work here and we know. New Yorkers may not be smarter than the rest of the world, but they are not more stupid.
If polls are really needed, see today's New York Times/WCBS-TV News study. It shows 59 percent of New Yorkers interviewed thought life in the city got worse during the Dinkins years. Quality of life includes the city's economy, race relations, crime and public education. Eight percent thought life was better and thirty percent thought it was just the same.
If most New Yorkers think their lives are worse after one Dinkins term and only 8 percent think they are better off, why are so many thinking of voting for a second, enough to make the race too close to call?
Some like and approve of Mr. Dinkins, very much. Some very much do not like or approve of Rudolph Giuliani. They do not like the idea that he was a prosecutor, or think he was too tough.
Or they do not like the way he tried to prevent his supporters from being sore losers last election night by telling them to be quiet. Save our souls, New Yorkers never heard such terrible language.
Or they think he is a fascist -- a plain anti-Italian lie out of the Dinkins camp. Or white New Yorkers may feel guilty for considering voting against an African-American, a sensation encouraged by President Clinton. That we do not need; New Yorkers can feel guilty at the drop of an autumn leaf.
Black New Yorkers have been hurt, perhaps most, by the drop of the quality of life. But since they will vote overwhelmingly for Mr. Dinkins, they obviously feel that a black Mayor, even one who has not improved their lives, is better than a white one who has not had the chance to try. Such very heavy black preference for black may be understandable, but Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dinkins ought to spare us piety about voting across color lines.
Dinkins people call black-for-black voting a matter of pride. Mr. Giuliani says he does not want the support of voters who would choose him for "pride" of color or ethnicity. Strain an ear: no applause from my friends who would have danced liberal fandangos had Mr. Dinkins said that.
Write off voters who will vote for reasons of race, emotion, bigotry, distaste or party. What's left are those who would vote for a candidate of any party, religion, hue or hair style. Most of them are middle-class, strivers by upbringing.
They are among the majority who say their lives are getting worse. But these New Yorkers often are embarrassed about voting as so many other Americans do, for their economic self-interest. They think of that as selfish. They long for something that would better express their sense of American hope. And there is something better: civil respect.
The phrase has not been used in the campaign, although I hereby release copyright. But my New York ears and stomach tell me that more New Yorkers see that their best interest and the city's are the same -- civil liberty expanded to civil respect, and that one withers without the other.
So I think the election will turn on how many New Yorkers vote on the one major issue. Which candidate will do the most to heighten the quality of life in New York and, by whatever name New Yorkers yearn for it, build civil respect?

HEADLINE: Jordan's Role in Israeli-Palestinian Peace Effort;
To Invigorate Economy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The Clinton Administration and the international community have correctly recognized that rapid economic development in the West Bank and Gaza is critical to the success of any peace agreement. The Palestine Liberation Organization, Israel, the United States and the West now share the common goals of economic stability and a rapid decrease in unemployment for the Palestinians. To this end the United States is currently organizing donations from the OECD to a multibillion dollar investment fund for projects in the West Bank and Gaza. Planning and implementation of investments will take time. They cannot be expected to create new jobs immediately. In the meantime, an additional, simple mechanism to aid the Palestinians would be a unilateral reduction of tariffs on exports from the West Bank and Gaza. 
 A reduction of tariffs, in addition to the proposed investment fund has several advantages:
(1) The potential impact on the employment and on the general well-being of Palestinians is huge. Low wage rates, together with current high rates of unemployment, imply a comparative advantage for the West Bank and Gaza in labor-intensive industries. Exports will therefore grow in branches such as agriculture and textiles, which require only minimal investment. Thus, many new jobs could be created within months of implementation. (In contrast, much of the investment from the fund will go to infrastructure projects that are not labor intensive and will have lengthy planning stages before they can create many jobs.)
(2) Any country in the world could join as an act of good will with a minimal impact on the local economy. The economies of the West Bank and Gaza are too small to be a threat to any local industry in the West. In the current state of affairs in most world markets, even a full abolition of tariffs would generally create new trade while diverting little existing trade from current exporters of labor intensive goods.
(3) A unilateral reduction in tariffs requires no lengthy trade negotiations. Such a reduction in tariffs by the European Community, the United States and other OECD countries can provide a much needed complement to an investment fund. It will let the market do what it does best -- generate new jobs in response to economic opportunity, while governmental aid can do what governments do best -- provide a sound infrastructure for a better future.

HEADLINE: The Family Farm Doesn't Exist Anymore

 BODY:

To the Editor:
After you exposed the economic and political incestuous relationship between the United States Department of Agriculture and corporate agribusiness, which has been destroying our family farm system of agriculture for decades ("Tainted Trade," front-page series, Oct. 10-12), one would have hoped for a more enlightened followup analysis in "The Politics of Food" (editorial, Oct. 16). 
 By denouncing "farmers" as "the nation's richest welfare recipients," you perform not only a grave disservice to the struggling thousands of men, women and children who annually grow and harvest our agricultural bounty, but also you seriously mislead the public as to who really pays and who profits when it comes to the manufacturing of our food supply.
To subscribe to the many corporate agribusiness shibboleths you propound, as Laura B. DeLind, a Michigan State University social anthropologist, argues, makes family farmers readily susceptible to (and firm believers in) agricultural programs, services, technologies and research that promote "efficient," businesslike farm management and production. In turn, strategies of commercial "self-improvement" serve an economic and political system dominated by corporate capital.
"The family farm, like the 'emperor's new clothes,' does not exist," Ms. DeLind argues. "It is a torturous twisting of reality, under the guise of 'conventional wisdom' . . .
"By accommodating all major organizational variation within a single conceptual category, the systematic reasons, particularly the economic and political reasons, for operational differences among farming enterprises are obscured. These latter are built, not on personality, managerial ability or individual effort, the perceived 'quality' of ownership, but on differential control over the processes and resources of production."
As Ms. DeLind concludes: "The category family farm must be pried apart. It must be opened up so that its internal contradictions can be seen, not hidden, and used as a basis for identifying and comparing the relative class positions of producers. This would provide a keener awareness of the structure of agriculture . . .
"In addition, any long-term action to reform the system -- to bring about a more equitable distribution of power and income -- must rest on class-based alliances which cut across the 'family farm' category."

HEADLINE: Knocked Out by the Freshmen

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Perpetually teetering on the edge in Washington's annual budget battles, the superconducting supercollider had managed to survive one brush with death after another like an alley cat with extra spring in its legs.
But the proton smasher lost its ninth life on the House floor last week, the victim of a new generation of politicians whose faith in big science has been shaken by the kind of cost overruns and construction delays that have dogged the supercollider for years. 
 Eighty-one of the 113 freshmen casting votes in the House moved to kill the project, defying the advice of President Clinton and the House leadership of both parties. It was a majority so overwhelming that House leaders could not revive their strategy of last year, which was to go along with the Senate's solid support for the project even after the House voted to kill the project.
Many of the freshmen have challenged the old boy network by which members of Congress vote for each other's projects as an exercise in mutual backscratching that assures their re-elections but also drives up the deficit. The backbenchers have made limited progress, in part because they have been just as meek about tackling automatic spending programs like Medicaid as their elders.
 
Space Station Is Target
 But in the case of the supercollider, those freshmen not representing the construction states of Texas and Louisiana found a cause they could rally against without offending any vital constituency back home. Likewise, the vast majority of House freshmen voted last week to kill the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's $3.7 billion advanced solid rocket motor project, which was designed to enable the space shuttle to carry heavier cargoes at higher altitudes in orbit. And many freshmen now say they are preparing to take aim at the space station next year.
"It was the House freshmen who were the driving force," grumbled Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat who strongly favored the supercollider project. "They are the product of an angry electorate that wants to cut projects and cut perks. Basically, they are at war with the institution of Congress."
To listen to the post-mortems from the proponents and opponents of the project is to hear two different visions of the Government's role in science, and the replacement of the once limitless faith that politicians put in scientists with a view that the wasteful ways of science contractors must be curtailed.
"This new generation of leaders doesn't understand the difference between an expenditure and an investment," complained Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a six-term New Jersey Democrat and who was a supporter of the supercollider on the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. "Listening to the debate, I wondered if this Congress would have invested in the railroads or the early development of aviation. It certainly is not a Congress that would have invested in the space program."
Representative Martin R. Hoke, a Republican freshman from Ohio who is also a member of science panel, voiced a different view. "If we find more basic building blocks of the universe," he said, "it's not going to change the way people live."
 
'Cancer' of Runaway Budget
 He added that the project's runaway budget, the fact that its estimated cost rose from $4.4 billion to more than $11 billion in just over seven years, demonstrated that the supercollider was "reflective of a cancer, the way a lot of these projects get sold in the first place."
"They are sold on the basis of numbers that are fraudulently produced with the contractors knowing that they are able to obtain more money later," he said.
Only 25 years ago, when Americans were more optimistic about their economic future and frightened that the Soviet Union could pull ahead in technology, 5.2 percent of the Federal budget was devoted to nonmilitary scientific research. That figure gradually dwindled to 1.8 percent of the budget last year, as Federal spending on programs like veterans' benefits, Medicaid and Medicare mushroomed, and research spending more or less stagnated.
If all nonmilitary science spending were cut this year, the budget deficit would still climb. But to the freshmen, the supercollider was a ripe symbolic fruit ready for picking. Several put the program on their pet lists for cuts during their election campaigns along with mohair subsidies and House mail franking privileges.
"We are spontaneously as a group against all unnecessary spending, and we were elected on that," said Representative Karen Shepherd, a freshman Utah Democrat. Another Democratic freshman, Representative Blanche M. Lambert of Arkansas, said: "We all campaigned on fiscal responsibility. The bottom line was money."
"There's double-digit unemployment in my district," Ms. Lambert continued, "and this project didn't create any jobs in my district. For all the money, where was the return?"
Congressional supporters of the program knew they had an uphill fight with the incoming freshmen, so Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, sent every one of them extensive literature on the project before they arrived in Washington and invitations to visit Waxahachie to see construction in progress. But only a handful accepted the invitation, and by their own account, few freshmen studied the program as closely as other issues like health care and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"It's not something I stayed up at night reading about," said Representative Ernest J. Istook Jr., a Republican freshman from Oklahoma who voted against the supercollider. "The decision had to be made on what you can afford to do and what you cannot afford to do."
Representative Sam Coppersmith, a freshman Democrat from Arizona who is a member of the science committee, thought long and hard about the project, and concluded that it did have noteworthy scientific merit. But in the end, he voted against the project, because of the cost overruns.
"There should be some penalty for promising and not performing," he concluded.

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
Canadian With Mandate: Joseph Jacques Jean Chretien

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The Conservative Party derided him as "yesterday's man" because he faithfully served Prime Ministers Lester B. Pearson, Pierre Elliott Trudeau and John N. Turner.
But by placing today's problems in the hands of Jean Chretien, who will become the country's next Prime Minister, Canada's voters said experience must count for something. Among the nation's problems are getting people back to work, adjusting trade relationships and preserving national unity. 
 Voters gave the Liberals a resounding mandate, with 178 seats in the 295-seat House of Commons, up from 79, and slashed the Progressive Conservatives from 153 to 2, the most punishing blow to any governing party in Canadian history. Even the Conservative Prime Minister, Kim Campbell, lost her seat in Vancouver.
But despite a comfortable majority, Mr. Chretien will have to work with a Parliament fractured by regional rivalries. Two regional parties surged in the voting: The separatist Bloc Quebecois won 54 seats and the populist Reform Party, based in Alberta, won 52.
 
Challenge of a Deficit
 But the biggest challenge for the new Government, which is expected to be installed within the next two weeks, is a crushing budget deficit, higher on a per-capita basis than the deficit in the United States. The deficit tightly restricts the maneuvering room for job creation.
"The main constraints on the Government's power are not going to come from a vigorous opposition," said Alasdair McKichan, president of the Retail Council of Canada. "They're going to be coming from the demands of Canada's international creditors."
Pressure from the other direction seems sure to come from Bob White, the head of the 2.2-million-member Canadian Labor Congress, who warned that Mr. Chretien has to make good quickly on his promised $6 billion public works program, which is intended to create up to 120,000 jobs over two years. "He's got the trust of a lot of Canadians based on the economy being the No. 1 issue," said Mr. White. "And if he fails to start addressing that issue, then he'll lose an enormous amount of credibility."
Exporters are worried about Liberal hostility to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which broadens the bilateral agreement with the United States to include Mexico.
Mr. Chretien has said he wants to renegotiate Nafta. But the new leader has never specified what the renegotiation would entail. At this stage no one knows whether it would stymie the deal, though the assessment in Washington is that it would not.
In a sense, Mr. Chretien's position is similar to that of President Clinton last January, when he too was hemmed in by economic constraints on a jobs program, and he too sought improvements in the free trade pact.
 
Mutual Needs
 Still, most analysts say Mr. Chretien will back away from precipitating a crisis with Washington over trade.
Two reasons are cited: First, he needs the support of the business community if his economic initiatives are to work, and fighting Nafta will not win him many business friends. Second, given Canada's export dependence on the United States, Canada would be hurt far more if the tariff walls were to rise again. The United States takes about 75 percent of Canadian exports, and exports are responsible for about a quarter of the Canadian economy.
"Would the Liberals really want to intervene in a complicated process and antagonize the President?" asked Maureen Appel Molot, director of the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs at Carleton Unversity in Ottawa. "I think not. They'll have neither the time nor the inclination."
 
Underestimated by Others
 As the Tories recently discovered, one of Mr. Chretien's strengths is the tendency for others to underestimate him. He cultivates a rough-hewn demeanor, exacerbated by a sometimes awkward use of English, which he did not seriously take up until he was elected to the House of Commons, at 29.
"Maurice Chevalier and I had to practice to keep our French accent in English," he likes to say jokingly. "It has become a kind of trademark."
But the lack of polish in this 59-year-old lawyer from Shawinigan, a mill town 50 miles northeast of Montreal, conceals what Maclean's, the newsweekly, calls a "shrewdness and calculating ambition."
 
A Country Childhood
 Joseph Jacques Jean Chretien, was born Jan. 11, 1934, the 18th of 19 children born to Marie Boisvert Chretien. "In those days," he says, "God decided how many kids people had." His father, Wellie, was a machinist in a paper mill and moonlighted as secretary of the Shawinigan municipality to help send the children to college.
Jean did not do as well as his siblings at school. One of his problems was shyness about a birth defect that had left him deaf in his right ear and distorted his mouth.
During the political campaign, the Tories took out advertisement that seemed to ridicule Mr. Chretien's appearance, but the ads backfired. With great dignity, he told reporters: "It's true I have a physical defect. God gave it to me."
Mr. Chretien's father and grandfather were Liberal Party organizers, and it was from them that Jean developed a taste for politics. "I argued for the Liberals in the poolroom near our home," he recalled in his autobiography. His grandfather, Francois Chretien, had also been Mayor of a small nearby village, St. Etienne des Gres, for 30 years.
The family had always been Liberal, in the free-thinking, anti-clerical, anti-establishment tradition of the 19th century. His pitch was to the working class because the Liberal Party in the Shawinigan of that day was supported by unions and workers.
 
Defeated in 1984
 Defeated in his first bid for leadership of the Liberals in 1984, he returned in 1990 to rally the dispirited party on his terms and at his own pace. Monday's triumph was sweet vindication.
His wife, Aline, told an interviewer for Saturday Night magazine some years ago that her husband had plotted a career that only went upward.
"It was to always advance, to keep moving up," she said. "It was to never stay at the same level, and he hopes that his friends will tell him if he begins slipping."
Mr. Chretien is a Quebecer who has little use for separatism. As a result, the separatists have little use for him.
Lucien Bouchard, who heads Bloc Quebecois, said at one point in the campaign that Mr. Chretien had no business even representing a district in Quebec because of his views. To this, Mr. Chretien hotly replied that he had as much right as Mr. Bouchard.
The two men will have many more face-offs. By virtue of Bloc Quebecois' strength in the new House, Mr. Bouchard is the leader of the official opposition.
Mr. Chretien says Quebecers have wanted to "rewrite history" ever since their ancestors lost the battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759.
 
Flight of Money and Jobs
 Yet Quebecers, he maintains, end up only paying the price for independence without ever experiencing the euphoria of it. The price is the money and jobs that have left the province in recent years as a result of uncertainty about the future, a price that is likely to continue being paid as the threat of separatism again increases.
"Part of their intense reaction against me," Mr. Chretien said in his autobiography, "came because I had to demystify their great dream."

HEADLINE: Going Private -- A special report;
Mexico Sells Off State Companies, Reaping Trouble as Well as Profit

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico

 BODY:
When Mexico first said it was going to sell off or shut down its vast network of Government-run businesses, many people were skeptical, thinking they had heard such promises before from third-world governments that ran bloated industrial bureaucracies.
A decade later, Mexico is nearing the end of one of the most sweeping sales of state companies in the world. In all, the Government has sold or dissolved more than 80 percent of the 1,155 businesses it once ran. 
 The sale of the state companies has brought the Government more than $21 billion. Almost all of that went to retire part of the national debt, helping the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari slow inflation from more than 150 percent to below 10 percent and open up the economy to competition and outside investment.
 
400,000 Jobs Are Lost
 The savings on debt payments have also enabled Mexico to spend more on social programs and move ahead with even bolder economic reforms, including negotiation of a North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States.
But there are signs that the privatization program has aggravated many problems instead of easing them. For example, whittling back government industry has cost more than 400,000 jobs since 1983, causing widespread social hardship.
In addition, getting government out of business did not always lead to greater efficiency, more competition or a better life for ordinary Mexicans. In many cases, the new private owners have proved to be just as unresponsive to workers and consumers as the old government bureaucrats.
In recent months, moreover, the privatization program has stumbled because what was being offered did not generate enough interest from investors.
 
A Model, World Bank Says
 The program has been described by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as a model for other developing countries, which have not been nearly as successful at pulling out of industries.
However, of the 940 businesses the Government disposed of, far more were closed than sold. Of those sold, the overwhelming majority were through acceptance of private bids, usually from wealthy Mexican investors, rather than through public stock offerings to employees or the public.
Sales did not guarantee success. Mexico's largest shipyard, Astilleros Unidos de Veracruz, was sold with great hopes to Norwegian investors in 1991 but is now nearly bankrupt because of labor disputes and a slowdown in business. Dozens of old sugar mills sold off in the last few years have closed, causing hardships for workers and cane growers alike.
The privatized telephone company is still a sluggish monopoly, with customers waiting a year or more for installation and thousands of lines out of service at any given time.
 
A Few Investors Become Rich
 Doing business with a privatized bank can be a costly nightmare, since the investors who bought them seem intent on recouping their investment in a few years by charging sky-high rates for loans. And the two privatized television stations have done little more than rejigger their old menu of soap operas and sports programs.
Perhaps the deepest disappointment is a common feeling that in selling off what some consider the national patrimony, the Government has favored a few investors, who have become fabulously rich. Instead of paving the way for competition in goods and services, the program has increased competition among the handful of families vying to be Mexico's wealthiest clan.
"The booty of privatization has made multimillionaires of 13 families, while the rest of the population -- some 80 million Mexicans -- has been subjected to the same gradual impoverishment as though they had suffered through a war," a columnist, Alvaro Cepeda Neri, wrote in La Jornada, a leftist Mexico City newspaper.
Luis Rubio, a political scientist in Mexico City, said: "This Government has proved to be a first-class manager of the economy. What it hasn't done is anything to increase competition."
Government officials say that competition, though desirable, was never really their goal. Rather, the priority was efficiency, they say, along with elimination of costly subsidies and debilitating losses.
 
The Program
Some Now Sniff At the Offerings
 For a long time, private investors seemed willing to take a chance and relieve the Government of those responsibilities. But times have changed.
Last month, the sale of a shrimp-exporting company with $250 million in sales, Ocean Garden Products Inc., was abruptly put off because the bids submitted to the Government were too low. The sale of El Nacional, a newspaper that adheres to the line of the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, was dropped for the same reason. And the state-owned oil company, Pemex, scuttled plans to sell secondary petrochemical refineries this year because it did not think it could get a good price.
Government officials say that such stumbling blocks are temporary and that they plan to offer the same companies for sale at the end of this year or early next year after doing a better job of promoting interest among investors. Officials at the San Diego-based Ocean Garden, owned by the Mexican Government, say foreign investors will be allowed to bid this time, and the size of staff at El Nacional has been slashed to reduce costs and make the newspaper a more attractive investment.
"The people love to buy when we have already managed the cleanup," said Mexico's Finance Minister, Pedro Aspe, who is generally credited with the Government's privatization strategy.
Government officials say they must increase productivity as Mexico, the United States and Canada prepare for passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would eliminate most trade barriers between the three countries. Even the main Mexican labor confederation believes that job cutbacks were necessary.
"The whole effort has been good for the economy of the country," said Juan S. Millan Lizarraga, Secretary of Education for the Confederation of Mexican Workers. "There had to be some adjustments in personnel."
"What has been worse," he said, "is the situation of those workers in industries that have been kept by the Government."
Mr. Millan was speaking of Pemex, which has reduced its payroll by 100,000 workers, mostly through early-retirement programs. Like electricity, railroads and other businesses that the Constitution defines as strategic, oil is generally excluded from the privatization program, though Pemex has entered several projects with foreign investors to drill for or refine the petroleum that Mexico still controls.
 
The Buildup
The Empire Grows With Oil Revenues
 The number of state-run businesses in Mexico was comparatively small through 1970. But when the Arab oil embargo of 1973 drove up oil prices and greatly increased Mexico's revenues from its oil, the Government had the money to run hundreds of unprofitable businesses whose main purpose was widely understood to be providing jobs and paychecks regardless of productivity. By 1982 there were 1,155 such entities, including economically insignificant ones like commissions or trust funds set up for specific projects like the 1968 Olympic Games.
Acquiring or setting up such companies proved to be easier than disposing of them. Sale and divestment, called disincorporation, began under President Miguel de la Madrid, who served from 1982 to 1988. Under Mexico's current President, Mr. Salinas, the program evolved into the Government's nearly complete retreat from the private sector.
Taking a leaf from the privatization program introduced by Margaret Thatcher when she was Britain's Prime Minister, Mr. Aspe and other Mexican economists drafted a plan for starting with smaller enterprises and moving gradually to larger and more complicated ones so they could learn from experience.
But officials say they made sure that most of the revenue from the sell-offs went into reducing Mexico's debt rather than budget expenditures.
Mexico managed to slice billions off its debt, but more importantly for economic stability, net debt dropped from more than 70 percent of gross domestic product in 1986 to less than 29 percent today, according to the Bank of Mexico. As a result, interest payments on debt declined considerably, allowing the Government to funnel more money into a national antipoverty program that finances public works projects, gives grants to small businesses and refurbishes schools and community centers.
 
The Balance Sheet
Many Jobs Are Lost With the Sell-Off
 For many Mexicans, privatization has been a mixed blessing. When the project began in 1983, nearly 12,000 people worked at the state's huge Fundidora steel foundry on the outskirts of Monterrey. Ninety miles away in Monclova, the Altos Hornos foundry, also owned by the Government, employed about 24,000.
Founded at the turn of the century, Fundidora was inefficient, technologically outdated and bankrupt when Mexican officials decided to just close it down in 1986. All 12,000 jobs were lost, and today the foundry site is being cleaned up and turned into a park and business center in a $350 million project by the state of Nuevo Leon.
Altos Hornos, set up in the 1940's, had newer equipment and production methods, and despite strikes and other labor protests it was sold to a consortium of private investors in the Monterrey area in 1991. One of Mexico's leading industrial groups, it now employs 10,400 people, fewer than half its former labor force.
Another privatization cited as a success was that of Aeromexico, which at the time of its sale in June 1989 had only 30 percent of the market and was known as "Aeromaybe" because its service was so poor. Today Aeromexico is Mexico's biggest passenger carrier, with a consistent on-time performance. It now owns 55 percent of the carrier Mexicana and, in a turnaround, was part of the consortium that submitted a winning bid for 70 percent of Aeroperu, which was privatized by the Government of Peru.
In 1990 the Government began the privatization of Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, which was touted as one of the biggest state-owned companies in the world. But many Mexicans say they cannot tell the difference between the new Telmex and the old, given the difficulties they have reaching an operator, getting a phone installed or upgrading service.
The denationalization of Telmex was the largest and most complex sale of a Government-held enterprise. After selling majority voting rights and a 20.4 percent stake to a consortium for $1.76 billion, the Government sold $3.7 billion in shares to the public in two separate offerings, the only such public tenders to date in the privatization program.
The sale of 18 commercial banks for a combined $11 billion in June 1991 was considered a great success because each bank went for three to four times its book value. But it can still take more than a month to get a check cashed, a major stumbling block for middle-class Mexicans and foreign investors who are used to relying on such services.
Mortgages are just becoming available, interest rates on credit cards and car loans can be 50 percent higher than in the United States and credit of any kind for longer than 10 years is hard to come by.
In the bulk of privatizations, Mexico generally advertises that a company is up for sale, invites bids from private investors and reaches a decision that it says is based not only on price but also on a bidder's ability to assume debt. In sensitive industries like newspapers and broadcasting, foreign investors are limited to minority holdings.
While there have been no big demonstrations against the sell-offs of Government companies like those in Brazil when steel plants were sold, critics here accuse Mexico of giving preferential treatment to certain investors. Government officials have acknowledged working with potential bidders before an important deal, like the sale of the state telephone company and a recent package of television stations, but maintain that the final selection is honest and evenhanded.
Still, some Mexicans seem to have done awfully well by the Government. Carlos Slim Helu, whose Grupo Carso was part of the consortium that submitted the winning bid for a controlling share in Telmex, is now considered one of the richest people in the world.
This year Fortune magazine estimated his wealth at $2.9 billion and ranked him 68th on its list of the world's 101 richest people. Since Mexico has only one telephone line for every 14 people in the country, Mr. Slim and his partners in the consortium, Southwestern Bell and France Telecom, stand to reap huge profits as the communications network expands.
 
The Sacrosanct
Will Mexico Relax Its Hold on Energy?
 Mexico plans to close the disinvestment office this year or early in 1994. With a few exceptions, the 209 remaining state-owned entities are unlikely to be sold. They include schools, hospitals and the national lottery.
In recent weeks the state-owned insurance company and corn-processing plants have been sold. Many people are eager to see what happens when bids come in for the last item on this year's privatization list, the 150,000-customer natural gas distribution system here in Monterrey.
The sale has piqued interest, but not only because of the potential for expanding the network, already one of the largest in the country. The Monterrey gas network is an asset of the national power company, and as such comes close to the "strategic" -- and supposedly inviolate -- Government domain of oil and energy. The Government is allowing bids from foreign companies, and Southern Union Company of Austin, Tex., has shown some interest.
Recently a similar Government test -- a deal to sell part of a new electric generating station, Carbon II, in the state of Coahuila, near the Texas border -- collapsed when the American investor, a subsidiary of SCE Corporation, pulled out.
Mindful of the issue's sensitivity, the Mexican Government seems uncertain when it comes to yielding parts of its state-run energy industry. Mexico's 10-peso bill still bears an image of a refinery, commemorating the nationalization of the sector in 1938 in defiance of American oil companies.
Even a comparatively small deal like the Monterrey gas sale takes on added significance since it is one of the few assets remaining on the privatization list and its sale could ultimately signal a break with protection of a cherished sector.
"There's been a lot of heavy breathing," said George Baker, an energy consultant in Oakland, Calif., who often works in Mexico. "But because of what this entails, the Mexican Government hasn't yet figured it out."

On Liberties and Libertines: Furor Over Packwood Diary

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Every Tuesday, the Senate Democrats and Republicans talk about the great issues of the day in separate private policy luncheons. Today, they talked about sex.
More specifically, the senators discussed Senator Bob Packwood's diary and the Oregon Republican's none-too-subtle suggestion on the Senate floor on Monday that if he was forced to surrender it to the Ethics Committee it could reveal the sexual dalliances of other lawmakers. 
 Senators debated publicly today about unemployment and grazing fees with great confidence and flourish, but they seemed truly confused when it came to the diary.
 
How Thorough Is Good?
 On the one hand, senators said they wanted the Ethics Committee to examine thoroughly the accusations of more than 20 aides, lobbyists and other acquaintances who have accused Mr. Packwood of making unwanted sexual advances over several years. On the other, they expressed concerns that the Senator's civil liberties could be abused by enforcing the committee's demand that he give up all the thousands of pages of his diary to the panel.
And while no senator wanted to appear concerned about what the diary might reveal about himself or another senator, a few expressed displeasure that a colleague was apparently suggesting that he had something on somebody.
This morning, one senator teased Senator Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, the 69-year-old Democratic whip who is by all accounts a happily married Southern gentleman, that all his sexual secrets were about to be revealed.
But the overall mood all day was dour and edgy, since lawmakers know that sexual indiscretions have not only embarrassed such modern stalwarts as Senator Brock Adams of Washington and Representative Wilbur Mills of Arkansas, or ruined their careers, but colored the reputation of their institution as well.
"This is a monumental issue; this is a monumental discussion," said Senator David H. Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, who said he was not quite sure what should be done.
The ambivalence of the Senate was more fully expressed by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico. "My instincts dictate that we ought to be very careful before we subpoena a private diary of a senator or any witness," he said. "Having said that, I believe we ought to hear the Ethics Committee's reasoning and try to understand the problem."
Others were more coy. "I have to talk to my lawyer," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who usually has an opinion on everything.
 
'Powerful, Personal, Poignant'
 Behind the Republicans' closed door, in what was described as a highly emotional exchange, Mr. Packwood pleaded with his colleagues at lunch that portions of his diary that did not relate to his alleged sexual offenses should be protected as a matter of privacy. After lunch, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip, said, "It was a very powerful, personal, poignant meeting."
The Democrats also had a spirited discussion in their luncheon, and several senators who before the session seemed cautious about the release of the entire diary later appeared to be ready to follow the call of the Ethics Committee for full disclosure.
The latest turmoil in the Packwood case was touched off last week, when all six members of the ethics panel decided they needed unfettered access to the diary dating back to 1989 to corroborate or rebut the information they are gleaning from interviewing scores of Packwood associates and women who have accused the senator of sexual abuse.
 
Compromise Is Rejected
 The panel said last Friday that after investigators had examined 20 years' worth of writings, Mr. Packwood suddenly cut off access and declined to provide copies of excerpts the investigators deemed relevant.
The subpoena was issued after Mr. Packwood rejected a compromise agreement to allow a neutral party to review the diary and excise passages that involve his relationships with lawyers and doctors and strictly family matters, the panel said. The committee then said the entire diary "may be relevant and probative."
Mr. Packwood's lawyer, James F. Fitzpatrick, said that the agreement had broken down when the investigators began asking for information that was clearly irrelevant.
The committee asked the full Senate last Thursday to enforce the subpoena in Federal Court. But a consensus appears to have emerged in at least the Republican caucus that Senators George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, and Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, should work out a compromise on releasing the diary in consultations with Mr. Packwood and the Ethics Committee.
 
Decision Deferred, Happily
 The willingness to put off a decision on the subpoena could cool things off for a few days, but the Oregonian's speech Monday suggested just how far out of control things could get.
Speaking of the diary, Mr. Packwood echoed a warning by his lawyer, saying it included, "an extended affair that one senator had with a member of his staff" and "an affair that a staffer had with a member of the current Congressional Democratic leadership."
As Senator Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who presided over the session, hoisted an eyebrow, Mr. Packwood continued: "I have no intention of ever using this for blackmail, gray mail, or anything else. But I want the Senate to clearly understand that it is the Ethics Committee that has demanded the production of the pages of the diary upon which is contained the information to which my lawyer made reference."
A senior Republican Senate aide said of the Packwood statement, "You can say the cold war's over, but that was mutually assured Senate destruction."
Mr. Packwood said he has willed the diary to the Oregon Historical Society for release "years" after his death. For more than 25 years, he devoted up to a half-hour every morning to scrawling notes on the events of the day before, mixing ruminations on the issues with personal tidbits and possibly gossip.
Among the items cited specifically by the Senator was a meeting with President Richard M. Nixon over Watergate. On a more personal level, Mr. Packwood described his writing as containing "the hopes and the dreams and the despairs of all of us."

HEADLINE: 'Anything Goes' Houston May Go the Limit: Zoning

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
In many American cities, the mental image of the landscape is set by something the city has. Seattle has the Space Needle, St. Louis has the Gateway Arch. Here in Houston, though, even with its famed Astrodome, the urban geography has long been noted for what this city does not have: any zoning regulations whatsoever.
But now Houston, the only major American city without a zoning code, is on the verge of determining whether the time has finally come to impose zoning and, perhaps, inject some modicum of order to the helter-skelter, hodgepodge way that the nation's fourth largest city has evolved and even now continues to grow. 
 So while voters in many cities are going to the polls next Tuesday to pick their mayors, Houstonians are facing a referendum that poses a more fundamental choice over the character of their city. And that means they are debating the quintessential Sun Belt faith, perhaps more pervasive here than anywhere else, that unbridled growth -- anywhere, anytime -- is a good thing.
 
Of Vibrancy and Chaos
 With no ordinances separating residential, business and industrial areas from each other, Houston is full of neighborhoods that mix all three. A cluster of bungalow homes is split by a convenience store, a church is dwarfed by the glass skyscraper next door. Zoning opponents say this has brought a unique vibrancy to Houston, while zoning proponents say it has brought ugly chaos.
A prolonged recession, mounting concerns about unsightly sprawl and a determined drive by zoning advocates have all brought the issue to the fore.
Twice before, in 1948 and again in 1962, after one civic leader called it a Communist plot and another said it would bring "socialized real estate," voters here soundly rejected referendums to impose zoning. And nobody debated zoning much in the freewheeling 1970's and early 1980's, when the doubling and redoubling of world oil prices brought an almost mind-boggling prosperity to much of Houston.
But the collapse of oil prices and the ensuing bust here have clearly brought a measure of sobriety, which many people detect in the reasoned debate over the measure this time around. The vote on Tuesday is expected to be far closer than the other two referendums, and some recent polls show the pro-zoning forces headed for a victory.
"Any time zoning came up before, Houston was always like the perpetual adolescent," said Tim Fleck, editor of The Houston Insider, an influential newsletter on politics and other local issues. "But now people are really asking themselves the question: do we finally settle down and accept the strictures of middle-aged city life, and regulate things, or do we just continue to be the adolescent, partying around and building wherever we can?"
Many people argue that the lack of zoning epitomizes a kind of frontier spirit that made the city great. The biggest newspaper in town, The Houston Chronicle, editorialized against zoning recently, cautioning: "Houston has prospered beyond its fondest dreams without zoning. We will meddle with this success story at our peril."
But others see a definite downside. Maybe you do have the freedom to do anything you want with your home, but so does your neighbor -- like convert it to a tattoo parlor or a chop shop. That kind of thing happens in Houston.
In fact, proponents of the zoning measure say Houston is finally ready to face up to the fact that some things may be more important than the ultimate in free-market economics.
 
Enjoyment of Property
 "The experience of the 70's and 80's has taught us that peaceful enjoyment of property, peaceful enjoyment of a neighborhood, is also a valuable property right," said Jim Greenwood, a City Council member who is a leader of the pro-zoning forces. "It doesn't do much good to make a bunch of money if you have to drive 30 miles to a home where you can enjoy it."
The vote on Tuesday is the product of more than two years of research and mapmaking by a city-appointed panel that has divided the city's 580 square miles into a patchwork of areas zoned for various purposes, as is the norm in many other cities.
In many residential areas, a certain level of commercial activity would be retained, but in others new restrictions would keep out businesses that have drawn the most ire from homeowners, including liquor stores, coin laundries, palm readers and establishments that are politely known as hourly motels.
The outcome of the vote is extremely difficult to predict. A recent poll of 500 likely voters by The Chronicle, said to have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, found that about 43 percent of Houstonians favored zoning, 30 percent were against and 28 percent were unsure.
But even many who expressed a preference said they were confused about the issue, and the anti-zoning forces, which include large developers and small home-based businesses, have put on a blitz of television advertisements. The pro-zoning side has less money to spend but does have the public support of many city officials, including the city's popular Mayor, Bob Lanier, who himself appears headed for an easy re-election on Tuesday.
Virtually all aspects of zoning's impact are subject to bitter debate, including its cost. Barry Klein, executive director of the Houston Property Rights Association, an anti-zoning group, says zoning would hurt thousands of businesses and drive up taxes, while proponents say it would stabilize property values and cause no tax increases.
And there is considerable dissension in minority communities, which by many accounts have the most to gain or lose from zoning. In many wealthy residential neighborhoods, there is a form of de facto zoning known as "deed restrictions," under which those who buy property voluntarily agree not to use it for anything other than a home, knowing that their neighbors have done the same thing. But in many poor or middle-class areas, such restrictions are either nonexistent or too expensive to enforce.
Now, some black ministers who led the fight against zoning 30 years ago out of fear that it would be a tool for segregation, are urging a vote in favor, saying it represents the best way to stabilize neighborhoods and property values. Others are still leery. One group of black ministers argues that the lack of zoning has helped keep Houston from having large ghettoized areas of "poverty and slums."

HEADLINE: $1,000 Coupon Offer at Issue in G.M. Safety Suit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 26

 BODY:
A Federal judge held a hearing today to determine whether the General Motors Corporation should be allowed to settle a suit concerning the safety of 6.3 million pickup trucks by providing owners with $1,000 coupons to buy new G.M. trucks.
The Government opened a formal investigation of the pickups last April after G.M. refused to voluntarily recall and repair them. The company said the trucks were not defective. 
 The trucks have side-mounted gasoline tanks, and the Government has said the design creates a higher risk of fire in collisions from the side. G.M. no longer puts fuel tanks outside a vehicle's protective frame.
Judge William Yohn Jr. of Federal District Court here heard arguments about the proposed settlement, which would settle 23 consolidated class-action suits representing consumers in every states but Texas. Lawyers for General Motors and G.M. truck owners negotiated the agreement on July 20. The trucks at issue are 1973 to 1987 full-size C/K model pickups and their successor R/V models in model years 1988 through 1991. Only 60,000 vehicles are in the latter category.
 
Company Eager to Settle
 A Federal judge in Texas, the state with the highest ownership of the trucks, is scheduled to hold a hearing on Wednesday on the same proposed settlement for Texans. The judges will rule separately sometime soon; if each approves the settlement, other courts would likely use the agreement to resolve 14 additional class-action suits pending against G.M., lawyers involved in the cases said.
Jim Schink, a G.M. lawyer, told Judge Yohn today that the company wanted to settle the case "because we don't want to have an adversarial relationship with our customers."
"The plaintiffs' position shows there is substantial doubt that there is a safety risk," Mr. Schink added.
All that the agreement settles is the potential economic loss of the truck owners in disposing of their vehicles. If it is accepted, the trucks' owners do not lose their rights to sue G.M. for liability or to take part in a recall to repair safety defects.
Still, some consumers and their advocacy groups oppose the settlement because it does not address the Government's safety concerns. But only 11,653 of 5.7 million truck owners who were notified of the settlement by mail have formally criticized or rejected it.
The agreement would provide each truck owner with a $1,000 coupon, which could be used to reduce the final negotiated price of a new pickup or light truck in the 15 months after approval of the settlement. A truck owner or an immediate family member could use the coupon, transfer it with the truck to a new buyer or sell it. If the coupon was sold or given to an unrelated person, its value would drop to $500.
 
Boon for G.M.
 If every owner redeemed the coupon, it would cost G.M. $6.3 billion. But according to a survey conducted for lawyers representing the truck owners, only about $2 billion worth of coupons are likely to be used.
At the same time, marketing experts say that if the agreement is accepted G.M. will turn a lemon into lemonade. The company's profits from new truck sales might be several billion dollars, by some industry estimates.
"It's very clever because the perception is that both the company and the consumer can win," Stephen A. Greyser, a professor of consumer marketing at Harvard Business School, said in an interview.
Ed Lechtzin, G.M.'s director of legal and safety issues, said before the hearing, "We're not defensive about the fact that we might sell more vehicles and that it could very good for the bottom line."
 
Prime-Time Explosion
 The settlement was able to skirt the safety issue, Professor Greyser said, because public concern has sharply declined since last November when NBC broadcast a prime-time "expose" on exploding gas tanks on G.M. pickups. This spring the network acknowledged that its "Dateline NBC" program had rigged a pickup to catch fire in an experimental crash.
In court today, company and consumer lawyers said the $1,000 coupon would offset any decline in the trucks' resale value that could result from negative publicity about the tank design. To date, values have not fallen.
Clarence M. Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy organization in Washington, said the case might present the only chance to pressure G.M. into making free repairs on all the trucks. Even if the Government determines that the trucks are defective, by law it can order G.M. to make free repairs only on vehicles made within the previous eight years. Ninety percent of the trucks at issue are older than eight years, and instead of making free repairs, G.M. would only have to notify owners that a defect exists.

HEADLINE: CLINTON SEES WAYS TO REDUCE COSTS

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Reaching into a grab bag of leftover campaign promises, President Clinton today introduced legislation and signed executive orders that he said would cut the deficit, curb crime and streamline government.
Mr. Clinton said the proposals could save $10 billion in the next fiscal year by eliminating or reducing wasteful programs while fulfilling his pledge to search for additional cuts in the budget. 
 Administration officials said today that another $22 billion could be cut from government spending over five years. The cuts would be achieved, they said, by eliminating wasteful programs and revamping the procurement process to incorporate new technologies, like allowing bids to be made by computer and thus doing away with some paperwork.
Leon E. Panetta, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said he expected the Congressional Budget Office to peg the overall savings much lower, closer to $5 billion. But he insisted that the Administration estimates were the correct ones and would allow the President to steer $4 billion to $5 billion of the savings to pay for anticrime legislation, which is pending in the House and Senate.
 
'Keep Our Citizens Safe'
 The President said, "We ought to take some of that money that your Government has been wasting all these years and use it to uphold government's first responsibility, which is to keep our citizens safe here at home."
By investing what Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, called the "grunt work of government" with the promise of imminent action on issues that the President's pollsters have identified as important, Mr. Clinton hoped to build the case for quick Congressional support.
"I want them to know that, if these cuts aren't passed, I'm going to come back with more cuts," Mr. Clinton said. "And if those aren't passed, I'll come back with still more." He also promised to urge Congress to set aside $5 billion of the savings to pay for the enhancements called for in his anticrime bill.
 
Draws on Gore's Work
 Drawing from the recommendations made by the National Performance Review effort that was headed by Vice President Al Gore, the legislation that was sent to Congress today would achieve its major savings in the following ways:
*Reducing Agriculture Department field offices.
*Ending wool, mohair and honey subsidies. (This measure is essentially being counted twice, since it has already passed both houses and awaits the President's signature.)
*Authorizing managers at the Pentagon to use the proceeds from the sales of recyclable materials.
*Eliminating legal and regulatory restraints to allow open bidding on Medicare claim processing contracts.
"In a larger sense, the steps we are taking here today are also about proving to the American people that we can honestly and seriously deal with the issues that matter most to them and that for too long too many have felt powerless to change," Mr. Clinton said.
 
More Savings Possible?
 But some members of Congress, including Representative Tim Penny, a Minnesota Democrat, contend that the Government could save even more money, and are preparing legislation to that effect.
Mr. Panetta said that the plan Mr. Clinton announced today "more than fulfills that commitment" made in August to members of Congress who asked the Administration to produce additional budget cuts in exchange for support of the President's economic plan.
But he acknowledged that the President's efforts to link the new savings to the anticrime bill could falter if Congress balks at allocating the money or rejects the savings estimates.

HEADLINE: Electric Rates To Be Frozen By Authority

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
The New York State Power Authority, trying to repair its tattered public image and fight off competition from independent energy suppliers, said yesterday that it would freeze electricity rates for the next three years for its government customers in New York City and Westchester County, which could save them as much as $110 million.
The freeze would hold down electricity rates for New York City, the city's subways, suburban commuter rail systems and a number of other government agencies. The action would reduce their bills by roughly 4.5 percent, compared with the increases the Power Authority had previously projected. But some local officials said they did not anticipate that their savings would be as large as the authority announced. 
 The action would not directly affect consumers and businesses, which generally buy electricity from the Consolidated Edison Company, the private utility that serves New York City and Westchester County. But it could, in a modest way, help ease the budget squeeze on local governments and moderate the pressure for fare increases.
"This is one of the most significant rate actions any Power Authority board has ever taken," said Richard M. Flynn, chairman of the authority, which supplies a quarter of the state's electricity, some of it bought from Canada. "We have to beat the competition if we want to keep the customers."
 
'Aggressive Actions'
 Mr. Flynn has been under fire for his use of a state airplane to fly to a weekend home in Rhode Island, for poor management at two nuclear power plants and for efforts to derail attempts by independent companies to supply electricity at lower costs. He portrayed the rate action, one of the few times that the Power Authority has managed to keep rates under control for a sustained period of time, as a sign that the troubled authority is turning the corner.
"We're able to do this because of the aggressive actions we've taken in the past year to cut costs throughout the Power Authority and to revamp our nuclear management and operations," Mr. Flynn said.
In a public-relations barrage accompanying the announcement of the rate freeze, Mr. Flynn rolled out statements of support from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor David N. Dinkins, Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, and Peter E. Stangl, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Most of the cost savings are the result of a $1.1 billion bond refinancing at current lower interest rates, which should cut the borrowing costs of the authority by $370 million over the life of the bonds.
The authority has also reduced its work force by about 200 people and decided to absorb some of the expense of buying additional power to replace the output of its trouble-plagued Indian Point 3 nuclear power plant, which has been shut down since February for repairs. Mr. Flynn said the plant should resume service in early 1994.
Lower costs help make the rate freeze possible. But the fundamental pressure for savings comes from independent power companies that are offering more competition to the power business, which has traditionally been controlled by local and regional monopolies.
"The market has really evolved in recent years," said William F. Squadron, New York City's Commissioner for Telecommunications and Energy. "We had to explore whether there are alternatives."
For example, Sithe Energies, which is building a 1,000-megawatt, gas-fired power plant in upstate New York that is to be finished in 1995, has said it could deliver electricity to the city for about 10 percent less than the Power Authority now charges.
Officials of the company testified before a state legislative committee this month that the authority had tried to kill its project because of the threat that it posed to the authority's James A. FitzPatrick reactor, in Scriba, N.Y., which has a spotty record of reliability and did not run at all last year. But yesterday Mr. Flynn said he was only trying to assure that independent producers, who have been encouraged by Federal legislation guaranteeing them an outlet for their energy, compete on a "level playing field" with existing suppliers.
Mr. Squadron said he welcomed the rate freeze by the authority, saying it was a "very valuable step" that would help bring "stability" to the city's power costs. He said the city's willingness to look for a new source of power was the main factor in prodding the authority to hold down rates.
New York City and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are by far the largest government customers of the authority, buying almost 20 percent of its output. Last year they spent about $370 million on electricity purchases and an additional $160 million to Con Edison for distribution.
Mr. Flynn said the authority expects the New York City government alone to save $42 million in power costs through 1996. But city officials disputed those figures, saying they anticipate a benefit of only $10.5 million.

HEADLINE: Stocks Stumble in Erratic Trading Session

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
A day after blue-chip issues roared to new highs, the stock market stumbled through an erratic session yesterday that seemed to raise a question among some analysts: Why can't investors sustain a lengthy autumn rally?
To Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, the declines in most stock indicators yesterday may point to renewed anxiety about the health of the economy and the strength of corporate profits. After weeks of setting records, Wall Street may be running out of gas, he said. 
 "The market is foundering and looking for some direction," he said. "It looks tired. There is a new psychology among portfolio managers, where they basically want to reduce their exposure and risk. The market is going to have a downward bias for the next few weeks at a minimum."
 
 
Conference Board Report
 Traders cited two developments that rattled investors yesterday: the Conference Board, a business research group, said its consumer confidence index fell unexpectedly, to 59.4 this month from 63.8 in September. And the strong victory of the Liberal Party in the Canadian election cast new doubt on the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
As a result, the Dow Jones industrial average, which jumped 24.31 points on Monday to a record, fell 1.12 points to 3,672.49. The average had been down nearly 20 points but regained some losses after a small recovery in stocks of large companies whose earnings are sensitive to the economy.
One of the few bright spots in the market was the Dow Jones transportation average, which rose 19.44 points to a record 1,697.15. The previous high was 1,683.08 on April 16.
The transportation average was led by airline stocks like UAL, the parent of United Airlines, up 3 3/8, to 146 5/8; AMR, the parent of American Airlines, up 1 7/8, to 70, and Delta Air Lines, up 1 1/2, to 57 5/8. Analysts said investors seemed to be sensing that the airline industry might be entering a period of stronger earnings.
 
 
Profit Taking
 The industrial average was dragged down by investors who were cashing in on the gains of stocks that did well on Monday, like United Technologies, down 1 1/2, to 62 3/4; Alcoa, down 1 1/8, to 69 5/8, and Eastman Kodak, down 1 1/8, to 57 7/8.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose slightly, 0.10 point, to 464.30. The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.94 points, to 473.64. And the Nasdaq Composite index slumped 4.29 points, to 765.46.
Volume on the Big Board was 284.5 million shares, up from 260.3 million shares on Monday. Once again, declining stocks outnumbered advancers, 1,121 to 908.
Among the strong issues were steel, pollution-control, chemical and automobile stocks. Industries that suffered were banking, software, tobacco and life insurance. Among small stocks, technology and gambling issues, which have ricocheted all over the board in recent weeks, were hard hit.
The most active stock on the Big Board was BankAmerica, which dropped 3/4, to 42 3/8, mirroring the decline in other bank stocks, which appeared to be linked to concern about rising short-term interest rates. Among other heavily traded issues, RJR Nabisco, which said its quarterly net income plunged 58 percent, was unchanged at 5 3/8; General Motors increased 5/8, to 45 3/8.
National Health Labs fell 2 1/4, to 13 1/4, after the Federal Medicare program said it would not pay for two of the company's tests. American Express, which reported sharply higher quarterly profit, declined 1 3/8, to 32 5/8. And Data General was down 1 3/8, to 9 1/4, after it reported a $37.2 million quarterly loss.
Chevron, which announced that its quarterly earnings were down 10 percent, was unchanged at 96 1/4. USX jumped 2 1/2, to 38 1/8, after it reported $36 million in quarterly net income. And Allied Signal dropped 1/8, to 72 3/4, after it said its quarterly earnings rose 24 percent.
I.B.M., which reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, was up 1 3/8, to 46 1/4. And Procter & Gamble gained 1/8, to 52 1/8, after announcing that its quarterly profits increased to 95 cents a share.
On the Nasdaq market, Wall Data fell 1 1/4, to 39. The company said there was a surge of activity because of the expiration of agreements that had prevented its executives from trading until now. And BMC Software dropped 5 3/4, to 51 1/4, after it said its quarterly international sales were weak.

HEADLINE: Senate Bill to Extend Jobless Aid Is Defeated as the G.O.P. Prevails

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The Senate voted unexpectedly today to kill an emergency program that gives unemployed Americans an extra 7 to 13 weeks of benefits when their normal six months of checks run out. Legislators later said, however, that they hoped the measure could be reconsidered and passed this week.
Democrats said they planned to negotiate with Republican opponents over the issue that killed the measure: how to find the $1.1 billion needed to pay for the program. 
 The same issue delayed passage of the measure in the House for weeks, beyond the Oct. 2 expiration of the program. The House finally passed the legislation last week.
The bill would extend the emergency program until February. That four-month extension could keep checks coming for a while longer to roughly a million people.
 
Sought to Waive Rule
 Republicans say they support the program but want it financed on a pay-as-you-go basis by raising revenues or making cuts elsewhere in the Federal budget. Congressional budget rules require lawmakers to pay for the emergency program during the fiscal year in which it is approved.
Democrats contend it is impossible to find $1.1 billion in the 1994 budget, and had sought to waive the budget rule and make up the cost over five years. The Senate voted 59 to 38 to grant that request, but the party-line vote fell one short of the 60 required to bypass Senate procedures.
The effort was doomed in the last seconds of the vote when one Republican, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, switched from "yea" to "nay."
"When I realized that passage came down to just one vote I changed my vote in the hope that we could work out a way to be more accountable for the costs," she said in a statement.
Even with Senator Kassebaum's defection, Democrats appear to have sufficient strength to pass the jobless benefits extension should it come to the floor again. One strong Democratic supporter who could provide the winning margin, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, was absent today.
Regardless of the numbers, Democrats will try to work out a compromise on paying for the benefits in 1994 before bringing the bill back to the Senate floor, said the staff director of the Senate Finance Committee, Lawrence O'Donnell.
Mr. O'Donnell said, "we'll go back and see if there's some financing mechanism that makes this thing more acceptable to more Republicans."
When it was first enacted in 1991, the emergency benefits program was conceived as a temporary, $10-billion balm for a national economic slowdown. It extends the standard 26 weeks of unemployment checks by 13 weeks in the highest-unemployment states -- currently Alaska, California, Rhode Island and West Virginia -- and by seven weeks everywhere else.
Since 1991, Congress has approved the extension three times, at an additional cost of $15 billion. Congressional rules require that the cost of each extension be made up in the year in which it is passed, but until today, Democrats had always mustered the 60 votes needed to bypass the rule, and the White House had always signed the legislation.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Drops

 BODY:
The widely followed Conference Board consumer confidence index fell sharply this month, declining to 59.4 points in October from 63.8 in September. Although the business research group's survey rattled stock investors and knocked the dollar down, economists do not see it as a persuasive sign that consumers are about to retrench.
For one thing, two other respected confidence surveys suggest that consumer spirits -- though far from buoyant -- are rising a bit, not declining. The University of Michigan's index, regarded as a somewhat less volatile gauge than the Conference Board's, perked up in the first half of this month, jumping to 83.1 from 77.9. 
 The ABC/Money Magazine weekly poll also suggests that the mood of consumers has improved this month. That poll shows the mood brighter than at any time since the spring.
More important, consumers have not been acting as depressed about job prospects and the economy in recent weeks as they sounded when they wrote their answers to the Conference Board questionnaires.
So far this month, Johnson Redbook reported, sales by national retail chains have been running 8.2 percent ahead of the comparable period last year. The upswing in the housing market continues, and car dealers report a surge in buying. The Conference Board found car-buying plans more bullish than at any time since May.
All that, Mr. Kelly said, "suggests that retail sales are going to be very strong for October." Peter Schaeffer of Johnson Redbook said he expects a good Christmas.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Chretien Will Not Undo Nafta

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
President Clinton and his aides said today that they did not expect that the Liberal Party's victory in Canadian elections would hurt the prospects for approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement or lead to renegotiation of the pact.
"From my point of view, it will have no impact at all," President Clinton said this morning, discounting the Liberal Party's platform plank that called for renegotiation of the accord. "I see no reason to renegotiate the agreement or any grounds or basis for it, and I think we should just go ahead." 
 Several Administration officials said they believe that Jean Chretien, the Liberal Party leader, is more enthusiastic about free trade than others in his party and less interested in renegotiating the pact.
 
Chretien Has the Muscle
 President Clinton, who spoke by telephone with Mr. Chretien this morning, said the Canadian gave him no specific assurances on the trade accord. But, the President added, "nothing occurred in the conversation which made me have any doubt that our course of proceeding is the right course."
A White House official who spoke on condition that he not be identified said, "My sense is that given the scale of Chretien's win, he is going to be under less pressure" to seek renegotiations. A smaller victory margin could have forced the Liberal Party to seek the support of the left-leaning New Democratic Party, which is implacably opposed to the pact.
"What he has been saying is quite moderate," the official said. "What he has been saying is an open-access -- I don't want to say free trade -- but it's a very open-access, moderate agenda."
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said Washington opposed any renegotiation.
But at two news conferences and in an interview today, he refused to say whether the United States might be willing to discuss with the Canadians how to interpret the pact. The Administration is currently pursuing similar talks with Mexico on trade in sugar, fruit and vegetables.
 
Well, There Are Other Accords
 Mr. Kantor said he had seen nothing in Mr. Chretien's statements suggesting that he would seek to reopen the pact. "The Canadians have raised no concerns directly with us and so, therefore, there's nothing to renegotiate," he said.
A Canadian withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement would have little economic effect on the United States because the 1988 United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement already covers trade between the two countries.
If Canada withdraws, the United States would still conclude a pact with Mexico, Robert Rubin, the head of the National Economic Council, said last month. Without Canada in Nafta, free trade would be in effect between Canada and the United States and between Mexico and the United States, but not between Canada and Mexico.
The House of Representatives is tentatively scheduled to vote on Nov. 17 on legislation to put the agreement into law; the Senate is likely to vote the following day. President Clinton has been aggressively wooing members of Congress, and met with several Representatives today.
But Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat and a vocal opponent of the agreement, contended that the wide support in Canada for a party that favored renegotiation reinforced his view that Nafta should be redrawn.
 
Fence-Sitter Leans to the North
 Representative Toby Roth, a Wisconsin Republican who is one of the few undecided members of Congress, expressed concern at the Canadian vote, saying it would influence him and others who have not decided how to vote.
"I think that Nafta was a big issue in the Canadian elections," he said, "and I think that the American politicians have to take that, factor that into their equation as they're making up their mind as to whether to vote for it."
Most Canadian political experts today blamed the crushing defeat of the ruling Progressive Conservative Party mainly on the weak economy and a badly run campaign. They assigned a secondary role to trade concerns and the loss of jobs to the United States.
To bolster the trade pact, the Administration struck a tentative four-part deal with most House and Senate leaders today on how to raise $2.8 billion to cover the lost trade tariffs, worker-retraining programs and a cleanup program along the Mexican border, all facets of Nafta.
 
Covering Nafta's Costs
 Bowing to pressure from conservative Republicans, the Administration agreed to increase the customs inspection fee for arriving passengers by only $1.50, to $6.50, instead of doubling it, to $10, as proposed last week. But $6.50 will cover only the cost of the inspections and no more.
To make up the $2.8 billion, the Administration and Congressional leaders tentatively settled on three accounting maneuvers: requiring companies to send in income-tax deductions from workers' checks more quickly, requiring the Customs Service to use Internal Revenue Service data to discover undervaluation of imported goods subject to tariffs and projecting that the Agriculture Department would spend less to hold up crop prices as sales to Mexico rise.
But the tentative deal was not put in writing because of objections from conservative Republicans. Representative Thomas W. Ewing, an Illinois Republican who organized a revolt by 26 colleagues last week against doubling the $5 customs inspection fee, said he and a dozen allies probably would not vote for the accord if it included even just a $1.50 increase.
The Administration is also preparing to announce as soon as Wednesday that some money for the border cleanup would be used to set up a North American Development Bank to make loans to communities anywhere Nafta might cause job losses, officials said. The announcement is intended to woo legislators from districts far from the border.

HEADLINE: Looking Ahead at Dinkins Cabinet

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
As he campaigns for a second term, Mayor David N. Dinkins steadfastly refuses to talk about what his second administration would look like, though it is clear at City Hall that he would, if re-elected, probably have to find successors for his two most important aides as well as improve the overall management of his government.
Some senior advisers say Mr. Dinkins thinks that some commissioners may need to be replaced, or, as one put it, that "he's got to tighten up the bolts in some places." Whether Mr. Dinkins, who has long shown a reluctance to dismiss people, would ask for the resignation of some of his less-than-stellar commissioners is a matter of debate within the administration. 
 But his most crucial decisions will likely be how to fill the roles of the two figures who set much of the tone and direction for his administration: First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, who friends say is likely to leave government within the next year or so if Mr. Dinkins is re-elected, and Bill Lynch, the Mayor's closest political adviser, who has said often in recent months that he hoped to go to South Africa to advise the African National Congress on the formation of a multiracial government.
The Mayor gives no hint who their replacements might be, but many of his advisers suggest that they would probably set a different tone and personal style.
 
Infighting Is Concern
 Many aides say that the Mayor would have to cut down on the infighting that marred his first four years, including bickering between Mr. Steisel and the head of the Human Resources Administration, Barbara J. Sabol. Some also suggest that Mr. Dinkins should reduce the number of deputy mayors -- there are now six -- to streamline decision-making.
Even before he was elected in 1989, Mr. Dinkins named Nathan Leventhal, a former First Deputy Mayor under Mayor Edward I. Koch, to run his transition. He also promised to make Victor A. Kovner corporation counsel. But this time around, Mr. Dinkins has steered away from all talk about the possible shape of a second administration. "I'm not willing to discuss that at this time," the Mayor said.
Some rising stars are looked on as likely figures of importance if there is a Dinkins second term.
One is Carol O'Cleireacain, who was Finance Commissioner until she was appointed Budget Director in late August. The city's long-term fiscal problems are so severe that the budget will surely be topic A in City Hall next year, whether Mr. Dinkins or Rudolph W. Giuliani, his Republican-Liberal challenger, wins on Tuesday.
Another insider whose role would most likely expand is George B. Daniels, the Mayor's Counsel, who has become a crucial mayoral adviser and whose judgment and temperament is widely admired.
 
Success of Many Women
 Many of the commissioners who have performed well and would be likely candidates to fill openings at the top of the administration are women. Among them, said more than a half-dozen senior mayoral aides, are Emily Lloyd, the Sanitation Commissioner; Betsy Gotbaum, the Parks Commissioner; Catherine M. Abate, the Correction Commissioner, and Ms. O'Cleireacain.
"I know the men will be calling me up howling, but the female commissioners in general have outperformed the men," Mr. Steisel said.
Mr. Steisel, a former Sanitation Commissioner and investment banker, is respected within the administration for his expertise on government and management, but he has also been criticized for a manner that can be abrasive. His successor is likely to have a more collegial style and to make the city's senior administrators work more cohesively, many mayoral advisers said.
Mr. Steisel's successor may also require assurances that he or she will be perceived clearly as Mr. Dinkins's top aide.
While Mr. Lynch and Mr. Steisel have said often that they respect and like each other, their sharply different personal styles and different political and governmental experiences often led to internal clashes, many senior mayoral aides said.
 
No Clear Successor
 Many aides said that if Mr. Steisel did depart, there was no clear-cut successor within the administration.
Among the insiders mentioned as possible candidates are Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development; Fritz W. Alexander 2d, the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, and Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the chairwoman of the City Housing Authority, who served before that as a Deputy Mayor in the original Dinkins team.
But there are factors that would diminish the likelihood that any of these three would become the next First Deputy Mayor.
Mr. Sullivan, a retired bank executive, is not particularly familiar with many agencies within the huge city government.
Mr. Alexander, who was a judge on the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, before joining the Dinkins administration, was once the Mayor's law partner and is a close friend. But he might not be willing to make the commitment of time and energy needed to be First Deputy.
And Ms. Hernandez-Pinero left City Hall for the Housing Authority last year because she wanted to spend more time with her children.
The commissioners who are widely perceived as having performed well might be candidates for Mr. Steisel's job, should he depart. In addition to Ms. Lloyd, Ms. Abate, Ms. O'Cleireacain and Ms. Gotbaum, others given high marks included: Carl Weisbrod, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation; Margaret A. Hamburg, the Health Commissioner; Kenneth J. Knuckles, the Commissioner of General Services, and Raymond W. Kelly, the Police Commissioner.
Among those perceived by many within the administration as having had difficult tenures are Ms. Sabol, the head of the Human Resources Administration; Lucius J. Riccio, the Transportation Commissioner; Hazel N. Dukes, the president of the Offtrack Betting Corporation, and Josephine Nieves, the Commissioner of Employment.

HEADLINE: Christopher Praises Belarus on Nuclear Issue

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: MINSK, Belarus, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to this capital of broad boulevards today and praised its leaders for taking "historic steps" to remove nuclear weapons from their territory.
His message was as much an embrace of Belarus as it was a signal to Ukraine, whose leaders told Mr. Christopher on Monday that they were committed to making their country nuclear-free, but whose Parliament has not yet ratified the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty or agreed to adhere to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
 The former Soviet republic of Belarus, by contrast, signed both agreements this year, and has already actively begun to dismantle and destroy its nuclear weapons.
"The United States very highly values the historic steps Belarus has taken to remove nuclear weapons left on its soil by the Soviet Union," Mr. Christopher said at a joint news conference with Stanislav Shushkevich, who holds the positions of both head of state and speaker of the Parliament.
Mr. Christopher said Belarus "serves as a shining example to states around the region" because of actions, which he said have won the "gratitude of the entire world community."
Mr. Christopher also announced that the leaders of Belarus had informed him that they would hold early elections in March, earlier than expected.
Until today, leaders had pledged to hold parliamentary elections, but had not set a deadline. Mr. Christopher called that decision a "sharp acceleration" of the country's movement toward democracy, although a final decision is up to Parliament.
The remnants of the Communist era are evident in Minsk, a city of 1.6 million people where a statue of Lenin still graces Independence Square. A huge white canvas covers a Mount Rushmore-like marble head of Mr. Lenin behind the stage in the auditorium of the former headquarters of the Communist Party.
The Communist Party continues to dominate both the Council of Ministers and the Parliament. And the country has even adopted the Soviet national anthem as its own, minus the words.
One of the most conservative republics under Soviet rule, Belarus is still heavily dependent on Russia, which supplies 70 percent of its imports. But Mr. Shushkevich has fought efforts by Prime Minister Vyachelsav Kebich and Parliament to align his country's foreign policy with Moscow and join a Russian-led defense pact.
Today Mr. Shushkevich thanked the United States for offering help with his country's elections and for proposing a plan that would give Eastern Europe a "partnership" role in NATO.
Although he said that his country was determined to move toward democracy, he added, "The United States should understand why the political reforms and the economic reforms are very slow in this process."
Asked how long it would take to rid his country of nuclear weapons, he said it was "difficult to say," although he added that his country was eager to become nuclear-free.
Belarus has dismantled 9 of its 72 SS-25 missiles under the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and is pledged to speed up the disposal of the others. It has already received $59 million in American aid for dismantling.
In exchange for proceeding with disarmament, Belarus asked earlier this month for a seat on the United Nations Security Council.

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN TRAIL;
Florio and Whitman Focus on Basic Themes

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN

DATELINE: BRICK TOWNSHIP, N.J., Oct. 26

 BODY:
It is exactly one week before Election Day and the polls show the race for Governor could be close. But Christine Todd Whitman and Gov. Jim Florio could be vacationing in Hawaii for all the stress the two candidates are showing on the campaign trail.
Appearing remarkably relaxed and confident, both candidates crisscrossed the state today, returning to their core audiences to shore up support and dropping in on lunchtime crowds to lobby for last-minute votes. 
 Mr. Florio had only two events for the day, while Mrs. Whitman sandwiched two small events around a television and a radio interview.
Traditionally, candidates in the closing innings try to hone in on a theme. Florio has chosen to emphasize his role in the state ban on assault weapons. But Mrs. Whitman tried out various pitches today on several widely varying fields.
Her day began with a visit to the state headquarters of the American Automobile Association in Robbinsville, where she addressed about 30 staff members and slung a few barbs at Mr. Florio.
"He has no defense for the past or vision for the future," she told the small gathering, which was nearly matched in number by a horde of reporters. "We need to hear what he is going to do. He won't answer because he doesn't know."
Spending lunchtime at a food court in Trenton, she ate a slice of cheese pizza and waded through a crowd of state workers on their lunch break, shaking hands and holding animated talks on everything from her tax-cut plan to infant mortality.
By the afternoon, Mrs. Whitman was in New York City for interviews on CNN and on the Bob Grant talk show on WABC radio.
Mr. Florio, a man renowned for his intensity, began the day schmoozing and laughing with an elderly group in Brick Township, Ocean County. Mr. Florio introduced his wife, Lucinda, gave his standard line about her being his "better two-thirds" and told a story about how the couple was walking in a parade in Trenton a few days ago when someone in the crowd spotted Mrs. Florio and called out, "Hey, there's Whitman."
"If folks in this state would think Mrs. Whitman and myself would hold hands and walk down the street, anything can happen," he said.
Later, during a news conference in Clifton, Mr. Florio continued trying to link Mrs. Whitman to the National Rifle Association. He accused Mrs. Whitman of trying to hide N.R.A. support for her candidacy and handed out what he said were copies of a newsletter put out by the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs, an N.R.A. affiliate organization. The newsletter said that the group's executive association had voted to endorse Mrs. Whitman.
Mr. Florio said that if Mrs. Whitman were elected, she would work to dismantle the state ban on semiautomatic weapons. Mrs. Whitman has said she will support the law, but has also said she favors removing certain weapons from the ban and believes that gun owners who owned semiautomatic weapons before the ban should be allowed to keep them.
Mary Warren, a member of the rifle and pistol club association's executive board, said the group recommended Mrs. Whitman to its membership but did not endorse her.
Carl Golden, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, said Mrs. Whitman never sought or received an official endorsement from the association.
"They put out something in their newsletter, but that does not constitute an endorsement," Mr. Golden said. "I know the Governor is struggling mightily to turn it into one because it's the only issue he's got."
When reminded that he once accepted contributions from the N.R.A before being elected Governor, Mr. Florio said, "That goes to the very heart of who it is that's willing to stand up when something is wrong."
 
Black G.O.P. Assails Florio
 Today, the African-American Republican Coalition held a rally to criticize Mr. Florio for his record on issues affecting black residents. The coalition released a report that said African-Americans were worse off now than before Mr. Florio took office in the areas of education, welfare, health and unemployment.
"Governor Florio had three and a half years to make a difference for the African-Americans in this state," said Assemblywoman Priscilla B. Anderson, a Republican from Camden. "The facts show he hasn't really helped us at all."
 
Bellwether (Long Hair Extra)
 Come election season, everyone is a pollster. High schools take straw polls among their students. The elderly pass out little slips of paper before bingo. If Weekly Reader can do it, why not Mike Sutlovich?
Mr. Sutlovich, a barber in Hackensack, polled his customers last October and found that Bill Clinton was running just enough ahead of President Bush to win. This year, Mr. Sutlovich held a seven-week poll that ended last Friday and found Mr. Florio ahead of Mrs. Whitman, 733 to 685.
His analysis?
"People around here, they feel like they don't have much of a choice, that they're being forced to choose between the lesser of two evils," he said.
"Two years ago, I couldn't even mention Florio's name in here; people would get mad," he said. "Between tax hikes and this and that, I stood a better chance of getting re-elected governor myself."
But as angry as voters are with Mr. Florio, many do not consider Mrs. Whitman sincere or capable, he said.
"They say, 'Hey, she hires illegal immigrants, what kind of respect does she have for the working stiff?' " he said. "Other people say Christine here, she can't manage her own campaign. How is she going to manage the state?"

HEADLINE: On the Trail of Voter Vindication;
Florio Campaigns on the Value of Taking Tough Medicine

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
They have become known as the Recession Governors, the executives of big industrial states who inherited budgets and payrolls that were bloated by the boom years of the 1980's and revenues that are starved by the lean times that came with the 1990's. And the first among them in office, and the first to face a review by the voters, is Jim Florio of New Jersey,
"We were first across the barbed wire," the Governor said recently, choosing a grim simile of trench warfare, to describe the politics of governing in a recession. 
 As Mr. Florio's re-election campaign against Christine Todd Whitman enters its final days, keeping those other governors in mind seems to be the key to understanding his claim for a second term. Mr. Florio returns time and again to his argument that while others postponed the harsh truths of recession budget-making, New Jersey swallowed a stinging dose of higher taxes early on -- medicine that will eventually, he says, produce a long-term cure.
Mrs. Whitman and others may point to the turmoil that followed the defining act of his administration, the $2.8 billion in new taxes Mr. Florio rammed through the Legislature during his first months in office. They may note the voter backlash that followed, the early wars and icy truce with Republican legislators who rode the tax backlash to a veto-proof majorities two years later, and the barely concealed bitterness of many Democrats whose legislative careers were ended in that campaign.
 
Comparison to California
 But to questions about these events, Mr. Florio turns for vindication to the experiences of governors who tried to finesse the recession, keeping their heads down, avoiding new taxes, praying for a recovery.
"Three and a half years ago California and New Jersey faced the same problems," he said in a recent interview, ticking off details -- rising costs, shrinking revenues, yawning deficits. "Today, New Jersey's bonds are rated double-A plus, California is junk."
From higher bond ratings Mr. Florio proceeds to lower borrowing costs, which affords more money for job training and industrial development, which produce more new jobs for a state that has lost 200,000 of them since he became governor, and so on -- stepping from program to program, fact to fact, drawing a skein of inevitability around his policies.
 
Fifteen Previous Campaigns
 This is Mr. Florio's 16th campaign in 24 years as a politician, which is not to count the one that won him the student council presidency at Trenton State College in 1962. To each, winning and losing, he has brought the same dogged reliance on the facts as he sees them and the same hard-scrabble style that he gained on his way out of the near poverty of his Brooklyn childhood to the national spotlight of his latest race.
By all accounts, Tuesday's vote will be as closely watched in the White House as in the dozens of other state houses where governorships will be up for grabs next fall. The question is, will a campaign style that is more attack than explanation be enough vindicate the governor?
Watching Mr. Florio on the stump, one of many inconsistencies in his style becomes clear. He is an incumbent governor with a considerable record in office, an encyclopedic command of its detail and a lawyer's ability to defend that record. Yet Mr. Florio has clearly preferred to fight the campaign on Mrs. Whitman's record than on his own.
So Mr. Florio steadfastly refuses to forecast his plans for his next term, should he win one, beyond saying that he plans to press on with the economic development programs already in motion. Pushed to say if he saw any problems ahead, like the continued budget deficits that seem to be in many economic forecasts, he said with evident peevishness, "If I saw any problems, I'd be talking about them."
 
Spending the Political Coin
 Yet Mr. Florio's record is arguably one of considerable achievement, and one purchased with the true coin of politics, his popularity, said Carl Van Horn, a Rutgers University professor and former head of planning for Mr. Florio.
"Most governors save their real battles until the second term, but Florio has clearly left a legacy already," Mr. Van Horn said. "He was dealing with real problems that are everywhere in this country, and he didn't wait until they got worse. In Florida, Lawton Chiles said he wouldn't raise taxes until he had made all possible cuts. A year later his popularity is down around 20 percent, and then he raised taxes. You could ask, who got it right?"
Little of the commotion of Mr. Florio's first term could have been predicted from his campaign against James A. Courter, a Republican and, like Mr. Florio, a United States Representative.
Mr. Florio devoted most of his time to the shoot-the-wounded style of campaigning that he, along with other Democrats, developed after watching George Bush crush Michael A. Dukakis with negative campaigning in the previous year's Presidential race. It was Mr. Florio's third try for the governorship, following a failed attempt for the nomination in 1977 and a narrow loss to Thomas H. Kean four years later, and he won by 540,000 votes.
 
Dropping the Budget Shoe
 When Mr. Florio delivered his inaugural address on Jan. 16, 1990, his words contained no forecast of the storm that would soon enfold his cause. Instead he reviewed the themes from his campaign, illustrated with poignant vignettes of citizens he met on the campaign: automobile insurance reform, gun controls, worker re-training, appointment of an environmental prosecutor. There was no mention of new taxes, or of sacrifice.
But a month later, his treasurer and current campaign aide, Douglas Berman, declared that the fiscal year 1990 budget that Mr. Florio inherited from Governor Kean was, with five months to go, some $600 million out of balance. These days, Mr. Florio often cites the arts groups and farm groups who demonstrated against him then, as he went to work cutting their programs, as if their anger were proof of his budget-cutting diligence.
In mid-March, Mr. Florio dropped the other shoe, his 1990-91 budget, which called for a doubling of the income tax rate for upper-income New Jerseyans, a one-cent increase on a sales tax to be expanded to apply to a wider range of goods, and numerous smaller levies on business expenses, from telephone calls to purchases of heavy trucks. Total annual yield: $2.8 billion.
With his tax increase, Mr. Florio put in motion a system in which the state collects vastly more money and redistributes it back to the communities according to need. It amounted to a fundamental reorganization of the way taxes are collected and services are financed, a moving away from the previous fragmented system of local taxes, under which rich communities did well and poor ones starved.
 
A Crisis Atmosphere
 Instead of sending his department heads before appropriations committees to defend his plan, Mr. Florio developed a focused strategy to keep Republicans and tax-shy Democrats in the Democrat-dominated legislature on a tight rein. He sent only Mr. Berman to defend the budget, arguing that the rest of the cabinet was too green to speak authoritatively.
"I'd been in Trenton for 10 years then, and it was the first time I'd seen it done that way," said Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, now the Republican Speaker of the Assembly. "No one talked to us, no one collaborated, it was just pushed through in three weeks."
David Kehler, president of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey, a nonpartisan think tank and government watchdog group, concurred.
"Florio had a legislative strategy but he didn't have a public strategy to build public support for these things," he said. "His staff ran the tax increases through in a kind of crisis atmosphere - 'There's no time to debate, let's move on this.' "
In contrast, two other recession governors, John Engler of Michigan and Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, have since brought similar tax-shifting proposals before their lawmakers, only to see them defeated, Mr. Kehler said.
"So it was a legislative success for Florio, but it produced a massacre," he added.
 
Hitting Rock Bottom
 Most of the new taxes began biting quickly but the offsetting decline in the rate of property tax growth did not register for a year or more, and many voters, particularly those lower middle-income residents who stood to benefit from the Florio plan, rose in near revolt. The anti-tax crusade was skillfully abetted by gun owners and the National Rifle Association, which was gearing up for an attempted repeal of a strict gun control law Mr. Florio had successfully pushed for in late 1990.
Reporters began reaching for the Fahrenheit scale as a trope for the governor's below-freezing, and still falling, popularity rating. And when the polls closed on election day in November 1991, 32 Democrats had been defeated, and the Republicans had won 85 of the legislature's 120 seats and veto-proof majorities in both houses.
"It was very difficult," Mr. Florio said recently, looking back at the days when his administration hit rock bottom. "I suspect there are not a lot of people who could have gone through the last 3 1/2 years without crawling into a fetal position."
In the first 12 months of the new Assembly, Mr. Florio's veto was overridden 12 times, compared to three veto overrides in the previous 40 years. The Republicans rolled back the penny increase in the sales tax and overruled the governor's budget and enacted their own spending plan, one that cut spending from the previous year's level for the first time anyone could remember.
 
A Move to Bipartisanship
 Yet the Republican majority also began to feel the responsibilities of governing. When the cut in the sales tax brought the layoffs of thousands of state workers, Mr. Florio blamed the Republicans. When the budget cut resulted in higher prescription costs for elderly patients, the governor directed complaints to the legislature.
And in a victory, this spring, of immense importance to Mr. Florio's prestige, the Senate misread the popular feeling for gun control and was forced to back down on one of its leadership's first campaign pledge, to end the Governor's ban on certain semiautomatic firearms.
Meanwhile Mr. Florio brought in a new, less contentious top staff, including M. Robert DeCotiis as chief counsel, a man who, many Republicans concede, was skillful at soothing Republican feathers and at building a spirit of cooperation. More legislation rolled through in a bipartisan spirit, with each side happily claiming credit -- a tightening of welfare eligibility, election law changes, new coastal zone protections, the decontrol of prices at hospitals in the state.
Approaching what is probably his last try -- Governors in New Jersey are limited to two terms -- at an office he has coveted for 15 years, Mr. Florio feels that time has vindicated him.
"Somebody has to run the state," he said to explain his fierce style, "even if it takes a long time to cut through the noise and get to where people finally start to say, 'Oh, O.K. -- I see now.' "

HEADLINE: Weicker Plans to Offer Bill To Limit Handgun Ownership

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Oct. 26

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said today that he plans to draft legislation that would virtually ban the private ownership of handguns in Connecticut.
"It's time we stepped out on the issue," Mr. Weicker said. 
 "This isn't something unique to Connecticut. It's a national disease and it comes under the guise of people's -- quote -- rights," he said. "Well, believe me, the United States isn't in 1993 what it was in 1776. And we recognize it in every other phase of our life, and it's time we recognize it as far as weapons go."
Mr. Weicker first floated the idea of the handgun ban on Monday, but he said then that he was not certain if he would submit such a proposal to the General Assembly.
Today he said he plans to meet with legislative leaders and representatives of gun-lobbying groups to discuss the legislation before presenting it to the General Assembly in February.
 
Sees Shift in Opinion
 Mr. Weicker said he wants to ban the private ownership of all handguns, with the exception of those used by law-enforcement officials, the military, collectors and private security companies.
He acknowledged that the prospects for such a sweeping ban are not strong, but he said he believes that public sentiment is shifting in that direction. He also played down opposition from gun lobbyists.
"I'm not going to accept any more slogans," he said. "People are getting killed every which way in this state, as they are in states and cities across the nation -- we've never seen such unparalleled violence."
Mr. Weicker said that the state did not have enough money or police officers to deter crime and that such underlying social problems as unemployment, lack of health care and inadequate educational opportunities must be addressed before the state can ever hope to see the crime rate go down.
"Will the people of this state continue to permit the proliferation of handguns in the hands of anybody and everybody that wants to have them -- an instrument which has only one purpose, which is to maim or kill a human being? It's as simple as that. That is the purpose of a handgun," he said. "Or has the time come to get these weapons off the street?"
In June the state legislature passed a ban on the sale of about 60 semiautomatic guns deemed to be assault weapons. A coalition of gun owners, supported by the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment Foundation, is challenging the ban in court.

HEADLINE: G.M. Tells Plant It Will Delay Date Of Closing

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
General Motors gave its car assembly plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., a brief reprieve yesterday, saying it would continue operating as much as a year beyond its scheduled 1995 closing date.
But G.M. said that it still planned to close the plant as soon as full production of a 1996 mini-van model began elsewhere, and that employment at North Tarrytown until then would depend on sales of the Chevrolet Lumina, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac Transport mini-vans assembled there. 
 News of the delayed closing came as a relief to G.M. workers, shops and restaurants near the plant and to state and local officials who are trying to find a new use for the 95-acre site along the Hudson River. But most took the company at its word that it would still close the plant, which built its first automobiles in 1900 and is Westchester County's largest remaining factory.
"It's good news in that 2,000 people are going to be employed there for a year beyond when we thought they would," said Susan Glass, a spokeswoman for New York State's Commissioner of Economic Development, Vincent Tese. But, she said, the state has shifted its efforts from trying to persuade G.M. to stay to mediating talks between the company and the village on a departure package.
 
Cleanup a Goal
 The Mayor of North Tarrytown, Sean Tracy, said, "We see this as a reprieve for the business community in the village for another year or two, to allow them to prepare themselves for a new customer base."
In the meantime, Mr. Tracy said, the village's lawyers are working on a departure package proposed by General Motors. The village's primary goal is to make sure that G.M. cleans up the huge industrial site, so that the land will be attractive to buyers.
"This site is so important to the future of our community, we can't just whistle past the cemetery in the hope that G.M. might stay," he said.
G.M.'s announcement in February 1992 that it would close the North Tarrytown plant in 1995 stunned state, local and union officials, who had made large concessions to keep the factory open. Under a 10-year agreement that began in 1985, the state, county and village had provided incentives valued at $140 million.
 
Seeing Delay as Victory
 In 1987, Local 664 of the United Auto Workers had agreed to a contract that eliminated most job classifications in an effort to provide G.M. a modern and efficient shop floor.
Yesterday the president of Local 664, Donald C. Martino, saw the delayed closing as a victory, because it would keep the plant in operation until the next round of union talks with G.M. in 1996.
"I kept saying we'd never close in '95, while G.M. was saying it wouldn't change its decision," Mr. Martino said. "Everybody wrote us off, but the workers here kept building a world-class quality van. It depends on sales, of course, but sales are picking up, so maybe we can win a concession in '96 and stay open."
Margaret Holmes, a spokeswoman for G.M.'s midsize car division in Warren, Mich., said the North Tarrytown plant would stay open into the 1996 model year so that G.M. would maintain a presence in the mini-van market until its new 1996 model "accelerates to full production."
"This does not, however, change General Motors' plans to cease operations at North Tarrytown after the existing vehicle is replaced by the new mini-van," she said.
The number of jobs at the plant, which stood at 3,450 in February 1992 but fell to 2,150 six months later when G.M. eliminated the second shift in response to disappointing sales, "will depend on the orders we get from our customers," she said.
The threat of closing has hung over the assembly plant, G.M.'s oldest, since the 1970's. Its expensive retooling in the 1980's to build a new line of mini-vans was seen as a great victory, but tied its future to the success of models that havenot sold well. Now employees and the businesses that serve them are again hoping for the best.
"We've always been under the gun, and this extends the stem of hope for us," said Jimmy Carter, a U.A.W. attendance representative who has worked at the plant for 30 years. "The van is starting to sell, and we're putting in nine-hour days and every other Saturday. This is the best work force in the world."
Karen Eannacomi, an hourly worker, said: "Everybody's happy, and some people think this means the plant will stay open. I'm not sure of that, but the longer we stay here, the better it is for everybody. It gives us another year to plan the future."
Rick Tucci, a Pinkerton security guard assigned to the plant, said: "I think it's great if it stays open. Basically, if they're not here, I'm not here."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Calm Over Trade Pact's Prospects

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The victory of the Liberal Party in Canada's election on Monday has again put the spotlight on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The next Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, has said he wants to renegotiate the agreement to protect some Canadian exporters.
The possible objections from Canada provide an opportunity to ask what will happen in the bond market if the United States Congress rejects the agreement with Mexico. A leading opponent of the agreement, David E. Bonior, a Democrat of Michigan, said yesterday that just 10 more votes were needed to get the 218 votes to defeat the trade pact. Congress is scheduled to vote on it on Nov. 17. 
 Some analysts argue that the bond market will sell off if the agreement is defeated, even though a defeat will not have a significant impact on economic growth or inflation in the near term.
"Nafta is an important symbol of American willingness to continue to be part of the world," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at at CS First Boston. "Defeat would be a very bearish symbol. The instant market reaction would be negative and it would also call into question President Clinton's ability to get other things done in the future, especially on deficit reduction."
Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers, agreed about the symbolic importance of the agreement, adding that its defeat would raise doubts about moving ahead with other efforts, like the still-stalled negotiations to open world markets under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
"Free trade and open borders for money and goods are a tremendously disinflationary force, and anything that disrupts that will raise questions about the larger effort," he said.
But Mr. DiClemente was not sure how much the bond market would be affected by a Congressional defeat of the free-trade pact because the immediate impact on inflation and growth would not be significant. "I think it would cause a ripple," he said. "I don't know if it would be enough in itself to dominate a day's trading or start a trend."
Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said the Congressional vote on the agreement would probably have little impact. "The big effect of this is political," he said. "I don't view it as something that will affect the market significantly one way or another."
 
Treasury Market
 Prices of Treasury bonds and notes inched higher after falling for three consecutive days. Because traders and investors are so uncertain about the course of the economy and inflation, each new piece of economic news is watched closely.
Yesterday's report on consumer confidence turned out to be a surprise on the positive side for the market: that is, the report was weaker than expected. The Conference Board consumer confidence index for October was 59.4, down from a revised 63.8 in September. Most analysts had been expecting an increase to around 65. The news helped bolster prices early in the day.
The market also received a lift in the afternoon from a weaker-than-expected report on department store sales for the first three weeks of October.
In secondary trading, the price of the 30-year bond was up 7/32 of a point, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.98 percent from 6 percent the day before. The yield on the Treasury's three-year note was at 4.16 percent, down from 4.16 percent.
The announcement that the Treasury would sell $26.8 billion in three- and six-month bills next week pushed the discount rates on both securities higher. The rate on the three-month bill was 3.07 percent, up from 3.03 percent.
In the Treasury market, the auction of $16.5 billion of two-year Treasury notes went as expected. The notes were auctioned at the high yield of 3.94 percent. That is the same rate as at the end of trading Monday and is the same as the yield at the auction in September. In late trading in the when-issued market, the yield on the newly auctioned notes was at 3.92 percent, a reflection of demand after the auction and a signal that the dealers who bought them at the auction are probably happy with the auction results.
The Treasury will auction $11 billion of five-year notes today. In late trading in the when-issued market, the yield was 4.78 percent, down from 4.81 percent Monday.
 
Sweden's Bonds
 Sweden offered its first floating- rate global issue. A global issue can be traded simultaneously in markets around the world.
The $1 billion issue, with Lehman Brothers and J. P. Morgan Securities as joint lead managers, will have an interest rate that will change every quarter. The rate will be the London interbank offered rate minus 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. The first rate will be set just before settlement, which is Nov. 15. Based on yesterday's rate, the interest would be about 3.35 percent.
Bradley H. Jack, the head of the debt syndicate at Lehman Brothers, said the floating-rate market for debt issued by governments was not very active in the United States. So to make this deal attractive to American investors, it was done globally. This means that American investors can sell the bonds in Europe or Asia, where the markets for these issues are more active. About 25 percent of the deal was done in the United States, with 40 percent in Europe and 35 percent in Asia.
 
Corporate Bonds
 In the corporate market, the New York Telephone Company, a subsidiary of the Nynex Corporation, priced $400 million of debt securities yesterday, joining dozens of companies that have refinanced high-interest debt to take advantage of lower interest rates.
So far this year, American companies have sold more than $346.1 billion of bonds, mainly to refinance outstanding debt. American companies redeemed a record $74 billion in corporate bonds during the first eight months of this year, Fitch Investors Service Inc. said.
New York Telephone sold its bonds through two competitive pricings, with $150 million of 5 5/8 percent noncallable notes due in 2003 awarded to Morgan Stanley & Company and priced at 98.403 to yield 5.838 percent, or about 43 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.
The telephone company also sold $250 million of 6.70 percent debentures due in 2023 at 97.606 to yield 6.89 percent through Salomon Brothers. Underwriters said the 30-year debentures were callable in 20 years and rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps.
 
Municipal Bonds
 In the municipal market, the City of Los Angeles sold $390.7 million of waste-water system revenue bonds through competitive bidding, awarding the issue to Morgan Stanley. The maximum yield was 5.37 percent for an issue due in 2021, followed by 5.32 percent for a bond due in 2019, 5.31 percent in 2017 and 5.20 percent in 2014. For shorter maturity serial bonds, yields ranged from 2.75 percent in 1994 to 4.10 percent in 1998, 4.75 percent in 2003, 5.2015 percent in 2008 and 5.25 percent in 2010.
Because the bonds are insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company for interest and principle payments, they are rated triple-A by Moody's and Standard & Poor's.

Consumer Confidence Drop Causes Dollar to Weaken

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar generally weakened yesterday, hurt by news of falling consumer confidence in the economy. But it gained against the Canadian dollar after Canadians overwhelmingly voted the Conservatives out of power.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 108.35 Japanese yen, from 108.58 yen on Monday. It also slipped to 1.6805 marks, from 1.6855 marks. Still, the dollar rose to $1.3169 (Canadian), from $1.3123 (Canadian). 
 Gold prices were mostly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery settled at $370.30 an ounce, off 20 cents from late Monday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for spot gold at $369.30 an ounce, unchanged from Monday.
 
 
Conference Board Report
 A report by the Conference Board business research group that showed that consumer faith in the economy fell this month set the tone for a selloff in the dollar, currency strategists said.
The monthly report said many American consumers expected their own finances to worsen in coming months. That was construed as a sign of economic weakness that would tend to make the dollar's value worth less.
"It looks like the dollar has run out of steam on its aggressive move" upward, said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Paine Webber in New York.
Gillie Augeri, a vice president and chief dealer at Shawmut Bank in Connecticut, said the decline partly reflected investor profit taking on the dollar's recent strength. "If you wanted to take profits, this was an excellent day to take them," he said. "You had an excellent excuse to sell."
The notable exception to the dollar's weakness was its surge against the Canadian dollar. On Monday, Canadian voters overwhelmingly voted out the governing Progressive Conservative Party in favor of the Liberal challengers. The uncertainty of how the Liberals may change Canada's economic policies was a major reason for the move out of Canadian dollars.
"When you think about it and you're an investor and looking at Canada at this point it must be kind of scary," Mr. Augeri said.
The British pound, meanwhile, rose to $1.4795 in New York, up from $1.4790 late Monday.

The Minstrel Tradition: Not Just a Racist Relic

BYLINE: By MARGO JEFFERSON

 BODY:
Love and Theft
Blackface Minstrelsy and The American Working Class
By Eric Lott
314 pages. Oxford University Press. $24.95.
 Of course the recent blackface colboration between Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg at the Friars Club knocked Somalia off the front page: culture wars on the home front leave no civilians untouched. Entertainment and politics are both about power, and entertainment is a lot more fun.
All of which is at the heart of Eric Lott's terrifically smart and unexpectedly timely study of blackface minstrelsy. Rightly, he sees it as a crucial source for, and form of, popular culture. It was big business. It was a riot of ethnic and regional styles. And it was a psychic map that traced and exposed its fans' curiosity about the boundaries between races, classes and sexes. 
 Blackface minstrelsy was an American descendant of commedia dell'arte and an American cousin of English music hall. At its baldest, Mr. Lott writes, it was "an established 19th-century theatrical practice, principally of the urban North, in which white men caricatured blacks for sport and profit," assuring themselves of their racial superiority in the process. More complexly, these caricatures were stoked by fascination as well as derision. The gestures, voices, songs and dances borrowed from blacks or imagined to be black, he goes on, were "less a sign of absolute white power and control than of panic, anxiety, terror and pleasure." Imitation always implies admiration of some kind.
Put this all together and you have the form that gave rise to vaudeville and rock, Billy Crystal and Howard Stern, Al Jolson and Michael Bolton, "Saturday Night Live" and "In Living Color." And, given that its stars were all men, many of whom specialized in playing women (mainly viragos and wenches) onstage, it can be said that it paved the way for the mainstream cross-dressing of Milton Berle, Jonathan Winters, Flip Wilson and RuPaul (who, I'm told, attended the Goldberg roast dressed in a nun's habit).
Minstrelsy ruled the American stage during the 1830's, 40's and 50's, playing to an economically and socially distraught country. The industrial North and its wage labor was pitted against the agrarian South and its slave labor. Immigrants were at odds with those longtime citizens who considered themselves the "real" Americans. Economic changes sent women into the workplace and jobless men back to the home. The anti-slavery movement was gearing up, as was the struggle for women's suffrage. Minstrelsy's first audiences largely comprised working-class men who were at the center of these crises and felt at the mercy of them.
The first successful minstrel was a song-and-dance man named T. D. Rice, who, according to The Atlantic Monthly, was sauntering down a Cincinnati street one day in 1830 when he heard a voice singing: "Turn about an' wheel about an' do jis so/An' ebery time I turn about I jump Jim Crow." The voice belonged to "a Negro stage-driver lolling lazily on the box of his vehicle," and Rice was enchanted. "As a national or 'race' illustration, behind the footlights, might not 'Jim Crow' and a black face tickle the fancy of pit and circle . . .? Out of the suggestion leaped the determination."
Mr. Lott is at his best tracking the ways in which a "national illustration" -- a figure, like Uncle Sam, meant to embody a nation's identity -- became a "race illustration." Black Jim Crow, thanks to slavery, embodied a nation's identity crisis. The key to this transformation lies in the unruly power of comedy, as this telling quote from Freud makes clear: "The discovery that one has it in one's power to make someone else comic opens the way to an undreamt-of yield of comic pleasure and is the origin of a highly developed technique." And the power to make other people comic is linked to the power to make one's own fears and uncertainties comic.
Minstrelsy did just that. It began with black makeup and pseudo-plantation songs, dances and stories. It extended itself to mocking and ambivalent commentary on abolition, suffrage, political corruption, city life, country life and westward expansion. It made burlesque out of Shakespeare, ballet and the manners of the nouveau riche. It assimilated the passionate melodrama of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." It produced ballads, polkas, jigs and the syncopated predecessors of ragtime. And it accommodated, without removing the blackface, Irish, German, Italian and Yiddish accents.
The beat goes on, and minstrelsy puts on new masks with every generation. Mr. Lott cites Elvis Presley's now-legendary blackface turns without makeup: what would he make of Chuck Berry's forays into whiteface? (Mr. Berry sounds like a rockabilly redneck in "Johnny B. Goode" and a bemused sitcom father in "School Days.") Irish, Italian or Yiddish accents have been replaced by Puerto Rican, Polish and Russian ones.
And if rock videos are any indication, Asians are the new exotics of choice. They exude "Last Emperor" lust and mystery in Janet Jackson's "If I Was Your Girl." They exude technocratic lust and mystery in Madonna's "Rain." And, as the jazz musicians behind the black rappers in Digable Planets' "Cool Like Dat," they signify the ultra-hip, just as black jazz musicians used to signify it when they played behind white poets.
Mr. Lott is a professor of American studies at the University of Virginia, and he is so alert to minstrelsy's multiple impulses and strategies that I would like him to pursue them into the 20th century. But I want him to do so in a language that refuses to hide behind the mask of academic theory. Phrases like "the signifying chain linking working men to Bowery amusements" or the "inescapable synecdoches of plantation, factory and home" are deadly at this point. And the endless chain of quotes from like-minded scholars, reads, as Mr. Lott notes trenchantly in another context, "like a self-serving roll call of brand names." Every field, from American studies to journalism, has a standardized language. But it is up to scholars and writers to take the best of this and discard the rest. Mr. Lott has a mind of his own. Why not find a voice, too?

HEADLINE: China Makes Trade Pact for Americas Urgent;
Rethink the Agreement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Giving in to the pie-in-sky hopes expressed by supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement is not what I would expect of William Safire. "Laughter After Nafta" (column, Oct. 21) is no joking matter for tens of thousands of American workers on unemployment lines today or heading toward them in the future. 
 Mr. Safire's willingness to throw some people out of work now to help our kids get better jobs tomorrow is disingenuous. The trade agreement will not lose any jobs for economists or political columnists, but it will accelerate the outflow of factory and craft-worker jobs that have been sliding south to the sweatshops along our border with Mexico and eastward to Taiwan and other offshore factories.
What are the jobs that will benefit tomorrow's workers to which Mr. Safire alludes? Does he expect our unemployed and underemployed workers to wait two or three generations, or forever, for Mexican and other Southern Hemisphere laborers to turn into big ticket consumers?
As our economy is significantly driven by middle-income consumer purchases, the outflight of jobs to Mexico can only serve to shrink our pool of workers with discretionary income to spend. It's already happen
ing. What economic quid pro quo will Mexico supply, and how long will it take to generate?
With unemployment at record highs, particularly for minority youngsters, the United States neither today nor tomorrow can afford the price of providing improved income to Mexican workers and also to the run-away United States industries enjoying low-cost labor rates. We cannot reasonably expect all the next generation of Americans to be highly skilled technical-professional class employees. We can't expect all future workers to be college educated.
The United States will always need assembly, semiskilled and unskilled workers. How can we keep these jobs within our borders with the trade agreeement sending them south?
The trade agreement does not answer America's need for work opportunities today or tomorrow, and realistically, it certainly does not guarantee an evolving middle class south of the border. Mexico's population is one of the fastest growing in the world. And the free trade treaty will not provide jobs equal to this exponentially exploding birthrate.
Mr. Safire also envisions a North American marketplace 370 million strong to keep Europe and Asia from "ganging up." Predictions for a Europe as an implacable economic entity have been set on their ear lately by the unwillingness of members of the European Community to give up enough monetary sovereignty, cultural independence or border control to make such a competitive monolith an impending threat to our economy.
We have yet to see Asia evolve as a solidified economic force aimed at North America. The Asian countries are tough enough competitors separately. But the competition among China, Japan, Korea and a half-dozen smaller Pacific countries is too dynamic to foresee a unified economic community rising out of the East.
We will have to rethink the North American Free Trade Agreement and possibly redraft it to conform to the realities of a United States in need of more work. We certainly cannot think of our country as an island economy unto itself. But it is also adjusting to a hemorrhage of industrial jobs and is still without a program for keeping its workers employed. The trade agreement will not help solve these needs.
Things to do within our borders include tax credits to businesses, small and large, that invest in job-producing research and development, and create training programs, along with increased Federal aid for cities and states filtered through the private sector to help rebuild our crumbling infrastructure or prepare displaced workers for new opportunities. These and not a stronger Mexican economy are more likely solutions to cure the defects of our displaced manufacturing economy. Otherwise the last laugh heard will be Mexico's.

HEADLINE: China Makes Trade Pact for Americas Urgent

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A few days ago I returned from a trip to China. I would like to send a few select members of the House of Representatives over there to take a look at what's happening. China's overwhelming infrastructure and industrial development ambitions are clearly beyond its pocketbook. Vast new projects, like Shanghai's huge new city complex of Pudong stand partly developed with most of the work being done by manual labor. 
 Meanwhile, the dilemma of Western investment institutions isn't whether or not to invest in China, but only how to get money into the market. Pending an equity market with some stability, and the introduction of acceptable legal protection for investors, most Western capital wishing to participate in China's growth will continue to flow to the markets of other countries in China's economic orbit. One day soon, probably with Hong Kong as the facade, China will appear a respectable recipient to these institutions.
The giant sucking sound heard by representatives opposed to the North American Free Trade Agreement comes not from south of our border; it comes from the East. Western capital is and will be used to build the industries that employ Chinese, not Western, workers. The primary beneficiaries of the Chinese worker's increased spending power will not be the West, but other Asian countries.
How shortsighted the House will be if it does not approve the North American Free Trade Agreement. We must get on with building one large, powerful North and South American industrial and economic bloc in which our capital is invested to improve Western living conditions. The Chinese will not buy United States cars; Mexicans do.

HEADLINE: Redrawing the Map in Canada

 BODY:
The Liberal Party landslide in the Canadian elections was more like an avalanche. The Progressive Conservatives, who ruled for the past nine years, took the worst pasting ever for a governing party; they lost 151 seats and will have only 2 in the new Parliament. Meanwhile, two new regional parties scored huge gains. It's a new political era for America's biggest trading partner and closest ally.
Jean Chretien, the Liberals' leader who now becomes prime minister, is a career politician, well known by his service in nine cabinet posts and comfortably familiar to the hierarchy of U.S. power and politics. He's no Pierre Trudeau -- the last Liberal Prime Minister, outspoken and flamboyant. But like Mr. Trudeau, he hails from Quebec and is firmly opposed to Quebec separatism. 
 The Liberals' sweep -- they won 30 more than half of the 295 seats -- was striking in itself, but no more so than the sudden emergence of two parties with no nationwide following. All three parties' gains could be traced in large measure to the overwhelming unpopularity of former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservatives.
Mr. Mulroney was scraping bottom in public opinion polls when he quit last spring. The principal factors in his collapse were Canada's weak economy, unpopular taxes and job losses attributed to the free-trade pact he made with Washington.
Mr. Chretien makes a point of saying he has no interest in going fishing with the U.S. President, as Mr. Mulroney did with President Bush, lest he end up as the fish. He also talks broadly of wanting better terms for Canada in its free-trade agreements with the U.S. and Mexico. It remains to be seen what he means, and how much of that talk was campaign rhetoric. But his principal pledge was to create jobs with a quick dose of public works; given Canada's budget deficit, that will be difficult.
The two regional parties can't outvote him in Parliament, but will pose a constant reminder of the country's divisions. Most Liberal seats are in the East. The three-year-old Bloc Quebecois exists only in Quebec, mainly to fight for sovereignty. The Reform Party, founded six years ago, is a Western reaction to domination by Ontario and Quebec; more conservative than the Conservatives, it targets government spending and immigrants.
The Bloc Quebecois will be the "official opposition" in the new Parliament, having placed second with 54 seats; the Reform Party got 52. Symbolically, the Bloc's leader, Lucien Bouchard, declares his commitment to separation by saying he won't move to the Ottawa mansion provided for the head of the opposition.
But substantively, Mr. Bouchard said on election night that his party was ready to "tackle the most urgent tasks of Canada," namely economic revival. "Our goal is not to rend the fabric" of Canada's institutions, he said -- in English.
Canada's voters have made one thing clear: They want no more of the Conservatives for now. But by splitting their support between East and West, English and French, they have mapped out a fractious political landscape.

HEADLINE: U.S. CANCELS A PLAN TO BEGIN SANCTIONS AFTER JAPAN ACTS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today canceled plans to impose trade sanctions next Monday against Japan after Tokyo agreed to open its public sector construction market to international competition.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, announced this morning that the Administration would not proceed with the sanctions, at least for now, because the Japanese Government had promised to eliminate the practice of restricting the bidding on construction contracts to a few companies. The sanctions would have barred Japanese companies from bidding on some Federal construction projects. 
 The century-old Japanese restrictions have long been a sore point with American construction companies. Irritation over them has intensified in the last decade, as Japan embarked on an extensive program to build better roads, airports and other public works. Ending the restrictions would eliminate a persistent source of friction between the two countries.
 
A 'Historic' Move
 "This move today by the Japanese Government is welcome, it is important, it is significant, and it's historic," Mr. Kantor said.
The Japanese plan to end restrictions had only a few details today. Mr. Kantor said the Administration was still prepared to impose sanctions if the Japanese Government did not provide further details of its plan and carry it out by Jan. 20. But he played down this possibility, saying that the Japanese plan, "indicates for the first time that the Government of Japan is determined to bring about important reforms in its public sector construction market, including improved access for all foreign firms."
The Japanese decision to change the Government contracting procedures is more the result of domestic political changes in Japan than any response to the threat of American sanctions, said Seiichiro Noboru, the top economics official at the Japanese Embassy here.
Bribery of Japanese Government officials by local construction companies contributed to the downfall of the Liberal Democratic Party this summer and its replacement by a coalition of seven parties championing deregulation and other changes. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has set up a special council of senior politicians to draft by late December a detailed overhaul of Government construction contracting practices.
By moving the American deadline to January, Mr. Kantor accommodated the Japanese schedule.
Tokyo has agreed to provide further details at next month's meeting in Seattle, where President Clinton is scheduled to discuss trade and investment issues with Mr. Hosokawa and a dozen other heads of state from countries with Pacific Ocean coastlines, Mr. Kantor said.
The Japanese plan accepted by Mr. Kantor today also called for Tokyo to bar bids by companies convicted of bribery, improve enforcement of its anti-monopoly law and establish objective, published standards for bidding and contracting procedures. All of these steps could limit the discretion of the powerful bureaucrats at the Japanese Construction Ministry, who have successfully resisted previous American efforts to open the Japanese construction market.
 
Senator Backs Plan
 Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who has pushed successive administrations for seven years to open the Japanese construction market, said today that the Japanese plan was vague in some places but still ambitious enough to justify the postponement of sanctions. "I think they've accomplished something," he said.
Mr. Murkowski said his concerns centered on the Japanese pledge to apply the changes to all contracts above a certain value, without specifying a value. The value must be set low enough to cover contracts for American architectural and engineering companies, and not just big contracts that include a lot of earthmoving and other work performed locally in Japan, the Senator said.
Charles E. Hawkins, a senior vice president for Associated Builders and Contractors, an American industry group based in Washington, said he was cautiously optimistic that the Japanese offer would make a difference, but wanted to see the details. A Japanese agreement in the late 1980's to open the bidding for the construction of the Kansai International Airport at Osaka initially seemed like a big concession to the United States, but the fine print of that deal later prevented American companies from winning more than a tiny fraction of the contracts for the project, he said.
American companies are interested in Japan because, "you look around the world and it's the one area where there's a lot of construction going on," said Kenneth H. Fraelich, the executive vice president of marketing and strategic business development at AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems Inc., which tried unsuccessfully to sell a mass-transit system to the Kansai airport project.
"Our business there we couldn't double or triple right now because it's zero," he said, adding that the latest Japanese offer, "is a very encouraging announcement if they do what they say."
 
Size of Problem Debated
 For years, the United States and Japan have been unable to agree even on the size of the problem. According to Japanese Embassy figures, American companies won $330 million of public sector contracts in Japan last year, while Japanese companies won $325 million in contracts in the United States. But Commerce Department figures show that American companies won only $189 million of a $700 billion Japanese market last year, while Japanese companies took $1.5 billion of the $425 billion American market.
Some American construction industry executives contend that even the Commerce Department figures understate the disparity because Japanese companies have bought large stakes in many American construction businesses, while American companies have had trouble investing in their Japanese rivals.

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico Takes Lead With School Vouchers, And Feels the Arrows

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Oct. 26

 BODY:
As the rest of the nation continues to debate using school vouchers, Puerto Rico is plunging ahead with a month-old experimental voucher program that has already provoked threats of an islandwide teachers' strike as early as next week.
The legislation, passed on Sept. 3, is intended to "expand the options of parents and students with regard to the selection of schools," said Education Secretary Jose Arsenio Torres, and to "offer economic incentives to public schools to improve their course offerings." 
 Under the plan, parents who participate receive a government credit of $1,500 per child. They can then transfer the credit to the public or private school of their choice.
"We have taken this radical step because we have a sick school system," Mr. Torres said in an interview here this morning. "Our costs have been getting higher and higher, registration has been dropping, the dropout rate has been climbing and the achievement level falling. The people want change, and we are giving it to them."
 
Opposition From Teachers
 But the plan has met with intense resistance from three unions representing the 46,000 teachers in the commonwealth. The teachers are demanding the dismissal of Mr. Torres and a halt to what they call the "privatization" of public education. Two of the unions have authorized a strike and the third has scheduled a strike vote for next Saturday; if it passes, as seems likely, union leaders say a strike could begin Nov. 1.
"Every dollar spent on vouchers is a dollar taken away from the public schools," said Jose Eligio Velez, president of the Teachers' Association of Puerto Rico, which with more than 27,000 members is the largest of the three unions. "There have never been enough dollars to attend the needs of the public schools, and this will only drain even further what is available."
While Puerto Rico has more than doubled its spending on education in the last decade, to $1.5 billion, the commonwealth, which has a population of 3.6 million, still spends only $1,987 per pupil, compared with a mainland average of $5,245.
Several states are also considering school voucher programs, which were supported by the Reagan and Bush Administrations, and voters in California will decide next week whether to use such a system there. The Clinton Administration is opposed to voucher programs.
 
$1,500 Grants Available
 Under the Puerto Rican plan, qualified students from second grade through high school are to receive a $1,500 grant at the start of each school year, a significant sum where the annual per capita income is $6,500, less than half that of the states. The grants can be used at any public or private school willing to enroll them. An initial fund of $10 million was established for the current school year, but that amount will expand to $30 million by 1997, when the commonwealth's Legislature is scheduled to review the program.
Because the voucher plan became law just days before classes began, only 1,716 of the island's more than 650,000 students have thus far used vouchers to change schools. According to commonwealth statistics, 1,121 students have transferred from one public school to another, 302 have moved from public schools to private schools and 293 have left private schools to enroll in public schools.
Leaders of the teachers' unions portray the voucher legislation, sponsored by Gov. Pedro Rossello, as beneficial only to the wealthy, because the poor are presumed to be not able to afford private school tuition. But Mr. Torres and other supporters of the program point to the movement of students from private to public schools, and within the public school system, as proof that the plan has broader appeal.
"There is no reason to fear a great exodus or a privatization of the schools," said the Rev. Jose A. Basols, outgoing president of the Puerto Rico Association of Private Education and director of Colegio Ponceno, one of the best-known private schools on the island. "They are battling ghosts."
 
School-Based Management
 Only families with an income of less than $18,000 a year are eligible to make use of the vouchers. The cutoff will exclude many families that send their children to private schools, but will include a vast majority of families with students in public schools. In addition, students cannot claim a voucher if they transfer from one private school to another, and no more than 50 percent of the students enrolled at any private school can be voucher recipients.
The government's voucher program is central to a broader and even more controversial educational decentralization plan intended to install school-based management, now in place in some school districts on the mainland.
Of Puerto Rico's 1,650 public schools, 40 are being run by teacher-parent councils under legislation passed last June, with 50 more designated to adopt the system in January and the rest scheduled to follow over the next five years.
The three main teachers' unions oppose that change, too. "We do not believe that the councils are prepared or qualified to evaluate or select teachers," said Renan Soto, president of the Teachers' Federation of Puerto Rico. "We are also worried about the powers the councils will have in a country that is as highly politicized as ours."
 
Union Interests Cited
 But supporters of the voucher and community school programs say the unions are thinking not of the welfare of students but of their political muscle. "The unions see this as a threat to their interests and do not want to lose their power," Father Basols said. "They don't understand that this is a great opportunity to improve the schools."
The National Education Association has sent 11 organizers here to help its local affiliate, the Teachers Association of Puerto Rico, in organizing a strike and explaining the teachers' cause to the public. The national group has also authorized $100,000 for assistance to teachers here, including radio advertisements and leaflets, and has said it will grant interest-free loans of $500 to members who join a strike.
Teachers' unions here have also taken the issue to court, contending that the law violates both the Puerto Rico Constitution and a 1990 statute governing the education system. That law makes it illegal to "use public funds or property to sustain schools and educational institutions that are not of the state."
But Justice Secretary Pedro Pierluisi testified recently that "research into both local and Federal law showed there were no constitutional obstacles" to the program. He and other state officials maintain that because the vouchers are issued to the families of students, not to the schools they attend, the prohibition does not apply.
 
Praise From a Parent
 At the 40 schools that have already been turned over to community control, like the Dr. Francisco Hernandez Gaetan Elementary School here, a public school, parents and teachers say they need a voucher program if they are to succeed. While some teachers at some community schools elsewhere have complained of a heavier workload with no pay increase, parents and teachers here said vouchers are a way to strengthen their neighborhood school
"I'm going to stay here no matter what happens," said Miguel Casilla Rivera, a sanitation worker whose four children attend the school. "I like what the teachers are doing, I like having a voice in the decisions, and my children feel at home here. So I see no reason to go somewhere else" once he obtains vouchers.
The school is already making changes to be more competitive. Its teacher-parent council will offer free after-school courses in music and art, and it hopes to organize a computer education course with money raised from local businesses.
"We believe the voucher program is going to benefit us because we will be able to offer more services," said the school's principal, Luz Hernandez. "Our parents are committed to this school, so we think we will have more money to spend on books and equipment and materials."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: The Overview;
CONGRESS IS GIVEN CLINTON PROPOSAL FOR HEALTH CARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
After nine months of brainstorming and politicking, President Clinton delivered to Congress today a 240,000-word proposal for universal health insurance. It represents the most complex, detailed legislative blueprint devised by any President.
The document provides scores of details that were not available in White House documents or speeches by Administration officials over the last nine months. 
 The final legislative proposal revises earlier versions of the President's package, in an effort to control costs and to satisfy the hundreds of political constituencies that are already doing battle over the issue, on which Mr. Clinton has staked his Presidency.
 
Ready to Compromise
 In the Capitol, under the gaze of statues of figures from America's past, Mr. Clinton declared that the United States was "choking on a health care system that is not working." He and his wife, Hillary, summoned Congress to join them in a historic mission to guarantee comprehensive health insurance coverage for all Americans.
His voice rising and his fists pumping, Mr. Clinton demanded that Congress pass a bill by the end of next year. He offered to compromise on most matters, saying, "I want to reiterate what I have said so many times: I have no pride of authorship, nor do I wish this to be a partisan endeavor or victory." But he also said, "When it is over, we must have achieved comprehensive health care security for all Americans, or the endeavor will not have been worth the effort."
Republicans and Democrats alike predict that Congress will make substantial changes in the health care system next year. But members of both parties said today that Mr. Clinton's proposal would be substantially revised on Capitol Hill and that the legislation ultimately enacted would be more modest.
 
Signaling Flexibility
 Like her husband, Mrs. Clinton signaled flexibility, a willingness to jettison almost any element of the White House plan except the goal of providing a comprehensive package of health benefits to all Americans. "We have literally no pride of authorship on many of the details and technical aspects" of the bill, she said.
Mrs. Clinton asked for bipartisan cooperation. In that spirit, her husband praised President Richard M. Nixon as well as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman for trying to provide health insurance coverage for more people.
Mrs. Clinton told Congress today, "This will be an opportunity for all of us to work together, to go beyond politics as usual, to make it clear to the American people that this President and this Congress hear them and are committed to solving their problems in a very real way."
But at the ceremony at the Capitol the Republican leaders of both houses, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, warned that the legislative process would be difficult.
"There are substantive and profound policy differences" between the President and Republicans, Mr. Michel said. "The real differences cannot be glossed over," he added, asserting that Mr. Clinton would take the nation "on an uncharted course of government-run medicine."
Mr. Dole said, "Turning over one-seventh of our economy to the United States Government is an idea that has many Americans -- Republicans and Democrats -- very concerned."
Also attending the ceremony was Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, who has spent much of his career trying to control health costs. He described the Clinton plan as the "most complete work product that I have ever seen, and I think anybody here has ever seen" from a President.
On the other hand, Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a conservative Democrat from Texas, said later, "It's a little bit more expensive and a little more government than the American people can get excited about."
 
'It Seems Bewildering'
 Mr. Clinton's vision of health care overhaul, blending free-market competition with Federal regulation, has always sounded a bit complicated. People reading the full text of his proposal today were left with a bewildering sense of the immense complexity of the proposal.
Anticipating this concern, Mr. Clinton said, "When we debate something that the Administration recommends or something some of you recommend, and it seems bewildering in its complexity, I ask that it be compared against what we have now, because none of us could devise a system more complex, more burdensome, more administratively costly than the one we have now."
Dozens of details, including these, emerged from the text of Mr. Clinton's proposed bill, which will not be formally introduced in Congress for several days:
*Abortion would be covered like other services deemed medically necessary and appropriate. But the proposed legislation includes a "conscience clause," stating that doctors and hospitals need not perform procedures to which they object because of religious belief or moral conviction.
*Health insurance purchasing groups known as regional health alliances would be responsible for collecting all the premiums owed by consumers and businesses. In addition, states would have to insure that the amounts are indeed paid. But the bill does not say how this goal would be achieved, or who would be financially responsible if the payments fell short.
*The Federal Government would put intense pressure on states to set up alliances guaranteeing health coverage for all state residents by Jan. 1, 1998. If a state did not meet that deadline, the Secretary of Health and Human Services could withhold Federal money and take direct action to set up and operate the alliances.
*A new agency, the National Health Board, would set a health budget for the nation and would regulate most private health insurance premiums. There would be "no administrative or judicial review of any determination" by the board on these questions.
*Starting in 2003, workers would owe Federal income tax on any employer-provided health benefits that exceed the standard package of benefits defined by Federal law. Currently, health benefits are not counted as income.
*The Federal Government would review the prices charged for new drugs that represent a significant advance over existing drugs, and it would publish its findings. Elderly and disabled people on Medicare would get a new benefit covering the cost of prescription drugs. To qualify for this program, drug makers would have to give the Government a discount of at least 17 percent off the average retail price of their old drugs.
 
Regional Alliances
 The amount of discounts on new drugs would be subject to negotiation with the Government. Federal officials could deny Medicare coverage for a new drug if the Government and the manufacturer could not agree on the discounts.
Under the Clinton plan, most Americans would get health insurance coverage through the regional alliances. A company with more than 5,000 full-time employees could operate its own health insurance program outside the alliances. People working at company headquarters would be in the corporate health plan.
Employees of a big company working in another state at an office with fewer than 100 employees could join the local alliance in that state.
There has been much debate about the role of these alliances, which under Mr. Clinton's proposal could be either private not-for-profit corporations or state government agencies. The alliances could set fee schedules for doctors who charge a separate fee for each service performed.
In a last-minute adjustment to placate doctors, the White House decided that physicians may conduct "collective negotiations" with the regional alliances, even though Federal antitrust laws would ordinarily prohibit such collective action to set fees.
Doctors said they needed this exemption from the antitrust laws to balance the economic power of the alliances. A typical alliance would be buying health care for hundreds of thousands or millions of consumers.
 
Creating New Agencies
 The Administration assumes that most Americans will enroll in health maintenance organizations or similar networks of doctors and hospitals, which provide comprehensive coverage in return for premiums set in advance. Under the Clinton proposal, all health plans, including H.M.O.'s, would have to give consumers an opportunity to use doctors who did not participate in the plan. Consumers would generally have to pay more if they used a doctor or a hospital outside the network.
Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, consumers who believe they have been improperly denied medical services or payments could file a protest with a "complaint review office." Each state would have to establish such an office. A consumer dissatisfied with the state's decision could appeal to a new Federal agency, the Federal Health Plan Review Board, and from there to a Federal appeals court and to the Supreme Court.
This scheme is intended to limit the number of claims getting into Federal court. But some lawyers predict that there will be a flood of lawsuits by people trying to enforce the new right to health care envisioned by Mr. Clinton.
The President made changes in his proposal to attract support from conservative Democrats and Republicans in Congress. But some changes annoyed liberal Democrats.
Some Democrats were upset over a provision to limit Federal spending on subsidies for low-income workers. "I think it undermines the credibility of the Administration's promise of universal coverage, insurance that will always be there, because it won't be there if they run out of money," Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said.
Mr. Waxman heads the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and is the architect of a half-dozen laws that expanded Medicaid to serve millions of pregnant women and young children in the last decade.
 
Backing From Catholic Group
 The American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Catholic Health Association, representing Roman Catholic hospitals, hailed the President's call for universal health coverage.
But drug makers and biotechnology companies asserted that the Clinton plan would discourage investment in research to find cures for AIDS, cancer and other deadly diseases.
Lisa J. Raines, vice president of the Genzyme Corporation, said tonight: "We are deeply disappointed that, after dozens of meetings, members of the Administration still do not understand that Federal review of new drug prices would have a devastating impact on the biotechnology industry. It's tantamount to price control. We have found that Congress has a deeper understanding of this issue."
 
Arriving at Creating a Consensus
 Mr. Clinton said his proposal would provide much more coverage of preventive services than is usually found in private health insurance plans. It would, for example, pay for immunizations, Pap smears, cholesterol screening, mammograms, blood tests and periodic medical examinations, all according to a schedule prescribed by the Government.
The White House said tonight that it had lined up 31 senators and 43 House members to co-sponsor the President's plan. But the list includes critics like Mr. Waxman and Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, who want to make major changes in the Clinton proposal.
While many lawmakers disagree with specific details of the President's proposal, Mr. Clinton does appear to have forged a consensus in favor of action on this issue.
"Partial or incremental approaches are no longer options," said John E. Curley Jr., president of the Catholic Health Association. "Because of President Clinton's leadership, health care reform will now be seriously debated in the public policy arena for the first time in more than a decade."

Charts: "How Much, How Soon"
 The Clinton health care plan lays out a rought timetable, subject to delays in passage by Congress.
 
1994: The Administration hopes Congress will pass the plan in spring or summer; a more cautious assessment is that Congress will not act until fall.
 
1995-1997: Transitional period during which states would establish health care programs for their citizens.
 
Jan. 1, 1998: Deadline by which all states must have their plans approved and all Americans - except illegal aliens - would be guaranteed health coverage.
 
2001: Mental health and dental benefits would be expanded.
 
"How the Plan Has Changed"
In its broad outlines, President Clinton's health care plan remains unchanged from the version he unveiled in a speech to Congress on Sept. 22. But it is a plan of daunting complexity, and many details have been revised since then in an effortto reduce opposition.
 
SUMMARY
 
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE
 
Coverage for all Americans, regardless of medical or employment status.
 
A guaranteed package of benefits including free preventive care.
 
A choice of three kinds of health plans: traditional fee-for-service, Health Maintenance Organizations ad plans that combine the two. Medicaid recipients will receive the standard package.
 
REVISIONS
 
Expected date of universal coverage delayed by a year, to Jan. 1, 1988.
 
More generous coverage of mamograms and of dental care for children.
 
Extra services for children now in Medicaid.
 
Federal Trade Commission is given sweeping new powers to regulate insurerss.
 
All health plans, including H.M.O.'s, must offer patients the option to seek care from any physician, even if at additional cost.
 
HEALTH ALLIANCES
 
Insurance would be administered through pools, called health alliances, meant to concentrate the purchasing power of consumers.
 
Generally there will be one alliance for each state or region; in addition, companies with more than 5,000 employees will have the option of creating their own corporate alliances.
 
The alliances will negotiate with health providers and offer consumers a choice of plans, along with information on their cost and quality.
 
REVISIONS
 
Alliances cannot limit the number of fee-for-service plans; they may reject health plans only for failure to meet state standards of quality and care or if their budgets exceed the average of others in the area by 20 percent.
 
Reduces administrative obstacles for any state that wants to create a single-payer system.
 
COST OF COVERAGE
 
Businesses would pay at least 80 percent of the cost of premiums for the employees. Employees would pay the remainder, with the cost varying according to how expensive a plan they choose.
 
Out of pocket expenses would be higher for those choose not to join an H.M.O.
 
Cost to small businesses and to poor individuals would be subsidized. Caps would limit the cost for business, ranging from 3.5 percent for small companies to 7.9 percent for larger ones.
 
REVISIONS
 
The amount low-income workers would have to pay for premiums would be capped at 3.9 percent of income. And businesses with up to 75 workers would be eligible for subsidies. But an overall cap would be placed on the combined subsidies for both.
 
Companies that benefit from Government subsidies for premiums for early retirees will be asked to rebate some of the savings.
 
COST CONTROL
 
Insurance premiums would be limited, to bring increase in health costs in line with general inflation rate over five years.
 
A national health board would set national and regional budgets.
 
REVISIONS
 
National health board to be part of the executive branch, not independent.
 
Estimate of Federal savings reduced to $60 billion from $91 billion

HEADLINE: Dinkins Uplift, Giuliani Grit: 2 Advertising Schools Battle

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
David N. Dinkins opened his television advertising campaign with a "Heartbeat of America"-style commercial complete with rousing music. Rudolph W. Giuliani began with a grainy, low-key ad that looked as if it had absorbed its grittiness from the streets of New York.
Next, the Dinkins campaign broadcast advertisements extolling the Mayor's accomplishments in warm, lofty images. The Giuliani campaign came back with ads featuring ordinary people.
 
Clash Between Ad Styles
 Then Mr. Dinkins attacked with negative ads, accusing Mr. Giuliani of fighting against "everything we stand for." The Giuliani campaign countered with the candidate's wife charging the Mayor with race-baiting. 
 The back and forth may seem to be spontaneous -- the product of this particular mayoral race at this particular time -- but in an important sense it has little to do with the candidates involved, or even with the city they are seeking to lead. Rather, it is a clash between two different styles of political advertising: that favored by Mr. Dinkins's consultants, David Doak and Bob Shrum, and that favored by Mr. Giuliani's consultant, David Garth.
In campaign after campaign, Mr. Doak and Mr. Shrum, who work only for Democratic candidates, and Mr. Garth, who has worked for candidates of both parties, have refined their styles so that now it is possible to describe an ad -- as their competitors often do -- as "characteristic Doak and Shrum" or "typical David Garth."
The Doak and Shrum style is characterized on the one hand by lush, rhetorically rich positive ads and scathing negatives. Mr. Garth's ads are typified by a low-budget, "5 o'Clock News" look and by lots of written information. And in the New York City mayoral campaign, both groups of consultants have run campaigns that are as true to their own styles as they are to the candidates they represent.
Indeed, comparing the consultants' advertisements for the mayoral campaign with advertisements they did for other candidates, it is possible to find not only broad patterns, but also specific scenes and images repeated from one campaign to the next.
In 1990, for example, Mr. Doak and Mr. Shrum ran the re-election campaign for Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania. The opening campaign ad showed Governor Casey taking the oath of office, then leading a meeting at a conference table.
 
Improvisations on a Theme
 Similarly, the advertisement that began Mr. Dinkins's re-election campaign opened with the Mayor taking the oath of office, then leading a meeting at a conference table.
"He intervened to save Sharon Steel, brought in Ford Electronics and the new J & L structural plant," the narrator said in the Casey ad.
"He's balanced four budgets, cut waste and, in a recession, saved jobs by persuading companies like CBS and Prudential to stay in New York City," the narrator said in the Dinkins ad.
Like improvisations on a theme, sometimes a phrase from one campaign reappears in a slightly modified form in another. In 1987, for instance, Mr. Doak and Mr. Shrum ran the media campaign for Mayor Art Agnos of San Francisco. Mr. Agnos's mailings used the slogan "One City, One Future, One Message." This year, Mr. Dinkins's advertisements carry the tag line "One City, One Future."
Mr. Garth has borrowed even more heavily from his previous campaigns in his ads for Mr. Giuliani.
 
Like Specter, Like Giuliani
 Last year, for instance, Mr. Garth ran the re-election campaign for Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. A series of ads showed ordinary Pennsylvanians -- veterans, Navy yard workers and retirees -- talking about how the Senator had helped them out. As they spoke, various facts and statistics appeared on the screen. Most of Mr. Giuliani's ads have featured ordinary New Yorkers -- a baker, a restaurant worker, a mother -- bemoaning the sad state of the city while damning figures scroll across the screen.
When Mr. Specter was attacked on television by his opponent, Lynn H. Yeakel, his campaign answered with an ad in which Teresa Heinz, the widow of Senator John Heinz, chastised her for dirty campaigning. When Mr. Guiliani was attacked by the Mayor, his campaign responded with an ad featuring his wife, Donna Hanover Giuliani, chastising the Mayor for the same thing.
Stylistically, it would be hard to find two consulting firms that run more dissimilar campaigns than Doak, Shrum, Harris, Carrier, Devine, based in Washington, and the Garth Group, based in Manhattan.
Ads by Mr. Doak and Mr. Shrum typically have what are known in the business as high production values. They are shot on film, even though it is more expensive than video; this gives them a rich, warm look. And they are drenched in atmospherics -- music, reverberating voices, Kennedy-esque oratory.
 
Not Hesitant About Attacking
 "People like to be optimistic," Mr. Doak said about the style. "The stuff has to look good, especially when you're dealing with your candidate."
At the same time, Mr. Doak and Mr. Shrum are not at all hesitant about using negative ads, and have created several advertisements that stand out for their ferocity. These include one used against Ann Richards in the Texas gubernatorial primary that implied that she had used drugs while an elected official.
In contrast, Mr. Garth's ad campaigns invariably have a newsy feel. They are shot on videotape, which gives them a flat look. They always feature real people and lots of text on the screen. Mr. Garth refused to discuss his advertising style, but people who have worked with him say he feels that the writing gives viewers a sense that the ads have substance.
Mr. Garth, too, has produced some famous negative ads, including one for Ed Koch's gubernatorial campaign that asked viewers to name one thing Mario M. Cuomo had done as Lieutenant Governor while a clock ticked menacingly in the background. Some of his ads for Mr. Giuliani have been scathing as well, particularly one that attacked Mr. Dinkins for mishandling everything from his income taxes to the Crown Heights disturbances. But Mr. Garth is not known as a particularly effective negative campaigner, and he generally relies on more informational, statistics-crammed ads.
Among political consultants of both parties there seems to be a general sense that Mr. Doak and Mr. Shrum's style, combining stirring positive ads with threatening negative ones, has served the Mayor well. But several consultants questioned whether Mr. Garth's style is appropriate for Mr. Giuliani's political needs.
"Garth has expended a lot of capital getting you to like Rudy, and that hurt," said Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant. "It's not something Garth is good at." Some consultants suggested that Mr. Garth had made a mistake by using video, which has a cool, distant look, to try to make Mr. Guiliani seem warm. His latest ad features Mr. Giuliani's mother, Helen, praising her son.

Casey of Pennsylvania, both opening with the candidates taking the the oath of office. Similarities also appear in advertisements made for Rudolph W. Giuliani by David Garth, who used ordinary people and text to deliver messages on the issues. (pg. B8)

Utility Bonds Hit by Rating Threat

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Utility bonds took a beating yesterday after the Standard & Poor's Corporation announced that several companies were facing a credit rating downgrading and that the outlook for a third of the industry was being switched from stable to negative.
The announcement by S.& P. threatened to push the bonds of some electric companies from investment grade status into noninvestment grade, or junk bond, status. And the selling was especially focused on companies that are already at the bottom of the investment grade rankings. 
 Many money managers cannot hold old bonds that are below investment grade, so a lot of the selling was done to get rid of the bonds before a possible rating downgrade, said Geoffery Kurinsky, a senior vice president at Massachusetts Financial Services, a money manager in Boston. He said some of the companies, like the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, were already priced as if they had been lowered to junk bond status.
 
 
Long Island Lighting
 The bonds of the Long Island Lighting Company have been falling for several weeks, but they dropped even further yesterday. The Long Island utility was in the group that had its outlook changed from stable to negative and has a triple B rating, just a notch above the bottom of the investment grade category.
For example, the price of Lilco's 7.125 percent bond due June 1, 2005, was off by about three-quarters of a point. The spread between the yield on the Lilco bond and that of comparable Treasury securities, a closely watched measure of performance, widened to about 130 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from about 105 basis points several weeks ago and about 120 basis points on Tuesday, Mr. Kurinsky said.
The bonds of Cleveland Electric dropped even more sharply, with the price of the 9 percent bond due in July 2023 off about three full points. The spread between the yield on the Cleveland Electric bond and the comparable Treasury bond jumped about 30 to 220 basis points. The Cleveland Electric bond has a triple B-minus rating, which is the bottom of the investment grade category; the company was one of those put on credit watch with the probability that it will be downgraded after further review.
Curtis Moulton, an S.& P. industry analyst who did the study, said, "We see the business risk for the industry increasing, and because of that the rating outlook for a lot of companies has changed."
He said the main reason for the change in the outlook was growing competitive pressures. But the companies also face slow earnings growth, environmental cost pressures and the costs of operating or decommissioning nuclear plants.
 
 
Treasury Market
 Treasury prices fell yesterday as traders and investors awaited today's release of the first report on the pace of economic growth in the third quarter.
The Commerce Department's data on the gross domestic product in the three months ended Sept. 30 will begin to answer questions about how much faster the economy is growing in the second half of the year after an anemic pace of 1.3 percent for the first six months.
The recent selloff in the market, which has pushed the yield on the 30-year bond back to 6 percent, is a reflection of fears that the economy will be strong enough to put upward pressure on consumer prices. Rising inflation is the nemesis of the bond market because it erodes the fixed rates of return from bonds and notes.
 The average forecast for the G.D.P., according to Market News Service, is 2.8 percent. Most economists seem to agree that consumer spending will be in the 4 percent range. The disputes that make the range of forecasts run from around 2 percent to 3.5 percent are over exports, inventories, Government spending and capital spending.
But even as this number is released, the focus will shift to the status of the economy in the current fourth quarter, where economists generally feel that automobile production and sales are helping push up growth a little more, to an annual rate of around 4 percent, or even higher. The strong 10-day automobile sales reported earlier this week have reinforced that view.
In trading yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond was down 8/32 of a point as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6 percent from 5.98 percent Tuesday.
The Commerce Department report that orders for durable goods, like cars, appliances, computers, airplanes and military equipment, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in September, contributed to some of the selling. The increase was more than the average forecast of two-tenths of 1 percent expected on Wall Street.
 
 
Military Spending
 Excluding military industry and commercial aircraft orders, everything else was up. But excluding these two categories can present a skewed picture of the economy. The Government cutback in military spending is one of the major drags on the economy right now. And the aircraft industry is one of the country's major export industries.
The market seemed to overlook the fact that the backlog of unfilled durable-goods orders continued to decline, falling 1 percent. Most economists say there will not be sustainable gains in manufacturing until that backlog begins to grow, so the decline could indicate that the pace of growth cannot pick up that much in the near future.
Although the Treasury auction of $11 billion of five-year notes went well, it did not give the market a boost. The high yield in the single-price auction was 4.81 percent, down from the 4.83 percent last month. But in late trading in the when-issued market, the yield had popped up to 4.84 percent, reflecting the souring of sentiment in the late afternoon.
Following are the results of the five-year Treasury note auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 4.81%
Low Price . . . 99.736
Low Yield . . . 4.74%

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 7.83 Points, Closing at 3,664.66

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
The economic news was encouraging yesterday, but investors apparently needed a little more convincing. They sent confused signals in a fragmented stock market, bidding up small companies while shunning some industrial powerhouses that might be expected to profit from a spurt in the recovery.
Despite the Government's announcement that September durable- goods orders rose, blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average gave up more of the gains of Monday, when the index hit a new high. Other indexes were only slightly stronger, though the Nasdaq composite rose sharply, lifted by technology issues. 
 Traders said investors seemed hesitant because quarterly earnings reports were generally mixed and because they were awaiting the Government's announcement today of third-quarter data on the gross domestic product, which should shed more light on the direction of the economy.
The blue-chip issues also seemed to be hit by profit taking and a rise in interest rates in the bond market, which tends to cause investors to move funds from stocks to fixed-income securities.
 
Nasdaq Jumps 6.42 Points
 The Nasdaq composite index, which had been sluggish recently after reaching new records earlier in the month, jumped 6.42 points to 771.88. It was led by Apple Computer, up 2, to 31 3/4, Intel, up 3/4, to 64 1/2, Dell Computer, up 7/8, to 20 3/8, and Newbridge Networks, up 1 7/8, to 62 1/2.
These issues often perform well in the fourth quarter, when technology companies typically have their strongest sales. "These stocks are going to be a major driver for Nasdaq," said Claudia Mott, director of small capitalization research at Prudential Securities.
On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow industrial average fell 7.83 points to 3,664.66. Among slipping Dow components were stocks whose earnings are sensitive to the economy, like Allied Signal, down 1 7/8, to 70 7/8, Alcoa, off 1 1/8, to 68 1/2, and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, which fell 1 5/8, to 103 1/2, after announcing slightly lower quarterly income.
The Dow Jones transportation average, which reached a new high on Tuesday, again hit a record, increasing 1.50 points to 1,698.65. The Standard & Poor's Index of 500 stocks rose 0.31 point to 464.61. And the American Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.42 points to 475.06.
Big Board volume was 279.8 million shares, down from 284.5 million shares on Tuesday. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners, 1,031 to 971.
Ford Motor was the second-most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, rising 5/8, to 60 3/8, after the company reported sharply higher quarterly earnings. General Motors increased 1 1/2, to 46 7/8. Paramount Communications, the target of a takeover battle, was up 2, to 81.
UST dropped 3 3/8, to 24 3/4. Anheuser-Busch fell 1/2, to 47 5/8, after reporting a quarterly loss. Du Pont, which also announced a loss, declined 1/2 to 46 1/2. Timberland shot up 7, to 77, after announcing strong earnings.

ICN Pharmaceuticals offers a double bet for investors.

BYLINE: By Joshua Mills

 BODY:
INVESTING in ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., currently the object of a proxy struggle between its incumbent management and Rafi M. Khan, a California stockbroker, is sort of like betting the daily double at the local race track. As where horses (or dogs) are concerned, the gamble does not pay off unless the bettor correctly picks the winners of two consecutive races.
In the first half of this particular double, investors are being asked to bet that bullets and bombs will give way to partnership and that United Nations sanctions will turn into trade alliances. The second half is a bet that the Food and Drug Administration will approve ICN's antiviral drug, ribavirin, as a treatment for hepatitis C. 
 A number of commentators, like Joseph Morgan, M.D., publisher of Dr. Morgan's Medical Stock Commentary, conclude that ICN is a risky but potentially rewarding bet. Dr. Morgan suggests that ICN is well positioned to take advantage of eventual economic revival in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics and that ribavirin is well on its way to approval. ICN shares closed yesterday at $11.125, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
ICN, based in Costa Mesa, Calif., was founded and is led by Milan Panic, a Serbian emigre and the former Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, and last year it did more than 59 percent of its business in Yugoslavia -- whose business climate these days is not even as hospitable as Antarctica's.
The local problems are devastating to business operations. The Yugoslav dinar was devalued five times last year, making supplies much more expensive; the currency problems cost ICN's Yugoslav operations about $48 million. Inflation, which in February reached an annual rate of 26,000 percent, is now about 100,000 percent, said Keith Crane, an economist with Planecon, a research and consulting firm in Washington that specializes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics.
Price controls on drugs were imposed last year, which "inhibited ICN Galenika's prior practice of increasing prices to keep up with inflation," ICN noted in its annual report. ICN has a 43 percent stake in SPI Pharmaceuticals, which in turn owns 75 percent of ICN Galenika, a Yugoslav pharmaceutical manufacturer.
The sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro, exempt certain medical supplies that ICN Galenika makes. But gaining the exemptions requires licenses from the United Nations for each transaction, and the administrative burden has hurt ICN, which purchases many raw materials for its drug manufacturing outside Yugoslavia.
As ICN noted in its annual report, "While the impact of sanctions, price controls and devaluations on future sales and net income cannot be determined with certainty, they may, under the present political and economic environment, result in an adverse impact in the future."
Mr. Crane of Planecon said there was "no cause for optimism about the region's economy." Even if a peace is reached, he suggested, "the United States and Western Europe are not going to be quick to repeal the embargo because of revulsion with the Serbian Government."
And if the political bet is not too long a shot, what about the other half of the double -- the F.D.A. approval of ribavirin? The drug "is having a new day in the sun," an ICN spokesman, Jack Sholl, said yesterday, describing its "late-stage development for approval as a hepatitis C treatment," an endorsement by the American Academy of Pediatrics as a treatment for infant respiratory diseases and its presence in 44 countries for use in treating a total of eight diseases.
 The F.D.A. review process often lasts several years. Drugs that do well in early stages, when tests are conducted on first a dozen, then perhaps a hundred people, often falter in the home stretch, during what the F.D.A. calls Phase 3 -- which involves perhaps a thousand people at dozens of sites. The roadside to F.D.A. approval is littered with the debris of drug makers whose stocks boomed on optimism in the early stages of the approval process, only to break down and crash -- like the Cetus Corporation, whose Interleukin-2 was not approved by the F.D.A.

HEADLINE: Catholic Bishops Proposing Active U.S. Policy Abroad

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
The nation's Roman Catholic bishops have drafted a statement calling for a more active American role on the world stage, including supporting the United Nations, expanding foreign aid and, when necessary, using military force for interventions intended to rescue people from hunger or mass violence.
Now in draft form, the statement is meant to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the bishops' 1983 pastoral letter on nuclear arms, which stirred intense public debate because it ran counter to the Reagan Administration's emphasis on a build-up of nuclear weapons. 
 The new document, which will be submitted for amendments and a vote at the bishops' meeting Nov. 15-18 in Washington, also appears to challenge what the bishops say is an radically altered political climate.
"After the cold war, there has emerged an understandable but dangerous temptation to turn inward, to focus only on domestic needs and to ignore global responsibilities," the statement reads. "This is not an option for believers in a universal church or for citizens in the world's most powerful nation."
 
No Movement, but a Reflex
 Archbishop John R. Roach of St. Paul and Minneapolis, who heads the bishops' committee on international policy and helped draft the document, said that the bishops did not see the growth of an isolationist ideology like the one in the United States before World War II, but rather "an involuntary reflex" that risked "withdrawing more and more from any involvement overseas."
The bishops sensed this drift, he said, in public anxiety over American actions in Somalia and Bosnia as well as in the public's "enormous preoccupation, and a legitimate one, with what's going on at home, whether health care reform or the economy."
Unlike the 1983 document, the present statement is not meant to be a full-scale pastoral letter, which usually sets forth authoritative church teaching. By contrast, the drafters called this statement "a set of more modest reflections" that do not "provide definitive answers to the key policy questions of this moment."
 
Some Broad Principles
 Nonetheless, the statement proposes priorities for American policy makers, and it offers guiding moral principles for complex issues like the use of economic sanctions, the rights of nationalities to self-determination and military interventions.
This statement is not likely to curtail the wide range of opinion on international issues among Catholics, both in the pews and in the pulpits. But it can become a widely known base line for discussions within and outside the church.
Looking back at the 1983 letter, for instance, the bishops wrote that it "led to spirited debate and constructive dialogue in our dioceses and parishes, and has been widely used in schools, colleges and universities, the armed forces and research institutes."
The new document clearly reflects the bishops' wrestling with moral issues posed by the war in the Persian Gulf, the break-up of Yugoslavia, the intervention in Somalia and the stalemate in Haiti.
The bishops voice special distress, for example, at the wave of conflicts rooted in nationalistic rivalries, especially when these are reinforced by religious differences. "Every child murdered, every town 'cleansed,' every hatred uttered in the name of religion is a crime against God," they write.
But they warn against responding to conflicts with a religious dimension by stripping religious forces of their social roles or "even by repressing so-called fundamentalist movements, especially in the Islamic world." Such efforts are apt to backfire, distracting attention from political, economic and ideological factors in the conflicts, the bishops say.
Demands for self-determination by ethnic or religious groups often reflect valid concerns, the statement says, but these can frequently be met by guarantees of minority rights and other measures short of establishing independent states.
The statement agonizes over the use of economic sanctions, which the bishops supported against Iraq, Serbia, Haiti and South Africa, but which they recognize often work the greater hardships on innocent people rather than on the politically powerful.
Sanctions, they conclude, remain "an effective alternative to war" but also a "blunt instrument" to "be used sparingly and with restraint."
Referring to the situations in Haiti, Bosnia, Liberia, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan, the bishops take up the debate about intervention by foreign governments or international organizations in the internal affairs of states. "The principles of sovereignty and nonintervention may be overridden only in exceptional circumstances, notably in the cases of genocide or when whole populations are threatened by aggression or anarchy," the bishops say.
While nonmilitary forms of intervention should take priority, "military intervention may sometimes be justified to insure that starving children can be fed or that whole populations will not be slaughtered," the bishops say.
But they emphasize that intervention should be limited to "clearly defined humanitarian objectives," should be "multilateral, under the auspices of the United Nations," when possible, and should remain part of broader efforts to strengthen international law and institutions.
 
Support for Foreign Aid
 Strengthening international institutions, especially the United Nations, is a major theme. "Perhaps no challenge is more urgent or more complex than that of improving the United Nations' ability to reduce conflict in the world," the bishops write, adding that "at a minimum, the United States must pay in full its U.N. assessments."
The statement also stresses the moral obligation of returning attention to issues of economic development and the plight of poor nations. The bishops are critical of the reduction of assistance for economic development in American foreign aid and say that in contrast to other industrialized nations, "we continue to rank near the bottom in terms of the share of our economy devoted to development assistance."
The committee that drafted the statement included influential church leaders like Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago and Roger Cardinal Mahony of Los Angeles as well as Archbishop Roach and Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, both former presidents of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
Before drafting the statement, the committee held session not only with other church leaders but also with foreign policy leaders like General Colin L. Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Alvaro de Soto, the senior political adviser to United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
The 1983 pastoral letter affirmed the validity of both the early Christian emphasis on nonviolence and the later, dominant teaching that under certain stringent conditions warfare can sometimes be morally justified.
That letter said the two traditions complemented and corrected one another, but it did not resolve the tension between them. The same tension runs through the current statement, with the bishops acknowledging the power of nonviolent resistance in bringing down Communist regimes but also endorsing the right of political authorities "as a last resort to employ limited force to rescue the innocent and establish justice."

HEADLINE: Regional Configuration Gets Pro Football Team

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 27

 BODY:
The Carolina Panthers will do, but if the owners of the National Football League's newest franchise really want to get the name right, they might try something more descriptive, like the Carolina Post-Urban Regional Configuration.
To be sure, urban policy was not exactly Topic A today in this town. From the exultant "TOUCHDOWN!" across the top of The Charlotte Observer, to James Laughlin's hawking cassettes of his "Carolina Rally Song," to the hand-scrawled "Carolina Panthers -- A Reality" triumphantly tacked to Uptown Donnie's hot dog stand, the only subject was the N.F.L.'s anointing of Charlotte on Tuesday as the home of the league's 29th franchise. 
 In a town with a particularly pronounced strain of the South's veneration of go-go hustle and self-promotion, the euphoria was no surprise. But with sports as much dollars and demographics as muscle and mud, Charlotte's victory over better known cities like Baltimore and St. Louis is a revealing window onto a nation whose center of gravity is moving South and whose old notions of what a city is are often as out of date as a leather helmet.
 
On the Map, but Where?
 Still sometimes confused with Charleston to the south or Charlottesville to the north, Charlotte may still be a place few people can place on a map. The new football franchise is a reminder of how different the cities that now snare professional teams can be from the older cities that used to get them.
And with its conspicuous economic success in recent years, its flood of newcomers, its sprawling market area of medium-sized cities running from Durham, N.C., to Columbia, S.C., Charlotte is a city in the new mold.
"When Charlotte talks about being part of a market with 10 million people within 150 square miles, it's not really a statistical sleight of hand or a rhetorical flourish," said David Goldfield, an urban historian at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "It's really a historical truth. Other cities increasingly are marketing themselves as regional entities, but for us there's a particular historical truth to it."
From the stores hawking merchandise for a team so far without players or stadium, the live television coverage of the return of the Carolina delegation that courted the N.F.L. owners in Chicago and the celebrations downtown, one might think the millennium had arrived, not football. But then, the possibility of seeing huge men pound on each other each Sunday sometimes seemed the least of the excitement.
 
'To the First Tier'
 "This is probably as big an event as there's been in our history in terms of just elevating us to the first tier of American cities," Mayor Richard Vinroot exulted after Charlotte was picked over four rivals.
"If you saw the National Basketball Association playoffs, you had Larry Johnson with 'Charlotte' across his big chest, standing there on national TV on Sunday afternoon, next to Patrick Ewing with 'New York' on his chest. Everybody knows New York, of course, and all of a sudden, there's Charlotte."
Charlotte has not exactly come from nowhere. The city was incorporated in 1768 and named for Queen Charlotte, the wife of King George 3d of England. It grew first with gold, then with cotton, then with textiles, toiling in Atlanta's shadow for most of this century.
But with a booming economy based on banking and a diversified service and manufacturing base, Charlotte has blossomed in the past two decades to become the nation's third-leading banking center. The city grew by 25.5 percent from 1980 to 1990, to 396,000 people. Its metropolitan area grew by almost 20 percent, to 1.1 million.
 
Numbers Aren't Everything
 Still, neither figure makes Charlotte a powerhouse. It is now the 34th-largest metropolitan area, between Buffalo-Niagara Falls and Providence-Pawtucket, and the 35th-largest city, between St. Louis and Atlanta.
What persuaded the N.F.L. was a marketing area that includes most of the Carolinas. Marketing studies developed by Rand McNally and used to promote Charlotte indicate that, using a basic trading area that includes surrounding counties, Charlotte ranks 28th nationally. Using an expanded unit definition that takes in 134 counties, Charlotte ranked sixth in size. And, in fact, the euphoria about the football franchise spread throughout the Carolinas.
"We are ecstatic," said Dick Blouse, executive director of the Greenville Chamber of Commerce in South Carolina. "We don't view this as a Charlotte team, but a regional team."
In Clemson, S.C., where the team will play its first year at Clemson University's "Death Valley," interest in the team is already so high that customers lined up at the Mr. Knickerbocker sporting goods store this morning to buy Panthers' paraphernalia. The store manager, David Spearman, said he had to turn them away because his shipment had not arrived.
"It's like living through an earthquake this morning," he said.
Much of the distinctive nature of the Carolinas is a product of history, specifically a textile industry that created a host of medium-sized cities through the Carolinas rather than one urban center with Charlotte at the central distribution point.
"Charlotte has always conceived itself as being the economic capital of the two Carolinas," said Dan Morrill, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "This is nothing new."
What is new is the degree to which population and job growth are coming to cities like Charlotte and other medium-sized cities, particularly those in the South like Nashville; Tampa and Orlando in Florida or Greenville-Spartanburg in South Carolina. In the 1990 census, of the 20 fastest-growing metropolitan areas with more than a million people, 19 were in the South and West.
There were a few dissenters here today. "I would hate to say that whether a city has a damn football team has anything to do with whether it's a world-class city," said Bob Raiford, a local radio commentator who terms himself a curmudgeon at large.
Football aside, Charlotte has problems, like a soaring crime rate, not much different from those in bigger cities. And even some admirers of Charlotte say that, football or no, it is bigger on squeaky-clean enthusiasm and leafy neighborhoods than urban excitement. "Some people say New York is a city that never sleeps," said Professor Goldfield. "Charlotte may be a city that never wakes. But it's a nice place to live."
But snaring the N.F.L. franchise with an innovative plan for private construction of a stadium, on top of the success of the N.B.A.'s Hornets, has most people here soaring.
"When we first set out to seek the N.B.A., people sort of laughed at us," said Mr. Vinroot. "One pundit said, 'The only franchise you'll get is a new McDonald's.' Well, we proved them wrong. Now, there is, I think, a feeling of self-confidence that's almost scary."

HEADLINE: Chretien Says He Wants Changes in Trade Accord

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Fresh from the stunning triumph of his Liberal party in Canada's general elections, Prime Minister-designate Jean Chretien said today that he wants changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement and may not implement the pact without them.
Although he insisted at a news conference in Ottawa that Canada did not want to intervene in the debate over trade legislation in the United States, his comments complicated the task of passage and appeared to put him into conflict with President Clinton. 
 Mr. Clinton told reporters in Washington on Tuesday that he saw "no reason to renegotiate the agreement." President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico also opposes renegotiation.
Over 15 years, Nafta is intended to create a single $7 trillion-a-year market covering 360 million consumers in Canada, the United States and Mexico.
Mr. Chretien's remarks created consternation in Washington, with officials saying some members of Congress would refuse to vote for the agreement if there were a possibility it might be changed later. "We get the sense that many Congressmen will use Chretien's comments as an excuse" to oppose the pact, one official said.
But Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who favors the pact and is a chief deputy majority whip, said Mr. Chretien's position "has not affected our vote count -- that's the truth."
He added that if Mr. Chretien revived talks on the pact before Congress votes in mid-November, "that will hurt us." Noting that Mr. Chretien had said he would not take any action until he had appointed his Cabinet, Mr. Richardson said, "My hope is he will wait in appointing his ministers."
Still uncertain is whether Canadian demands can be dealt with as side issues or whether they will lead to counterdemands in Mexico and the United States that would reopen the entire agreement.
Elaborating on the Liberal position for the first time, Mr. Chretien said he would press for changes to protect Canadian energy reserves and to define rules on unfair subsidies and unfairly low prices for exports.
Canadians have asked for such definitions because, they say, American charges that Canada unfairly subsidizes exports of steel, pork, lumber and other products are arbitrary.
Washington has demands of its own, including abandonment of provisions in the four-year-old Canada-United States trade accord that protect Canadian books, films and other cultural industries from full competition.
Mr. Chretien made his comments in response to reporters' questions; they were not part of a formal declaration by the new Government, which will not be installed for 9 or 10 days.
Mr. Chretien and Mr. Clinton, who spoke by telephone on Tuesday, have scheduled a meeting to discuss the problem on Nov. 19 in Seattle, during an Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference.
Although the Liberal Party platform had called for renegotiation, there has always been a question how hard the case would be pressed once the party was in power.
Liberals had fought free trade in the 1988 elections and are divided over Nafta today. The left wing wants to scrap the deal. Moderates fear that if it does not go forward, Canada will find itself isolated and economically impaired. Mr. Chretien is in the camp of the moderates, but he is anxious to prevent any ruptures within the party.
He also emphasized today: "I will do my best to have very good relations with the United States and Mexico."
The Canadian legislation to put Nafta into force was passed by Parliament under the Progressive Conservative Government, which was soundly beaten at the polls Monday. But Mr. Chretien said it would not become law until he proclaimed it.
Mr. Chretien said his first task as Canada's 20th Prime Minister would be to create jobs -- as was also promised in the Liberal platform. "My first priority will be definitely to work on the economy," he said. "That is the reason why we won the election."
He is expected to announce shortly a $6 billion public-works program to create up to 120,000 jobs over two years.

HEADLINE: U.S. MAY TIGHTEN EMBARGO ON HAITI

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 --
With efforts to restore Haiti's elected President stymied, President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers met today to consider a complete economic embargo against the poor Caribbean nation.
But they took no action, and it was not clear when they would meet again. 
 Administration officials said the advisers were considering a French proposal for a worldwide economic embargo on Haiti. The proposal is being circulated among members of the UNited Nations Security Council.
 
Deadline Played Down
 Under an agreement negotiated in July, Haiti's military government is required to cede power to the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the President ousted in a 1991 coup, by Saturday. But President Clinton's advisers played down the importance of the deadline, and they did not say when stiffer sanctions might go into effect.
"We are not pressing for additional sanctions at this time," the United States representative to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, said in New York.
A United Nations embargo enforced by a flotilla of American, Canadian and French warships, was imposed against Haiti on Oct. 16 and went into effect just before midnight on Oct. 18. But that only covers oil products and weapons.
The French proposal calls for a blockade against Haiti that would prevent virtually all commerce from flowing into and out of what is already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
 
Assets of Military Frozen
 Earlier this month, in an effort to go beyond the oil and weapons embargo, the Clinton Administration unilaterally froze the assets of Haitian military leaders and their supporters. But the meeting today appeared to be the first in which the Administration formally considered a complete embargo.
The Administration received a copy of the French proposal this morning, one Presidential foreign policy adviser said. "What it does is to point in the direction of increasing the bite of sanctions, and that's a good thing."
The draft resolution would permit imports of goods deemed necessary for basic humanitarian needs and would allow the Government of the exiled President, Father Aristide, to request exemptions on a case-by-case basis. Otherwise, all commerce between Haiti and the outside world would be banned.
Among the factors Administration officials say among they are weighing in considering whether to push for new sanctions is whether they will be able to get a consensus among Security Council members. They would also have to weigh the position of Father Aristide on a wide-ranging embargo. The exiled President is scheduled to addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday.
Clinton Administration officials said they hoped that the reimposition of the limited embargo will force Haiti's military and police rulers to step aside as required by an agreement signed at Governors Island in New York in July and allow the return of Father Aristide, who was deposed in a military coup two years ago.
 
Aristide Seeks More Pressure
 Father Aristide and his supporters have been calling for stepped-up economic pressure on the military leaders and their supporters since it became clear in recent weeks that the leader of Haiti's armed forces, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, would not step down as scheduled on Oct. 15.
But even some who say they back Father Aristide's return say they worry that such a draconian economic measures would further impoverish an already desperately poor country.
"We may succeed in making Haiti more democratic, but we are also risking the spread of contagious diseases, deforestation and total economic collapse," said Rep. Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who is chairman of a subcommitee on Western Hemisphere Affairs.
Administration officials said the discussions of tighter sanctions were in the "preliminary stage," and that the draft text of a new United Nation resolution on sanctions was being circulated among members of the Security Council.
Already there are signs that the limited embargo is increasing hardships in Haiti. Officials from CARE, one of the largest relief agencies operating in the country, said that they would have to cut back their activities in the next 48 hours because of a shortage of fuel to deliver food into the countryside.
"Fuel supplies are becoming rapidly depleted, which means we're going to have to curtail operations," said Hope Rosenberg, a communications officer for CARE in New York. "We're feeding 600,000a day, roughly 10 per cent of the population. So if if we have to curtail that, a lot of people will suffer."
As the Administration moved to turn up pressure on Haiti's military and police rulers, Secretary of State Warren Christopher renewed calls today for Father Aristide to broaden his government to include more political parties.
Speaking to reporters during a stop in Riga, Latvia, Mr. Christopher said that the Administration accepted the idea that additional people could be recruited to serve in Father Aristide's Government.
"It's important to assure the return of President Aristide will achieve harmony and tranquility," Mr. Christopher said.

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN TRAIL;
Giuliani Says He'd Fill Posts on Basis of Merit

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday accused Mayor David N. Dinkins of making appointments based primarily on race and ethnicity, and said that as mayor, he would make all appointments based on merit, "irrespective of race, religion, ethnic background and sexual orientation."
At a news conference at his headquarters at 415 Madison Avenue, near 50th Street, he suggested that the Mayor was preoccupied with diversity and had made decisions at the expense of general competence. 
 "Right now in the city administration it appears as if the principal reason why people are selected is symbolic," Mr. Giuliani said. "The principal reason is to create a representative government, rather than to select the most talented person. Many people have observed, not just this candidate -- even newspapers that endorsed David Dinkins -- that the quality of the people around David Dinkins is not what it should be."
Though Mr. Giuliani has spoken at other occasions recently of the need for the "empowerment" of various minority groups, he said yesterday that he would seek the most qualified people, while also reaching out to New York's many communities..
Leah Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Dinkins campaign, said of Mr. Giuliani's comments: "It is sad and surprising that a person running for mayor of New York City is going to put down or deride a commitment to diversity and excellence. That is in keeping with his belief that the police force should not reside in New York City and be more representative of the people that it protects, and it goes along with his desire to dismantle the 20 percent target program for minority and women's business enterprises that the Mayor had sought to create."
At his news conference, Mr. Giuliani welcomed the endorsement of Andrew S. Fisher, a Democrat who was legal adviser to Mayor Abraham D. Beame. Mr. Fisher is chairman of the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation and headed the Brooklyn Bar Association in 1989. But his record was blemished in 1990, when he pleaded guilty to failing to pay state income taxes in 1986 and 1987.
 
Opening Schools at Night
 Speaking at Alexander Berger Junior High School in the Bronx, Mr. Dinkins announced yesterday a plan to open at least half of the city's schools at night in an eight-month trial program to expand the number of schools available for community groups and youth programs.
Mr. Dinkins was joined by Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore. "I am here because I deeply believe in Mayor Dinkins and the direction in which he is taking your city," Mrs. Gore said.
Many of Mr. Dinkins's proposals, like increasing police officers deployed in the public schools, have been unveiled in earlier speeches. Yesterday he said there would be no fee for using the schools in the evening as long as the group is committed to community service.
Richard L. Murphy, the city's Commissioner of Youth Services, said the cost of the trial program in about 500 schools would be between $2 million and $3 million. But he said savings within the budget can cover the cost.
The Mayor also received an endorsement yesterday from James Brady, former press secretary for President Ronald Reagan. Speaking at John Jay College, Mr. Brady, who was injured in an assassination attempt on President Reagan, praised Mr. Dinkins as a "strong consistent voice for gun control."
 
And the Bills Go On
 Win or lose, Mayor Dinkins's campaign will have some sizable bills to pay after Nov. 2. But so will Mr. Dinkins himself.
The Mayor has still not paid the lawyer who represented him during 1990 city and Federal investigations into a stock transaction that came to light during the 1989 mayoral race. Aides to Mr. Dinkins said the bill was for about $200,000.
Harold Ickes, Mr. Dinkins's campaign counsel, said the Mayor intends to repay the bill "in a reasonable time after the election." The unpaid bill was reported yesterday in New York Newsday.
"He really hasn't focused on it because he's been raising money for this campaign," Mr. Ickes said. He said the legal fees were Mr. Dinkins's personal expense and would not be paid by his campaign.
Charles A. Stillman, the lawyer who represented Mr. Dinkins, said he completed his services to the Mayor by 1992 but did not send a final bill to him until earlier this year.
Asked why his office waited a year to send the bill, Mr. Stillman said: "This is not some major New York law firm with a business manager and office manager. We're just not focused on those things as much as others were. There was no calculated reason for it. That's just when it got sent out."
Mr. Stillman said his Manhattan-based firm, Stillman, Friedman & Shaw, does no work for the city and was not showing favoritism to the Mayor in its billing practices.
"Accommodations for individuals stuck with substantial legal fees are not unusual," he said. "I've treated David Dinkins absolutely the same as all other clients."
 
A Statistical Tie
 A poll released yesterday by The New York Post and WNYW-TV showed that the mayoral race remains too close to call, with no sign of significant change in the numbers.
The survey of 400 registered voters showed Mayor Dinkins leading with 46 percent over his Republican-Liberal challenger, Mr. Giuliani, who had the support of 40 percent of the respondents. The Mayor's slight lead, reflected in other recent polls, was within the survey's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points, making the race essentially a statistical tie.
The poll indicated a tightening of the race for comptroller between Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi, the Democratic candidate, and Herman Badillo, the Republican-Liberal nominee. Mr. Hevesi, who had held a wide lead over Mr. Badillo, had the support of 42 percent in the poll, compared with 35 percent for Mr. Badillo. Nineteen percent of the voters polled said they were undecided.
A poll released on Tuesday by New York Newsday/WABC-TV showed the candidates for comptroller tied at 40 percent each. But a New York Times/WCBS-TV poll released the same day showed Mr. Hevesi leading 43 percent to 30 percent.
 
A 'Reverse Freedom Ride'
 More than three decades after freedom riders rolled into the South to promote integration and voting rights, a new generation of freedom riders is on the road. They still pack into buses but have reversed their course. Yesterday they arrived in New York City from places like Alabama and Mississippi.
Their mission is to get people in poor neighborhoods to vote on Tuesday. "It's a reverse freedom ride," said Crystal Poole of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the drive's sponsor.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: Financing the Plan;
The Difference 6 Weeks Make: Revisions in Costs

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The biggest differences between the health care plan President Clinton invited Congress to ponder six weeks ago and the bill he offered today are financial, reflecting an effort to avoid a repetition of the huge cost increases that have characterized Medicare since its was enacted in 1965.
The changes were meant to reassure likely supporters of the bill who were suspicious of the plan's financial underpinnings, and they brought one quick and important change of tune. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee and who called the first version of the proposal "fantasy," said today, "I'm much more satisfied." 
 The three main changes are to assume that inflation will rise 3.5 percent annually through the year 2000, instead of the previously assumed 2.7 percent; to increase an allowance for unexpected subsidy costs from $30 billion to $45 billion, and, most of all, to define the program as a "capped entitlement."
That definition means Congress would have to take a vote on what to do if costs outran estimates. With Medicare and Social Security, by contrast, the Government pays cost overruns automatically.
Leon E. Panetta, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said that he personally believed that the new steps were needed and that he had pushed for them. Health care estimates, no matter how carefully drawn, are hardly certain forecasts, he said, adding, "We've just seen too many unpredictable results in health care."
 
Fears About Ceiling
 The changes announced today, like many others, were a consequence of the unusual consultative approach the Administration took in laying a rough draft of the plan before Congress and inviting criticism. Many of the critics wanted to be allies, and nothing bothered them more than the comparison with Medicare, the health care plan for the elderly. Its costs exploded because of unanticipated increases in health care prices and because elderly people went to their doctors more often than anyone expected.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said today that he had asked for a study of just how Medicare cost estimates had gone wrong over the years.
"All of us are concerned about making sure that we're not doing something that looks good, that is good, but wrecks all of our grandchildren," Mr. Hoyer said of the health care bill.
In its first year, the Medicare program cost $6.5 billion; by 1992 it had soared to $132 billion.
But the effort to reassure some lawmakers unsettled others. Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who leads the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health, for example, said he feared that the spending cap presented a possibility that there would not be enough money for discounted insurance for the poor or for subsidies to help small businesses buy health insurance. At the same time, he said, there was no limit on the benefits that corporations would get when the Government assumed their responsibilities for health care for early retirees.
The Administration was wary of this political problem, too. Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman said at a White House briefing, "It is most unlikely that ceiling will be reached," an argument other officials were making to any Democrat who would listen.
In emphasizing the Administration's conservative approach, Ken Thorpe, a deputy assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, told reporters on Capitol Hill that whenever the Administration was confronted with differing estimates for what health-care premiums would be, it routinely selected the higher set of estimates.
President Clinton himself stressed the same theme of fiscal caution. He told Senators and Representatives assembled in Statuary Hall at the Capitol: "We have tried to be as conservative as we could here in making sure that we have not over-claimed for cost savings or overestimated how small the cost of things will be. Therefore, I think we have in our plan put more money in than it will cost to implement this plan. But better to be wrong on that side than the other side."
Those words were welcome, but most lawmakers said they wanted time to study the proposed legislation in detail.
Even Mr. Moynihan's commitment was not absolute. After receiving his own briefing Tuesday from Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, the Senator said: "The Administration says their numbers are the best we can do just now. We know they are subject to change. We know there are vast uncertainties."
Mr. Panetta agreed, saying that the Administration would keep its cost estimates up to date as it got more information. But he said that in health care, "We do not have the kind of accurate fix" available in other areas of the economy.
Other Administration officials, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified by name, said that when the program was fully phased in, it would increase health care spending by $60 billion to $65 billion, not counting the savings that would be achieved through the program. This increased spending would result from the greater demand for services that comes from providing coverage to people who are now uninsured or underinsured.

HEADLINE: Cablevision To Purchase TV Systems

 BODY:
Cablevision Systems Corporation, which is considered a prime target in the takeover wave sweeping the communications industry, turned the tables on speculators yesterday and announced that it would buy an additional three cable television systems for $463 million.
By acquiring the three systems from Sutton Capital Associates Inc., Cablevision will pick up an additional 176,000 subscribers in areas adjacent to the systems it already operates. 
 The company, based in Woodbury, L.I., currently has 2.1 milion subscribers and is the fourth-largest cable operator in the country. Two of the new systems are in New Jersey; the third is in Framingham, Mass.
Charles F. Dolan, chairman of Cablevision, said last night that he had been working on the purchase of the three systems for "a very long time" and that they were consistent with the company's long-standing growth strategy.
"These are systems where we already have a considerable number of subscribers," he said. "This gives us economies of scale and programming opportunities."
Based on the $463 million purchase price, Cablevision is paying more than $2,600 per subscriber for the systems.
The deal was announced after the stock market closed yesterday. Earlier, Cablevision's stock ended at $68, up $1.75, on the American Stock Exchange.
The deal hardly puts an end to takeover fever, however. Industry executives say that Time Warner Inc. and U S West remain actively interested in buying Cablevision as part of their effort to build advanced networks around the country. Southwestern Bell Corporation and Bellsouth Corporation have also been rumored bidders.
Many analysts say Cablevision will almost certainly be sold to someone, because the company has built up clusters of cable systems in good markets.
Under its deal with Sutton Capital, Cablevision is acquiring Monmouth Cablevision, which has about 115,000 subscribers in 31 central New Jersey communities, and Riverview Cablevision, with 45,000 subscribers in Hoboken, West New York, Weehawken and two other communities in Hudson County. And in Massachusetts, it is acquiring Framingham Cablevision, with about 16,300 subscribers.

HEADLINE: Candidates Debate Budget in Battle for Westchester Executive

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCARSDALE, N.Y., Oct. 27

 BODY:
As the race for Westchester County Executive enters its final days, even a strictly controlled League of Women Voters forum can turn into a rough-and-tumble debate, the incumbent, Andrew P. O'Rourke, and his challenger, state Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, showed here tonight.
Given no time for opening statements and restricted to answering issue-oriented questions posed by the League and members of the audience, Mr. Brodsky, a Democrat from Greenburgh, quickly turned his comments on his opponent, suggesting that the solution to nearly every problem in Westchester lay in replacing its chief executive. 
 Mr. O'Rourke, first elected to the post in 1981, cited his administration's actions and then turned to his familiar theme: that Mr. Brodsky was part of a do-nothing state government in Albany.
Given 90 seconds to respond to the first question, how to contain costs while providing needed services, Mr. O'Rourke began: "Cost containment means doing what we're doing right now in Westchester County. We have held the tax-levy increase to zero for the past three years. My budget for '94 comes out tomorrow and again it will be a frozen, zero tax-levy increase budget."
 
Horse Leaving the Barn
 But Mr. Brodsky began, "I listen to the County Executive talk about cost containment as something he is deeply engaged in with some sense of watching a horse leave the barn and the door being closed behind it. Since Andy O'Rourke became County Executive 11 years ago, property taxes are up 124 percent, larger than other counties in the area, larger than local governments, larger than local school districts."
Beyond the attacks and assignments of blame, of course, lies a county of 870,000 people that faces growing problems of the sort that many of its residents moved from New York City to escape, and a recession that has hit hard at white-collar employment in the county.
Mr. Brodsky is trying to provide an alternative for people who are feeling that Westchester can't afford all that it once could, including a big county government. "For Westchester to remain the same, we're going to have to change the government," he said.
Provoking groans and laughter from the audience, Mr. Brodsky repeatedly cited his editorial-page endorsement on Tuesday by the Westchester-Gannett Newspapers, which had endorsed Mr. O'Rourke in 1989, when Mr. Brodsky first challenged him. More than anything, the editorial suggested that Mr. O'Rourke had been in office too long, and that fresh leadership was needed.
 
Speaking of an Editorial
 But Mr. O'Rourke won friendlier laughter from the audience with his own references to his opponent's reliance on an editorial to speak for him. And while constantly jabbing at Mr. Brodsky, he also used his incumbency to cite specific ways his administration had acted on affordable housing, cutting costs and working with New York City on protecting the water supply that the county shares with it.
Both candidates said they opposed the county government's having the power to force affordable housing on communities that resist it. In a county that is under a consent order to provide more affordable housing in middle-class communities, and where the issue has been a bitter one in cities like Yonkers and smaller suburbs, both men said the county had to work with local governments.
And asked for alternatives to the multibillion-dollar filtration plant that the Federal Government may order New York City to build for its water supply, both said the reservoir system should be in the hands of a state or quasi-independent agency, rather than the city's.
Mr. O'Rourke, however, said that if the filtration plant were needed, Westchester should go along and pay its share of the cost.
 
Reducing Fat or Services
 One member of the audience asked how the candidates would cut costs within the county government. Mr. O'Rourke said the key was reducing duplication among various levels of government while examining the best way to provide every service.
Mr. Brodsky, who was attacked repeatedly by the Republican as a big spender, said he was prepared to reduce services. "There ought not to be duplication, but the fact of the matter is that saving money for people will require the downsizing of the government and may require less services than I would otherwise wish to recommend or provide."

HEADLINE: Haig Scorns U.S. for Its Tough China Policy

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Sitting in one of the skyscraper hotels that signifies China's economic ascent, former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. was seething about American policy toward China.
Visiting Beijing early this month to introduce the new president of the United Technologies Corporation to the Chinese leadership, Mr. Haig argued that Washington was about to lose China again by driving the next generation of Chinese leaders toward "jingoism" and "anti-Americanism." 
 "How dare we go around telling the rest of the world" that they must live up to American standards on human rights, he demanded. "I think the time has come to take a different tack here. And Tiananmen is a long way behind us."
His hotel is a few miles east of Tiananmen Square, where thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators fled the onslaught of the June 4, 1989, military crackdown, a night that left hundreds if not thousands dead.
With President Clinton meeting the Chinese Communist Party leader, Jiang Zemin, in Seattle next month, the question of whether and how to move American-Chinese relations into a new era is likely to be answered soon.
Exactly where the relationship can move is tricky business, however, and advocates on all sides of the policy issues are maneuvering for influence.
The greatest restriction to movement may have come from Mr. Clinton himself. In May he laid down a daunting challenge to the Chinese leadership when he signed an executive order extending China's most favored nation trading privileges for another year, but insisting that in that time China show "consistent overall progress" in its human rights record.
A number of China specialists worry that this schedule may be too short and internal pressures too great. paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, 89, is in declining health, and the prospect of Mr. Deng's death has rendered his potential successors more cautious than ever about undertaking change. Any leader who could be said to have bent to America's will might be vulnerable in any power struggle after Mr. Deng's death.
Moving United States-China relations away from the annual Congressional wrangle over renewal of China's trade status, with its emphasis on human rights, is an idea shared by a number of businessmen and diplomats who are coming to China to participate in China's economic boom.
This view is also shared by China specialists like Kenneth Lieberthal at the University of Michigan, who have begun to advocate that the United States "should stop punishing China for the massacre of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square" because China is simply too big and too important to isolate indefinitely.
 
The Japan Card
 Mr. Haig lowers his voice to give the geo-strategic underpinning to his argument. In the future, he said, the only way to protect Asia from the kind of Japan "that we don't want to see" is to build a strong relationship with China.
Since the United States already has a strong relationship with Japan, an equally strong American-Chinese relationship will be complementary, he argued. Keeping these future Asian superpowers balanced "is the greatest safeguard against regional uncertainty and instability," Mr. Haig said.
And what would become of human rights policy?
"We would espouse our values, but we should do it by example, not by pedantry," he replies.
Not far from Mr. Haig's hotel suite, a recently released political prisoner provided some contrast.
The prisoner was held for more than two years in solitary confinement and thought for a time that he had lost his mind in isolation. His health is broken, his life shattered by his pamphleteering for democracy in 1989. He asked that his name not be used.
After listening to a description of Mr. Haig's view, he said that keeping up the pressure on the Chinese leadership to respect human rights has been one of the greatest influences on its behavior.
"It would be very sad if the United States changed its policy in this way," he said.

HEADLINE: Durable-Goods Orders Up for a Second Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
More evidence that the economy is shifting into higher gear emerged today as orders for long-lived factory goods posted a second straight increase in September, the first back-to-back advance in nearly a year.
While the September rise for durable goods was just seven-tenths of 1 percent, after a revised 2.6 percent gain in August, analysts said the Commerce Department report reflected surprisingly strong performance. The orders total was held down by plunging military and aviation business, but, because of the long time between placing orders and actually producing such goods, that category has relatively little bearing on immediate economic prospects. 
 Economists were particularly heartened by the breadth of the gains and the fact that a widely followed subcategory, orders for civilian capital goods other than aircraft, surged 3.4 percent after a 1.8 percent gain in August.
 
'Beginning to Have Some Life'
 "It's pretty encouraging," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "The manufacturing segment of the economy is beginning to have some life."
Today's report also showed that shipments of manufactured goods climbed 1.9 percent last month, to $137 billion, the highest level on record. Shipments in all major industry groups advanced.
This, analysts said, reflected heavy orders placed early in the year after a booming final quarter of 1992. Then, the economy grew at an annual rate of 5.7 percent before slumping to an average of less than 1.5 percent during the first half of 1993. The department is to publish its first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, with economists expecting growth of about 2.75 percent.
"This is another indication that we're coming out of the slump we had during the spring and summer," Dave Orr, chief economist for the First Union National Bank, in Charlotte, N.C., said of today's figures. He expressed some concern about the decline in unfilled orders, which fell for the seventh straight month to the lowest point since June 1988. But, he said, the stronger and more numerous upbeat elements of the report "better fit the trend."
The biggest orders gains were posted by electronic and other electrical equipment, up 3 percent after falling nearly that much in August, and industrial machinery and equipment, up 2.5 percent. Primary metals advanced 2.4 percent. The only major decline was in transportation equipment, which tumbled 1.8 percent.
Sales of cars and houses have been among the strongest economic indicators recently despite continuing consumer apprehension about jobs. Low interest rates have aided both sectors. Companies, meanwhile, are buying new equipment.
"The industrial sector is picking up steam," Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said. "The durable goods report is consistent with other recent data that show the U.S. economy accelerating during the second half of 1993."
Orders last month totaled $132.79 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis, 9.3 percent above the September 1992 level. For the year to date, orders are running 8.3 percent ahead of the comparable 1992 period.
Over all, orders for durables have advanced in three of the latest four months. With transportation excluded, the gain was 1.5 percent for September, the fourth consecutive month with a gain of more than 1 percent, according to Laurence H. Meyer & Associates of St. Louis.
Shipments, today's report showed, have similarly advanced in three of the latest four months, with the September level 9.1 percent above that of September 1992.
Unfilled orders, a predictive indicator, fell 1 percent last month to $428.76 billion, the 26th decline in the past 31 months. With transportation excluded, however, the decline was a negligible one-tenth of 1 percent.
Perhaps the most important element of today's report, Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank said, was that nonmilitary orders rose for the second straight month -- nine-tenths of 1 percent in September and 3.3 percent, after revision, in August.
This broke a pattern all year in which every month had reversed course from the preceding one. The performance pointed, Mr. Niemira said, to "building momentum."

HEADLINE: A Race of TV Images: Framing the Debate

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
Perhaps the most interesting television advertisement in New Jersey's crowded political season has little to do with the main attraction, the race for governor.
It is a spot that urges the re-election of William L. Gormley, a Republican State Senator from Atlantic City, and it is almost entirely devoted to a visual of him paddling about in the rough ocean surf in a kayak. The last image shows the 46-year old candidate on the beach in his bathing suit, looking, from what might be interpreted as a deliberate backside angle, like something of a hunk. 
 Mr. Gormley, who finished fourth in the 1989 Republican primary for governor, laughs off allusions to "beefcake" that the ad has encouraged. It was, he says, merely an inviting way to carry a serious message about his work to improve the economy and build schools.
The point is that the art of selling a candidate on television still depends on visuals, visuals, visuals -- however remote they are from the real issues.
Some of the ads for Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor, tried to dump all the problems of the long recession at the door of Gov. Jim Florio and his $2.8 billion tax plan. Others argued that Mrs. Whitman would broadly cut taxes while the Democrats could not be trusted to refrain from raising them again. For both themes, many of the visuals were static images of shuttered factories with broken windows.
 
Assaulting the Public
 Meanwhile, Mr. Florio's ads were shooting up the screen with chattering assault weapons.
Neil Upmeyer, president of the Center for the Analysis of Public Issues at Princeton, says the Democrats so far are the winners in the battle of the ads, and the assault weapon is why.
"Assault weapons have very little to do with the kind of crime most voters fear in this state," he noted. "The handgun is what threatens most people. But the image of the assault weapon is so much stronger and memorable."
Not only were the assault weapon ads effective, in the judgment of Mr. Upmeyer and others. They were also out there early.
The Florio campaign began running spots shortly after Labor Day that attacked Mrs. Whitman on issues like her reservations about aspects of the assault weapon ban and drunken-driving laws. At the time, some Republican insiders gloated that the Democrats had made a strategic mistake: By spending heavily on television in September in a state with campaign spending limits, the Florio camp risked running short of money later in the campaign.
 
Negative, Without Nastiness
 The Democrats' ads had framed the debate, however, and Mrs. Whitman was forced to spend a lot of time explaining her positions on assault weapons, drunken driving and welfare reform.
"The Florio people did a superb job through their ads of strengthening the very soft lead they started the campaign with," said Dr. Jerome Aumente, director of the Journalism Resources Institute at Rutgers University.
The TV ads may have turned negative but never in the nasty style of previous campaigns.
Mr. Upmeyer and others suspect that Mr. Florio and his campaign adviser, James Carville, were prepared to get as mean as necessary. But when a variety of polls showed them comfortably ahead, the Florio team never had to make that decision.
 
Falling Short
 There is fairly widespread, even bipartisan, agreement that Mrs. Whitman's television commercials failed her in two ways.
*They did little to counter the Florio camp's unrelenting campaign to portray Mrs. Whitman as a hunt-country dilettante out of touch with ordinary people.
*They failed to inspire confidence in Mrs. Whitman. Her biggest target was Mr. Florio's shaky credibility, But her own credibility got no boost from ads trying to sell the voters on her promise to come up with a broad tax cut.
And the Florio team was swift to capitalize on criticism of her tax plan.
"Especially effective was their quick response to challenge the Whitman tax cut package and damage her credibility," Dr. Aumente of Rutgers said. "Her ads mentioned trivial things she would cut out of the budget -- like sneakers for prisoners and the Governor's helicopter -- that just didn't add up to the kind of savings needed to allow her tax cuts.
Roger Bodman, a Republican lobbyist, said he felt Mrs. Whitman's most effective ad appeared on radio, not television.
"It's the one where her daughter defends her with a great deal of passion," said Mr. Bodman, who serves as a political analyst on the New Jersey Network.
 
Subject of Referendum
 He agreed that the Florio campaign had largely succeeded in defining Mrs. Whitman for the public before the paid media campaign got under way in earnest.
"I felt if the Republican campaign was to be successful it had to be fought on the ground that the election was a referendum on Jim Florio," he said. "Instead it has been turned into a referendum on Christie Whitman. That's not necessarily bad but it shows the effectiveness of the Florio campaign to turn things around like that."
Jim McQueeny, a Democratic consultant, said the Whitman campaign was so severely hurt by the tax cut promise that her most recent commercials barely mention it.
"Her ads attack Florio for most of the state's economic ills, but she never gets around to explaining what her alternatives would be," said Mr. McQueeny, who also serves as a political analyst for NJN.
Mr. Upmeyer of the Center for the Analysis of Public Issues said he felt the biggest weakness in the Whitman media campaign was that it relied too much on anti-Florio sentiment and never generated enough good will to make her own economic pronouncements believable.
"If the ads can help establish her as a highly regarded and credible candidate, people would listen to what she had to say on important economic issues. That never happened."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Ford Reports a $463 Million Profit for 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 27

 BODY:
With profits in the United States at their highest level for the period since 1988, the Ford Motor Company today posted third-quarter earnings of $463 million, in contrast to a loss of $272 million during the quarter last year.
While Ford's stock surged immediately after the announcement, it receded a bit after Wall Street analysts looked more closely at the numbers. In addition to a one-time favorable tax adjustment of $140 million, Ford's profits were buoyed by sales in Latin America, a market that some analysts consider too volatile to support investors' hopes for future prosperity. Other analysts worried that Ford was continuing to cut the profit margins on its vehicles too fine. 
 In the the end, Ford stock closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $60.375, up 62.5 cents, a record closing price. It was the most active issue on the Big Board, with more than five million shares traded.
 
 
Higher Truck Sales
 The company cited cost cuts and improved truck sales as important contributors to its profitable quarter. Excluding the tax benefit, Ford's American operations earned $163 million, compared with a loss of $260 million a year ago.
Over all, Ford's earnings came to 79 cents a share, or 51 cents once the tax adjustment was excluded. For the quarter, worldwide sales and revenue were $24.5 billion, up $1.2 billion from the third quarter last year.
The Chrysler Corporation reported record third-quarter earnings of $372 million at midmonth, excluding a similar tax adjustment. The General Motors Corporation is expected to report a loss on Thursday.
At Ford, strength in North and South America was not enough to offset continued losses in Europe. Before income taxes, Ford's worldwide automotive operations lost $206 million for the quarter, compared with a total loss of $927 million a year ago.
Today's report also provided insight into Ford's long-term strategy. Analysts have long puzzled over why Ford, which has gained almost six points of market share since 1981, and now has 5 of the 10 top-selling vehicles in America, is not more profitable. One answer, the company indicated today, is that Ford is purchasing market share through its high marketing budget, which pays for rebates and other financial incentives for customers, like low lease rates.
"We have been spending at high levels, but we think the net benefit is clearly worth it," said David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance and treasurer. "In the short run, with the economy weak and total overall demand having to be induced by a certain amount of marketing expense, we aren't making the sort of profits that we'd like to in the long run. But the opportunity to do that in the long run is enhanced."
Once the recovery gathers strength and the car and light-truck market swells to normal boom levels of more than 15 million vehicles a year, he said, Ford, which held 25.4 percent of the total American market for the 1993 model year, will be in a position to cash in.
 
 
The Cost of 'Safe Products'
 Already, Ford has lowered sales incentives on its vehicles. The average incentive for the third quarter was $865, compared with $1,065 in the period a year earlier, Mr. McCammon said. But he said marketing costs for the quarter were 11 percent of total revenue in North America, which works out to about $1.5 billion. When Ford was making big profits in the late 1980's, he said, marketing costs were closer to 6 percent.
Those high marketing costs worry some analysts. "Chrysler has products that people will pay full price for, but Ford ever since 1985 has been introducing safe products that people will buy if the price is right," said Ron Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter in San Francisco.
In Europe, where Ford's new Mondeo sedan is drawing customers, losses declined slightly, and company officials said the slack European market may be improving.
Ford lost $217 million in Europe in the third quarter, compared with $285 million last year. Separately, Jaguar, the English luxury car builder owned by Ford, lost $108 million, compared with $135 million a year ago. Jaguar's loss included a $65 million charge against earnings for moving a sheet-metal-stamping operation.
Ford's finance arm, the Ford Motor Credit Company, reported record third-quarter earnings of $275 million, up 14 percent from $241 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Cancellation of Sanctions Buoys Dollar Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday as the currency markets focused on Japan's economic weakness and the Clinton Administration's cancellation of planned trade sanctions against Japan. The dollar finished mixed against other currencies.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 108.69 yen, up from 108.35 yen on Tuesday. 
 Gold edged higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery gained 40 cents, to $370.70 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted the spot price of gold at $369.30 an ounce, unchanged from Tuesday.
The dollar's move against the yen yesterday "was largely a function of progress in U.S. trade talks," said David de Rosa, a Swiss Bank Corporation director in New York.
Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's trade representative, said on Tuesday that the United States would not impose sanctions against Japan next week as the Japanese authorities had agreed to open public-sector construction jobs to international bidding.
Currency traders said the yen had also been hurt by the tumbling Tokyo stock market. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed below the 20,000 level for the first time since July 28. "The market is principally concerned about the economic weakness in Japan," said Belal Khan, a senior dealer at the New York branch of the Bank of Tokyo.
The yen had sharply risen against the dollar for much of this year on the market's perception that the Clinton Administration was pushing for a strong yen to reduce the trade deficit with Japan. A strengthened yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive, and imports into Japan cheaper. The defusing, at least for now, of Japanese-American trade tensions is seen as a sign that any "strong yen" policy will not be pursued from Washington.
Most European currencies fluctuated in a narrow range against the dollar yesterday, as traders waited for today's report on the American gross domestic product for the third quarter. They said strong figures would push up the dollar's value, and further the impression that the United States economy is growing faster than most other major economies.
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6810 German marks, up from 1.6805 marks on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Coffee Prices Rise Sharply On Market Moves by Brazil

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Coffee futures prices rallied strongly yesterday as Brazil, the world's largest producer, raised the money to buy beans and withhold them from the market.
In a double dose of supportive news, Brazil also announced that its October coffee exports were less than half of what traders had expected. 
 "It's a pretty bullish framework, especially when you consider that coffee is still at one of the lowest prices we've seen in the past 20 years," said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Smith Barney Shearson Inc.
On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, green coffee beans for December delivery settled at 76.35 cents a pound, 1.65 cents above Tuesday's close and 2.65 cents above the day's low of 73.70 cents.
The market heated up late in the session as rumors spread that the Brazilian Government had secured financing to join other leading coffee-producing countries in a plan to withhold 20 percent of their planned October-June exports to bolster prices.
Brazil's absence from the withholding plan had driven coffee prices lower since Oct. 1, when the international price-support effort began.
Brazil confirmed the rumors after the close, saying it would buy 135,000 132-pound bags of coffee, possibly starting as early as tomorrow, to help meet the withholding quota for the month of October. That would mean Brazilian exports of less than 700,000 bags of coffee this month instead of the two million bags analysts had expected.
"That is more bullish than any story about Brazil going in and buying coffee," said Judy Ganes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. But, she cautioned, "one month's figures aren't necessarily indicative of what's to come."
In other commodity trading, silver futures rose sharply. Silver for December delivery jumped 6.2 cents an ounce, to $4.469, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Some analysts attributed the strength to optimism about the economy fostered by a Government report that orders to American factories for big-ticket goods increased in September for the third time in four months.
Elsewhere, energy futures rose modestly on the New York Mercantile Exchange in quiet trading. Light crude oil for December delivery rose 11 cents, to $17.65 a barrel.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The earnings gap grows, within professions and among them.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IN 1990 the average take-home of the partners in the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore exceeded the total salaries of all nine members of the Supreme Court. Chief executives of the Fortune 500 did pretty well that year, too, netting an average of $1.4 million -- roughly 40 times the average for public school teachers.
O.K., O.K, it is getting harder to work up a lather over such familiar outrages. But the source of these numbers, Derek Bok's new book, "The Cost of Talent," (The Free Press) offers more than a rehash of the old stuff. 
 Rather than focusing on the pay gap between the skilled and unskilled workers, the former president of Harvard and dean of its law school hones in on the divergence in pay among professionals, a subject just beginning to capture the attention of labor economists. And while Mr. Bok is better at describing the consequences than the cure, the phenomenon (and the book) are disturbing.
Wages, economists have been telling each other for decades, are determined by the value an extra worker can bring to the job. Thus if one more burger flipper adds $6 an hour to Wendy's revenues, while one more software engineer adds $30 an hour to Intel's, the software specialist will earn five times as much.
Simple as it sounds (and as hard to prove), marginal productivity theory is still more or less the state of the science of wage determination and income distribution. Indeed, virtually all the explanations for the current blue collar-white collar gap turn on this potent idea from classical economic theory.
But what seems to answer a question as old as Marx in comparing the lot of skilled workers with that of the proletariat does not hold up very well in explaining why, say, auto executives earn more than nuclear chemists. Nor does it touch the issue of why the earnings gaps within professions as well as among them have grown so much in the last two decades.
Mr. Bok, a lawyer who knows his economics, is happy to amplify. "We're talking about unique services," he argues, where there "is an imbalance of information between professionals and the people who employ them."
It is hard enough to figure whom to hire or what to pay them if the work is merely important -- say, tax accounting. It is even harder when the professional typically works as part of a group -- say, the second assistant to the director of personnel. And when it is a matter of life or death, the information vacuum looms as black as outer space. "Can you imagine someone looking for the lowest-cost heart surgeon, even if insurance didn't pay?" Mr. Bok asks.
One apparent consequence, which Robert Frank of Cornell and Philip Cook of Duke University have labeled the "winner take all" phenomenon, is a broadening of the star system beyond sports and entertainment that leads to an ever-smaller number of professionals grabbing an ever-increasing share of the pie. And it is apparently reinforced by the psychology of career choices that have much in common with the lure of high-stakes gambling: People make decisions about education and employment based on small chances of gigantic payoffs -- what they might earn if they, say, bat .320 for the Dodgers or become partners in Goldman, Sachs.
Mr. Bok raises the specter of deeper social and economic losses. One worry is that the most talented are systematically forsaking key professions, like teaching and government service, that do deliver personal security but never deliver a big financial hit. America, he notes, has more than twice as many lawyers as it did in 1970. And education majors who become career high school teachers have College Board scores a full hundred points below those who never teach at all.
Another worry is the loss of loyalty to employers, the bond beyond money that makes organizations more productive than a collection of individuals looking out for No. 1. Still another, is the "whole different feeling of leader to group": If the million-dollar boss is seen as merely the luckiest or most ruthless bee in the hive, capitalism is in trouble.
What to do? Mr. Bok is bearish on the idea that corporate directors can be galvanized to pay senior executives according to merit. "Look who appoints the corporate directors," he points out, "it's hardly a free market." In the end, Mr. Bok suggests, the only real solution is to persuade the culture to renounce the philosophy that he who dies with the most toys wins.
The other approach (embodied in this year's deficit reduction package) is to use government to handicap financial outcomes. While there is considerable skepticism about the capacity or desirability of taxing the super-successful more heavily, it remains the fix of choice for those who do not think there are other choices. "The world wouldn't collapse," allows Frank Levy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "if you increased taxes at the top."

Ally for Sale

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
She's intelligent, personable and articulate. Turkey's new Prime Minister, Tansu Ciller, an economist trained in the United States, wowed 'em on television and in private meetings here on her recent visit to America.
Unfortunately, the central message that she and her advisers brought to the White House was unworthy of the proud Turkish people. 
 It's this: The cutoff of the oil pipeline to Iraq, part of the world's sanctions on Saddam Hussein, is costing Turkey billions. Mrs. Ciller wants the U.S., as the chief Desert Stormer, to arrange to recompense Turkey for this cost.
Otherwise -- and here's the zinger that shows how little this Turkish Government understands alliances -- Turkey might just not extend its agreement to permit its airfields and supply routes to be used to protect and feed Iraqi Kurds in our Operation Provide Comfort.
Though not presented as a quid pro quo, the point was blunt: Pay us the money, and we let you keep on preventing Saddam Hussein from slaughtering the Kurds beginning to build an autonomous democracy on the dictator's land.
That goes beyond realpolitik to real blackmail. But an ally whose cooperation is for sale is available for alliance to a higher bidder, and other nations know that. Relationships that rely on immediate mutual back-scratching never become "special."
In her hard sell, the Turkish Prime Minister went further. Saddam, she told one and all, is growing more popular in Iraq day by day. The sanctions aren't working. She wants to do business with him, and never mind the regional threat.
President Clinton and his advisers did not express irritation at being presented with a big bill for continued parking in Turkish airports. That's because Turkey is the secular Muslim nation that stands in contrast to Iran's fanatic fundamentalism, and those two models are battling for the future of the Turkic-speaking nations along Russia's southern rim.
We need Turkey for a related reason: The Russian reformers are in danger of creating a Yeltsin-Grachev regime. The Russian President, in debt for his political existence to the chief of the armed forces, is letting the former Red Army reach into the former Soviet empire to re-establish Moscow's control, ostensibly to enforce order or to protect Russian "near-abroads."
Turkey's stability would be vital if Containment II comes to pass. But an alliance is a two-way street; Turkey's leaders are as worried as we are about a resurgence of Moscow imperialism.
Underlying Mrs. Ciller's programmed pleas for appeasement of Saddam is her own military's decision to escalate the crackdown on the P.K.K. -- terrorist Kurds in Turkey who demand instant independence.
One Turk in six is a Kurd; the great majority want to live as citizens of Turkey, free to express their Kurdish cultural heritage and speak their own language. But the shortsighted army leaders, by overreacting to the terrorists; by suppressing the Kurdish identity of all Turkish Kurds; by raiding Kurdish villages in Iraq while restraining hot pursuit of the P.K.K. in Syria, Iran or Armenia -- are making the classic mistake of driving moderates into the radical camp.
The democratically elected Prime Minister Ciller, mindful of past army takeovers, told me determinedly: "There will be no more coups in Turkey." Let's hope not; but as Kurds and their supporters see it, Ankara's military has already taken control of this Government's Kurdish policy. Mrs. Ciller's recent predecessors were harder for the Turkish Army leaders to push around.
Strange, how this ancient, homeless Kurdish people -- 20 million in a half-dozen countries -- is again at the nexus of geostrategy. The Turks worry that if the Iraqi Kurds build a democratic state, Turkish Kurds may want the same, so Turkey sends us an intolerable bill for helping save Iraqi Kurds from genocide.
Wrong. If Mrs. Ciller reverses course and helps Iraqi Kurds achieve prosperous autonomy -- and by so doing encourages their ethnic brethren to be loyal Kurdish Turks -- the first female Turkish Prime Minister will be remembered not as a clumsy ally-for-sale but as a new Ataturk.

HEADLINE: Next Mayor Faces Expensive Challenges on Basic Services and Repairs

SERIES: Mayoral Agenda: 5. Infrastructure -- A periodic report on key issues facing the election winner.

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:

The Series So Far
Previous stories in the Mayoral Agenda series focused on the city budget, Sept. 27; social services, Oct. 2; crime, Oct. 11, and the economy, Oct. 18.
Whoever is elected mayor on Tuesday will face expensive problems that have yet to surface as major campaign issues. 
 They are the housekeeping questions: taking out the garbage, keeping the drinking water clean, fixing the bridges and improving the subways.
Mayor David N. Dinkins spoke last week before an audience of construction officials and said his administration had improved New York's infrastructure and would do more. But outside experts complain that neither candidate has sufficiently discussed issues that could involve the expenditure of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and affect the quality of life of all New Yorkers.
On several issues, the men express similar views and differ only on pace and methodology. For instance, numerous subway improvements have been stalled over a decision by the Dinkins administration to withhold $100 million of the city's contribution to the needed construction. The administration isn't against the improvements; it simply contends that alternative financing sources exist. The camp of Mr. Dinkins's opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, says the money could be made available if the city's capital budget is reorganized.
Hardly the stuff of political drama, but important to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers.
Here are details on some of the various infrastructure challenges that will face the next administration:
Intermittently, the city's bridges are falling apart. The last major closure was in July 1992, when engineers found a beam on the Manhattan Bridge that had rusted through and had to keep subway trains off while repairs were made. There are many smaller instances; last week engineers closed a ramp from Third Avenue to the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn.
City Hall said last month that 56.4 percent of the city's bridges are structurally deficient, which does not mean that they are unsafe but that they need repairs. The number in 1991 was 55 percent, and the projection for next year is 56.3 percent.
"We're doing component repair, fixing the part that's broken," said Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Transportation. "While we're doing that, some of the older parts are wearing down."
That deterioration means that periodic closings are likely in the future and could have tremendous cost. The East River bridges have more than 1,000 maintenance items waiting, and the impact of a major failure could be staggering.
 
Repair Jobs Tripled
 Lucius J. Riccio, the Transportation Commissioner, said the city is making progress, tripling the number of bridge repair jobs undertaken in the last four years, compared with the prior four years. Painting, he said, is now on an 8- to 10-year cycle, rather than once very 30 to 40 years. But it will take time to show results, he said.
Samuel I. Schwartz was chief engineer and first deputy transportation commissioner for the city until 1990 and is now head of the Infrastructure Institute at Cooper Union. He said an independent study he commissioned while still with the city showed that the bridges could be kept in good maintenance for $150 million a year, much of it for simple things like paint. But currently, he said, the city spends far more, about $400 million, because it must replace rusted steel that was left unpainted.
"The painting program to a large extent has been halted because of the lead crisis," he said. "Any paint was good for the bridges. Graffiti were good. That's what protected us through the 1970's. Now it's fighting an uphill battle."
 
Finding a Place for Garbage
 New York is using up its space for garbage.
Once there were landfills in every borough, but now a fleet of barges carries almost all the city's household trash to Fresh Kills on Staten Island. That is a problem for two reasons.
Staten Island will probably vote in a referendum next month to pursue secession from New York City. City Hall's official position is that the city will not break up, and that even if it does, the remaining four boroughs will still own Fresh Kills. But privately they are less sure.
And whatever happens politically, Fresh Kills is approaching physical limits. If everything goes right, Fresh Kills could last until about 2030. That assumes that incinerators are built soon; recycling takes off, and the Federal Government continues to guarantee the interstate transportation of garbage and trash. It also assumes the garbage pile on Staten Island can be built as steep as the city plans, making it one of the highest peaks on the East Coast, three times the height of the Statue of Liberty.
On the other hand, if all those things go wrong, Fresh Kills could be full in 10 years, less than three mayoral elections away. If that were to happen, it is not clear where the city could dump its garbage locally.
 
The Recycling Program
 The Dinkins administration, with some dissent from environmentalists, says that recycling is going well. It is slogging toward building incinerators.
Mr. Giuliani says he believes that the city's recycling program could be improved. Earlier this week, he proposed a one-year moratorium on incineration, which some environmentalists believe creates dangerous air pollutants and ash disposal problems.
Emily Lloyd, the Commissioner of Sanitation, said that of cities with populations exceeding one million, only New York collects for recycling from all homes, requires recycling and enforces the rules, or regulates recycling of commercial wastes. New York is more successful at diverting material for recycling than any other big city, she said.
Mr. Giuliani's position, said his issues director, Mr. Schwartz, is that if the city ran the Department of Sanitation better and had a better contract with the sanitation union, more resources would be available to press forward with recycling, reducing the amount that has to be incinerated.
New York, almost alone among big cities, does not filter most of its water. But whether it can keep doing so is unclear.
The Federal Environmental Protection Agency wants all cities to filter their water, believing that step generally is necessary to meet Federal standards for drinking water.
Earlier this year, the E.P.A. gave New York a temporary exemption. It must rule again by the end of this year.
The Dinkins administration has argued that it will not need filtration if it can protect its large reservoirs in upstate New York by controlling activities in their 2,000-square-mile watersheds. The city would like to buy some parcels of land and enforce regulations on septic systems in other parts.
The city also could either order upstate communities to improve their sewage treatment plants -- as it is allowed to do under state laws -- or pay for the upgrading itself at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, a cost likely to be passed onto water rate-payers.
The alternative, according to city officials, is to spend up to $8 billion in building treatment plants, and then $300 million a year to run them. Federal officials think the price might be a lot lower. But the plants are not capable of filtering out certain chemicals, like oil, that can only be kept out by watershed protection.
While this is a decision to be made by Federal officials, not the next Mayor, the vigor and skill with which watershed protection is pursued will probably influence the outcome. Mr. Giuliani's campaign says the Dinkins approach is correct, but that it got off to a late start and is not moving fast enough.
 
Repairing the Subways
 Earlier this year the State Legislature approved a $9.6 billion, five-year capital program for the city's subways, but then the city announced that it was reducing its contribution from $205 million a year to $105 million. The city said that the difference would be made up by money from the Municipal Assistance Corporation, but the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that it is already counting on that money, and that the result of the city's decision would be to cut the budget by half a billion dollars.
In May, the transportation authority said that as a result it would defer rebuilding 28 subway stations, including the one on the C and D lines at 161st Street in the Bronx that serves Yankee Stadium; the IND 50th Street/Rockefeller Center station, the 72d Street IRT station, and most of the Times Square station in Manhattan, the Queensboro Plaza station and the Main Street station in Flushing, Queens, and six stations on Staten Island.
Reconstruction of the Franklin Avenue shuttle was also deferred, as were design work on the Second Avenue subway and work on transit police district offices and subway repair shops.
The deferral of work raises some safety issues -- for instance, the Oct. 7 subway collision in Brooklyn, blamed on motorman error, possibly would not have happened with an automated signal system. But another concern is the need to combat a general sense of deterioration.
 
'Gateways to Service'
 Alan F. Kiepper, president of the Transit Authority, said in a letter to the chairman of the transportation authority in May, "We find these setbacks most unfortunate because the station environments represent our 'gateways to service,' in that they present our customers with both their first and last impressions of our system."
Joseph G. Rappaport of the Straphangers Campaign, a riders' advocacy group, was more blunt. "You'll see all sorts of stations that desperately need attention continue to decay," he said. "Some stations that need better lighting to fight crime will continue to be dim."
"You've got to have a revived transit system to make the city work," he said.
Mr. Giuliani supports restoring the $100 million a year, according to Mr. Schwartz, who said the money would be available if the city's capital program could be reorganized, with changes in state law to allow more efficient contracting on city projects.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the money the city had intended to use for capital was taken instead by the State Legislature for holding down the fare. The city has been cheated out of bridge toll revenues and surpluses accumulated by suburban rail lines, he said.
Whatever the financing problems, a solution would probably be appreciated by city residents. "Dinkins and Giuliani don't see how sexy fixing up a subway station can be," Mr. Rappaport said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 29, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about infrastructure issues and the New York City mayoral race omitted the first name of Rudolph W. Giuliani's issues director, who discussed recycling and the management of the Sanitation Department. He is Richard J. Schwartz. (A former city transportation official who was quoted earlier in the article, about infrastructure maintenance, was Samuel I. Schwartz.)

HEADLINE: FLURRY OF ATTACKS AS RACE FOR MAYOR IS NEARING AN END

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
A visit from the President, a flurry of broadcast appearances and saturation-strength television commercials propelled the New York City mayoral campaign toward its final weekend yesterday as Mayor David N. Dinkins rolled into high-geared attack and Rudolph W. Giuliani made more tempered appeals to liberal swing voters.
With polls showing the race too close to call but voters' unfavorable impressions of Mr. Giuliani edging upward from the Mayor's past broadsides, Mr. Dinkins unleashed his harshest commercial of the campaign, using footage of Mr. Giuliani's epithet-spiked speech to a rowdy police rally near City Hall last year and condemning him for excessive zeal as United States Attorney in Manhattan. 
 For his part, Mr. Giuliani mixed apparent confidence with the acknowledgment that his voter support seems to suffer when he is too much on the offensive, and he steered away from direct attacks on Mr. Dinkins.
 
A Giuliani Endorsement
 Mr. Giuliani's new ads feature an endorsement from the Rev. Dr. John E. Brandon, a Harlem minister and former head of the city's Human Rights Commission, who says the Republican-Liberal nominee "will bring us together around the issues of the economy, supporting small businesses and lifting people out of poverty" and "will be fair with everybody, bringing people together and not separating them."
In an appearance on WCBS-TV last night, Mr. Giuliani took some pains to soften his earlier suggestion that the city should try to bar Louis Farrakhan from speaking at Yankee Stadium -- a stance that was considered to have hurt him with liberals. The program was to have been a debate, but Mr. Dinkins skipped it because the station refused to include the Conservative Party candidate, George J. Marlin, as the Mayor wished. [Page B2.]
 
A Postponed Appearance
 "He has a right, unfortunately, from the point of view of the sensibilities of people, but fortunately for the First Amendment, he has a right to express that viewpoint," Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. Farrakhan's appearance, originally proposed for this weekend but since postponed. "And I would protect Farrakhan to the same extent as I'd protect someone that I agree with."
In reminding New York voters of Mr. Giuliani's speech at the police rally, Mr. Dinkins used an issue that politicians had been predicting he would invoke, suggesting that the Mayor intends to leave no hot button unpushed between now and Election Day.
He also began broadcasting another ad repeating past criticisms of Mr. Giuliani for once opposing abortion rights before unequivocally backing them four years ago, and painting the Republican-Liberal candidate's proposals for reshaping city government as cold-hearted. A third commercial cites the endorsement of the Mayor by newspapers ranging from The Village Voice to The Forward, a newspaper aimed at Jewish readers.
Together, the Mayor's twilight rally with President Clinton at a Queens union hall, an emotional gathering with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta and other members of the clergy at City Hall, new endorsements and street stumping in which each candidate sniped at the other from a distance marked the beginning of the end of their long battle.
"It's easier to be a good President for New York City and New York State if you have a good partner in City Hall and the statehouse," Mr. Clinton told a cheering crowd of 800 unionists and Democrats at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hall in Flushing in his second visit there of this campaign.
Referring to the procession of national Democrats who have endorsed the Mayor, he said: "We may not have the vote in New York, but we have a stake in New York. How can America do well if New York State and New York City don't do well?"
The Mayor, speaking in an unusually blunt and forceful style, again framed the contest as a partisan battle royal, insisting that "it's time to turn back the broken politics of blame and shame, of code words and cold indifference."
Later, in an hourlong appearance of his own on WCBS-AM radio, the Mayor defended his insistence on including Mr. Marlin in the debates, saying, "There's not a question Rudy Giuliani could dream up that would measure up to the superior questions from the press corps that I've faced for four years."
Mr. Giuliani, campaigning at a center for the elderly in Astoria and other stops in Queens, dismissed Mr. Dinkins's gaining of support from the President and celebrities like Barbra Streisand, saying, "He's got to go Hollywood because he's in very bad shape."
But perhaps none of the activity was more intense or potentially influential than the candidates' new commercials, which are now on the air so often that an average viewer will see each of the three Dinkins ads three times. The Giuliani ads include one with him talking with minority students at Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn, his alma mater.
 
Raising Questions
 Campaign officials said Mr. Dinkins planned to spend about half a million dollars on television time between now and Tuesday, and Mr. Giuliani somewhat more, though neither camp would disclose precise figures.
Robert Shrum, a mayoral media adviser, said the new ads raised more questions about Mr. Giuliani's record, in keeping with the campaign's longstanding strategy.
"We take nothing for granted; we have never intended to take anything for granted," he said. "We're simply showing Mr. Giuliani and how he has behaved in some times when he was under pressure. His entire campaign has turned into an apology for his past record, of saying, 'I didn't quite do it that way.' In fact, I think his explanations have never helped him much."
 
Viewed as Distortion
 Mr. Giuliani countered that the Dinkins ads -- especially one that claims he has proposed "city job cuts that would decimate services for senior citizens" -- grossly distorted his views and that the Mayor himself had initially proposed cuts in programs for the elderly earlier this year.
"In the last days of the campaign, unfortunately in this campaign even in the early days, sometimes when people get desperate they spread a lot of false rumors and they try to frighten people," Mr. Giuliani said.
Seeking to counter the potential impact of former Mayor Edward I. Koch's endorsement of Mr. Giuliani, nearly a dozen former city officials who served under Mr. Koch came to City Hall yesterday to endorse Mr. Dinkins. One who did not come but was listed as a Dinkins supporter was Bess Myerson, the former Miss America and friend of Mr. Koch, whom Mr. Giuliani unsucessfully prosecuted on charges of trying to improperly influence the judge presiding over her lover's divorce.
 
A Difficult Job
 "The Dinkins mayoralty now clearly exhibits the seasoned strength needed to lead us," said Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center who was a deputy mayor under Mr. Koch and director of Mr. Dinkins's transition to office four years ago. "Having served in government, we know how difficult the job can be," he said.
Others who spoke included Benjamin Ward, the former police commissioner, who criticized Mr. Giuliani for his participation in the raucous demonstration by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
"The police brass and most of the police in this city are still embarrassed by what went on on these steps," he said. "And we know it will take perhaps several years for us to get over the reputation that the police union with the help of Rudy Giuliani caused. It put us in a bad light in police circles all over the country."

HEADLINE: His Brain 'Aching,' Clinton Tries A Soft Touch to Push Health Plan

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

 BODY:
A day after delivering his health care proposal to Congress, President Clinton yesterday moved to humanize the complicated universal health insurance plan that he said he had studied "until my brain aches."
Setting aside the fist-pounding oratory that he used in his address to Congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Clinton adopted a confessional tone. Instead of trolling for votes from potentially skeptical lawmakers, Mr. Clinton used his public appearances to shore up the base of popular support for his plan. 
 In his address to an audience of dignitaries, medical students, professors and administrators at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Mr. Clinton emphasized his roots as the son of a nurse from a rural region of the country and his wife's longtime interest in children's health. And he described his effort as a personal battle to restructure a health care system that he said "Rube Goldberg in his wildest dreams could not have designed."
 
'Enormous Ramifications'
 "This is a human problem," Mr. Clinton said. "But you must understand that it has enormous ramifications for all the other aspects of your nation's life."
In a speech in Manhattan last night to business executives, Mr. Clinton also stressed the need for building public support for the North American Free Trade Agreemtn. The President called for the executives to ask their employees to persuade members of Congress to support the pact as well.
In his speech to the business leaders' conference, sponsored by The Wall Street Journal at the Waldorf-Astoria, Mr. Clinton said many wavering Democrats could be persuaded to support the pact -- if they could be convinced that the vote would not be unpopular with their constituents.
"I think if there were no recorded votes we could ratify Nafta tomorrow," Mr. Clinton said.
A lot of members on the fence "just want some other real voters to tell them to vote for it," the President said.
After several weeks in which troublesome foreign affairs have dominated his time, Mr. Clinton today happily returned to his domestic agenda.
 
Ovations for Mrs. Clinton
 Hillary Rodham Clinton, who joined her husband on the trip, received two standing ovations in Baltimore before she even spoke. She said the plan, which she had a major role in shaping, is intended "to preserve what is right and works about the American health care system, but, finally, to fix what is wrong."
The White House had been searching for a receptive audience to address once Mr. Clinton came up with the polished version of his health care plan. Johns Hopkins was apparently chosen because Mrs. Clinton was warmly received there last June, when she spoke about health care costs.
 
Violence and Health Care
 The location was also chosen to allow Mr. Clinton to drive home the theme he has been promoting recently, linking efforts to control crime and violence with health care. The East Baltimore campus of the university's medical school is home to an overburdened emergency room that treats many victims of violent crime.
"We have some group behaviors in this country that are imposing intolerable burdens on the health care system," Mr. Clinton said. "We must recognize every time another kid takes another assault weapon onto another dark street and commits another random drive-by shooting and sends another child to the Johns Hopkins emergency room, that adds to the cost of health care."
"It is a human tragedy," Mr. Clinton added. "It is also the dumbest thing that we can permit to continue to go on for our long-term economic growth."
On the trade agreement, Mr. Clinton renewed a theme he has spent several weeks developing, arguing that those who oppose the pact were worried about the jobs they had already lost rather than any jobs that would be lost in the future.
 
'Flypaper' for Emotions
 The agreement, which would lower trade barriers between the United States, Canada and Mexico, could succeed if disgruntled Americans who are worried about their futures can be convinced that the Federal Government will follow through on its promise to retrain workers for other work, he said.
The opposition to the pact is fueled by the profound sense of insecurity the last few years of recession have given the American worker, he said.
"What happened today in America is we have a whole lot of people who have dealt with this, not very well, who feel that they have worked hard and played by the rules, and who now are the seedbed of resentment welling up against Nafta," he said. "Not because of anything that's in Nafta, but because it is the flypaper that's catching all the emotions."
The first Congressional votes on the trade pact are scheduled for Nov. 17.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Passage May Hinge on Mexican Sugar

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 28

 BODY:
After years of discussion, the prospects for free trade in North America may hinge on this arcane question: Will Mexicans decide to sweeten their soft drinks with corn syrup instead of sugar, and then try to export the extra sugar north?
As the United States Congress prepares to vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement next month, Mexico is coming under heavy pressure from American lobbyists, legislators and Government officials to promise in writing that the sugar will not be shipped north. 
 In the balance are a dozen or more members of the House of Representatives who might then be willing to vote for the agreement, possibly insuring its passage.
Mexican soft-drink makers dismiss as unfounded the fears among American sugar producers that, like their counterparts in the United States and other countries, the Mexicans might switch to so-called high fructose sweeteners.
 
No Renegotiation, Mexico Says
 Soft-drink makers in Mexico say that the country's famous sweet tooth is likely to prove more powerful than the incentive they might have to turn from costly refined sugar to the less expensive corn sweeteners.
American sugar producers say, however, that such a switch would enable Mexico to flood the highly protected United States sugar market with the sugar it had left over.
The Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari says it would be unthinkable to renegotiate the trade deal it reached with the United States and Canada more than a year ago. But with the fight over the accord shaping up as a vote-by-vote struggle in which the Clinton Administration admittedly remains behind, some Congressional leaders say a Mexican compromise on the issue could be crucial.
"There are more votes that would come to the agreement if we could do something about sugar than all the other issues combined," said Representative Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican who is a leading supporter of the agreement.
Supporters of the agreement say they do not yet have the 218 votes they need to win its passage. Officials say at least 12 members from Northern states that grow sugar beets and Southern states that grow sugar cane might support the pact if the sugar issue is resolved in their favor.
 
Side Deal Called Possible
 The tussle illustrates how the agreement's fortunes are depending on last-minute deals among lawmakers. Another such deal was made on Wednesday, for instance, when Mexican and American officials announced the creation of a special development bank for small business and other projects along the border to obtain the vote of Representative Esteban E. Torres, the California Democrat who has been pushing for the bank.
Proponents of that deal now hope that Mr. Torres can deliver half a dozen votes for the accord.
Two Mexican officials said that despite their Government's tough public stance against the possibility of revising the agreement, some sort of side deal on sugar might well be in the offing. "You are not going to see it for another couple of weeks, but we are not going to lose everything because of a little problem of sugar," one said.
 
Fears of More Demands
 The danger that Mexican and United States officials see in such a compromise is that it would encourage demands for changes by other American industries that fear Mexican imports, including citrus growers, glass producers and appliance manufacturers.
But the political muscle of American sugar beet and sugar cane producers is legendary, since they have preserved sharp limits on foreign imports that keep American sugar prices high.
Under the terms of the trade accord, the quota of 7,258 metric tons of sugar that Mexico is now allowed to export to the United States would rise to 25,000 tons six years after of the pact goes into effect. The quota would disappear entirely after 15 years.
But the accord says that if Mexico can produce more sugar than it consumes for two consecutive years, it can start shipping as much sugar to the United States as it wants as quickly as seven years after the agreement takes effect.
A wholesale switch to corn sweeteners in Mexican soft drinks would mean under the current terms that Mexico could ship as much sugar north as now enters the United States from the entire rest of the sugar-producing world.
According to a study last fall by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Mexican soft-drink industry used 1.3 million metric tons of sugar in 1991, and the amount continues to grow. The United States sugar quota for all foreign imports this year was 1.2 million metric tons.
In a letter on Tuesday, Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat who is a leader in the Congress on sugar matters, urged Mr. Salinas to accept a formal "clarification" of the trade pact so that Mexico could not export sugar to the United States without actually producing more than it now uses.
And at a meeting with Senator Breaux and House leaders on Friday, at least a dozen representatives indicated that they might vote for the trade pact if such a clarification were made, three people familiar with what happened at the meeting said.
For the moment, Mexico's sugar industry does not appear to be much of a match in the political maneuvering for its American counterpart.
Nearly four years after the Government began selling off its network of sugar mills to private investors, many of the operations are still antiquated and inefficient. Mexico's own sugar imports declined after a bumper harvest this year. But they are expected to rise again next year as stocks are depleted, and to continue rising as the domestic sugar market grows.
Many of the privatized mills went to soft-drink bottlers. That ownership and Mexicans' taste for things sugary, officials say, make it unlikely that soft-drink companies will switch from sugar anytime soon. Mexican soft-drink bottlers generally agree, even though the high-fructose corn sweeteners will get less expensive as the Mexican tariffs on them fall under another provision of the trade pact.
 
Experimenting With Raw Sugar
 In an interview today, Weldon H. Johnson, the president of the Coca-Cola's Latin American Group, said the company's Mexican bottlers were experimenting with a possible switch. But he said it would be from refined sugar to treated raw sugar.
"Our analysis shows that treated raw sugar has the same economics as the high-fructose corn syrup everyone is talking about," he said.
Yet while Mexico agreed in the trade pact to other demands of the American sugar lobby -- most important, Mexico will raise its wholesale sugar prices to American levels -- one Mexican negotiator who spoke on the condition he not be identified said Mexico had fought to keep corn syrup out of the equation. He said that this was done to leave open the possibility that Mexico could export any surplus arising from a switch to corn syrup and that at least one Mexican bottler had explored such a move.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Plans Shift in War on Drug Traffickers

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
The Defense Department announced a modest shift yesterday away from its ineffective and heavily criticized attempts at intercepting drugs to a greater emphasis on helping countries in Latin America attack the major drug trafficking organizations. But drug experts said the change was likely to have little effect on the flow of illegal drugs into the United States.
Brian E. Sheridan, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug Enforcement Policy and Support, said the military planned to cut spending on the interception of drugs, which now accounts for 71 percent of its $1.17 billion anti-drug budget, by 6 to 11 percentage points. It intends to increase spending on training and equipment for countries that grow, refine and export illegal drugs to 16 percent, up by 5 percentage points. 
 The biggest impact on the military's anti-drug programs, which have repeatedly been criticized in Congress and by independent drug experts as among the country's most expensive and least effective anti-drug efforts, is being brought about by Congress.
Pentagon officials said Congress was likely to cut the overall military anti-drug budget by as much as $250 million, or nearly double what the Pentagon had recommended after an internal review.
Some drug experts said the Pentagon shift represented little change from that of the Bush Administration and pointed out that in making the announcement today, the Clinton Administration failed to address the main issue of debate: how much of the proposed $13.1 billion annual drug budget should be devoted to law enforcement and how much to rehabilitation and other health measures.
The Clinton Administration's budget allocates about 65 percent to law enforcement and 35 percent to health measures, or about the same as the last Bush budget. Members of Congress and many drug experts have been urging a substantial increase for treatment, and some have suggested a 50-50 split.
The Administration issued a national drug strategy last week that emphasized health issues. But the strategy was widely criticized by Democrats as well as Republicans and independent experts for not giving any indication of how spending would be apportioned.
Drug experts questioned the fundamental direction of the Pentagon's shift, saying corruption and a lack of enthusiasm for tackling the drug problem in some Latin American countries made putting more money into them an extremely questionable enterprise.
Colombia has been the most cooperative by far in helping the United States achieve its goals in Latin America, they said, and it has focused almost entirely on quelling the domestic violence of drug gangs rather than on trying to destroy their ability to produce and ship drugs.
"They're taking money out of interdiction, which is good" said Peter Reuter, the director of drug policy research at the Rand Corporation. "But they're moving it to an area that I think is even less promising: helping governments that don't want to be helped."
Mr. Reuter characterized the Pentagon's changes as "minor programmatic changes of the kind that go on every year without pronouncement."
 
Futile but Morally Essential
 Rensselaer Lee 3d, a consultant on international drug issues and the author of "White Labyrinth: Cocaine and Political Power," said he regarded attempts at fighting drugs abroad and at intercepting drug shipments as futile but morally essential. "We have to show that we care, that we're taking a stand," he said.
Mr. Sheridan said the assistance to Latin American countries would probably include increases in the number of United States Army Special Forces training teams and perhaps more radar equipment to help the countries track smugglers' planes. Drug Enforcement Administration officials say the radar sites are ineffective and should be shut down.
Mr. Sheridan said the Pentagon also planned to provide more intelligence information to the Latin American governments and to step up assistance in planning anti-drug investigations and raids. He emphasized that American forces would not be accompanying Latin American police and military units on operations.
To cope with a reduced total budget of $900 million to $950 million, Mr. Sheridan said the Defense Department was replacing some of its larger warships -- cruisers and destroyers -- on patrol in the Caribbean with smaller vessels that had been used to monitor Soviet submarines.

HEADLINE: A Verdict on Kevorkian: Their Kind of Neighbor

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROYAL OAK, Mich., Oct. 27

 BODY:
Most everyone here in his hometown seems to like the man they call Dr. Death, Jack Kevorkian, the thoughtful, neighborly retired pathologist.
He got the nickname decades ago as an iconoclastic medical resident interested in unusual experimentation. But its current connotation of necromantic celebrity is rooted in his more recent mercy-suicide crusade, which, his neighbors are noting, he dared to bring right into his own small walk-up apartment last week in helping a sick and agonized woman from Ann Arbor kill herself right there, next to Mr. B's Pub on South Main Street. 
 "I'm definitely for it, but we have to discuss this issue better," said Carroll Harris, the concerned manager of Mr. B's busy, yuppie restaurant scene, who watched the coroner's workers carry out 72-year-old Merian R. Frederick in a body bag, the 19th suffering patient to be assisted to die by Dr. Kevorkian since 1990. "We shouldn't have a woman who goes into his apartment to die with a million reporters around the building. She could have died in a hospital with dignity."
Other neighbors, even in fondly supporting the 65-year-old ascetically styled doctor, complain of his "bizarre" flair for lethal Rube Goldberg devices and for sometimes seedy surroundings in his one-man crusade, particularly the 20-year-old Volkswagen van used as the site for fatal events until it was seized as evidence.
 
No Debating the Dignity
 But inside Dr. Kevorkian's simple apartment last week, there was no debating the dignity of the event of Mrs. Frederick's parting in the eyes of the Rev. Ken Phifer, who knew her well across 14 years and counseled and supported her in her final decision, attending his parishioner to the end.
"My experience is when people have reached a certain point of desperation, the surroundings are of no moment at all to them; they matter only to survivors," he said, describing a long and painful siege of neural degeneration suffered by Mrs. Frederick, his friend and parish leader at the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Ann Arbor.
Without disclosing details of the case, subject now to criminal investigation, the minister stressed that Dr. Kevorkian had supplied merely a "technical dimension" to the woman's own careful, heartfelt spiritual decision that, deprived of speech and mobility by the painful Lou Gehrig's disease, she could choose to end her life.
 
Not Subtle Enough?
 Here on South Main Street, Dr. Kevorkian is described as a simple, friendly figure of a neighbor and a visionary of sorts. His style is more debated than is his goal of suicide assistance.
"He kind of rubs it in your face," said Jesse Cundiff, a sympathizer nonetheless and a 53-year native of this Detroit suburb, where a boom of youth-focused economic resurgence has made it California-looking with cappuccino bars and boutiques along South Main Street. This coincidental touch of Bohemia does little harm to Dr. Kevorkian's pursuit of his cause in the name of evolutionary self-determination.
"But if he would be kind of subtle, I don't think he would have all this trouble," Mr. Cundiff said of pending charges and investigations. It is a legal mare's nest in which prosecutors in the adjoining jurisdictions of Wayne and Oakland Counties are proceeding, respectively, with considerable philosophical reservation in some killings and decided zeal in others, under a new state law tailored by frustrated, perplexed critics to stop Dr. Kevorkian. The new law forbids physician-assisted suicide and provides for a four-year prison term.
With at least three cases pending under the new law, the suicide crusader, whose medical license has already been revoked, seems finally heading for some climactic court confrontation and possible jail time, perhaps within days. Characteristically, he is welcoming this as a new chance to dramatize his cause.
 
Critics See Quirks
 "This is what I have waited for," he exulted at this possible climax after Mrs. Frederick's death. He has since fallen silent as his lawyer, Geoffrey N. Fieger, pursues court stratagems.
As they attempt to bring him to ground, critics contend there has long been a quirkiness to Dr. Kevorkian's career. They focus on some of his earlier proposals to do medical experiments on condemned prisoners at the time of execution, to see widespread transplant of their organs and to make use of fresh cadaver blood on the battlefield. But Dr. Kevorkian's many friends here mark him as one of a kind and right on course in a crusade that reflects his own taste for nonconformity amid life's impingements.
"We all love him at the library," said Lori Boden, a worker at the Royal Oak public library that Dr. Kevorkian frequents a block east of his apartment.
She said the memory of the death agony of her own mother to leukemia, with conventional medical techniques at a loss to help, made a mockery of the criticism of the doctor's unconventionality.
 
Survivors Are Grateful
 Survivors of the people Dr. Kevorkian assisted echo this, saying the only dignity worth anything to a dying person is the retention of volition, however terminal, and the cessation of pointless agony. "Jack is very aware of people's status, their suffering and dignity," insisted Heidi Fernandez, whose fiance, Thomas Hyde, died with Dr. Kevorkian's assistance in August after he was rapidly muted to a life of paralysis and pain by Lou Gehrig's disease.
"I loved Tom so, and didn't want him to go," Ms. Fernandez said. "But when the writing's on the wall, if someone makes a decision to end a life of pain and suffering, I don't see what the big problem is."
Opinion polls suggest that almost two-thirds of the public might accept well-regulated physician-assisted suicide. "Yeah, but I think there's an element of 'yes, but not in my town,' " said Donald J. Walby, the owner of a local paint store who likes his neighbor, Dr. Kevorkian, but does not appreciate the notoriety he brings to Royal Oak.
"Having the latest one die right upstairs in his own apartment -- that was really pressing the issue," said Mr. Walby, who has been in business since 1936 and readily admits personal affection for Dr. Kevorkian.
 
Doesn't Mind the Jokes
 Friends say Dr. Kevorkian is plain enough to enjoy some of the many jokes about his grim dealings. "He laughed when I told him about the Dr. Kevorkian doll," said Dawn Haselhuhn, founder of a group of local supporters she says can gather by the scores at a moment's notice to counter-balance outside protesters. "You pull the doll's string and it passes gas to you," Ms. Haselhuhn said, referring to Dr. Kevorkian's relying lately on carbon monoxide inhalation devices as his terminal technique.
Ms. Fernandez, who made the issue her own public advocacy cause after the death of Mr. Hyde, her fiance, said Dr. Kevorkian was embarrassed when she praised him "as the Thomas Edison of medicine." He once described himself thusly: "When they call me a pioneer they're wrong. I'm a person at the right time when the mores are changing."
Proponents are pleading with society to look beyond the immediate circumstances of his style and focus on the principle he is raising. "Look, every time I think of wheeling my Tom up to that crusty old V.W. van of Jack's, I could croak," Ms. Fernandez said, recalling the death of her man inside the tattered vehicle. 'But I still know that it doesn't detract one bit from the final peace Tom sought and got with Jack's help."

GRAPHIC: Photo: "We shouldn't have a woman who goes into his apartment to die with a million reporters around the building," said Carroll Harris, the manager of Mr. B's restaurant, who watched coroner workers carry Merian R.

HEADLINE: ISRAEL SEEKS DEAL WITH QATAR ON GAS

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Israeli officials say they have held secret negotiations with the tiny Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar on a multibillion-dollar project to bring natural gas to Israel and then export it across the Mediterranean to Europe.
The officials say they could sign an agreement by early December. But Qatar's Oil Minister denied today that a deal was in the making, calling reports of an imminent breakthrough "unrealistic and based on illogical assumption." The Qatari news agency quoted him as saying economic relations are not possible while the Arab boycott against Israel remains intact. 
 While it was not clear through the thicket of contradictory statements whether a deal was on or off, there was little doubt that the Israelis have had contacts with representatives of a land that, like most Arab countries, had been off-limits to them for decades.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met secretly with his Qatari counterpart in New York last month, and several weeks ago an official from Mr. Peres's ministry went to Qatar to discuss economic and political relations. In addition, Energy Minister Moshe Shahal is reported to have met in Israel with a group of Qatari energy specialists and businessmen, one of three such delegations that came here last month.
 
Contacts With Arabs Expand
 Israel's contacts with the Muslim world in general have expanded in the six weeks since it signed an agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization on introducing Palestinian self-rule to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Right after the signing ceremony, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made the first public visit by an Israeli leader to Morocco, and two weeks ago he capped a trip to China with a surprise stopover in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country. That same week, Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin became the highest-ranking Israeli official to visit Tunisia.
While none of those contacts have led to formal relations, they suggest to Israeli officials that genuine change is in the air and that diplomatic and business links with Arab countries, once unthinkable, are now at least imaginable and perhaps within reach.
The project under discussion with Qatar, the Israelis say, would involve shipping liquefied natural gas in tankers from the Persian Gulf to the southern Israeli port of Eilat, on the Gulf of Aqaba. Gas would then be carried by a still-to-be-built pipeline from Eilat to an Israeli port on the Mediterranean, either Ashdod or Ashkelon, and from there much of it would be exported to Europe by way of still another pipeline that would be constructed under the Mediterranean to Greece.
The fate of the project, officials here say, depends on feasibility studies that are in progress and that they say are being paid for by Qatar, whose 250,000 people have one of the world's highest per capita incomes because of oil and gas revenues.
Mr. Shahal said several days ago that Israel would soon sign a natural-gas contract with a Persian Gulf country. He did not identify the country, but other officials said that it was Qatar and that an agreement was expected by the first week or two of December. They put the cost of the project at $2 billion or more, and said it would supply Israel with gas for 25 years.
 
Effect of Remarks Feared
 After Mr. Shahal spoke out on Israel's negotiations in the Persian Gulf, other officials here expressed concern that his public remarks may have killed the hoped-for deal with Qatar. An article today in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot said that, indeed, the Qataris had gone back on their intention to sign an agreement.
But the remarks attributed to the Qatari Oil Minister, Abdallah Bin Hamad Alattiya, suggested that a joint venture with Israel was never realistic. Other Arab oil officials also dismissed the project as prohibitively expensive and improbable both technically and politically, given Qatar's size and need to follow the lead of much larger gulf governments like Saudi Arabia and Iran.
"It's one of these euphoric thoughts that went along with the making of the peace process in the Middle East, not a real project," said an Arab oil minister who did not want to be identified.
Despite these demurrals, Israeli officials insisted that the project was real and could still be carried out.

HEADLINE: Trial Begins in Berlin for Iranian Charged in Dissident's Death

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, Oct. 28

 BODY:
A reputed agent of the Iranian secret police and four accused accomplices went on trial today for the murder of a leading Iranian dissident last year.
Federal prosecutors say Iran ordered the killing of the dissident, Sadegh Sharafkandi, who with three aides was cut down in a hail of gunfire at a Berlin restaurant. A guilty verdict would be a triumph for political and human rights groups that have charged Iran with sponsoring an international terror campaign against its opponents. 
 Since 1987, more than a dozen opponents of the Iranian Government have been murdered in European cities. The trial that opened in Berlin today was the first case in which alleged killers have been charged with having acted on orders from Teheran.
Iran has denied involvement in the killings.
The trial opened against the background of growing controversy over a visit by the chief of the Iranian secret service, Ali Fallahian, to Bonn this month. American and British officials publicly criticized Germany for receiving Mr. Fallahian, and several members of Parliament are demanding an investigation of contacts between the German and Iranian secret services.
 
Predecessor Also Slain
 In the trial that opened today, prosecutors have accused Kazem Darabi, a 34-year-old Iranian who has lived in Berlin since 1980, of hiring four Lebanese to help him kill Mr. Sharafkandi, who was secretary general of the Iranian Democratic Party of Kurdistan. Mr. Sharafkandi's predecessor was shot to death in Vienna in 1989.
The case had already attracted international attention because of prosecutors' efforts to link the killers directly to the Iranian Government, but it took another twist with Mr. Fallahian's arrival in Bonn three weeks ago. He was received there by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's principal adviser on secret services, Bernd Schmidbauer.
Their meeting provoked a series of angry newspaper editorials and speeches by members of Parliament, as well as unusually direct criticism from Washington and London. Critics said that Germany seemed to be negotiating with a man widely viewed as a dangerous world terrorist.
According to reports in the German press, Mr. Fallahian and Mr. Schmidbauer may have discussed a deal under which the accused killers now on trial in Berlin would be freed or given lenient treatment. In exchange, the Iranians were said to have offered to free several Germans being held in Iran.
 
Israeli Flier Also Mentioned
 Some accounts said Mr. Fallahian had also raised the possibility of releasing Ron Arad, an Israeli air force navigator believed to be held by pro-Iranian forces in Lebanon, and lifting the death sentence issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and confirmed by the present Iranian Government against the novelist Salman Rushdie.
Upon his return to Teheran, according to the Iranian news agency IRNA, Mr. Fallahian expressed "satisfaction on the current information cooperation between Iran and Germany." Two days later, a leading German businessman in Iran, Gerhard Bachmann, was arrested and charged with espionage and other crimes.
At a news conference in Bonn today, members of the German and European Parliaments called for Mr. Schmidbauer's resignation. They said his meeting with Mr. Fallahian violated a European Community ruling that no member should improve its ties to Iran until the death sentence against Mr. Rushdie was lifted.
 
Criticism Rebuffed
 Mr. Schmidbauer, who visited Iran last year, has refused to give details of his meeting with Mr. Fallahian.
"The Government intends to continue holding humanitarian talks with Iran within the framework of a critical exchange of opinions, despite unjustified criticism," Mr. Schmidbauer said. He said Iran "wants to cooperate with Germany on disarmament and against drug trafficking and terrorism."
A senior federal law enforcement official, Volker Foertsch, last week confirmed reports that the German and Iranian secret services had cooperated in the past.
Germany is by far Iran's largest trading partner. German companies sold more than $5 billion worth of goods and services in Iran last year, and the Government has sought to maintain good ties with Iranian leaders.
"The mullahs have identified Germany as the weak member of the Western alliance," asserted Jamshid Watandoust, an Iranian exile leader who lives here. "They see Germany as an economic giant and political dwarf that is willing to do anything that will mean more business."

HEADLINE: Campaign Waltz May Cost County Executive, Critics Say

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Andrew P. O'Rourke appears to be waltzing toward the close of his re-election campaign, sometimes literally so.
The other day the Westchester County Executive, a burly, silver-haired grandfather who projects a cultivated affability, showed up at a Golden Harvest Dance for 1,000 elderly people and waltzed and tangoed a half-dozen women across the floor to Swing Era tunes like "Sentimental Journey." With a carefree air, he showed off the terpsichorean wiles his four sisters taught him when they were growing up on welfare in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen and aspired toward what Mr. O'Rourke calls "polite society." 
 His Cheshire-cat grin bespoke a man who believes he has not been badly bruised in this campaign because he feels most voters think he has managed the county well and kept their taxes stable. But his Democratic critics say that self-confidence masks an inattentiveness and inertia that will cost Mr. O'Rourke dearly on Election Day.
Richard L. Brodsky, his 47-year-old Democratic challenger, argues that property taxes have more than doubled during 11 years of O'Rourke rule, that Mr. O'Rourke has wasted money on patronage and sweetheart deals for Republicans and that he has been idle while the county's economy lost 40,000 jobs. He says Mr. O'Rourke is running this year only because he lost a promised Federal judgeship with the election of a Democratic President.
Still, Mr. Brodsky's battle remains uphill because Mr. O'Rourke has the advantage of running affluent Westchester, a place that most residents consider congenial for raising families and where county government seems to get little of their scrutiny. Mr. O'Rourke is also an incumbent in a place where television's preoccupation with the politics of New York City makes it difficult for challengers to become known.
 
Charm and a Sense of Humor
 Mr. Brodsky has suggested the county's attractiveness can blind residents to their leaders' peccadilloes, arguing in a recent debate that Westchester remains livable "in spite of its government, not because of its government." But Mr. O'Rourke blithely retorted: "It's a great place because you have a great county government."
Charm is one of Mr. O'Rourke's greatest assets, supporters and opponents agree. His humor is more self-effacing than vindictive. He has a quiverful of disarming anecdotes. And he falls back on a childlike puzzlement when anyone accuses him of wrongdoing. He avoids harsh personal attacks, sharpening the contrast with Mr. Brodsky's flinty edge.
Some, like Alfred B. DelBello, Mr. O'Rourke's Democratic predecessor and fellow alumnus of Yonkers politics, think Mr. O'Rourke is too much the showman.
"Andy likes politics and likes the public aspect of it, but he never did like and doesn't apply himself to the job of administrator," he said.
With Democrats boasting a 23,500 edge in registration, Mr. O'Rourke must win over moderate and conservative Democrats, the kind who voted for a Republican like Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
"Andy's record appeals to them because they're concerned about welfare, crime, taxes and spending," said Peter W. Delaney, Mr. O'Rourke's campaign manager.
Indeed, Dr. Anthony Cupaiuolo, director of the Michaelian Institute for Public Policy and Management at Pace University, detects a reluctance on Mr. O'Rourke's part to emphasize his Republican affiliation just as he detects an effort by Mr. Brodsky, in this staid county, to sidestep traditional Democratic positions.
 
Stricter Welfare Rules
 Mr. O'Rourke and even opponents like Mr. DelBello rank a toughening in the county's welfare procedures as perhaps Mr. O'Rourke's most signal accomplishment. Mr. O'Rourke says that by compelling recipients to work or learn skills and monitoring their diligence, he has saved the county millions of dollars and put 2,600 people to work in the last year. The number of aid-to-dependent-children cases is expected to rise, however, from 11,751 in 1992 to a projected 13,490 next year although the number of home relief cases is expected to fall from 6,513 to 5,497.
Mr. Brodsky argues that Mr. O'Rourke is taking credit for a welfare revisions mandated by the state, and more liberal critics say Mr. O'Rourke has hardened the lives of deserving poor. But Mr. O'Rourke, citing his own welfare background after his widowed mother became blind, argues that his motives have been compassionate.
"It's an uncomfortable feeling to be on the public dole, and from a human feeling we should get people off," he said.
 
The Housing Issue
 He has proceeded somewhat more gingerly on the more explosive issue of housing for low- and moderate-income families, with the specter it raises for some white suburbanites of an influx of poor minorities and urban-style problems.
"I'm not here to integrate communities," Mr. O'Rourke said in an interview. "I'm here to build affordable housing. People understand we're getting more minorities in Westchester. They must be taken care of, and the basic right of any citizen is a decent place in which to live."
Mr. O'Rourke, who beat Mr. Brodsky by 6 percentage points four years ago and dismisses him as a hack politician, is trying to convince voters that he has kept the faith by stabilizing taxes for the last two years and through next year.
 
Moral Backbone Questioned
 But his critics say he does not have the moral spine required of a leader given a $1.2 billion budget and 10,000 people to manage. Mr. O'Rourke has admitted that he recommended the woman he lives with, Flora Lowe, for a job with the county's health insurer and that he asked officials of the medical school that runs the county hospital to seek a doctor's slot for his son-in-law and a school admission for his daughter Alice.
This week Mr. O'Rourke lost the endorsements of the editorial pages of The New York Times and Gannett Suburban Newspapers, both of which backed him in 1989. Voters, the Gannett chain said, no longer tolerate "in-your face patronage and cynical influence peddling."
Mr. O'Rourke took the news with the same cheery mien that he seems to lose only when opponents attack his personal life. "Thank you for being here on my birthday," he told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday, his 60th birthday. "I already got a singing telegram from Gannett."
A graduate of Fordham University's law school, Mr. O'Rourke ambled into politics as a fledgling Yonkers lawyer looking for clients. He chose a Republican club, he once said, because it had regular meetings and the Democrats did not.
He started out as a Yonkers councilman, moved up to the county legislature and was chairman of that Republican-dominated body when Mr. DelBello was elected lieutenant governor in 1982 and the county legislature got to pick a successor -- Mr. O'Rourke. Outside that office, the highlight of his career was a quixotic bid for governor in 1986.
In the heady days of the mid-1980's, Mr. O'Rourke spent liberally, and property taxes have risen from $147 million in 1983 to $329 million this year, a 124 percent increase. A not insignificant share of that increase was spent on housing the county's exploding homeless population, which stands at 3,300.
Mr. O'Rourke also rebuilt the county's civic center, expanded its airport and medical center, built a new jail and recycling center, and created such amenities as a bus system that daily transports 400 disabled people to doctors or shopping centers.
He says that by avoiding deficits he has retained Westchester's AAA bond rating, and he takes credit for keeping unemployment at 5.7 percent during a recession in the Northeast. He shrugs off accusations of ethical blindness, pointing out that District Attorney Carl A. Vergari found he had broken no laws.
"The whole thing I went through proves that I never took advantage of the public trust," Mr. O'Rourke said.
Mr. O'Rourke has three grown children by his wife, Alice, from whom he has been separated since 1987. As painful as the hiring disclosures was the scrutiny of his family life. The separation from his wife, he had to confide, so alienated his daughters that he was not even aware that one, Aileen, was working for a law firm doing county business.
He is an aficionado of military history and, while in office, wrote two adventure novels, "The Red Banner Mutiny" and "Hawkwood," both published by Bantam Books.
"I think most people think the government is running well," he says. "And if they think it's not, then it's time for a change."

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Jobless Aid But Attaches Two Conditions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The Senate voted today to renew a two-year-old program that grants up to 13 extra weeks of checks to jobless workers who exhaust their normal unemployment benefits. But the Senate did so only after tacking conditions to the renewal that confounded its prospects in the House.
The measure now goes to a House-Senate conference, where lawmakers from both chambers will try to agree on a version of the bill that each side can pass and send to the White House. 
 No new recipients have been added to the emergency unemployment benefits program since it expired on Oct. 2, and none can be added until the House and Senate reach agreement.
Unemployed workers are normally entitled to six months of benefits, and about 60,000 people exhaust those 26 weeks of checks every month.
 
Threats of Filibuster
 Congress voted an emergency extension of that 26-week period in November 1991, and has renewed the extra benefits three times since. The bill now before Congress would prolong the emergency program of additional benefits for four months, to next February, at a cost of $1.1 billion.
Lawmakers in both parties generally say they support the four-month extension, but Republicans have balked at its generosity and at the Democrats' unwillingness to pay for it by making cuts elsewhere in the 1994 budget. The House passed a version of the extension last week, but the Senate's first attempt to pass it, on Wednesday, was strangled by Republican threats of a filibuster.
Today, the Senate voted, 76 to 20, to approve the bill, but only after Republicans attached two amendments.
 
Federal Job Cuts
 The first amendment, proposed by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, and approved by 82 to 14, would carve into law a White House proposal to reduce the Federal workforce by 252,000 employees.
The second amendment, sponsored by Senator Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, would deny additional unemployment checks to any jobless worker who reported a taxable income last year of more than $120,000. It passed by a vote of 52 to 43.
By any Federal yardstick, the effect of that proposal would be minuscule, denying benefits only to about 26,500 workers and saving the Government about $2 million. But it sticks in the craw of many Democrats, to whom unemployment checks are a benefit that should be available to everyone.
The bill would grant an additional seven weeks of unemployment benefits to jobless workers in every state with an unemployment rate below 9 percent. In states with jobless rates above 9 percent workers would receive an extra 13 weeks of benefits.

HEADLINE: U.S. Judge Rules Council Lines In Bridgeport Violate Rights Act

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Less than a week before Election Day, a Federal judge has ruled that a Bridgeport City Council district map drawn this year violates the Federal Voting Rights Act and the United States Constitution and must be redrafted.
The judge ordered that municipal elections proceed next Tuesday, to avoid throwing the city government into chaos, but established strict timetable requiring a new map within 60 days, and a special election within 120 days to replace the winners of next week's contests. 
 The judge, Peter C. Dorsey, ruling in a case filed by the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union and the N.A.A.C.P., said that although black and Hispanic residents represent more than 50 percent of Bridgeport's population, council district lines have diluted minority voting strength by dividing neighborhoods. The 20-member council has 4 black members and 1 Hispanic member.
 
Intent Doesn't Matter
 "The issue is not whether a discriminatory purpose caused the present districts," Judge Dorsey said in his order. But the facts, he said, are undisputable. "The white predominance in Bridgeport elections has continued."
Lawyers for the two groups said it was the first case ever filed in Connecticut using the Voting Rights Act, which has primarily been used in the South to increase black representation. They said that the decision, while it sets no precedents for other jurisdictions, will probably be used to pressure other Connecticut cities, including New London and Meriden, in a state in which minorities are said to be underrepresented.
"It is our intention to try and bring more of these challenges in Connecticut," said Samuel L. Walters, an assistant general counsel to the N.A.A.C.P., which has filed previous suits in New York under the Voting Rights Act, including a case under way in the town of Niagara Falls.
For Connecticut's largest city, Judge Dorsey's order, signed on Wednesday, is just one more travail. In recent years the city has brushed with bankruptcy, battled drug gangs, and tried without success to bring in casino gambling to rebuild the economy.
The City Attorney, Mark T. Anastasi, said it was a victory that elections would take place at all, and said that no decision about an appeal or any other action would be made until after Election Day. But other local and state officials said the deadlines might be impossible to meet.
The 20 City Council members elected next week will be inaugurated on Dec. 1, almost 30 days into the 60-day period for drawing a new map. Several Council members said today that they thought that only the districts changed by the new map would have to hold special elections, a prospect that could complicate negotiations further as new members battle to retain their district lines to avoid having to run again.
"It cannot be done in this timetable," said State Senator Alvin W. Penn, a former councilman who now represents the city in Hartford. "There are too many questions."
 
5 New Districts
 Judge Dorsey, without specifying how it should be done, ordered the city to create two new districts in which a majority of the voters are black, two new districts with a Hispanic majority and one in which the total of black and Hispanic voters constitutes a majority.
One white council member, Michael J. Marella Jr., whose district was changed this year to include more blacks, said he was not thinking past Tuesday.
"We'll just keep going, then we'll take the bull by the horns and see what happens after that," he said. In any case, he said he believed there could be a silver lining for some candidates next Tuesday.
"If they lose, this gives them an opportunity to run again," he said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Cox to Form a Tiger Fund

 BODY:
Archibald Cox Jr., former chief of CS First Boston, said yesterday that he had joined the Tiger Management Corporation, where he will be head of a new fund investing in companies in China, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.
As chairman of the new Tiger International Fund, Mr. Cox will start by helping raise money from investors and be responsible for investing up to $1 billion in companies in those markets. He plans to live in Hong Kong to be close to China, the fund's major field of operations. Tiger International will invest directly in companies and projects for which there is no way of investing through publicly traded stocks or bonds. 
 "In these markets it is hard to find enough publicly traded stocks to invest large amounts of money," said John A. Griffin, president of Tiger Management. "You could readily invest $100 million in a power plant or container port in China, but to buy $100 million of stock in China is impossible. Their capital markets are not yet developed enough."
Despite the lack of well developed markets, Mr. Cox said he was confident that "Asia will be the place of greatest economic growth and best performing markets in the 1990's."
He declined to say whether the new fund might match the 32 percent annual return posted by the Tiger Management Corporation since 1980, but added, "We would not be doing it if we did not think that there will be exceptional returns which would be hard to achieve through normal portfolio investments in Western Europe or the United States."
Mr. Cox said the fund expects generally to have partners, including local partners, in its investments. These could take several years to bear fruit, but will not be limited to long-term infrastructure projects.
The new venture comes three months after Mr. Cox resigned as chief executive at First Boston, which he joined in 1990.

HEADLINE: Developer Wins Project To Revitalize Atlantic City

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The company that has developed such urban centers as Harborplace in Baltimore and the South Street Seaport in New York today won the nod to turn 20 square blocks of this shabby resort city into a $520 million hotel-retail-entertainment complex.
The selection of the Rouse Company of Columbia, Md., is a step toward making the city less dependent on its casinos and developing it as a broader vacation and convention destination. The choice of Rouse still must be ratified by the board of directors of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority at a meeting scheduled for Nov. 8. 
 The first part of the effort to build a tourist corridor to link the Boardwalk with downtown Atlantic City will include a non-casino hotel run by Doubletree Hotels Corporation with financing by Caesars Boardwalk Regency Corporation. The hotel would serve as the flagship for a new $254 million convention center.
"This urban entertainment center is designed to attract family and non-gaming tourists to Atlantic City and create year-round attractions for both domestic and international visitors," said Nicholas Amato, head of the development authority.
 
7,500 Jobs Foreseen
 The corridor project, which Mr. Amato said would create about 1,500 permanent jobs and 6,000 construction jobs, is also expected to include a multimedia entertainment center, restaurants and local and national retail stores.
"There are those around who say, 'What's going to happen to Atlantic City?' This is our answer," Mayor James Whelan said.
Rouse officials said today that the company, which has assets worth $4 billion, is committed to using local workers, vendors and developers throughout the estimated five-year project.
Bob Minutoli, Rouse senior vice president, said the company also had a strong commitment to affirmative action, and would exceed state and local mandates for using minority- and women-owned companies.
The project will be financed partly with bonds from the development authority, which collects 1.25 percent of gross casino revenues for development projects statewide, revenue from the $2 casino parking fee and contributions from other state agencies, said Dennis Lower, the authority's associate deputy director.
The balance, about $270 million, is to come from the sale of private bonds. Doubletree and Caesars were leveraging $35 million to bring $50 million to the project, Mr. Lower said.

HEADLINE: Fairchild Plans to Convert Plant Into a Shopping Mall

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST FARMINGDALE, L.I., Oct. 28

 BODY:
The Fairchild Corporation announced plans today to redevelop the abandoned 80-acre aircraft plant from which thousands of fighter planes rolled off the assembly line during World War II. The company described it as one of the largest military conversion projects on Long Island.
The cavernous hangars, loading docks and graffiti-covered office complex will be torn down and replaced by a shopping mall with three major retailers and scores of specialty stores. 
 The Fairchild plant, once one of Long Island's biggest factories with 5,000 employees, is in the center of the Island on Route 110, a busy industrial-commercial corridor running along the Suffolk-Nassau border. The plant closed in 1983.
The project will cost between $80 million and $100 million, and the money will come from Fairchild, said Jeffrey J. Steiner, chairman and chief executive of the multinational corporation, which has worldwide real estate and manufacturing interests and annual sales of $1.5 billion.
Mr. Steiner, who announced the plans in Hangar 17, the size of three football fields, said he hoped not only to generate thousands of construction and retail jobs, but also to generate taxes for the Town of Babylon and Suffolk County.
Environmental problems that have blocked past development efforts on the old industrial site apparently have been resolved, said Richard H. Schaffer, supervisor of the Town of Babylon. He said an agreement between Fairchild, Babylon and New York State would allow Fairchild to designate an area in the southeast corner of the property as a state Superfund cleanup site, with Fairchild assuming responsibility for the cleanup.
Mr. Steiner said Fairchild had chosen Peter L. Levine, commissioner of the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey and president of Levcom, which specializes in building and operating shopping centers, as the developer of the Fairchild project.
"This old plant represents what's great about this county, while at the same time what's hurting the country," Mr. Levine said. "It was once a place of great pride and should be again."
He described the 80 acres as "the finest available, large site in all of Long Island."
"It sits in the center of the Nassau-Suffolk market place, and from a demographics viewpoint, is strong," he said. Levcom and Fairchild officials hope that an economic upsurge in the late 1990's will enable industrial development on the other half of the Fairchild site, with an emphasis on research and development.
Most World War II pilots learned to fly using Fairchild's single-engine trainer, the PT-19. Many Air Force pilots then flew Fairchild's P-43 and P-47 single-engine fighter planes. From 1950 to 1954, Fairchild produced the F-84 Thunderjet, a single-engine fighter, followed by the F-105, and most recently the A-10, an air-support craft used during the Persian Gulf war.

XEROX CORP. (N)

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation said yesterday that third-quarter net income rose 24 percent, exceeding the expectations of industry analysts and buoying the company's shares.
Xerox stock rose $5.75, to $76.375, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. 
 Xerox shares had declined slightly earlier in the week, as analysts said investors anticipated the company's third-quarter results would be as lackluster as in the first half, when slow economies and a reorganization of its sales force cut into profits.
Instead, Xerox said its earnings had improved as equipment sales increased after two quarters of decline. A cost-cutting drive trimmed expenses by $72 million in the period. Those cuts included 600 more jobs, trimming employment at the company, based in Stamford, Conn., by 1,800 since Jan. 1. Xerox's domestic employees account for about half the company's global work force of 97,500.
"The company had a bang-up third quarter, a quarter which should have been a problem," said B. Alex Henderson, an imaging analyst at Prudential Securities.
Mr. Henderson had expected Xerox to show a 20 percent decline in operating profits and a 3 percent decline in revenue in the period, because of the company's exposure to currency fluctuations and poor sales in Europe.
In Brazil, where Xerox sold $1 billion worth of products like copiers and printers last year, high inflation led to a foreign exchange loss of $55 million in the period. In the comparable period a year ago, Xerox had no Brazilian currency charges.
"For the balance of the year, the European and Brazilian economic environments will remain difficult, and competitive pricing and currency will continue to put pressure on earnings," Paul A. Allaire, the chairman and chief executive of Xerox, said in a statement yesterday.
To focus on its document processing business, Xerox has over the last year sold pieces of its financial services business. Its insurance operations are on the block now.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Rally Is Cut Short In Selloff by Europe's Banks

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar retreated against most currencies yesterday after selling by European central banks ended an early rally.
In late trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6740 German marks, down from 1.6800 marks on Wednesday. It also fell to 108.17 Japanese yen, from 108.69 yen. 
 Gold prices slipped. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery fell 50 cents, to $370.20 an ounce.
The dollar rallied early yesterday after the Commerce Department released its preliminary estimate showing United States third-quarter gross domestic product rose by 2.8 percent. Excluding the effect of flooding in the Midwest and droughts in the Southwestern United States, the G.D.P. would have grown by 3.4 percent in the quarter, the report said.
Even though the report was in line with expectations, dealers took the news as a confirmation of the new, rosier view of the United States economy and a good reason to buy dollars.
"The figures were pretty much as we, and the market, expected and on the whole you could not ask for a better set of numbers," said Jane Edwards, an international economist at Lehman Brothers in London.
But the dollar's rally was short-lived, a result dealers blamed on the aggressive sales of dollars for marks by the Bundesbank of Germany and other European central banks.
 
Shoring Up Reserves
 Several European central banks, most notably the Bank of France, still must pay back to the Bundesbank the marks used in early August to buy local currencies that tumbled after the European Monetary System was rejiggered.
The Bundesbank also may have bought marks to shore up its own reserves, but dealers speculated that the bank may have been concerned about the mark's weakness against the dollar after cuts in German interest rates last week.
The dollar also eased against the yen in late trading in New York, but ended above the lows touched in Tokyo after the American economist C. Fred Bergsten set off panic selling when he said United States policy favored a dollar at 100 to 110 yen.
"The market in Tokyo is much more sensitive to it," Belal Khan, a senior dealer at the Bank of Tokyo in New York, said of Mr. Bergsten's comments. United States dealers said it was unclear how much influence Mr. Bergsten, who is the director of the private Institute for Internatinal Economics, had with the White House.
The British pound finished in New York at $1.4895, up from $1.4805 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A ski resort company is poised to benefit from a sport's rebound.

BYLINE: By Robert Hurtado

 BODY:
DESPITE a recent rejuvenation of the ski business, there are still many resorts that face hard times and are considered prime acquisition candidates for the stronger operators. And few resorts are liquid enough to take advantage of the rich opportunities.
According to some Wall Street professionals, investors angling to profit from this should consider an enterprise like S-K-I Ltd., a publicly traded company in Killington, Vt., that has deep enough pockets to do some buying. 
 "The ski industry has recovered from a spate of unusually mild winters and the recent recession, which combined to stall growth," Robert Mains, an analyst with the First Albany Corporation, said. "Cash-strapped and teetering on bankruptcy, some financially weaker ski resorts will sell out to the better capitalized operators who are poised to make attractively priced acquisitions in this period of industry consolidation."
Industry experts said operators of ski resorts shared many of the same headaches of real estate investors who bought properties in the late 1980's at heavily marked-up prices and now cannot make ends meet. It did not help that the Japanese, in their quest to own prime American real estate, bought at least six big ski resorts and helped to drive up property values.
Declining property values have wiped out investors' equity, and in some cases put the debt obligations of these owners at a premium to the value of the resort. The cash flows from the ski resorts never materialized, making it nearly impossible to service the debt. "These are the conditions that lead to fire sales," Mr. Beja said.
Financially strong and cash rich, S-K-I Ltd. is viewed by some market players as a natural beneficiary of any industry consolidation. The company operates three ski areas, Killington and Mount Snow in Vermont and Bear Mountain in California, and is well regarded in the industry for its ability to take on new properties and enhance their value, according to some analysts.
David M. Basoco, an analyst with Chesapeake Research, said that by any valuation, the stock appeared cheap, since it had been trading at less than 13 times this year's earnings estimate.
Conditions are clearly improving for acquisitions. Indeed, S-K-I last week signed a purchase agreement with a small resort adjacent to its Killington property. But the company has not acquired a big property since 1988, when it bought the California operation.
The company said recently that over the longer term, it would pursue opportunities to add diversity to its revenue base and reinforce profit margins, and it was ready to take advantage of those opportunities when they emerged.
Joel Tillinghast, a portfolio manager with Fidelity Investments in Boston, said he favored S-K-I on the fundamentals.
"Management has done an excellent job of making money rather consistently in a business that is highly seasonal and weather dependent," he said. He pointed to S-K-I's ability to stay in the black in the bad years, as well as the good, chalking up 33 years of profitability in the process. Over the last 20 years, the company has recorded 16 percent compounded growth in equity and 15 percent compounded revenue growth.
One trick to its success has been to reduce its dependency on natural snow by manufacturing its own. To maintain its competitive edge, S-K-I has upgraded its ski operations with spending on new chairlifts, improved trails and other amenities.
At the same time, it has always been strong on cost control. Variable costs, like a part-time staff, are monitored and adjusted to remain synchronized with the business conditions.
For the fiscal year that ended on July 31, S-K-I reported earnings of 77 cents a share, on revenues of $98 million, compared with 65 cents a share, on revenues of $89 million a year ago. Value Line expects the company to earn about 90 cents a share in fiscal 1994.
S-K-I stock fell 50 cents, to $12.25, in Nasdaq trading yesterday.

The Taylor, In Wedding Of Darkness And Light

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Paul Taylor is famous for bright-looking dances with a dark underside. But Mr. Taylor has never merged the two quite so inseparably as in "A Field of Grass," presented by the Paul Taylor Dance Company in a world premiere on Wednesday night at City Center. An evocation of six songs by Harry Nilsson from the late 1960's and early 70's, the dance begins on an insidiously goofy note. Why, one wonders, is Mr. Taylor bothering to plunk a grinning dancer center stage, seated in a lotus position and dragging on a cigarette, to the accompaniment of this tepid musical soup?
Very gradually, as "A Field of Grass" moves from one song through another, Mr. Taylor creates a landscape filled with green, sun, a soft breeze and gamboling youngsters in bell-bottom jeans. As gradually, the dancers' bodies tauten. Tall, threatening city buildings seem to have sprung up across earth that one recognizes as tinged with blood. The sun comes out again from behind thin storm clouds at the end. But it shines down on games forbidden in the time that the songs establish and the dance suggests. 
 A good deal of the power of "A Field of Grass" is attributable to the subtlety with which Jennifer Tipton dims, hardens and brightens the light in which the dance takes place. The songs grow darker, too, in a teasing sort of way. And Mr. Taylor has found the perfect interpreter in Patrick Corbin, a dancer who looks amusingly like a model happy-go-lucky boy next door in everything he dances.
It isn't just the sweet wholeheartedness of his smile and his sunny blondness. Mr. Corbin, as he has proved increasingly with each successive year in the Taylor company, is a dancer for all seasons. So buoyant he looks as if a feather could knock him off course, Mr. Corbin is in reality a dancer of impressive strength, resiliency and nuanced physicality. It is hard to imagine anyone else dancing this crucial role, though he is accompanied by two lithe male dancers and a quartet of charmingly sassy females.
But in the end this is Mr. Taylor's deceptively low-keyed triumph. The skipping, ground-skimming dancers of the first song, "Mother Nature's Son," become robots who spurt into brief flights of free flight in the ritualistic "Rainmaker," their limbs locked into bayonet-sharp angles. The lovers look a little lost in "I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City." They sidle and jive gently to a syncopated beat in "Daybreak," bodies pressing close in a tight conga line.
The group dance Mr. Taylor has set to "Spaceman" is one of his most chilling, its melee of flying bodies ending with Mr. Corbin's convulsive apparent death. Then it's back to calm, though an uneasy one, in "The Puppy Song." Everyone has a right to a friend of one's own, Mr. Nilsson sings, a friend who will be accepted everywhere. The time of the songs suggests the overt racial segregation of America in the 1960's. But the seven dancers swing through a continuous change of partners, arms around each other, often in same-sex couples. A slightly battered-seeming Mr. Corbin is still smiling. The dancers look happy. The effect, however, is subversive.
The fine cast of "A Field of Grass" was completed by Hernando Cortez, Richard Chen See, Sandra Stone, Caryn Heilman, Rachel Berman Benz and Denise Roberts, who stands out for her piquant dancing. Santo Loquasto's costumes suggest rather than announce their period, much in the manner of the songs.
It was good to see "Snow White" return to the Taylor repertory. David Gropman's ingeniously stripped-down theater-within-a-theater was as charming as ever. And Mr. Taylor's good-humored retelling of the story avoids the kind of acid comic high jinks that sometimes sink his funny dances. Francie Huber was delightful in the title role, all sappy Disney smiles and touching affection for her dwarfs. Elie Chaib is perfect as the hunched and slithering Queen and as the most stolid of princes.
Karla Wolfangle was the self-polishing, slightly tart Bad Apple. The lumbering, high-flying dwarfs -- only five for what Mr. Taylor has described as an economy production -- were played with great charm by Joao Mauricio, David Grenke, Andrew Asnes, Thomas Patrick and Edward Talton-Jackson. Mr. Taylor should next choreograph a dance for Bottom and his friends.
The program was completed by two of Mr. Taylor's most popular music visualizations, the gooey-sweet "Arden Court" and the pungent "Esplanade." Watching these dances, one marvels yet again at the ingenuity of the ways Mr. Taylor moves his dancers on and off the stage. Standing out in the compelling crowd of dancers were a twinkling Ms. Benz, the genial and accomplished Mr. Mauricio and, dancing only in "Arden Court," the stylish Mr. Talton-Jackson and Angela Vaillancourt, a big, easy, generous-spirited new Taylor dancer.

This twice-a-year ritual, some of the best free theater in town, offers a variety of entertainment this season. Among the offerings, which go on view this weekend at the auction houses, are everything from the experimental to revivals, as paintings, sculptures and drawings with estimates totaling more than $207 million appear for the art market's autumn pulse-taking.
The usual pre-auction anxiety is evident as collectors, dealers and experts from all over the world flock to Sotheby's and Christie's to see works by artists ranging from Picasso and Renoir to Gorky and Hockney. Just how the market will fare in these economic times is the question everyone is asking. While this fall's auction catalogues are much leaner than those of the boom years in the 1980's, and the atmosphere is noticeably sadder, the experts who put the sales together are also far wiser. 
 "It's been hard getting good material," said Christopher Burge, the president of Christie's in New York. "But we both came through at the last minute," he added, speaking of his own auction house and its rival, Sotheby's.
Persuading collectors to sell choice artworks has been a struggle for everyone in the auction business for the last two years; people still prefer to hold on to their art, if they can, until the market shows a definite upturn. But that's only one part of the problem. Pricing is another. "We've made a conscious effort to keep estimates down," Mr. Burge said, adding that he believed prices would be back to where they were in the first half of 1988.
While more big-ticket paintings -- those expected to bring more than $2 million -- are up for sale than in recent seasons, these aren't what everyone's talking about. Instead, all eyes will be on Sotheby's sale of 88 Picassos on Thursday. The works date from 1899 to 1972 and range from multi-million-dollar paintings like "Women and Children at the Seashore" (1932), estimated at $2.5 million to $3.5 million, to small drawings like "Six Studies: Still Lifes, Figures and Landscapes" (mid-1920's), expected to sell for $8,000 to $10,000.
The collection was formed by Stanley J. Seeger, an American living in Switzerland who has been buying Picasso's work since 1980 and now wants to sell so he can start other collections. This is a highly personal group of Picassos reflecting one man's taste. Mr. Seeger bought all but four of the works at auctions in New York or London.
Putting so many Picassos on the block in the same evening is risky, especially given the delicate state of the market. Some experts say Sotheby's is courting trouble. Many auctiongoers are still haunted by last May's sales, when 16 Warhols were auctioned within 24 hours and only 2 were purchased. (Curiously, this season there are no Warhols for sale at either Sotheby's or Christie's; experts say neither house was offered any.)
David Nash, who heads Sotheby's department of Impressionist and modern paintings, said: "At first I was worried about selling so many Picassos at once. But the feedback we've been getting is very positive. Some people feel the sale might stimulate the market because there is such an enormous range. There's something for everyone."
And each has been priced to sell. In many cases, works have been estimated at far less than Mr. Seeger originally paid for them. For example, he bought "Study for the Actor and Two Profiles of Fernande" (1904-05) for $742,500 at Sotheby's in New York in May 1992. It is now expected to bring only $300,000 to $400,000. "Reclining Woman" (1932), which Mr. Seeger bought at Sotheby's in London in 1988 for $1.17 million, is back on the market with an estimate of $600,000 to $800,000. "The Faun Among the Branches" (1946), purchased at Sotheby's in London four years ago for $374,220, is now expected to bring $100,000 to $150,000.
Works that Mr. Seeger bought earlier, however, have estimates far above their original prices. "Glass, Bouquet, Guitar and Bottle" (1919), which he bought 12 years ago for $792,000 at Sotheby's in London, is now estimated at $2.5 million to $3.5 million. "Playing Cards, Package of Tobacco, Bottle and Glass" (1914), for which Mr. Seeger paid $495,000 at Sotheby's in London in 1981, now has an estimate of $1.5 million to $2 million, while "Women and Children by the Sea" (1932), for which he paid $810,000 at Christie's in New York 10 years ago, is being offered for $2.5 million to $3.5 million. "At the end of the day he'll probably break even," Mr. Nash said.
 
'Not Just Browsing'
 There are four Picassos in Christie's sale of Impressionist and modern art on Tuesday, but Michael Findlay, the senior director of Impressionist and modern paintings, said he didn't think that would be a problem. "Because of the chronology of the sales, it's unlikely that our Picassos will be affected," he said. "They will be offered first; each is from a different decade in the artist's career, and they come with reasonable estimates."
Christie's sale focuses on several star works by other artists. Among them is Renoir's "Motherhood or a Woman Nursing Her Son" (1886). The painting, which shows the painter's mistress, Aline Charigot, nursing their child, is considered choice because the artist rarely created a work on this scale that was at the same time an intimate glimpse of his own family. While Christie's catalogue doesn't give an estimate, the auction house said the work might fetch about $8 million. The last time this painting was at auction was in 1988, when it was sold at Sotheby's in New York for $8.8 million. "The market is at 1988 levels," Mr. Findlay said of the current offering, "and this is lower than it sold for, which makes it quite reasonable."
Also at Christie's is Degas's "Dancers Taking a Bow (The Ballerinas)," from 1885. "It's not that typical at this stage in his career for Degas to have done a luminous pastel, and he rarely painted ballerinas on the stage," Mr. Findlay said. "They were usually resting in the wings."
Mr. Findlay said prospective buyers had expressed interest in the Degas and Renoir. "The market as a whole is gathering steady speed," he said. "Collectors these days are calling to look at very specific things. They're not just browsing."
Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art on Wednesday is also geared for the serious collector. The most notable work, by far, is a colorful Matisse cutout, "The Wine Press" from 1951, which Mr. Nash said could bring about $10 million. "Cutouts are extremely rare," he explained. "The last big one at auction was in 1966."
The work, which was included in the Museum of Modern Art's giant Matisse retrospective last year, has generated interest from American museums as well as private collectors. "We've seen growing confidence in the market," Mr. Nash said. "Since last fall, each sale has done better and better, and people are feeling more secure."
 
Continuing Struggles
 But this upbeat mood is not reflected in the market for contemporary art, which is still struggling to crawl out of the doldrums. Offerings are slim at both houses, although each has several strong works.
At Christie's sale on Nov. 9, there is Gorky's "Year After Year" (1947), which is being sold by Gifford Phillips, a New York collector and a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art. Beautifully colored, the lush abstract painting is full of symbolic images. While Christie's has not provided an exact estimate, it says the painting may bring $3 million to $4 million.
Another important work in the Christie's sale is an untitled Cy Twombly work from 1969, a blackboard painting with spiraling scrawls in chalk on a gray background. "In the height of the market, this would have brought upwards of $3 million," said Diane Upright, who heads Christie's contemporary-art department. This season the auction house hopes it will bring $1.8 million to $2.2 million.
"The painterly quality is powerful, and it comes with a good price," Ms. Upright said. "Grand old pieces bring out grand old collectors. But happily, we are also seeing a lot of potential new buyers, mostly Americans."
 
Safety and No Saatchi
 Sotheby's contemporary sale on Nov. 10 has been put together with specific buyers in mind. "It's a safe sale; we haven't stuck our neck out," said Lucy Mitchell-Innes, the head of the contemporary-art department at Sotheby's worldwide. "Every work has been carefully curated to match pieces to known buyers."
The absence of Charles Saatchi, the London-based advertising magnate who has been a steady seller at Sotheby's for two years, is apparent. But even without him, the auction house has managed to obtain a few prime works. Among the stars are David Hockney's "California Art Collector" (1964), estimated at $600,000 to $800,000, and a 14-foot-tall Calder standing mobile from 1960 called "Constellation," expected to fetch $500,000 to $700,000.
There is also a strong group of Minimalist works, including Donald Judd's first wall progression (1964), estimated at $60,000 to $80,000, and "Several," a 1965 sculpture by Eva Hesse, expected to bring $350,000 to $450,000. (Mr. Hockney, Calder and Ms. Hesse are all artists whose work has done well at auction recently.)
Besides the safe quality of the sale, there are other telltale signs of tough times. Sprinkled throughout Sotheby's catalogue are works by artists including Mr. Twombly, Ellsworth Kelly and Frank Stella that are clearly distress-sale merchandise. Each is marked "Property of the F.D.I.C., as Receiver of First City Bank, Houston."
Sotheby's has also kept its contemporary works priced in the $50,000-to-$750,000 range; the auction house's experts said this was the range with which collectors have indicated they feel comfortable. "The sale shows a definite change from last year, a move away from being heavily weighted toward Abstract Expressionist and Color Field artists, to the next generation, namely Minimalist, Conceptualist and Neo-Expressionist," Ms. Mitchell-Innes said.
Her colleague Anthony Grant, who heads Sotheby's department of contemporary art in New York, added that the response to this fall's offerings had been positive. "There is no shortage of buyers for top quality," he said. "But anything less than first-rate is a real problem. These days, there's simply no urgency to buy."

Iraq Saves World Cup For the U.S.

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
THE nation of Iraq did one huge favor for the United States yesterday. It saved this soccer-deprived republic from even the remote threat that the 1994 World Cup would have been whisked to a real soccer power. I doubt that the Iraqis were very happy about that side effect of their 2-2 tie with Japan, which meant neither nation qualified for the 1994 cup.
The Iraqis would have been a great story: a nomad team forced to play only road games because of the troubles in their homeland. They were in the same condition in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico when I interviewed them in their hotel in Toluca, and the goalkeeper gave me a keychain with Saddam Hussein's photo in color. During the Gulf war in 1991, I went scrounging around for that souvenir, but I couldn't find it. 
 Some fans would have adopted the Iraqis as underdogs. America loves an underdog. But the United States may never have seen the World Cup if the United States State Department had kept any Iraqi players from entering.
"We're going to deal with the issue if it comes up," said David Johnson, a spokesman for the State Department, which must be celebrating now that South Korea and Saudi Arabia have qualified on the playing fields of Qatar.
The precedent for stopping athletes from an unfriendly country was set last summer when the United States kept athletes from Libya out of the World University Games in Buffalo. The United States is currently taking part in an international economic embargo against Iraq, and just might have made it difficult for Iraq to take part in the 1994 World Cup, even though President Reagan put it in writing in 1987 that all qualifying teams would be helped with entrance requirements.
In the wake of the Gulf war and the World Trade Center bombing, the State Department surely has legitimate concerns about internal security. But even threatening to keep athletes out of the world's most important sports tournament is a major policy step. As we saw in 1980 and 1984, athletes are the easiest hostages to failed politics.
The implied threat from the State Department ought to frighten the organizers from Atlanta, who have been awarded the 1996 Summer Games. As it happened, Billy Payne, the president of the Atlanta committee, was in New York yesterday. The former Georgia football player looked like he was high-stepping it through the old rubber-tire exercise as he distanced himself from other sports events.
"We shouldn't necessarily panic," Payne said. "The Olympic Games are not the World University Games or the World Cup. The Olympic Games are all about bringing people together, to bring about peace. You do not have that unmistakable mandate in other events."
Actually, soccer authorities say they make this a better world by unfurling yellow Fair Play banners and telling young players not to kick each other in the shins. And even if some Americans haven't figured it out yet, the World Cup is very big. Basically, the world shuts down for a month every four years.
I've been around the friendly folks from FIFA, world soccer's governing body. I don't think they would have been amused by the State Department playing games with passports of Iraqi players. In Zurich, the home office of soccer, a deal is considered a deal.
I happen to believe FIFA would have given the United States a few days to declare its intentions about Iraq, and then FIFA might have moved the 1994 World Cup to Germany, to Japan, surely not to England with its sociopathic fans, but possibly to Italy, home of the best cappuccino and the best soccer league in the world.
The Azzurri, the Blues, the national players of Italy, have no lock on the 1994 cup. If Italy loses to Portugal in Milan on the night of Nov. 17, it will probably not qualify, which would be social and economic disaster for millions of fans in the New York area, who are counting on Italy to play three, four, five games at the Meadowlands.
In my not-totally unrealistic scenario, the lads from Iraq were going to cause the 1994 cup to go straight back to the scene of the delightful 1990 World Cup. Of course, some Italian officials are otherwise detained, as the saying goes, during the current political scandals, but the games could have gone on.
One more goal by Iraq yesterday and my wife and I could have reclaimed "our" lovely flat over the two trattorias, and I could have covered most of the games on a $300 Italrail pass. Giddy fans from Norway and Cameroon and Bolivia and Mexico would have marched through train stations in Italy, waving flags, singing anthems.
Real soccer. Real soccer fans. Real soccer stadiums. Real soccer country. But I guess the United States will be interesting, now that its good pals from Iraq have saved the World Cup.

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
Cus D'Amato, who was the dean of boxing managers and trainers when he died in 1985, ran the Gramercy Gym at 14th Street and Irving Place in Manhattan for more than 40 years. Yesterday, officials of a neighborhood revitalization group made sure his name would not disappear from the area.
The gym was razed earlier this year to make way for low-income housing, so the 14th Street Union Square Local Development Corporation erected a sign naming part of 14th Street "Cus D'Amato Way." Floyd Patterson, Jose Torres and Vinnie Ferguson, fighters he managed, participated in the ceremony. 
 Then the celebration moved indoors with cocktails at the Con Edison building on the block.
In a speech, the writer PETE HAMILL, who used to hang out at the gym, related an anecdote that he said reflected the essence of Mr. D'Amato. In 1958, when Floyd Patterson was the heavyweight champion of the world, Mr. Hamill said, "he was in Indianapolis for a fight, and he and his sparring partners went into a coffee shop where the manager refused them service because they were black."
"When the manager realized he was refusing service to Floyd Patterson," Mr. Hamill went on, "he apologized. To which Patterson replied, 'I may not always be heavyweight champion of the world but I'll always be a man.'
"Floyd was the epitome of the Cus D'Amato style," Mr. Hamill added. "He taught his fighters to become men, not just champions."
Asked earlier in the day about Mike Tyson, Mr. D'Amato's last great fighter and his legally adopted son, Mr. Hamill said: "The tragedy was that Cus died when Tyson was 21 or 22. In the long run, people are responsible for their own lives, but in this situation, they need someone to guide them across the minefields of celebrity."

HEADLINE: Tighten the Sanctions on Haiti

 BODY:
Standing before the United Nations General Assembly yesterday, Haiti's deposed President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, passionately argued for a complete trade embargo against his country to force its military rulers to step down and allow him to return to office.
Ordinary Haitians deserve this sort of cooperation from the international community. First they took the risk of supporting Mr. Aristide and electing him to office with an almost 70 percent majority. Since then they have endured obscene brutality from the Haitian military and paramilitary "attaches," who have not shrunk from murdering Mr. Aristide's followers, whether prominent members of his Government or the desperate poor who comprise most of his following. 
 At the U.N. Mr. Aristide promised to establish a nation built on law, pluralism and economic growth. He called for "reconciliation between all." And while he conceded that he would probably not be able to return to Haiti by tomorrow's deadline, as outlined in the Governors Island agreement he signed with the junta leaders in July, he said it was only a matter of time.
Haiti's generals have refused to honor their part of the agreement by stepping down to allow Mr. Aristide to return. They say, disingenuously, that they can't do this until Parliament ratifies an amnesty for the engineers of the coup that deposed the President. But they have terrorized the very legislators who need to do this, posting armed thugs outside Parliament. Some legislators have fled to the United States.
In his speech yesterday, Mr. Aristide promised that if the generals left "tomorrow morning," he would convene Parliament that very afternoon to enact the necessary legislation.
President Clinton yesterday promised the junta leaders that in thinking they could simply outwait the international community, "they are making a grave mistake." He said the Administration was exploring its options.
Haiti has a bloody and unfortunate history. It is a country that has never known democracy. U.S. marines occupied the island in 1915 and stayed for 19 years, responding to an incident in which the Haitian President was dismembered alive in front of the French legation.
Since then, Haiti has suffered under a succession of dictatorships, supported by ruthless military or paramilitary thugs. While Mr. Aristide's followers have also been guilty of some excesses, his seven months of government were notable for a marked decrease in human rights abuses and a genuine attempt to establish constitutional rule.
 So far, despite the fact that he is Haiti's legitimate leader, Mr. Aristide has made all the concessions, promising that the leaders of the coup that ousted him will suffer no punishment. Meanwhile the generals have had the nerve to ask for the privilege of naming a replacement for Justice Minister Guy Malary, whom they assassinated two weeks ago.
It's heartening that Mr. Clinton is standing behind Mr. Aristide and has not taken seriously the attempt at character assassination by psychobabble initiated by some Republican senators during the past week. From now on, the pressure should be on the junta leaders -- not Mr. Aristide -- to make concessions.
Mr. Aristide has not asked Americans to risk their lives to insure his return. He does not want an occupying army on Haitian soil. Mr. Clinton can show his resolve by granting Mr. Aristide's request and supporting the proposal being circulated in the U.N. Security Council for a complete trade embargo of Haiti.
He can also warn the neighboring Dominican Republic that if it allows its territory to be used to evade the embargo, it too may be isolated by sanctions. The Haitian poor who await Mr. Aristide's return deserve no less.
