HEADLINE: Islamic Center Seeks 9/11 Recovery Grants for Lower Manhattan

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

 BODY:
The directors of the planned Islamic community center and mosque near ground zero have applied for grants from an agency tasked with helping Lower Manhattan recover from the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The request was for about $5 million, said a person with knowledge of the grant application. 
In a statement, the developer, Sharif el-Gamal, said that the board of Park51, as the center is known, asked for the financing from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation about two weeks ago. The money, which would come from a pool of $2 billion in federal financing administered by the corporation, would be used for domestic violence prevention programs, language classes, art exhibitions and other social services at the center.
''Park51 remains committed to exploring all sources of revenue and funding to build the community center in Lower Manhattan,'' Mr. Gamal said. ''It is important to note that this community center will provide hundreds of construction jobs over the next few years and when opened will provide 150 permanent jobs.''
The plans for the center created a national furor this summer after opponents complained that its location, two blocks from the northern edge of ground zero, was inappropriate. Since then, the evolving plans for the center -- and especially its financing-- have come under scrutiny.
Mr. Gamal has said he plans to raise the $140 million required to build the center by tapping small donors, enlisting paying members and courting corporations and philanthropists. Nothing has been raised yet, but the developers insist that their fund-raising efforts are going according to plan and that they have found interested donors.
The center would include a Muslim prayer space, a swimming pool, a preschool and a 9/11 memorial.
The competition for the latest rounds of financing from the development corporation, totaling about $17 million, is expected to be intense. Julie Menin, who sits on the corporation's board, said that 255 groups had requested a total of $170 million.
Applicants have to show a ''nexus to revitalizing the World Trade Center site and its surroundings,'' Ms. Menin said, adding that the applications panel would favor proposals focused on job creation and partnerships with other Lower Manhattan organizations.
''Because the economy is in the state it's in, we've had more applications than ever,'' Ms. Menin said. ''There are going to be very tough choices.''
Park51 applied for financing for six separate programs, including money to buy equipment, lease or purchase the building, and bring art exhibitions to the space. Money was also requested for counselors for victims of domestic abuse, programs that would help new immigrants and services for small-business owners. Another application seeks money for a program to help homeless veterans with job training and drug counseling.
Ms. Menin, who said that she had not seen Park51's application, said it was not unusual for one organization to apply for more than one grant.
If Park51 receives money from the development corporation, it will be subjected to rigorous federal reporting requirements. Kevin Cunningham, the executive artistic director of 3 Legged Dog Media and Theater Group, which received $1.5 million from the corporation several years ago, said he was required to submit regular reports outlining demographic data on employees and patrons alike.

HEADLINE: Nissan Says Its Electric Leaf Gets Equivalent of 99 M.P.G.

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The federal government has rated the Nissan Leaf, the battery-powered car scheduled to go on sale next month in five states, as getting the fuel equivalent of 99 miles a gallon, Nissan said Monday.
The Environmental Protection Agency, which tests vehicles for emissions and fuel efficiency, has determined Leaf's official range to be 73 miles on a fully charged battery, much less than the 100 miles previously claimed by Nissan.
Both figures will appear prominently on the Leaf's window label, which shows the estimated yearly electricity cost as $561. The E.P.A. calculates annual fuel costs as $867 for the Toyota Prius hybrid and $1,669 for Chevrolet's Malibu, which like the Leaf, is classified as a midsize car. 
The E.P.A. puts vehicles through five tests to simulate varying driving conditions and levels of climate-control usage.
Because drivers cannot simply stop at a gas station and refuel, the Leaf's range is expected to weigh heavily on shoppers' minds. Adding to any confusion they might feel, the Leaf will have a second sticker from the Federal Trade Commission -- it regulates advertising by alternative-fuel vehicles -- displaying the car's range as 96 to 110 miles.
''Driving behavior, temperature -- those things do affect your range,'' said Mark Perry, the director of EV and Advanced Technology strategy in North America for Nissan. ''We're trying to be very open so folks are making the right decision for them. We don't want them to be surprised.''
The E.P.A. calculated the 99 m.p.g. equivalent figure by combining ratings of 106 m.p.g. in city driving and 92 m.p.g. on highways. The Leaf's rating is nearly double that of the Toyota Prius hybrid, which is 50 m.p.g.
The agency has not concluded its tests of the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid that also goes on sale next month in parts of the United States. The Volt, unlike the Leaf, has a gasoline engine that allows the car to remain operational after the battery, which General Motors says has a range of 25 to 50 miles, is depleted.
''Their calculation is a little bit more straightforward than ours, so I suspect they may have gotten through the process a little faster,'' a G.M. spokesman, Rob Peterson, said in explaining why the Leaf results were finished first. ''At this time we don't have a definitive number.''
The Leaf's rating is based on a formula from the E.P.A. in which 33.7 kilowatt hours of electricity is equivalent to one gallon of gasoline.
''The tough part with an electric vehicle is we have no gallons. We have no gas,'' Mr. Perry said. ''But we understand the need to provide a comparison and that's what the formula does.''
Mr. Perry noted that electricity costs -- assumed to be 12 cents a kilowatt-hour for the purposes of the label -- varied widely in different parts of the country and in some cases depending on what time of day the car was plugged in.
The Leaf's window sticker will list the car as needing seven hours to charge via a 240-volt outlet and consuming 34 kilowatt-hours every 100 miles. It will show the Leaf, which has no tailpipe, as receiving the best possible scores for emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.
Nissan dealerships in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona and Tennessee will start selling the Leaf in December. Sales will begin in Texas and Hawaii in January, followed by additional states later in 2011.

HEADLINE: Indexes Rally From a Slow Start to End the Day Mixed

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS; Landon Thomas Jr. and Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stock indexes on Monday started the morning down but pared their losses to end the day mixed amid anxiety over Europe's financial crisis and a widening inquiry into insider trading on Wall Street. 
Bank shares slumped after the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the offices of two hedge funds as part of a broad insider-trading investigation. Goldman Sachs sank 3.4 percent, while Bank of America fell 3.1 percent.
Shares of companies that sell retail and consumer goods rose on hopes that shoppers would be in a spending mood as the holiday shopping season kicked into high gear.
By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.97 points, 0.2 percent, to 11,178.58. The Dow was down as much as 149 points earlier. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.89 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,197.84.
The Nasdaq bucked the trend and ended the day up 13.90 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,532.02.
Bank stocks were already under pressure because of concerns over how the bailout of Ireland would affect their investment portfolios and their ability to increase dividends.
''As part of the Ireland bailout, banks will have to take a haircut,'' said Benjamin Wallace, securities analyst at Grimes & Company in Westborough, Mass. ''All these issues bring into question whether banks are strong enough to pay out dividends next year, and whether the government will ask them to hold on to more capital for some more time.''
Ireland formally asked for help from its neighbors Sunday after weeks of pressure from the European Union. While details of the package were still being worked out, Ireland's government slipped further into crisis Monday as a coalition partner of Prime Minister Brian Cowen threatened to abandon him.
It was the second time this year that the European Union has come to the rescue of one of the 16 member countries that use the euro. In May, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund committed $140 billion to Greece to prevent the country from defaulting on its debt.
Investors, however, took heart from signs that the holiday shopping season is off to a good start. A widely watched gauge of spending, MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, found apparel sales rose 9.7 percent in the first two weeks of November.
Amazon.com's shares were up 3.4 percent, and Apple rose 2.2 percent. Other technology shares also gained.
''Consumers make up 70 percent of the economy, and there is a sense that they will start spending their increasing savings,'' said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company.
In another positive sign, the computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard reported better-than-expected results and raised its profit forecast. Its stock was up 1.8 percent in regular trading and continued to rise after hours.
Among the economic reports scheduled this week are October home sales, an update of consumer sentiment, and revisions to estimates of the third-quarter gross domestic product.
Some economists expect that the latest reading on economic growth for the third quarter will be slightly higher than the previously estimated 2.0 percent increase.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 19/32, to 98 15/32, pushing the yield down to 2.80 percent, from 2.87 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: On the Economy, Some Credit Is Due

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Pretty Good for Government Work'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 17), Warren E. Buffett thanks Uncle Sam for saving the country from an economic meltdown. If I were Uncle Sam, this is how I would reply: 
Thanks so much for giving credit where credit is due. My brood, the taxpayers, did indeed come to the economic rescue when we needed it the most.
However, I must say that I find the timing of your message odd and counterproductive. Your words give me comfort, but cold comfort, now that you've waited until after the election to tell the world that you actually believe in your Uncle Sam.
I must remind you that on Nov. 2 plenty of people were elected to Congress who want my head on a platter, who don't believe the intervention did any good and who will now make it impossible to intervene again when the need arises. (In fact, it has arisen, with the current need for another, larger stimulus bill.)
I'm ready to step in again, but thanks to wise minds like yours who spoke out too late or too softly, I won't be able to.
William B. Rabb Pensacola, Fla., Nov. 17, 2010
To the Editor:
Warren E. Buffett seems to have forgotten President Obama in his praise of Uncle Sam's good work.
Did he forget who is head of state and who is taking the heat from voters for not being able to turn the financial system around while in office only two years? Perhaps, in praising Uncle Sam, Mr. Buffett really meant President Obama. I hope so.
Ed Roach Naples, Fla., Nov. 17, 2010
To the Editor:
Thank-you notes are lovely, but they're even better when addressed to the right people. Uncle Sam did not rescue our economy. It was average Americans who were forced to step up and bail out those who risked everything and lost. And, sadly, we have yet to be thanked.
Instead, extravagantly wealthy individuals and corporations demand even more concessions in the form of more tax cuts and less regulation.
In the meantime, our cities, our schools, our neighborhoods and our very livelihoods become less tenable by the day.
How nice for Warren E. Buffett that he is enjoying the fruits of our labor. I hope that someday the American people can enjoy them as well.
Carol Dungan Logie Minneapolis, Nov. 17, 2010
To the Editor:
Warren E. Buffett should know that Americans need help now, and that there is more he can do. As one of the wealthiest and savviest investors of our time, he is uniquely situated to influence the public debate for the better.
He should go to Washington to press his case that not all government intervention in the economy is evil. He could help persuade Congress to support his position that it would be a good idea for the wealthiest Americans to pay a bit more in taxes to help balance the budget.
Howard S. Koh New York, Nov. 17, 2010
To the Editor:
I want to thank Warren E. Buffett for his kind thoughts. Now, can we have our money back ... with interest?

HEADLINE: Defenders of Earmarks Point to Urgent Needs That Would Not Be Met

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER; Michael Cooper contributed reporting from New York, and Emma Graves Fitzsimmons from Chicago.

 BODY:
ST. LOUIS -- With their vote last week to support a moratorium on earmarks, House and Senate Republicans are taking aim at a popular target: the much-criticized system for distributing federal money that reflects politicians' clout as much as the merits of projects in their districts.
In doing so, Republicans are hoping to tap into growing public concern about federal spending, and stand up to the kind of projects that have become reliable late-night punch lines over the years, like bridges to nowhere, teapot museums and studies of pig odor.
But at a local level, there remain many supporters of earmarks, who argue that they play an important role -- solving basic and urgent infrastructure needs in communities -- that is often lost in their cartoonish portrayals. 
''I don't really care what it's called -- I'm mostly concerned about what the money is going to be used for,'' said Francis G. Slay, the mayor of St. Louis, whose deteriorating flood-control system along the banks of the Mississippi went unaddressed for years until Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Republican, accelerated the slow-moving project with help from an earmark.
''How can anyone vilify one of our representatives,'' Mr. Slay added, ''who has gone out and basically forced the federal government to fund a project that is essential to our ability to protect the property and the people of St. Louis from major flooding?''
Money can take many different routes from budgets in Washington to projects in communities. The vast majority is allocated through the decisions of federal bureaucracy, which often uses formulas to rank priorities, or by the states themselves, where critics say the money is often distributed as pork anyway, only by governors and state lawmakers instead of members of Congress.
Earmarks, which for all their controversy account for less than half of 1 percent of total federal spending, allow lawmakers to specify how money is used in their home states. If they were eliminated, Congress would cede more authority over spending decisions to the executive branch.
The fate of earmarks remains unclear because the Republican ban is, at present, voluntary, and Democrats have not yet responded to a proposed moratorium.
Critics of earmarks contend that even the most legitimate projects ought not be financed through a process that rewards influence and sidesteps normal procedures. But in some towns and cities, supporters say these earmarks provide the shortest and most direct route to paying for road, water and sewer projects. The flood-control walls in St. Louis are cited as an example of an earmark that solved an urgent problem.
During the Midwestern floods of 1993, the Mississippi here reached to the steps of the Gateway Arch, peaking just two feet from the top of the flood walls.
Though the decades-old walls held, unlike the barriers in many surrounding communities, the flood caused substantial damage and exposed systemic problems. In one area, the river channeled beneath the wall, forcing emergency repairs. Calls came from all sides to prepare for the next flood.
Like many other projects involving highways and bridges -- so long as they go somewhere -- spending to repair the St. Louis flood-control system has not been controversial. But getting the money for the work has taken years.
The $20 million project, which is scheduled to be completed at the end of 2012, has been praised by fans and foes of earmarks as a straightforward and cost-efficient effort to patch up an aging series of levies, flood walls and floodgates. The Army Corps of Engineers has estimated that a breach could cause more than $1.2 billion in damages.
''I can't say I'm in favor of earmarks, because I always thought they were someone's favorite little pet projects,'' said Greg Piel, a vice president at the Commercial Plating Company here, whose family business had to be ringed with makeshift levies in 1993 after the river channeled under the man-made barrier into his parking lot. ''I wouldn't call the repair of a flood wall for a city a pet project. That's an absolute must.''
Mr. Piel paused and added, ''It's really easy to cross the line between needs and wants.''
Even if the projects themselves are deemed worthy, debates arise over whether they should be financed through Congressional earmarks. Last week, Representative Michele Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican who leads the Congressional Tea Party caucus and has been strongly critical of earmarks, made an exception for them. She was quoted as saying that she did not consider infrastructure projects like roads and bridges to be earmarks because of their importance. The comments immediately drew challenges.
''In reality, infrastructure spending is what should absolutely not be earmarked,'' said Steve Ellis, vice-president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonprofit group that opposes earmarks. ''We need to make these spending decisions on merit -- prioritizing need like safety and congestion and economic impact rather than the muscle of the politicians involved.''
There have been many bipartisan efforts over the years -- like a national infrastructure bank backed by President Obama and others -- to create procedures to help the federal government identify and finance the most important projects.
But in the absence of a new system that would ensure that worthwhile local projects are financed, some groups are calling for reforming the earmark process rather then eliminating it.
''They lend themselves to some of the worst abuse in Congress, but a lot of what's wrong with them could be fixed,'' said Phineas Baxandall, who specializes in transportation and budget issues for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an advocacy organization. ''And if they're going to be eliminated, some of the legitimate role they play will have to be met elsewhere.''
In St. Louis, Senator Bond unapologetically defends his status as one of the top earmarkers in Congress and has criticized his colleagues' loss of faith in them. The state's junior senator, Claire McCaskill, a Democrat who is one of the few senators to refuse to seek earmarks, calling them arbitrary and unfair, has been pushing recently to corral Democratic votes for a moratorium.
For Mr. Bond, earmarks are a matter of trusting who is best positioned to make spending decisions -- politicians who know the needs of their home states or ''unknown, unaccountable bureaucrats'' from Washington.
''I disclose what I'm going to ask for,'' he said. ''I brag about it when I get it. I answer any questions about it. Does a bureaucrat do that with any money they send? No.''
Mr. Bond, who is retiring from the Senate in January, said he had long been frustrated in his efforts to lobby for money for the flood-wall repairs in St. Louis. The project received federal support but continued to move slowly even after Hurricane Katrina painted a vivid picture of the urban devastation that flooding can cause.
The situation became more urgent because the bonds that St. Louis had approved to pay for the city's $7 million part of the project had to be used within three years or they would expire. Mr. Bond earmarked the financing in 2008. ''Talking to bureaucrats is like talking to a wall -- that's why we went around them,'' he said.
Even though Mrs. McCaskill said she was happy to see the money arrive for the flood-wall repairs, she said it was disingenuous to say that the project benefited from the earmark process.
''It would be a slam dunk if the process was always about merit,'' she said. ''The reason it hadn't gotten funded is that money was stolen by some other senator for a project that wasn't as meritorious.''

PERSON: David Nolan 

HEADLINE: David Nolan, 66, Is Dead; Started Libertarian Party

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
David Nolan, whose opposition to the Vietnam War and President Richard M. Nixon's wage and price controls impelled him in 1971 to join with a few friends to found the Libertarian Party to fight against government power, died Sunday in Tucson. He was 66.
Mark Hinkle, chairman of the party's national committee, said Mr. Nolan appeared to have had a heart attack or stroke while driving his car. He lived in Tucson. 
Though its membership has always been relatively small, the Libertarian Party became a forceful voice for limiting government regulation of Americans' economic and political lives. It has argued for curbs on police power, lifting abortion restrictions, open immigration and an end to foreign wars.
In the recent elections, long-held Libertarian positions were echoed in the firestorm of concern about deficits and government spending expressed most loudly by Republicans and Tea Party advocates. But Libertarians' dovish views on military involvement and liberal attitudes about abortion veer sharply from those of conservatives. This week, expectedly enough, Libertarians campaigned against airport pat-downs.
The party's mix of conservative and liberal positions reflects an underlying belief that almost all government power is inherently coercive. Mr. Nolan came up with a well-known graph, called the Nolan Chart, to explain this phenomenon.
The graph has two axes: one labeled economic freedom and the other called personal freedom. Under Mr. Nolan's scheme, Libertarians dwell in the corner of the graph where both kinds of freedom are greatest. His hope was to persuade people to think of politics as a debate between libertarian and authoritarian positions rather than as one between the traditional left and right.
The Libertarians grew to become commonly regarded as the nation's most enduring political party after the Democrats and Republicans; several times the party put a presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states.
Mr. Nolan had no illusions that the Libertarians would ever become powerful in raw votes. But he hoped the party's participation in elections would simply expose Americans to libertarian views as a means to effect change.
In this month's election, he ran for the United States Senate seat in Arizona held by John McCain, a Republican, who easily won re-election. Mr. Nolan earlier ran unsuccessfully for an Arizona Congressional seat, again to draw attention to the Libertarian agenda.
''Most Americans think about politics when it comes to the dog race of elections,'' Brian Doherty, senior editor of Reason magazine, a libertarian journal, said in an interview Monday. ''Electoral politics is the central context in which Americans think about politics.''
Though it is often said the Libertarian Party was born in Mr. Nolan's living room in Westminster, Colo., on Dec. 11, 1971, in fact it began on that date at the home of another incipient Libertarian in Colorado Springs. But the emotional surge that led eight people that day to proclaim a new national political party had begun in Mr. Nolan's living room months earlier.
On Aug. 15, 1971, Mr. Nolan and four associates were meeting in his home when President Nixon appeared on television to announce wage and price controls, a step the libertarians considered unconstitutional in peacetime. They also strongly criticized Nixon's announcement in the same speech that he was taking the United States off the gold standard.
They carried their anger, plus their belief that the Vietnam War was both ill-considered and illegal, to the meeting in nearby Colorado Springs where the Libertarian Party was formed. The next summer, the party convened to nominate a presidential ticket that wound up receiving one electoral vote.
That vote, for the presidential candidate John Hospers and the vice-presidential candidate, Theodora Nathan, was the first electoral vote ever recorded for a woman in a presidential election.
Before the party was formed, Mr. Nolan had worked on a constitutional amendment to eliminate the income tax and had sold libertarian bumper stickers through the mail. His mailing lists in those efforts later proved critically important to the Libertarian Party in reaching like-minded people.
David Fraser Nolan was born on Nov. 23, 1943, in Washington and grew up in Maryland. He was influenced by the individualist fiction of Robert A. Heinlein and the novels of Ayn Rand. He went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the idea of being an uncompromising architect like Howard Roark, the hero of Rand's ''Fountainhead.''
After switching his major to political science, his involvement in conservative politics deepened. He was a founding member of M.I.T. Students for Goldwater in 1964, promoting the Republican presidential candidacy of Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, and helped it become the largest chapter in New England.
Mr. Nolan later moved to Colorado, where he worked in advertising and public relations and as a writer. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth.
When the Libertarian Party was formed, Mr. Nolan emphasized the need for liberals and conservatives to unite behind unrestricted capitalism and maximum civil liberties. At a meeting of party leaders this weekend, he submitted a resolution but did not attend. Delegates, who did not know of his subsequent death, approved the resolution.
It said, ''The Libertarian National Committee hereby reaffirms that the Libertarian Party welcomes individuals from across the political spectrum who now accept the libertarian principles of self-ownership and non-aggression.''

HEADLINE: Saving the Wild Tiger

 BODY:
A century ago, there were an estimated 100,000 tigers living in the wild. Now there are perhaps 3,200 left. The best chance -- probably the only remaining chance -- to save them from extinction is being worked out during a five-day summit meeting this week in St. Petersburg, Russia, staged by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank. The meeting includes representatives from major conservation groups and all 13 nations with tigers living in the wild, including India, Indonesia, Thailand and Russia. 
Two things are needed. The first is a more focused conservation strategy, like the ''source site'' approach recommended by the Wildlife Conservation Society. The goal is for all the countries with wild tigers to identify and protect sites with enough breeding females and room for an expanding tiger population. The hope is that vigilant protection of these sites could double the tiger population by 2022.
Ending the international trade in tiger parts, which are still believed to have almost magical powers in China and across Asia, will be harder to solve. This isn't a matter of stopping a few poachers. It means shutting down hard-core traffickers and a high-profit black market. Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, is scheduled to attend on Wednesday, the final day of the meeting, which we hope is a good sign. China banned trading in tiger parts in 1993. It must actively discourage the cultural appetite for them and aggressively pursue traffickers.
Unless these efforts succeed, tigers could go extinct in the wild within 20 years. The United States, which sent a senior State Department official to the meeting, has no wild tigers, but it does have well upward of 5,000 tigers living in captivity. The government keeps no track of where they are, who owns them, or what becomes of them, which means they are vulnerable to the black market. It needs to do more to protect these tigers.

HEADLINE: Buoys Gone, Home Sales Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD; Edward Wyatt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Over the last few years, buyers have been lured into the troubled housing market by two unusual opportunities: cash subsidies in the form of government tax credits, and rock-bottom prices on millions of foreclosed homes.
The tax credits are now history. And the supply of foreclosed homes on the market is already falling as regulators, lawmakers and state law enforcement officials press to sharply reduce the number of foreclosures.
Now, buyers and sellers are getting an early taste of what the real estate market might look like without those twin pillars of support: sales of existing homes plunged 26 percent in October compared with the same period last year, the National Association of Realtors said in a report Tuesday. 
In some parts of the country, it was the worst October in at least 20 years, according to separate regional sales reports. Sales were down 41 percent in Minneapolis, 28 percent in Massachusetts and 34 percent in Illinois.
In Portland, Ore., (down 39 percent) and Seattle (down 32 percent), it was the worst October since record-keeping began in 1994. In California, it was the second-worst October since at least 1994.
''People aren't buying houses -- period,'' said Mark Fleming, an economist with CoreLogic, a data firm.
Analysts had been predicting that winter chills would arrive early, although the numbers turned out to be a little worse than they had anticipated. Last fall, sales were robust as buyers scrambled to take advantage of the government's $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, which was on the verge of ending. (Tax credits were later extended and expanded to include a broader range of buyers, expiring finally in April.)
''The factors that brought people into the market have either disappeared, in the case of the tax credit, or their impact is lessening, in the case of foreclosures,'' said Jennifer H. Lee of BMO Capital Markets. ''I would certainly hope that housing can stand on its own two feet, but it will depend largely on the job market.''
About 4.43 million homes were sold on a seasonally adjusted annual basis in October, compared with nearly 6 million in October 2009. In October 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, about 5 million deals were signed.
In July, the first month without the credit, sales hit a nadir of 3.84 million, the lowest level in 14 years.
The tax credit inspired many people to accelerate planned purchases, just as administration economists intended. Meanwhile, the abundance of foreclosures offered millions of first-time buyers a chance to become owners. Misfortune for some yielded opportunities for others.
Distressed sales, including foreclosures, have been about a third of the market, while first-time buyers have been as much as 50 percent. Both are high by historic levels.
If the supply of previously foreclosed homes continues to dry up, housing prices might stabilize or even rise. That would provide long-sought relief for sellers but it could keep many potential buyers out of the market and put sales in a permanent slump.
Bill and Becky Britt just bought a house with five bedrooms, five baths and a five-car garage in the Denver suburb of Evergreen. The property was listed three years ago for $1.25 million. As recently as last February, the seller was trying to get $800,000. Then the property went into foreclosure. It was offered this fall by a bank for $600,000. The Britts paid $550,000.
Such deals are disappearing, said the couple's agent, Marlene Maxon. ''More and more the banks are figuring out, let's get these sold without having to go through foreclosure,'' she said.
Short sales, where the sellers negotiate with their lender to sell their house and repay less than the full amount owed, are rising in popularity although they are still outnumbered by foreclosures. Bank of America, for instance, said it had agreed to more than 60,000 short sales this year.
If the Evergreen house had been a short sale, priced at perhaps $650,000, the Britts would not be moving in.
''Frankly, we would not and could not have paid what we believe the house is truly worth,'' Mr. Britt, the president of Analytical Reference Materials International, wrote in an e-mail from Belgium, where he was working.
Foreclosures have been under fire for about two months now. All 50 state attorneys general are conducting a joint investigation whose goal is nothing less than to change foreclosure in America.
While many earlier programs tried and failed to curb the number of foreclosures, the uproar and outrage over shoddy documentation procedures at some lenders make success much more likely. Further ammunition came Tuesday in a highly critical interim report by an interagency federal task force examining the problem.
Michael S. Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions, told the Financial Stability Oversight Council that the task force found ''widespread, and in our judgment, inexcusable breakdowns in basic controls.''
The task force, formed earlier this fall, is composed of representatives from a range of government agencies with an interest in the financial system.
Mr. Barr said the mission of the task force included ''providing alternatives to foreclosure, and acting in a coordinated and comprehensive way to hold the firms accountable, bring clarity and certainty and help households.''
With the banks under pressure, they de-emphasized foreclosures in October. According to Lender Processing Services, a data company, the number of foreclosed homes that the banks prepared for sale during the month dropped by a third, to 80,000.
Whether this drop-off is temporary depends on the extent to which loan modifications and short sales ultimately supplant foreclosures.
Even before the freezes, foreclosures were losing steam. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, for example, sales of previously foreclosed homes have fallen by a third over the last year, while traditional sales were largely stable.
''The number of low-priced properties, of really good deals, is going to decline over the next few years,'' said Pat Paulson, president-elect of the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors. ''And as foreclosures fall, prices will go up.''
In California, the sales of previously foreclosed houses dropped to 10,367 in October from 15,621 in October 2009 and 19,925 in October 2008, according to DataQuick, a real estate information company.
A large part of the reason is that lenders simply are not bringing them to market.
CoreLogic, the data company, estimated this week that there was a ''shadow inventory'' of more than two million delinquent and foreclosed homes that banks will ultimately have to dispose of.
''Some share of it surely will come to market,'' said Mr. Fleming, the CoreLogic economist. ''How much is debatable.''

HEADLINE: Aggrieved Fliers Ask, 'What Now?'

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
As if air travel could get any worse.
The airlines have already taken away the free meals and the pillows. They have been charging for checked bags and extra legroom and raising fares whenever they can get away with it. They have been packing more people onto planes as they slashed the number of flights scheduled each day. And passengers now have fewer options if bad weather cancels or delays their flights.
Now, just in time for the Thanksgiving holiday -- traditionally the busiest time of the year -- the Transportation Security Administration has imposed tough new security measures.
And that may have been the last straw for many travelers. 
Judy Dugan, the research director at Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group, argues that the anger that has welled up against the new security procedures is an expression of fliers' overall attitude toward air travel.
''Passengers are angry and frustrated about most of the flying experience -- the whole 'shut up and sit down' experience of flying,'' Ms. Dugan said. ''But unless they're professional travelers, they can't pin the frustration on individual airlines. It's easy, though, to focus on the T.S.A., which is a big and omnipresent part of every flight for everyone.''
And don't expect any change for the better anytime soon. While many travelers may complain about their travel experience, the industry for the first time in years has found a way back to profitability by holding the line on the number of flights they offer.
United States airlines scheduled 526,000 flights in September, according to the Air Consumer Travel Report, down from more than 600,000 in September 2007. And each flight is now fuller. Load factors, which measure how many seats are filled by paying customers, have risen above 80 percent on average at most airlines and will probably be 90 percent or more over the holidays. Only a few years ago, airlines were achieving load factors of 70 percent.
Just between Chicago O'Hare International Airport and La Guardia Airport in New York, American Airlines and United Airlines scheduled 1,400 fewer flights in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period three years ago, a drop of 17 percent.
Fees are also piling up. Bag fees, for instance, brought in $1.7 billion in extra revenue in the first half of the year. In many cases, passengers are paying for services that were once free. Changing a ticket on US Airways, for instance, now costs $150 to $250; sending an unaccompanied minor on a Delta Air Lines flight, $100. Pet charge on Southwest, $75; an alcoholic drink on United, as much as $9.
''Air travel used to be glamorous and exciting -- and now, it's just a pain,'' said Mary C. Gilly, a professor of marketing at the University of California, Irvine. ''Airlines have become very cost-oriented as opposed to service-oriented. They are catering to their investors, not their customers.''
More problems may be on the horizon, some experts say. New federal rules have pretty much abolished instances of planes sitting on the tarmac for more than three hours. But the rule, which went into effect in May, may have had the unintended effect of forcing more flights to be canceled, some airline experts say.
Airlines said they have a strong incentive to comply with the tarmac rule given that the potential fines of $27,500 per passenger could end up costing around $3 million per delayed flight. But as a result, airlines have been canceling flights that they expect may face a long delay. When a plane returns to the gate to avoid the three-hour penalty, there is also an extra chance it will get canceled.
From May to September, the last month for which data is publicly available, only 12 flights remained on the tarmac more than three hours. That compares with 535 in the same period last year. But more flights were canceled in the same period, even as airlines reduced their overall capacity. Even so, airline experts say it is too early to determine whether the rule has benefited customers.
''We haven't gone through a big winter yet,'' said Brett Snyder, the author of the Cranky Flyer blog and the president of Cranky Concierge, an air travel assistance Web site. ''We need those long snowstorms that mess things up to know the impact of the rule. I think we need to wait.''
With fewer flights, though, travelers could end up waiting for hours at the airport, or even spend the night there, without any compensation for the inconvenience if bad weather delays operations.
Weather, in fact, more than security checkpoint delays, may turn into the bigger headache of the holiday period.
Airlines certainly anticipate full flights for the next week. The Air Transportation Association predicted that the number of passengers over this Thanksgiving holiday -- which is defined as a 12-day period that began on Nov. 19 and ends on Tuesday -- will rise 3.5 percent from last year, to 24 million people.
To help ease travel delays, the Federal Aviation Administration, as it has done in previous years, said it would clear the way for some commercial planes to fly in airspace normally reserved for the military. Airlines have also taken steps to meet the crowds. At many airports, extra airline employees will be on hand to help direct passengers to their gates, or help them move to the head of security lines if they are running late.
Southwest, the largest domestic carrier, said it would strive to accommodate every passenger, especially Wednesday and Sunday, traditionally among the busiest days, adding extra flights if needed.
''We do everything we can do to make sure you can get to your destination,'' said Greg Wells, the vice president for operations at Southwest Airlines.
Continental and United, which recently merged, have several measures in place to handle the influx of holiday travelers, according to Christen David, a spokeswoman for both airlines. The carriers have brought in additional customer service agents, gate agents and bag handlers. They are also asking managers and clerical personnel to work on the front lines on the day before Thanksgiving.
''It's all hands on deck,'' she said.
Upset with the security measures, Rachelle Desrochers, a health insurance analyst who works in Providence, R.I., said she rarely flew these days, preferring to drive or take the train instead. ''I may never get to the West Coast again,'' she said, half-jokingly.
Other travelers appeared more stoic about the current state of the airline business.
''We want cheap airline tickets but we don't want to accept the fact that airlines are turning into Greyhound buses,'' said Christopher F. Childres, a managing partner at Edgewater Capital Partners, a private equity firm. ''But if we pay Greyhound bus prices, we should expect Greyhound bus service.''
He said that his worst experiences were generally not with the airlines but with other passengers, ''whether it is a person walking through security with all the jewelry they own, or the person that doesn't buy two seats but lifts the armrest and takes up half your seat.''
But, he added, ''If you're paying $200 to fly 800 miles in two hours, there has to be an economic reason it's that cheap. You can't have a customer experience for $200.''

HEADLINE: Fraud Inquiries Focus on Public-Works Hiring in New York

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
Two of the nation's major construction companies are under federal investigation, suspected of defrauding government programs on some of the biggest public-works projects in and around New York City, according to people briefed on the inquiries.
The projects under scrutiny include the city's $2.8 billion Croton Water Treatment Plant and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's $1.4 billion Fulton Street Transit Center in Lower Manhattan, the people briefed on the investigations said.
The two inquiries focus on accusations that the contractors used what were essentially front companies to evade requirements that they hire a certain percentage of subcontractors owned by minorities or women, or businesses certified by government agencies as disadvantaged, the people said.
One of the investigations is expected to be resolved in the coming days with an agreement between one contractor under scrutiny, Schiavone Construction Company, and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn. The agreement will allow Schiavone, one of region's biggest tunneling contractors, to avoid criminal charges but will require it to pay more than $20 million and maintain certain internal reforms it has put in place, the people said. 
The second investigation focuses on Skanska USA Civil Northeast, a subsidiary of Skanska USA, which is ranked among the nation's top 10 contractors in several categories, including transportation, general building revenue and new contracts, according to several of the people, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the cases had not yet been made public.
While that inquiry, which is being conducted by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, is not as far along, people briefed on that case said it could lead to a similar -- perhaps even larger -- payment.
Neither company has been charged with a crime.
A lawyer for Skanska, Martin Flumenbaum, said Tuesday: ''We understand that there is a broad inquiry relating to the use of minority business enterprises in public-works construction projects in the New York area. Skanska is cooperating fully in connection with that inquiry and is committed fully to complying with laws and regulations governing the use of minority business enterprises.''
Austin V. Campriello, who represents Schiavone, declined to comment. The company was bought in 2007 by Dragados Inversiones USA, part of a Spanish construction conglomerate, after the conduct at the center of the investigation was said to have occurred.
Taken together, the two cases underscore what some law enforcement officials and analysts say is the systemic abuse of similar city, state and federal programs put in place in an effort to level the playing field for companies owned by minorities and women and those certified as disadvantaged.
In New York State, billions of dollars have flowed through this patchwork of programs in recent years, although precise figures are hard to compile.
The projects under scrutiny in the two investigations, which prosecutors are conducting with the transportation authority's inspector general, are not the only major undertakings by Schiavone and Skanska in the city. In joint ventures with a third company, they are also involved in some of the authority's most ambitious efforts. They have a $1.14 billion contract to build the tunnels and station structures for the No. 7 subway line extension and a $337 million contract to build some of the tunnels for the Second Avenue subway, though no accusations of wrongdoing have been raised in connection with those projects.
The schemes at the center of the two investigations are simple: Rather than hire a minority- or women-owned subcontractor or a company the federal government has certified as a struggling business, the contractors ran the payroll for their own workers -- or paid another subcontractor -- through a minority company that served as a ''pass through.''
In the case of Schiavone, based in Secaucus, N.J., part of the scheme centered on a company hired to haul away dirt excavated from the water-treatment plant project and work at the $530 million South Ferry subway station renovation and at the Times Square station. The company did a tiny part of the work, while most of it was performed by another company, a mob-connected trucking firm, the people briefed on the case said.
Skanska, those with knowledge of that case said, paid workers for dewatering and demolition at the Fulton Street Transit Center site through a company called Environmental Energy Associates in Ridgefield, N.J. That company, a certified disadvantaged business enterprise, or D.B.E., collected a fee for the service it provided, handling just the payroll, the people said.
Representatives of the offices of the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta E. Lynch, and the Manhattan United States attorney, Preet Bharara, declined to comment on Tuesday.
Several law enforcement officials who investigate construction corruption acknowledged that the goals for the participation of minority- and women-owned contractors and disadvantaged businesses often did not accurately reflect the universe of qualified companies.
A longtime construction industry official who has worked with community groups in an effort to increase the level of participation by female and minority contractors said the often-limited options had made a range of sometimes illegal -- at times blatant -- solutions commonplace.
The complex set of requirements for certification as a disadvantaged contractor includes being a member of what the federal government characterizes as a ''socially or economically disadvantaged'' group -- women, blacks, Native Americans, Asians and others -- as well as a $750,000 limit on personal net worth, a maximum average gross receipts for the business over three years of roughly $22 million and a certain measure of independence from non-D.B.E. firms.
Prosecutors, investigators and industry observers said it was hard to measure the scope of this type of fraud, but most agreed it was widespread. And while such crimes do not result in the theft of government funds -- the money is paid and the work is done -- they undermine the intent of the federal, state and local laws, which were written to create opportunities for struggling and minority- and women-owned companies. Also, in the view of some, they contribute to a culture of corruption in the industry.
Prosecutors in the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn have long focused on such cases. Its Federal Construction Fraud Task Force has made 61 arrests over the past decade for crimes related to this type of fraud. As a result, forfeiture orders have totaled more than $150 million, and 28 people and companies have been banned from seeking additional federal contracts, according to a recent court filing.
But while the United States attorney's office in Manhattan has seldom made such cases, the investigation of Skanska signals an increased focus in this area for the prosecutors there, some officials have said.
The reasons seem clear. In the past year, New York City's four-year-old program has resulted in $511 million in prime contracts and subcontracts for certified companies, according to the Mayor's Office of Contract Services. Over the life of the city's program -- referred to as W/MBE, for women- and minority-owned business enterprise -- more than $1 billion has gone to such contracts, according to the office.
At just one federal agency, the Transportation Department, a similar program resulted in $617 million worth of prime and subcontracts in 2009 in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, officials said. That money was for highway and transportation projects, like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ones under scrutiny in the two cases, the officials said. That federal program, which certifies and assists what it characterizes as disadvantaged business enterprises, was in some measure the model for the city's effort.
The investigations developed in two ways. The Brooklyn inquiry grew out of a case focused on mob influence in the trucking industry and the work of an independent monitor who had been hired by the transportation authority to oversee the downtown projects after a scandal involving the construction of the agency's headquarters, at 2 Broadway.
The trucking investigation uncovered the scheme at the water filtration plant, and the monitor, Toby Thacher, developed information indicating that the disadvantaged business enterprises working on the authority's projects were fronts. The information was passed on to the office of the transportation authority's inspector general, Barry Kluger. His office and the federal prosecutors, who in the Brooklyn case worked with the city's Department of Investigation on the water-treatment plant inquiry, built the cases.

HEADLINE: U.S.G. And P.T.A.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
For me, the most frightening news in The Times on Sunday was not about North Korea's stepping up its nuclear program, but an article about how American kids are stepping up their use of digital devices: ''Allison Miller, 14, sends and receives 27,000 texts in a month, her fingers clicking at a blistering pace as she carries on as many as seven text conversations at a time. She texts between classes, at the moment soccer practice ends, while being driven to and from school and, often, while studying. But this proficiency comes at a cost: She blames multitasking for the three B's on her recent progress report. ''I'll be reading a book for homework and I'll get a text message and pause my reading and put down the book, pick up the phone to reply to the text message, and then 20 minutes later realize, 'Oh, I forgot to do my homework.' '' 
I don't want to pick on Miller. I highlight her words only because they're integral to a much larger point: Our unemployment today is not only because of the financial crisis. There are some deeper problems. If we're going to get more Americans back to work, we will need more stimulus from the U.S.G. -- the U.S. government -- from the top down. But we will also need more stimulus from the P.T.A.'s -- the Parent Teacher Associations -- from the bottom up.
The deeper problems fostering unemployment in America today can be summarized in three paragraphs:
Global competition is stiffer. Just think about two of our most elite colleges. When Harvard and Yale were all male, applicants had to compete only against a pool of white males to get in. But when Harvard and Yale admitted women and more minorities, white males had to step up their game. But when the cold war ended, globalization took hold. As Harvard and Yale started to admit more Chinese, Indians, Singaporeans, Poles and Vietnamese, both American men and women had to step up their games to get in. And as the education systems of China, India, Singapore, Poland and Vietnam continue to improve, and more of their cream rises to the top and more of their young people apply to Ivy League schools, it is only going to get more competitive for American men and women at every school.
Then, just as the world was getting flattened by globalization, technology went on a rampage -- destroying more low-end jobs and creating more high-end jobs faster than ever. What computers, hand-held devices, wireless technology and robots do in aggregate is empower better-educated and higher-skilled workers to be more productive -- so they can raise their incomes -- while eliminating many lower-skilled service and factory jobs altogether. Now the best-educated workers, capable of doing the critical thinking that machines can't do, get richer while the least-educated get pink slips. (We used to have a receptionist at our office. She was replaced by a micro-chip. We got voice mail.)
Finally, just when globalization and technology were making the value of higher education greater than ever, and the price for lacking it more punishing than ever, America started slipping behind its peers in high school graduation rates, college graduation and global test scores in math and critical thinking.
As Education Secretary Arne Duncan put it to me in an interview, 50 years ago if you dropped out, you could get a job in the stockyards or steel mill and still ''own your own home and support your family.'' Today, there are no such good jobs for high school dropouts. ''They're gone,'' said Duncan. ''That's what we haven't adjusted to.'' When kids drop out today, ''they're condemned to poverty and social failure.'' There are barely any jobs left for someone with only a high school diploma, and that's only valuable today if it has truly prepared you to go on to higher education without remediation -- the only ticket to a decent job.
Beyond the recession, this triple whammy is one of the main reasons that middle-class wages have been stagnating. To overcome that, we need to enlist both the U.S.G. and the P.T.A. We need teachers and principals who are paid better for better performance, but also valued for their long hours and dedication to students and learning. We need better parents ready to hold their kids to higher standards of academic achievement. We need better students who come to school ready to learn, not to text. And to support all of this, we need an all-society effort -- from the White House to the classroom to the living room -- to nurture a culture of achievement and excellence.
If you want to know who's doing the parenting part right, start with immigrants, who know that learning is the way up. Last week, the 32 winners of Rhodes Scholarships for 2011 were announced -- America's top college grads. Here are half the names on that list: Mark Jia, Aakash Shah, Zujaja Tauqeer, Tracy Yang, William Zeng, Daniel Lage, Ye Jin Kang, Baltazar Zavala, Esther Uduehi, Prerna Nadathur, Priya Sury, Anna Alekeyeva, Fatima Sabar, Renugan Raidoo, Jennifer Lai, Varun Sivaram.
Do you see a pattern?

HEADLINE: Real Estate Investors Look to the Future, and See Signs to Buy Apartment Towers

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
At the start of the year, David Neithercut, the chief executive of Equity Residential, a real estate investment trust, set a target of $1 billion to spend on apartment buildings across the country. By the middle of this month, after buying 15 properties that included a troubled condominium tower in San Diego and three apartment buildings in Manhattan, Mr. Neithercut had invested $1.4 billion.
''We stepped up, swallowed hard and plunged in,'' said Mr. Neithercut, whose Equity Residential is the country's biggest publicly traded REIT. ''We never expected there to be a lot of opportunities out there in the marketplace.'' 
Equity Residential, the top apartment buyer this year, according to the research firm Real Capital Analytics, joins a list of institutional, public and private investors that are plowing money into apartments at a time when the market for most commercial real estate is flat. In the third quarter, sales of apartment buildings jumped 63 percent over the previous quarter, to $8.5 billion, according to Real Capital Analytics. Sales this year through the third quarter now stand at $18.5 billion, nearly double the same period last year. By comparison, sales through the third quarter in 2006 were $659.6 billion.
A number of factors are behind the rise in multifamily-unit sales this year. Low interest rates, a lack of new construction and falling vacancy rates have swelled the ranks of buyers and, in some cases, incited bidding wars. And real estate investors are eager to spend cash reserves hoarded in the bust.
''Investors see this as a great opportunity to get their hands on assets of the highest quality,'' said Hessam Nadji, the managing director of research and advisory services at Marcus & Millichap, a real estate services firm in Encino, Calif.
Competition is strong for the few properties that reach the market. Many owners are loath to sell unless they can reap a large profit. Class A properties, or properties in good locations, selling for more than $20 million in cities with little development and strong demand are the most wanted.
''It's highly competitive today because we only have 10 percent of the inventory we had in 2006,'' said Mark T. Alfieri, an executive vice president at Behringer Harvard, a private commercial real estate firm.
While some real estate investors bought properties last year, the buying did not begin in earnest until after the first quarter. Even Equity Residential, which was sitting on $1 billion in cash at the start of last year, bought only two properties in 2009. Rental rates and occupancies had improved enough by the second quarter that many real estate investment trusts were able to raise enough money to return to the market.
In New York, Equity's big recent purchases have included the 38-story River Tower at 420 East 54th Street, the 32-story 777 Sixth Avenue and the 26-story Longacre House at 305 West 50th Street.
Real estate companies with new multifamily investment funds that do not have any properties underwater or carrying heavy debt loads have moved the swiftest. Last year, Behringer Harvard became the year's most active buyer after purchasing 14 apartment buildings, many in all-cash deals, for $765 million. This year the company, based outside Dallas, has already spent $740.6 million on multifamily properties.
CB Richard Ellis Investors, which started a multifamily arm two years ago, has spent almost $1 billion since April 2009 on apartment buildings in deals that are either all-cash or combine low debt with cash.
''We may not be the highest bidder, but we have the highest probability of closing,'' said Stephen Zaleski, the managing director of the Multihousing Group at CB Richard Ellis Investors in Boston. ''We're incredibly nimble and can close a deal in 30 days.''
Investors have grown more confident about the market and are paying higher prices for a promise of future growth. As prices have escalated, capitalization rates, or the initial return on a building, have dropped to 6.7 percent in the third quarter nationwide. (When capitalization rates fall, so do investors' returns.) The rates had been as high as 7.1 percent in 2009. But in some big markets, cap rates, as they are called, have plunged to 4.5 to 5 percent. Since he started buying last year, Mr. Neithercut said, prices have risen 20 percent.
''I'd like to back up a truck and buy more back then,'' Mr. Neithercut said.
While it may seem counterintuitive in a slow-growing economy, real estate investors are willing to accept lower yields on the prospect of higher rents to come. Many say they think cap rates have bottomed and will start to rise in the coming year as fewer new apartments come on the market and demand for apartments heats up.
The new multifamily properties that are opening now were started before the credit crunch, when renter demand was high and financing was easier to get. This year, 99,000 units are expected to open, 40,000 fewer than in 2009. Just 50,000 apartments are projected for next year. It will probably be the end of 2012 before a large number of new properties open.
A smaller inventory should help drive vacancy rates even lower. A drop in vacancies nationwide and an increase in rents have emboldened investors. In the third quarter, the national vacancy rate dropped to 7.1 percent from 7.8 percent, the real estate research firm Reis said, the lowest number since Reis started publishing quarterly figures in 1999.
While job growth has remained anemic -- though the figures from October were encouraging -- real estate experts and investors say more Americans who had moved in with friends and family are gaining confidence in their job prospects and are signing leases again. Buying a home is less a consideration than renting for many people because they have neither money nor confidence in their job prospects.
''People are more willing to take a risk and lease an apartment because they expect to find a job in the next six to nine months,'' said Victor Calanog, the director of research for Reis in New York.

HEADLINE: 3rd Quarter Was Record For Profits In U.S. Firms

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The nation's workers may be struggling, but American companies just had their best quarter ever.
American businesses earned profits at an annual rate of $1.659 trillion in the third quarter, according to a Commerce Department report released Tuesday. That is the highest figure recorded since the government began keeping track over 60 years ago, at least in nominal or noninflation-adjusted terms. 
The government does not adjust the numbers for inflation, in part because these corporate profits can be affected by pricing changes from all over the world and because the government does not have a price index for individual companies. The next-highest annual corporate profits level on record was in the third quarter of 2006, when they were $1.655 trillion.
Corporate profits have been doing extremely well for a while. Since their cyclical low in the fourth quarter of 2008, profits have grown for seven consecutive quarters, at some of the fastest rates in history. As a share of gross domestic product, corporate profits also have been increasing, and they now represent 11.2 percent of total output. That is the highest share since the fourth quarter of 2006, when they accounted for 11.7 percent of output.
This breakneck pace can be partly attributed to strong productivity growth -- which means companies have been able to make more with less -- as well as the fact that some of the profits of American companies come from abroad. Economic conditions in the United States may still be sluggish, but many emerging markets like India and China are expanding rapidly.
Tuesday's Commerce Department report also showed that the nation's output grew at a slightly faster pace than originally estimated last quarter. Its growth rate, of 2.5 percent a year in inflation-adjusted terms, is higher than the initial estimate of 2 percent. The economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
Still, most economists say the current growth rate is far too slow to recover the considerable ground lost during the recession.
''The economy is not growing fast enough to reduce significantly the unemployment rate or to prevent a slide into deflation,'' Paul Dales, a United States economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ''This is unlikely to change in 2011 or 2012.''
The increase in output in the third quarter was driven primarily by stronger consumer spending. Wages and salaries also rose in the third quarter, which might help bolster holiday spending in the final months of 2010.
Private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports and federal government also contributed to higher output. These sources of growth were partly offset by a rise in imports.

HEADLINE: China Sets Tough Line in Climate Talks

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Senior Chinese officials said on Tuesday that next week's climate talks in Cancun, Mexico, would succeed only if the West agreed to transfer technology to developing countries like China and to take the lead in cutting emissions. 
The comments by one of China's senior officials in charge of climate issues, Xie Zhenhua of the powerful National Development and Reform Commission, were mirrored by two other senior Chinese climate officials who earlier this week published a report saying China was willing to make concessions -- if developed nations put money into a $30 billion fund aimed at helping poor nations cope with global warming.
Western countries pledged to set up such a fund but details have yet to be worked out. Mr. Xie said it would be the key to securing a deal to the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which is due to expire in 2012.
The positions reflect a long-standing view by developing countries, led by China, that they are largely not responsible for climate change -- which they say was caused by decades of western pollution -- and thus should not play a leading role in reversing it. Stated forcefully by China's chief climate officials, the comments reemphasized the challenge facing negotiators in Cancun as they try to reconcile the positions of the two camps.
''Developed countries need to take the lead in massively cutting their green house gas emission in order to give further development space to developing countries,'' Mr. Xie said. ''Developing countries in particular should be concerned about achieving tangible results with regard to funding and technology transfer issues.''
The United States, by contrast, wants developing countries to curb emissions and agree to international verification.
Mr. Xie called on developed countries to cut emissions by up to 40 percent and emphasized that China has already made huge strides in cutting pollution, even though its 30-year program of economic reforms have vaulted it to the forefront of industrialized nations. ''No single country or single block of countries has achieved that in history,'' Mr. Xie said. ''This is our big contribution to the international community.''
Despite China's growth, Mr. Xie said it remains a developing country and couldn't be treated like the United States or European countries with respect to climate change. ''We will never accept anything beyond our condition as a developing country,'' he said.
Mr. Xie noted that China had made pollution cuts such a priority that some local governments had made last-ditch efforts to meet pollution-reduction targets. This year some factories closed as officials tried to meet targets for reducing China's ''energy intensity'' -- the amount of power consumer per unit of economic output.

HEADLINE: North Korea Relies on China, But Tends to Resist Its Guidance

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON and MICHAEL WINES; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting, and Zhang Jing contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- North Korea's unending appetite for confrontation has left many wondering what its bottom line is, none more so than its supposed patron and big brother, China.
Despite its impoverishment and heavy dependence on Chinese aid and support, North Korea seems to regularly defy every Chinese diplomatic initiative, from Beijing's work to keep the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free to its efforts to prevent a violent confrontation.
China's influence is rising steadily around the world. But the problem of how to manage North Korea, its Communist neighbor and onetime ally, appears to befuddle China's leaders, who stumble from indulging the North to sending occasional signals of pique, all without persuading the country to adopt a path toward greater openness or stability. 
''At the moment China has limited influence,'' said Cai Jian, a professor of Korean studies at Fudan University. ''On one hand it's unhappy with North Korean actions and its provocative behavior, but on the other hand it still has to support North Korea.''
The support continues because China fears that the vacuum created by a sudden collapse there would open the door to rule by South Korea, ''and that will put an American military alliance on the doorstep of China.''
Mr. Cai said that during a recent trip to China, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, was told by the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, that they should communicate better so that China would not be surprised by its behavior.
This was followed by a warning given by one of China's senior leaders, Zhou Yongkang, who made a much publicized trip to North Korea last month. Mr. Zhou reportedly told Mr. Kim that China would support his son's succession but North Korea would have to take substantive steps to open up its economy, including rejoining diplomatic efforts, to relieve the external economic pressures on it. None of the top nine leaders in China -- the Standing Committee of the Politburo -- have close ties to North Korea. And China has little interest in seeing a Communist political dynasty take hold.
Despite its efforts to accommodate North Korea's idiosyncratic political system, China was apparently caught off guard by the recent developments. The news that North Korea had built a sophisticated uranium enrichment plant was received with incredulity by Chinese media outlets. The normally nationalistic Global Times cited experts who cast doubt on China's diplomatic strategy and said that North Korea had been ''purposefully hard-line.''
The North Korean shelling of a South Korean island seemed to have been even more of a shock. On Tuesday, Chinese officials implied that they had no advance knowledge at all and still had no contact. At a press briefing, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said China needed to verify media reports.
China also called on all sides to return to ''six-party talks'' between the main countries involved in the region. But almost no Chinese analyst seems to believe that this will result in anything until North Korea shows an eagerness to negotiate rather than make demands -- the current one seeming to be that the world recognize it as a full nuclear power with no strings attached.
Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday evening, the United States special envoy to North Korea, Stephen W. Bosworth, also called for a return to the six-nation talks and said he had ''very useful'' talks with Chinese officials. The two sides, he said, agreed on the need for multilateralism.
But during previous negotiations, North Korea used the time to further develop its nuclear capacity, even though this was against China's public position. China has also repeatedly called for calm and the avoidance of armed confrontation, but the two Koreas are now shelling each other.
This could strengthen the hand of critics of North Korea within China, some of whom are geographically closest to the border. Many leaders in northeastern China are frustrated over the steady flow of refugees escaping poverty. Others are disappointed that North Korea has dashed decades of hopes for cross-border trade or special economic zones along the border.
The question many have is whether China will do more than grumble. On his China trip, Mr. Kim was probably trying to shore up his support in Beijing for his son and in preparation for his current provocations. Many times in the past, that sort of lobbying worked and China chose to ignore the North's provocations. In 2006, for example, China had almost no warning of a North Korean missile test, leading Beijing to call it ''brazen'' -- fighting words compared with China's normal response. That led to limited sanctions. The question now is how close China is again to giving up on subtle influence.
''No matter whether it be within the party, among the people, or even within the military, China has grown increasingly sick and tired of North Korea's rogue politics,'' said a senior Chinese media commentator, who asked not to be named because of the delicacy of the issue. ''But strategically, China's kidnapped by it.''

HEADLINE: Fears of Future Bailouts Pressure Bonds in Europe

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
PARIS -- Investor concerns persisted Tuesday about the possible need for additional financial aid for countries in the euro area as Ireland prepared to release details of additional budget-cutting measures and Greece's restructuring efforts met with approval from international lenders.
Although Ireland has agreed to accept aid from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund -- expected to be close to 100 billion, or $134 billion -- the weakness of the Irish coalition government, along with wider worries that Europe might be required to bail out Portugal and perhaps Spain, is continuing to put pressure on the price of debt in countries considered vulnerable. 
''Markets don't believe that the bailout of Ireland will be the end of the story,'' said Nick Stamenkovic, a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets in Edinburgh. ''They're testing the mettle of the authorities. Portugal's the next major concern.''
The yield gap between Spanish 10-year bonds and safer German bonds touched a record Tuesday. Yields on the 10-year benchmark bonds of Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Italy all rose, while those of Germany and France declined. The euro, meanwhile, slid to $1.3399 by Tuesday afternoon from $1.3627 late Monday in New York.
The worry is that current official financial structures are adequate to finance a bailout of Ireland and Portugal, which votes on its 2011 budget Friday, but that they would not be sufficient to support the much larger Spanish economy. And that in turn raises the issue of a possible future debt restructuring, which is making investors nervous.
On a visit to Sweden, the European Union president, Herman Van Rompuy, said Tuesday that the Portuguese situation was completely different from that of Ireland. ''There is no need for help to Portugal,'' he was quoted by Reuters as saying, because Lisbon's budget deficit was falling and average yields on its debt were low.
The Irish government on Tuesday continued to negotiate terms of its own bailout with lenders. Some members of the deeply unpopular coalition government, led by the Fianna Fail party, have already threatened to withdraw their support, and Prime Minister Brian Cowen said late Monday that he would dissolve the government after passage of the budget early in December.
This political uncertainty has added to the turmoil in the markets, even though Ireland's political crisis has been forced in part by market pressure.
The European monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, said Ireland must adopt its budget in time to conclude negotiations on a rescue program. ''Stability is important,'' he was quoted by Reuters as saying. ''We don't have a position on the domestic democratic politics of Ireland but it is essential that the budget will be adopted in time.''
The Irish plan proposes to cut 15 billion from the country's deficits by 2014. Dublin is expected to release these plans Wednesday, details of which will be crucial in unlocking its international aid package.
Separately, Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen of Denmark said his government would join Sweden and Britain in providing loans to Ireland, Bloomberg News reported. Mr. Rasmussen said his Liberal-Conservative coalition had broad backing from Danish lawmakers for a contribution to the final package.
Denmark is not in the euro area, although its currency, the krone, is pegged to the euro and its central bank has kept interest rates in step with those of the European Central Bank.
The Greek government, meanwhile, received encouragement Monday from I.M.F. and European Union inspectors, who said the government had made significant progress in reducing the budget deficit. The review of the Greek program clears the way for the disbursement of 9 billion in January, part of a 110 billion loan for Greece that was agreed to last spring.
The European Commission, the E.C.B. and the I.M.F. said the Greek austerity program ''remains broadly on track,'' and concluded that the economy should start turning around in 2011.
Wage and price inflation is beginning to moderate, ''setting the stage for improvements in competitiveness,'' the inspectors said after completing a second review of Greece's progress in meeting the conditions attached to the loan.
The inspectors emphasized that ''extra effort'' would be needed to meet next year's targets, but they praised the fact that the reduction in the deficit in 2010 had been larger than initially planned.
They also played down concerns about recent revisions to 2009 data. Last week, the European statistics agency Eurostat reported that Greece's budget deficit in 2009 was 15.4 percent of gross domestic product, significantly worse than the 13.6 percent estimated in April.
The inspectors said that these revisions for 2009 and weaker-than-projected revenue collection ''mean that an extra effort will be needed to meet the deficit target of 7.5 percent of G.D.P. in 2011, which the government has reaffirmed.''
New measures have been agreed to that should broaden the tax base and eliminate wasteful spending, particularly in the areas of health care, state enterprises and tax administration, the inspectors added.
Greece has reaffirmed that it is committed to reducing the deficit to below 3 percent of G.D.P. by 2014.
''We do not consider the consolidation program to have fundamentally veered off track,'' Nick Kojucharov, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in a recent research note, ''and we do not think the government will be cut off from its assistance money.''
He said that roughly a third of the 2009 deficit revision related to methodological factors like changes in the calculation for local governments and an inclusion of new public enterprises into the general government accounts.
The remainder can be attributed to shortfalls in revenue relative to expectations. But, he said, the ''core'' expenditures have actually outperformed targets as the government had undershot on planned spending.
After the Eurostat revision, the Greek government set a revised budget that forecast a final 2010 deficit at 9.4 percent of G.D.P. as opposed to the 8.1 percent originally in the I.M.F.-E.U. program. The budget is expected to be passed Dec. 22.
The next review of the program, due in February 2011, will specify plans and timing for changes needed to achieve the remaining fiscal adjustment.
''While the banking system remains under some pressure,'' the inspectors said, ''capital is adequate and, as envisaged under the program, the Financial Stability Fund is now available to provide support, if needed.''

HEADLINE: Live Long And Prosper? One for Two

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A quick quiz: Which of the following countries has had the smallest increase in life expectancy since 1990 -- Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, South Korea or Sudan?
The answer is not war-torn Sudan or tumultuous Pakistan. It isn't South Korea, which started from a higher level than any of the others. And it isn't abjectly poor Bangladesh.
It's China, the great economic success story of the last two decades and the country that inspires fear and envy around the world. Yet when measured on one of most important yardsticks of all, China does not look so impressive. 
From 1990 to 2008, life expectancy in China rose 5.1 years, to 73.1, according to a World Bank compilation of United Nations data. Nearly every other big developing country, be it Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia or Iran, had a bigger increase over that span, despite much slower economic growth. Since 2000, most of Western Europe, Australia and Israel, all of which started with higher life expectancy, have also outpaced China.
The moral? Economic growth makes almost any societal problem easier to solve, but growth doesn't guarantee better lives -- or better health -- for everyone. That's been true for centuries. The rate of growth and the kind of growth both matter.
If you scan the globe today, you may end up wondering whether any country has landed on the right mix. Europe offers a good life to many people, with generous vacations, parental leaves and health benefits, but its economies have been growing slowly, which is one reason its debts are so onerous.
The United States grew more quickly than Europe in recent decades, but many of the gains flowed to a small slice of the population. Median household income, adjusted for inflation, actually fell from 2000 to 2007 -- and has fallen more since the financial crisis began in 2007.
China can sometimes look like the economy of the future, having grown stunningly fast for almost 30 years now, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it, too, has real problems. Above all, its growth has been uneven. The coast has benefited much more than the interior. Almost everywhere, some aspects of life have improved much more than others.
Whether China can switch to a more balanced form of growth, as its leaders have vowed, will obviously have a big effect on the rest of the global economy. Yet it's worth remembering that the biggest impact will be on the one-sixth of the world's population who live in China. And arguably the best example is the fact that the country has grown vastly wealthier but only modestly healthier.
There is an intriguing parallel here to the Industrial Revolution. The eminent economist Richard Easterlin has noted that longevity and health did not improve much when economic growth took off in the early 19th century.
With rising incomes, people could afford better food, clothing and shelter. But they were also exposed to more disease because so many of them were moving to cities. The combined effect appears to have been ''stagnation or, at best, mild improvement in life expectancy,'' Mr. Easterlin has written.
The Mortality Revolution, as he calls it, did not occur for almost another a century. It depended on relatively cheap investments in public health, like sanitation, and on the spread of scientific methods.
Similarly, in today's China, many more people have acquired indoor plumbing, heating, air-conditioning or other basics. Other aspects of the boom, however, have pushed in the opposite direction.
As in the Industrial Revolution, many people have left the countryside and poured into crowded cities. Accidents have become common, like the Shanghai fire last week or a series of workplace tragedies in recent months. Obesity is rising. Pollution is terrible.
I recently spent some time in China, and despite everything I'd heard in advance about the pollution, I was still taken aback. The tops of skyscrapers in Beijing can be hard to see from the street. Breathing the smog can feel like having a permanent low-grade sinus infection. For the Chinese, cancer has displaced strokes as the leading cause of death, partly because of pollution, notes Yang Lu of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.
Finally, there is the medical system itself. The dismantling of state-run industrial companies over the last two decades has ended the cradle-to-grave benefits system known as the iron rice bowl. In its place was a market-based medical system many Chinese could not afford. Even in emergencies, people sometimes had to bring cash to the hospital to get treatment.
Early last year, the Chinese government began expanding health insurance coverage, with the goal of making it universal by 2020. The initial signs look pretty good. The World Bank does not have data past 2008, but numbers published by the C.I.A. suggest that life expectancy has risen in the last two years. In my travels, I visited a simple, clean clinic in rural northern China that seemed to be providing the kind of basic care that could make a huge difference.
Of course, whatever the problems with China's boom, it still has significantly improved the lives of its citizens. Many fewer of them live in grinding poverty, and the population is living longer, even if the gains have not been as large as in many other countries.
Over any extended period, economic growth is probably necessary for higher living standards. It's just not enough. As Tsung-Mei Cheng, a health policy expert at Princeton, argues, ''Economists and the media tend to pay too much attention to the growth of G.D.P. over all, and not enough to its distribution.''
There is, after all, another large country with unimpressive recent gains in life expectancy, even smaller than China's. That's right: the United States. Since 1990, we have been passed by Chile, Denmark, Slovenia and South Korea, among others. China is still five years behind us, but it's gaining.

GRAPHIC: CHART: Paths of Development: China's economy grew rapidly from 1990 to 2008, but life expectancy rose only 5.1 years, less than the increase in nearly every other large developing country. Since 2000, its gains have been smaller than those in Western Europe. (Sources: World Bank

PERSON: Danny McDevitt 

HEADLINE: Danny McDevitt, 78, Dodgers Pitcher

BYLINE: By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK

 BODY:
Danny McDevitt, who pitched, and won, the Brooklyn Dodgers' final game at Ebbets Field in 1957, a 2-0 shutout, died Saturday in Covington, Ga. He was 78. 
McDevitt's son, Daniel, confirmed his death.
McDevitt, a left-handed pitcher, struck out nine Pirates, four in a row, on his way to a complete-game victory against Pittsburgh in that last home game, on Sept. 24, 1957, by the last major league team to represent Brooklyn.
He had started 17 games that year, winning seven and losing four, and compiling a 3.25 earned run average. The Dodgers played three more games, in Philadelphia, and finished the season at 84-70, in third place in the National League.
Afterward, Walter O'Malley, the Dodgers' owner, moved the team to Los Angeles, leaving much of Brooklyn infuriated and grieving.
McDevitt stayed with the team and went on to win 10 games for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1959 on their way to a World Series championship, although he did not play in the Series.
Daniel Eugene McDevitt was born in Manhattan on Nov. 18, 1932, and blossomed as a high school pitcher after the family had moved to Hallstead, Pa. After a semester at St. Bonaventure University, he was signed by the Yankees in 1951 but was shortly released. He pitched while in the Army and afterward joined the Dodgers' farm system.
McDevitt played professionally until 1963, with stints with the Yankees, the Minnesota Twins and the Kansas City Athletics after leaving the Dodgers. He won 21 games and lost 27 with a 4.40 earned run average over his six-year career. In later years he worked with the federal Economic Development Administration in Atlanta and developed real estate.
McDevitt's first marriage, to the former Betty Clarke, ended in divorce. His second wife, Jane, died in 1999. Besides his son, Daniel, he is survived by two sisters, Sally Cranage and Maureen Patouhas; two brothers, Robert and James; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Report Finds Low Graduation Rates at For-Profit Colleges

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
A new report on graduation rates at for-profit colleges by a nonprofit research and advocacy group charges that such colleges deliver ''little more than crippling debt,'' citing federal data that suggests only 9 percent of the first-time, full-time bachelor's degree students at the University of Phoenix, the nation's largest for-profit college, graduate within six years. 
The report, ''Subprime Opportunity,'' by the Education Trust, found that in 2008, only 22 percent of the first-time, full-time bachelor's degree students at for-profit colleges over all graduate within six years, compared with 55 percent at public institutions and 65 percent at private nonprofit colleges.
Among Phoenix's online students, only 5 percent graduated within six years, and at the campuses in Cleveland and Wichita, Kan., only 4 percent graduated within six years.
''For-profits proudly claim to be models of access in higher education because they willingly open their doors to disadvantaged, underprepared students.'' said Jose L. Cruz, a vice president for the trust. ''But we must ask the question, 'Access to what?' ''
Since the first-time, full-time students tracked in the federal statistics are the most likely to graduate, the report said, these figures may actually overstate the graduation rates.
The University of Phoenix said in a statement responding to the report that when all students are included, not just those in the federal data, 36 percent of its bachelor's students graduate in six years.
''It is unreasonable to expect nontraditional college students to complete their studies within an arbitrary, predetermined timeframe, especially when we know those students take longer to finish their degrees because they have families and professional obligations,'' the statement said.
The report acknowledges that for students seeking associate degrees, for-profit colleges' three-year graduation rate of 60 percent is considerably higher than the 22 percent rate at public community colleges.
There is still cause for concern, the report said, because for-profit students graduate with so much more debt than community college students. Many either default on their loans, or struggle to make payments but find that their lives are taken over by debt.
In a separate study also released Tuesday, the Pew Research Center reported that almost one-quarter of those who received bachelor's degrees at for-profit schools in 2008 borrowed more than $40,000, compared with 5 percent at public institutions and 14 percent at not-for-profit colleges. Over all, the Pew report found that students who earned a bachelor's degree in 2008 borrowed 50 percent more, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than those who graduated in 1996. Those who earned an associate degree or certificate in 2008 borrowed more than twice as much as their 1996 counterparts.
The Education Trust is financed partly by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This month, Melinda Gates resigned from the board of the Washington Post Company, which gets most of its revenues from its for-profit higher-education unit, Kaplan Inc.

HEADLINE: A Word From Dublin: Ireland Will Recover

 BODY:
To the Editor:
John Banville's Nov. 19 Op-Ed article about Ireland's bailout, ''The Debtor of the Western World,'' suggests a defeated and depressed nation. Americans must understand that this is not so. 
The United States has invested $165 billion in 600 business operations in Ireland. Thousands of American workers and investors with interests in Ireland should understand that most Irish citizens welcome the International Monetary Fund's arrival in Dublin because it will hasten our economic recovery.
Many American companies use Ireland to gain access to markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. They generate jobs in both the United States and Ireland as they create new knowledge and expand global production and trade. With almost 70 new foreign investments this year, Ireland ranks first in the world for per capita job creation by foreign investment.
Ireland's competitive and dynamic knowledge economy has performed well during the recession -- manufacturing output has grown 12 percent during the year to September, and total exports will be almost 6 percent up on 2009. Once the I.M.F. helps us to fix our decrepit banking system, full steam ahead.
Colm Kearney Dublin, Nov. 22, 2010

HEADLINE: With a Swagger, Wallets Out, Wall Street Dares to Celebrate

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG and KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
7:35 a.m. Updated Exuberance made a comeback this year at Josh Koplewicz's annual Halloween party. More than 1,000 people packed into a 6,000-square-foot space at the Good Units night club in Manhattan, a substantially larger crowd than in the last several years.
The open bar was sponsored by Russian Standard vodka, and Mr. Koplewicz, an investment analyst at Goldman Sachs, was able to snag a big headliner: the hip-hop star Lil' Kim, who performed dressed in a black cat costume.
The scene was more extravagant in September, at a 50th birthday party in Hong Kong for Brian Brille, the head of Bank of America Asia Pacific. Mr. Brille, who is well known on the New York social scene, wore a gray Hugh Hefner-esque jacket. Women dressed like Playmates, with feather boas and satin ears, danced behind a pink silk screen. 
Two years after the onset of the financial crisis, the stock market is recovering and Wall Street's moneyed elite are breathing easier again. And this means in some cases they are spending again -- at times cautiously, but sometimes with a familiar swagger.
It's true that firms scaled back the corporate excesses, like fancy retreats and private jets, for which they were vilified as a brutal recession gripped the country. Many of those constraints remain in place, like flying commercial on business trips, or more limited private car service for employees.
But when it comes to personal indulgences, there are signs that the wallets are beginning to open up. Traders and executives say that jobs seem much more secure. Businesses whose fortunes ebb and flow with the financial markets are thriving again.
''Wall Street is back spending as much if not more than before,'' said the New York dermatologic surgeon Dr. Francesca J. Fusco, whose business is booming again after a difficult few years.
Christie's auction house says investors from the financial world who fell out of the bidding market during the 2008 credit crisis are ''pouring'' back in.
Expensive restaurants report a pickup in bookings. At the Porter House restaurant in the Time Warner Center across from Central Park, the head chef, Michael Lomonaco, says business is up about 10 percent over a year ago and ''people are starting to shake off what happened.'' The restaurant is a favorite of A-list Wall Street executives, including Goldman Sachs's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein.
Real estate agents say Wall Street executives have already begun lining up rentals in the Hamptons for next summer. Dolly Lenz of Prudential Douglas Elliman said the bidding this year was ''hotter and heavier'' than previous years. ''There is a passion now in the market I haven't seen in a while,'' she said.
She said her clients, almost exclusively from Wall Street, were afraid to lose out. Just recently, Ms. Lenz said, she had three people bidding more than $400,000 for a summer rental in Southampton.
Compensation on Wall Street this year will not be much higher than 2009, and may even be lower. So the change in attitude appears more a matter of confidence and security than income.
''The mood is absolutely better, much better than even a year ago,'' said David M. Gildea, a health care trader at the Wall Street firm Cowen & Company. Mr. Gildea was a trader at Bear Stearns before it was sold to JPMorgan Chase at a fire-sale price. He then moved to another big firm, which went through a similar near-death experience.
In 2008, even on a good trading day, he said, he and other traders were reluctant to even go out for a drink after work, uncertain if they were going to keep their jobs.
Now, Mr. Gildea said, people are stepping out more, and firms like Cowen are more optimistic about the future. ''Are we back to where we were? Absolutely not,'' he said. ''Many people in our industry have learned to live more responsibly, but there is a definite buzz on the Street that hasn't been there in some time.''
J.T. Cacciabaudo, head of equity trading and sales trading at the regional brokerage firm Sterne Agee agrees, saying while there is some concern in the market about the fourth quarter and how it will end, optimism about the longer term ''has come back'' and firms like his are in growth mode.
''Going into the third quarter, there was chatter about layoffs and most of that didn't come to fruition because firms seem more optimistic about 2011 than the past two years,'' he said.
This despite the fact that bonuses on Wall Street are not likely to be up much from last year, though they will still be strong. Over all, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have set aside $89.54 billion this year to pay employees, 2.8 percent less than a year ago, according to data from Nomura.
Total revenue for the five firms, meanwhile, has fallen about 4 percent this year. A study by the influential compensation expert Alan Johnson says broadly that bonuses will be up 5 percent this year across all financial services companies, with employees in some businesses like asset management getting increases of 15 percent.
This is a far cry from 2007, when some firms on Wall Street set records for compensation payouts. That year Goldman Sachs set aside $20.19 billion in compensation and benefits; in 2008, it set aside just half of that amount, $10.93 billion for pay. In 2009, that number climbed to $16.19 billion.
In the years leading up to the credit crisis some executives became famous for their expenditures, like L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco International, whose $6,000 shower curtain became a symbol of unnecessary extravagance.
Some of that excess remains. A Morgan Stanley trader recently tried to hire a dwarf for a bachelor party in Miami, asking the dwarf to meet him at the airport in a ''Men in Black'' style suit, according to e-mail exchanges. The trader, who wanted to handcuff the dwarf to the bachelor, was recently fired.
Most expenditures, however, are for more mainstream indulgences. Marc B. Porter, a senior executive at Christie's, says Wall Street workers for whom the auction market was recently seen as ''out of range'' are pouring back in. This resurgence of activity, he says, has followed the recovery of different economies, be it Hong Kong or the United States.
In recent months, Deborah Killoran, a client of Dr. Fusco's, has been more willing to open the purse strings for cosmetic surgery. This month she is scheduled for an ulthera, a nonsurgical face-lift that costs $3,000 and upward.
Ms. Killoran, who runs a Brooklyn-based insurance company, says that over the last two years she cut her annual spending on cosmetic surgery in half, to about $3,000. She is now spending at pre-2008 levels. ''I have to meet a lot of people, and this is part of investing in myself,'' she said.
For a restaurant like Porter House, a pickup in business means a customer may spend an extra $8 for the Prime Cowboy Rib Steak rather than the Prime New York Strip Steak and eat out twice a month, instead of just once every four weeks. Mr. Lomonaco, the chef, says bookings for private rooms have increased. ''At some point, firms want to reward their people, and they seem more willing to do so this year,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 25, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about Wall Street's return to personal indulgence after the financial crisis misstated the medical specialty of Dr. Francesca J. Fusco, who said her business was rebounding. She is a dermatologist, not a cosmetic surgeon. And a picture caption with the continuation of the article also misstated her specialty, calling her a plastic surgeon.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Additional Exits as Shuffle Of Economic Team Looms

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The departure of a number of administration officials is giving President Obama broader scope to remake his economic team even as the White House prepares to carry out a long-planned shuffle involving two of his closest political advisers.
Michael S. Barr, the assistant Treasury secretary who helped to develop and pass the law overhauling and tightening federal regulations of the financial industry, will be leaving after next week but remains a candidate to head the new consumer financial protection bureau next year, administration officials said Tuesday. Diana Farrell, the deputy director of Mr. Obama's National Economic Council and another architect of the regulatory legislation, will leave at the end of the year, they said. 
Ms. Farrell had taken herself out of contention to succeed her boss Lawrence H. Summers, who is stepping down as head of the National Economic Council and returning to Harvard at the end of the year, administration officials said. A former director at McKinsey & Company, Ms. Farrell is returning to the private sector though not necessarily to her previous employer.
The White House, which has strained relations with the business community, wants someone with business experience to succeed Mr. Summers.
Mr. Obama has interviewed several people, including Roger Altman, an investment banker and a former deputy Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. Also under consideration is Gene Sperling, who was a National Economic Council director under President Bill Clinton and is now an adviser at the Treasury Department. But officials said the president would interview other people for the job and was not likely to make a choice until next month.
The White House has already accelerated plans to begin preparing for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign and coming confrontations with the new Republican majority in the House. David Axelrod, the senior adviser who has spent the last two years just down the hall from the Oval Office, will return home to Chicago soon after the president's State of the Union speech in late January, a senior official said.
Mr. Axelrod's departure from the West Wing is being accelerated at his request, according to a senior White House official familiar with his thinking, so he can take some time off before beginning preparations for the 2012 race.
His departure from the White House will be preceded by the arrival of Mr. Obama's other alter ego: David Plouffe, the manager of the 2008 presidential campaign. Mr. Plouffe is now expected to arrive early in January, officials said.
The swap of the Davids, as they are known among the president's top aides, is the highest-profile midterm change for Mr. Obama, although it is one that will keep intact the tight circle of advisers around him.
A senior official said Mr. Plouffe would most likely take some of Mr. Axelrod's duties as well as some from the deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina, who is also expected to depart for the campaign early next year.
In the second half of Mr. Obama's term, only Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner will remain of the original four principals on his crisis-forged economic team. Preceding Mr. Summers out the doors were Peter R. Orszag, the budget director, and Christina D. Romer, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, who was succeeded by her deputy, Austan D. Goolsbee.
After a long delay, the Senate last week confirmed Jack Lew, a former budget director to Mr. Clinton, to return to the Office of Management and Budget to succeed Mr. Orszag. Still to be chosen is his deputy. Both Mr. Lew, who was deputy secretary of state, and Mr. Goolsbee were hired from within the administration, at a time when Mr. Obama is under increasing pressure to bring in new blood.

HEADLINE: Lower Manhattan Gains Ground as Publishing Hub

BYLINE: By JOTHAM SEDERSTROM

 BODY:
The first moving vans pulled up to 7 Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan early in the evening last Thursday.
By Monday, Newsweek magazine had moved into its new offices, leaving behind the space at 395 Hudson Street it had shared for less than two years with journalists for The Washington Post and Slate. The magazine's editorial staff will now operate out of a 46,176-square-foot office at 7 Hanover that is less than a third of the size of its old space.
For the 77-year-old Newsweek, the move two miles south is one more event in a year that has included the magazine's sale for $1 by the Washington Post Company to the 92-year-old audio equipment magnate Sidney Harman, and its subsequent merger with Tina Brown's online enterprise, The Daily Beast.
''We're a different organization now -- there's no arguing that,'' said Joseph Galarneau, the chief operating officer of Newsweek, who said the new space might also house The Daily Beast in the months to come. ''Clearly, we're under a different ownership, but we're also a smaller organization than we were, and we just have different needs now.'' 
Newsweek is the latest publisher to make the move downtown, drawn by rents that average about $17 a square foot less than Midtown -- an attractive prospect as the industry struggles with declining circulation and advertising rates driven, in part, by online competition.
Once home to The New York World, The New York Tribune and The New York Times, all of which aligned on Park Row near City Hall, the area below Canal Street is slowly re-emerging, a century later, as a publishing hub.
With Conde Nast, The New York Daily News and American Media all planning to join Newsweek and other media groups downtown, some brokers say the area may soon eclipse Midtown and Times Square as a publishing center.
''Clearly, the word is out now,'' said Bradley P. Gerla, executive vice president at CB Richard Ellis who represented 4 New York Plaza in the deal that gave The Daily News 100,000 square feet in the building on Water Street. ''Media companies are taking notice of their competitors-slash-friends, and now they're signing leases downtown. It's no secret that the publishing business isn't doing the numbers they were, but we have the space here that accommodates them.''
Of course, big publishers and media companies like News Corporation, Thomson Reuters, the New York Times Company, Bloomberg and The Associated Press are still in Midtown.
''A lot of the firms are staying in Midtown,'' said Robert P. Stella, an executive vice president at CresaPartners, a real estate advisory firm that has represented The Economist and other media companies in Midtown. ''I think people prefer to stay here if they can afford it, but for those who are having troubles, they have to find ways to cut costs any way they can.''
While lower rents are a draw, the proximity to an array of public transit options and easy access to Brooklyn -- where many employees live -- sweeten the deal.
The move by American Media, which owns and operates more than a dozen newspapers and magazines, including The National Enquirer, the deal to join The Daily News at 4 New York Plaza in May will allow the company to consolidate its publications under one roof. It will also permit expansion to make room for amenities like an in-house photo studio and the ample conference space that many magazine publishers take for granted.
David J. Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, said that when his company acquired Shape and Men's Fitness in 2003, the current office space at 1 Park Avenue South could no longer accommodate its 300 employees.
''We've had to use boardrooms to do fashion shoots,'' said Mr. Pecker, who initially signed a deal earlier this year for 85,000 feet, but then added 15,000 feet more last month. ''We've basically had to shoehorn our people into the building. It's that bad.''
American Media filed for bankruptcy earlier this month, but Mr. Pecker said Chapter 11 proceedings would neither delay the move nor block his company from further expansion plans.
''We already have our electrical plans, and all the architectural drawings are already done,'' Mr. Pecker said. ''So as soon as we come out of bankruptcy, we've already identified our engineer, an architect and a general contractor and we should be starting in January and be finished building out by May.''
The biggest move is that of Conde Nast, which in August signed a letter of intent to relocate to 1 World Trade Center as an anchor tenant. As it did in 1996, when the publisher spearheaded the revival of Times Square by leasing space at 4 Times Square, brokers hope its plans to take up to one million square feet in the 1,776-foot-tall building may persuade other firms to lease there.
Douglas Durst, the chairman of the Durst Organization, which owns 4 Times Square and who also has a large financial stake at 1 World Trade, said the decision by the chairman of Conde Nast, S. I. Newhouse Jr., to relocate by 2014 was driven by a need not only to expand but also to update a space in Times Square that was approaching 15 years of age.
''There's no room for them to expand at 4 Times Square, and they needed another 200,000 square feet or so to consolidate all their business,'' said Mr. Durst, who said one amenity that Conde Nast would definitely receive was a private cafeteria not unlike the showcase one at 4 Times Square designed by Frank Gehry. ''We had some discussions, on and off, about renewing their lease, but the space is going to be 20 years old pretty soon and they didn't want to live through those renovations all over again.''
Media companies who settled in the downtown area several years ago, including Hamptons and Gotham magazines, The American Lawyer and the free daily Metro New York, say they do not regret it.
For Mansueto, a publishing company that owns Inc. and Fast Company, the decision to move to 7 World Trade Center from Midtown in 2007 was met with near-immediate praise, said Jane Berentson, the editor in chief of Inc.
Mansueto employees now enjoy the kind of natural light that is rare in Midtown's canyons of skyscrapers. The move has also allowed the company to host promotional events and parties for advertisers and editorial subjects, like the one it gave this month for its ''30 Under 30'' issue focusing on successful young entrepreneurs.
''Coming into this, we have a great party space, a good kitchen and a big room to lay out all the food,'' Ms. Berentson said. ''That's the kind of thing we wouldn't have done in our old space because we simply didn't have the space or the opportunity for it.''
Samantha Yanks, the editor in chief of Hamptons and Gotham, said the move to 100 Church Street had been an eye-opener for her and others at Niche Media, which leased 45,419 square feet in 2008 after operating on 22nd Street on Park Avenue for years.
''When I was growing up in the city, the only time people went down here was for jury duty,'' said Ms. Yanks, who lives nearby in the West Village. ''But I really shouldn't say anything more because the real estate prices have already started to skyrocket through the roof.''

HEADLINE: DEAL PROFESSOR; For Executives Seeking Absolution, a Double Standard

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer at Shearman & Sterling, is a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
Harry Campbell
This is a tale of two worlds.
In one, Steven L. Rattner is very much at odds with his former private equity firm, the Quadrangle Group. Mr. Rattner has settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission but has been sued by the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, over allegations that he engaged in a kickback scheme involving the state pension fund. Quadrangle has been openly critical of Mr. Rattner, calling his conduct ''inappropriate, wrong and unethical.'' Mr. Rattner appears to have paid the S.E.C.'s $6.2 million fine himself and is not seeking indemnification from Quadrangle. Mr. Rattner, meanwhile, contends that the firm has taken steps ''to seize'' money he is owed.
Compare this with the world of public companies and the relationship between Angelo R. Mozilo and Bank of America. Mr. Mozilo agreed to pay $67.5 million to settle civil fraud charges arising from his time as chief executive of Countrywide Financial. Bank of America, the current owner of Countrywide, has stated that it will, without quibble, indemnify Mr. Mozilo for part of this amount. Bank of America has not laid any of the blame for its current troubles with Countrywide at Mr. Mozilo's feet. 
Why are the two situations so different?
It's simple: Bank of America is a public company, while Quadrangle is a private firm.
In the Bank of America case, if there is a loss it is borne by the public shareholders, the ultimate owners of the bank. But the bank's officers and directors make the decision to indemnify, settle and pay. Since they do not directly bear the cost, these executives regularly agree to or demand broadly written indemnification provisions that act to absolve executives from liability for their wrongs. When a former executive makes a claim under these provisions, the company's current executives usually pay up whether or not these provisions actually cover this conduct.
In contrast, by owning and operating the firm itself, private equity eliminates the incentive for officers and directors to shift costs to shareholders. Private equity firms buy and sell companies and reap profits by their laserlike focus on the bottom line. This extends to the firms themselves.
Because of this, indemnification terms for private equity can often be less expansive than those for public companies. The Quadrangle dispute illustrates that Wall Street is much more vigilant about not letting what it sees as executive misconduct slide when money is on the line.
This is symptomatic of a more general problem.
In the private equity world, investors, known as limited partners, privately bargain for their corporate governance arrangements and the compensation to be paid to the firm's managers, known as general partners.
In the wake of the financial crisis, limited partners are acting to ensure that indemnification provisions do not become overbroad so that executives cannot be easily absolved of their sins.
In 2009, the Institutional Limited Partners Association issued ''The Private Equity Principles,'' a document calling for improved transparency and corporate governance in private equity firms. One principle in the document is that the ability of general partners to claim indemnification for breach of their obligations to the limited partners, known as fiduciary duties, should be cut back.
''Many private equity general and limited partners are closely re-examining indemnification and other corporate governance provisions in light of the financial crisis,'' according to James Silk, a partner specializing in fund formation at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher.
As part of this movement to hold general partners more accountable, major private equity investors like the Oregon Investment Council and Calpers have argued for reduced management fees with direct consequences. Preqin, an industry research firm, reports that in 2009 the management fee for new funds of more than $1 billion dropped by 17 percent from 2008.
Private equity reforms are again in stark contrast to what occurs at public companies. Almost without exception, public companies agree to indemnify executives for wrongful acts not committed in bad faith. The result is that unless the executive is proved to have deliberately undertaken a wrongful act, the executive is not liable to the company and will be indemnified for any government fines.
Public companies go even further when they acquire another company. In these cases, buyers almost always broadly indemnify executives of target companies. Bank of America, in its acquisition of Countrywide, agreed to indemnify Mr. Mozilo for any claim brought without regard to whether he had acted in bad faith. JPMorgan Chase agreed to a similar provision for James E. Cayne and other executives and directors in the Bear Stearns deal. This is a startlingly broad indemnification, which the courts have upheld.
Indemnification in some form is usually appropriate in both private and public contexts. Executives and directors do not want to be held liable for suits, frivolous or otherwise, for decisions made in the good-faith operation of the business. The Mozilo case shows that executives can let the protection go too far. Executives are being allowed to escape responsibility for wrongdoing no matter how egregious. And let's not even talk about efforts to limit excessive executive compensation. These appear to be going nowhere.
Unlike in the private equity world, in the public company sphere there is no movement to cut back on expansive indemnification provisions and hold executives more accountable.
If private companies are willing to take a new look at indemnification and take a harder line with their executives, perhaps public companies should, too. Are the expansive indemnification provisions provided by public companies really necessary, or do they allow executives to escape penalty for their wrongdoing? In particular, the practice of broadly indemnifying executives in acquisitions may be too beneficent; I've never seen a board reject a takeover offer because its executives are not receiving sufficient indemnification. Public companies may also want to rethink their practices of quickly paying out when executives claim indemnification.
Perhaps public company executives should be forced to start treating executives the same as Wall Street executives treat each other.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: At a 2008 Stop, Obama Promotes His Policies

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
KOKOMO, Ind. -- President Obama came to this manufacturing city in the Midwest to make the case for the effectiveness of his economic policies, telling workers that the return of jobs to auto plants in the area is a harbinger of a nationwide recovery.
In a rare appearance with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Obama said he acted aggressively to save the automobile industry because ''we had confidence in the American worker.'' 
''Today,'' he added, ''we know that was the right decision.''
''We're coming back,'' Mr. Obama told cheering workers at a Chrysler plant here that manufactures transmissions. ''We're on the move.''
He said that thanks in part to government policies, American car manufacturers were poised to hire more workers as the automobile industry remakes itself.
The White House said the point of the visit was to check up on how Kokomo, which was hard hit by the recession, was doing two years after Mr. Obama visited the city during the 2008 campaign. The White House deputy press secretary, Bill Burton, said the trip was not about the 2012 election.
But the visit by the president and vice president had the feel of a campaign swing. Mr. Obama even tapped some of the rhetoric of unity that he used in 2008, telling workers that Democrats and Republicans ''have got to put aside our differences.''
Mr. Obama had an ideal occasion -- a speech at a car plant -- to roll out his favorite metaphor from his midterm campaign appearances about how the American economy was like a car that Republicans ran into a ditch and then abandoned, only to ask for the keys back after Mr. Obama dug the car and the economy out of the hole. But he did not touch it, instead adopting more conciliatory talk.
''The election's over,'' he said. ''The most important challenge we face is not between Democrats and Republicans, it's between America and our competitors.''
He also called on Democrats and Republicans to resolve the issue of the Bush-era tax cuts, although he did not restate his position that the cuts for the richest Americans should be allowed to expire.
Mr. Obama's first big domestic trip since the midterm elections, which ushered his Democratic Party out of control of the House, brought him to a state that he improbably carried in 2008. Indiana is traditionally Republican territory, and home to two potential Republican candidates in the next presidential election, Gov. Mitch Daniels and Representative Mike Pence.
The state represents both the promise for Mr. Obama in the next election, and the challenges that await him. The state's brief foray into Democratic territory seems all but forgotten now amid the economic crisis; for Mr. Obama to win re-election in 2012, many political observers say, he will have to convince Americans that he has led a comeback in American jobs.
The auto industry is pivotal to that effort, and Mr. Obama will surely continue to make the case that without his aggressive moves to save General Motors, for instance, the American automobile industry would be in far more dire straits.
Upon his arrival in Indiana Tuesday morning, Mr. Obama worked a rope line of military families awaiting the arrival of Air Force One at Grissom Air Reserve Base.
Then he and Mr. Biden made an unannounced stop at the Kokomo Fire Department, where they chatted with firefighters who had been laid off and then rehired thanks to a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
After that, it was on to another unannounced stop at Sycamore Elementary School, where about 300 students, screaming deliriously, stretched their hands toward the two men.
''He touched me! He touched me!'' one girl yelled, after Mr. Obama shook her hand.
Mr. Biden, for his part, emphasized his own manufacturing background, telling workers at the plant that his father worked in autos.
After the speech at Chrysler, the two men made a surprise visit to the Gingerbread House Bakery, where they chatted with owners who told them that a loan from the Small Business Administration helped keep their business afloat.

HEADLINE: Fed Debated A Target For Inflation

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Nearly three weeks before they announced a $600 billion effort to shore up the economy, Federal Reserve officials debated whether to adopt formal targets for inflation and long-term interest rates, and whether the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, should ''hold occasional press briefings.''
The ideas were not acted upon, but the discussion suggested a desire among Fed officials to at least discuss altering how the central bank approached monetary policy in a sluggish economy, and how it communicated with the public. The ideas are likely to be debated again against the backdrop of a political maelstrom that has followed the Fed's recent decision to resume large-scale purchases of Treasury securities to jolt the weak recovery.
On Tuesday, the Fed released minutes of the Nov. 2-3 meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, during which it approved the asset-purchase strategy. The minutes also included a video conference the committee held on Oct. 15, the first such unannounced meeting since May 9, when officials met to discuss the European debt crisis. 
Economists widely agree that a low, steady inflation rate is best for economic growth. As an economics professor, Mr. Bernanke called for the Fed to officially announce an inflation target -- say, 2 percent or slightly less. Such a target, like those used by the central banks in Britain, Canada, and elsewhere, could enhance transparency and predictability. But opponents say it could restrict the Fed's flexibility, forcing it to stick with a target even in the face of an external shock to the economy.
After becoming chairman in 2006, Mr. Bernanke largely put the inflation-targeting debate on the back burner, partly out of political considerations. The Fed is required by law to keep prices stable and to maximize employment, and some members of Congress fear that an explicit inflation target would lead to one side of the ''dual mandate'' having priority over the other.
Moreover, in quarterly projections like one released Tuesday, Fed committee members set out long-run estimates that the markets view as implicit targets. Fed officials now expect inflation to be 1.6 to 2.0 percent, and unemployment to be 5 to 6 percent, over an unspecified long run.
In the new projections, the Fed revised downward its forecast for economic growth this year and over the next two years.
Fed officials now expect gross domestic product to rise by 2.4 to 2.5 percent this year, down from their June projection of 3 to 3.5 percent. The economy is expected to grow slightly more next year, by 3 to 3.6 percent.
Those growth rates are not enough to substantially reduce joblessness, and Fed officials now believe that unemployment could exceed 9 percent in 2011 and 8 percent in 2012. Moreover, most of them anticipate that it could take until 2013 or later for inflation to get back up to the unofficial target of about 2 percent.
Expectations of anemic growth were a principal reason behind the decision to resume the asset-buying strategy known as quantitative easing, which has come under attack by foreign central banks, conservative Republicans, Tea Party advocates and political commentators like Sarah Palin. Making matters even more complicated for the Fed, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, a maverick liberal Democrat of Ohio who has been highly critical of the Fed, on Tuesday said he would lead a Nov. 30 hearing to scrutinize the Fed's latest actions.
The decision to hold a preparatory meeting on Oct. 15 suggests that officials felt they needed time beyond their regularly scheduled meetings to fully debate all the issues.
Mr. Bernanke has justified the Nov. 3 decision in terms of both parts of the mandate, saying inflation is too low and unemployment too high. The inflation-targeting debate is not just an academic matter. A leading House Republican called last week for Congress to narrow the Fed's mandate to focus only on fighting inflation, not on managing employment.
In addition, several Fed officials, notably Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, have called for a variation of inflation targeting called price-level targeting. The idea is to let inflation run a bit higher in the future to make up for inflation being too low today, and thereby lessen the risk of slipping into deflation. Inflation targeting, in contrast, would not take account of past inflation but instead focus on future inflation.
Along with inflation and price-level targeting, the committee also discussed in mid-October whether the Fed should aim to set certain interest rates, like the yield for the benchmark 10-year Treasury note.
The Fed already sets a target for a benchmark short-term rate: the federal funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight. That rate has been essentially zero since December 2008. And setting targets for long-term rates is not unprecedented. The Fed did so during World War II to help finance federal deficits. But committee members appeared to have set aside the idea for now, according to the minutes, because of ''the risk that the Federal Reserve might find itself buying undesirably large amounts of the relevant security in order to keep its yield close to the target level.''
Anticipating the import of their coming vote, Fed officials discussed at the October whether Mr. Bernanke should brief the media ''to provide more detailed information to the public'' than the short, formal statements the committee normally releases after its meetings.
The Nov. 2-3 meeting was marked by even more vigorous debate, even if the conclusion was largely foregone, the minutes show.
Most officials thought the asset purchases would help push down long-term rates and bolster the prices of stocks and other assets, while ''some observed that it could also lead to a reduction in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.''
But some officials thought the action ''would have only a limited effect on the pace of the recovery.'' They argued that the slow recovery would not respond to additional monetary stimulus and ''that additional action would be warranted only if the outlook worsened and the odds of deflation increased materially.''
In addition, some skeptics said the action would ''put unwanted downward pressure on the dollar's value in foreign exchange markets,'' while others said it ''could cause an undesirably large increase in inflation.''
Observers said the minutes, which do not identify which officials held which views, did not shed much light on whether the Fed would ultimately carry out its plan to buy $600 billion of Treasury securities -- or even extend the purchases beyond June, if necessary.
Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to investors that an extension of quantitative easing ''remains significantly more likely than an early curtailment (as long as the Fed retains its independence) even if the recent improved tone of the economic data continues.''
Ian Shepherdson, an analyst at High Frequency Economics, said the minutes did not reveal how the Fed arrived at the $600 billion figure. ''We still don't know if this was the amount proposed by Mr. Bernanke or whether he asked for more but had to compromise,'' Mr. Shepherdson wrote in a report for investors. ''Neither do we know what criteria the Fed will use to judge the success or otherwise of the program, beyond broad statements to the effect that they would like faster growth and higher inflation.''

HEADLINE: Mistrust of Government, Crystallized

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
The latest controversy to envelop the Obama administration is only partly about the specific rules governing body scanners and pat-downs. It has to do, too, with the federal agency Congress created to deal with airline security and the tension that has been building for years between its latex-gloved employees and the traveling public.
In this way, the ''Don't touch my junk'' fiasco raises, yet again, what has become the central theme of Mr. Obama's presidency: America's faltering confidence in the ability of government to make things work. From stimulus spending and the health care law to the federal response to oil in the Gulf of Mexico, Mr. Obama has continually stumbled -- blindly, it seems -- into some version of the same debate, which is about whether we can trust federal bureaucracies to expand their reach without harming citizens or industry. 
Not long ago, this question seemed to have been mostly settled in American politics. The triumph of Ronald Reagan and his conservative argument throughout the 1980s had the effect of discrediting the liberal notion of sprawling government that had dominated the 20th century. Even Bill Clinton succeeded by incorporating this argument, vowing to reform unwieldy bureaucracies and to bring ''the era of big government'' to its close.
Then came the unraveling of the second Bush administration and the 2008 election, which persuaded a lot of long-dispirited liberals that their philosophy, and not simply their party, had been restored. The election of Mr. Obama and his formidable majorities in Congress, installed over the course of successive elections, was seen in some quarters of the Democratic Party as an ideological vindication -- a sign that voters had judged rigid conservatism a failure and were at last ready to embrace a more expansive government.
These Democrats subscribed to the historical frame put forth by the liberal academic Sean Wilentz, who in 2008 published a book titled ''The Age of Reagan: 1974-2008.'' Mr. Wilentz afforded Mr. Reagan significant credit as a pivotal American president, but the very title of his book advanced the case that Reaganism as a political philosophy was on the wane. In this interpretation of events, Mr. Wilentz and other liberal thinkers seemed to cast the entire era as something of an interlude, an ideological detour on the way from Lyndon Johnson's Great Society to Mr. Obama's modern brand of liberalism -- whatever that ultimately turned out to be.
The problem with this interpretation, it turns out, is that the elections of 2006 and 2008 were not a resounding mandate for some new (or old) ideological direction, but rather a rejection of the governing culture in Washington -- partisanship, extremism, pettiness.
Consider a survey last month conducted by the Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg for the liberal Campaign for America's Future, which the group has cited to buttress its case that voters are prone to accept liberal arguments. Even in this poll, 76 percent of voters agreed that the top priority in Washington should be to ''reduce the size of government and the deficit.'' And a plurality of voters (50 percent) said they were more worried about government spending and taxes than they were about government failing to invest in job creation.
For all its proposed expansions of government at a time of economic crisis, the White House has only sporadically and in limited ways focused its attention on reforming bureaucracies in the way that Mr. Clinton did. And even in their policy successes, the administration and its Congressional allies have sometimes furthered the image of government as less than ruthlessly efficient.
Take the ''cash for clunkers'' program last year, which Democrats considered a masterstroke, since it led to a spike in sales for domestic automakers and made some modest contribution to air quality to boot. At the same time, though, the program almost immediately exceeded its $1 billion budget, causing lawmakers to scramble for more money while car dealers, already struggling to pay their bills, waited in vain for the government to reimburse them for their rebate checks.
The program may have been an economic success, but it had to be shut down months ahead of schedule. To a lot of casual observers it probably came across as a classic case of bureaucratic confusion involving a few billion dollars -- at exactly the moment that the administration was making its case for a $1 trillion overhaul of the health care system.
It's not hard to see how the sudden uproar over body scanners -- however critical for airline security -- plays into this larger mistrust. The Transportation Security Administration grew out of a moment in 2001 when Americans seemed open to the notion of a more expansive federal presence. But as memories receded and no other planes became weapons of mass destruction (a testament, in part, to the T.S.A.'s diligence), the urgency of that moment gave way to frustration with a constantly changing array of orders -- ''Hand over the toothpaste! Lose the baby milk!'' -- meant to thwart one new threat or another.
White House aides expressed shock this week at how controversial the T.S.A. has now become. They seem to regard this latest argument as a distraction from the security issues that matter more, not to mention a showcase for hypocrisy, since a lot of the Republicans now attacking them have called in the past for stricter screening.
But this is just the latest iteration of a larger debate that surrounds much of what Mr. Obama does. And, just as with the health care protests and the reaction to the BP oil spill, the administration's surprise seems to indicate that it still doesn't quite get what that debate is really about.

HEADLINE: SOUTH KOREANS AND U.S. TO STAGE A JOINT EXERCISE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK McDONALD; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Mark McDonald from Seoul, South Korea. Mark Landler and Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington, and Martin Fackler from Tokyo.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and South Korea's president agreed Tuesday night to hold joint military exercises as a first response to North Korea's deadly shelling of a South Korean military installation, as both countries struggled for the second time this year to keep a North Korean provocation from escalating into war.
The exercise will include sending the aircraft carrier George Washington and a number of accompanying ships into the region, both to deter further attacks by the North and to signal to China that unless it reins in its unruly ally it will see an even larger American presence in the vicinity.
The decision came after Mr. Obama attended the end of an emergency session in the White House Situation Room and then emerged to call President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea to express American solidarity and talk about a coordinated response. 
But as a former national security official who dealt frequently with North Korea in the Bush administration, Victor Cha, said just a few hours before the attack began, North Korea is ''the land of lousy options.''
Mr. Obama is once again forced to choose among unpalatable choices: responding with verbal condemnations and a modest tightening of sanctions, which has done little to halt new attacks; starting military exercises that are largely symbolic; or reacting strongly, which could risk a broad war in which South Korea's capital, Seoul, would be the first target.
The decision to send the aircraft carrier came as the South Korean military went into what it termed ''crisis status.'' President Lee said he would order strikes on a North Korean base if there were indications of new attacks.
North Korea's artillery shells fell on Yeonpyeong Island, a fishing village whose residents fled by ferry to the mainland city of Inchon -- where Gen. Douglas MacArthur's troops landed 60 years ago this fall, three months after the outbreak of the Korean War.
Today, Inchon is the site of South Korea's main international airport, symbolizing the vulnerability of one of the world's most vibrant economies to the artillery of one of the world's poorest and most isolated nations.
A senior American official said that an early American assessment indicated that a total of about 175 artillery shells were fired by the North and by the South in response on Tuesday.
But an American official who had looked at satellite images said there was no visible evidence of preparations for a general war. Historically, the North's attacks have been lightning raids, after which the North Koreans have backed off to watch the world's reaction. This one came just hours after the South Koreans had completed a long-planned set of military exercises, suggesting that the North Korean attack was ''premeditated,'' a senior American official said.
Television reports showed large plumes of black smoke spiraling from the island, as dozens of houses caught fire. The shelling killed two marines and wounded 18 people. The South put its fighter planes on alert -- but, tellingly, did not put them in the air or strike at the North's artillery bases. Mr. Obama was awakened at 3:55 a.m. by his new national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, who told him of the attack.
Just 11 days before, North Korea had invited a Stanford nuclear scientist to Yongbyon, its primary nuclear site, and showed him what was described as a just-completed centrifuge plant that, if it becomes fully operational, should enable North Korea to enrich uranium into nuclear fuel and add to its arsenal of 8 to 12 nuclear weapons.
Taken together, the nuclear demonstration and the attack were widely interpreted as an effort to bolster the credentials of Kim Jong-un, the heir apparent as the country's leader, and the son and grandson of the only two men who have run the country. When his father, Kim Jong-il, North Korea's ailing leader, was establishing his credentials, the North conducted a similar series of attacks.
''They have a 60-year history of military provocations -- it's in their DNA,'' said a senior administration official. ''What we are trying to do is break the cycle,'' a cycle, he said, that has North Korea's bad behavior rewarded with ''talks, inducements and rewards.'' He said that the shelling would delay any effort to resume the six-nation talks about the North's nuclear program.
While Mr. Obama was elected on a promise of diplomatic engagement, his strategy toward the North for the past two years, called ''strategic patience,'' has been to demonstrate that Washington would not engage until the North ceased provocations and demonstrated that it was living up to past commitments to dismantle, and ultimately give up, its nuclear capacity.
The provocations have now increased markedly, and it is not clear what new options are available. Beijing's first reaction on Tuesday was to call for a resumption of the six-nation talks involving North and South Korea, Russia, Japan, China and the United States. The last meeting was two years ago, at the end of the Bush administration.
Mr. Obama's aides made it clear in interviews that the United States had no intention of returning to those talks soon. But its leverage is limited.
When North Korea set off a nuclear test last year just months after Mr. Obama took office, the United States won passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution that imposed far harsher sanctions. The sanctions gave countries the right, and responsibility, to board North Korean ships and planes that landed at ports around the world and to inspect them for weapons. The effort seemed partly successful -- but the equipment in the centrifuge plant is so new that it is clear that the trade restrictions did not stop the North from building what Siegfried S. Hecker, the visiting scientist, called an ''ultramodern'' nuclear complex.
By far the biggest recent disruption of relations came in March, when a sudden explosion sank a South Korean warship, killing 46 sailors. South Korean and international investigators said the blast was caused by a North Korean torpedo. The North has vehemently denied it. If the North was responsible for the sinking, it would be the most lethal military attack since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
President Lee of South Korea decided not to respond militarily to the sinking and was praised by Washington for his restraint. To make North Korea pay a price, he imposed new food restrictions on the North and ended trade worth several hundred million dollars that had been intended to induce the desperately poor North Koreans to choose income over military strikes. But some analysts believe that the cutoff in food aid was an excuse, if not a motivation, for Tuesday's attack.
Choi Jin-wook, a North Korea expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a research institute in Seoul, said, ''It's a sign of North Korea's increasing frustration.''
''Washington has turned a deaf ear to Pyongyang, and North Korea is saying: 'Look here. We're still alive. We can cause trouble. You can't ignore us.' ''
Yet for Mr. Obama, much stronger responses, including a naval quarantine of the North, carry huge risks. A face-off on the Korean Peninsula would require tens of thousands of troops, air power and the possibility of a resumption of the Korean War, a battle that American officials believe would not last long, but might end in the destruction of Seoul if the North unleashed artillery batteries near the border.
Pressing against a precipitous reaction is that the North's attacks have a choreographed character, even a back-to-the-future feel. The last time North Korea engaged in acts this destructive was in the 1980s, when it blew up a South Korean airliner and also detonated a bomb in Myanmar in a botched attempt to assassinate the visiting South Korean president. Both attacks were said to be ordered by Kim Jong-il, who was then the heir to Kim Il-sung, his father and North Korea's founder.
Now Mr. Kim's youngest son, Kim Jong-un, is in that position. He was promoted on Sept. 28 to the rank of four-star general, a prerequisite for his ascendancy to power. Many see these attacks as the effort of a man the Chinese now say is 25 years old to establish his military credentials.

HEADLINE: Santa's Price Point? 63 Cents

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Midway through last year, as analysts tried to predict where the economy was going, the toy maker Bill Nichols decided he had the answer. He bet that the economy would still be so shaky this holiday season that a bargain-priced plastic toy would take off.
With the help of ''mommy bloggers'' and a tepid economy, Mr. Nichols turned the squishy toys, named Squinkies, into a fad. Walmart.com has been sold out of them for more than a week, and stores nationwide are sold out or limiting how many Squinkies each person can buy. Like Beanie Babies or Zhu Zhu Pets, the toys are collectible -- the hundreds of characters include a Lhasa apso dog and a tiny bride -- but they are much cheaper, selling for $10 for a 16-pack.
''Demand is tight,'' said Laura Phillips, senior vice president for toys and seasonal merchandising at Wal-Mart. ''Mom doesn't feel bad -- 'I can get into it and my child can really enjoy it,' '' she said. ''Absolutely that matters in this economy.'' 
And children cannot seem to resist scooping up the latest toys, which come in plastic bubbles, as a vending machine would dispense, or pronouncing the Squinkies name with glee. (Mr. Nichols described it as made up, but one that was ''fun, memorable and came off the tongue easy.'')
Mr. Nichols's toy story has defied the odds at a tough time for small manufacturers. His company, Blip Toys, is a 16-person operation in Minnetonka, Minn. It faces competition from giants like Mattel and Hasbro with multimillion-dollar advertising budgets. Big retailers, like Toys ''R'' Us, Target and Wal-Mart, all want exclusive toys to offer. Independent retailers who might take a chance on smaller manufacturers have all but disappeared.
It is also a dicey time for simple toys, often overshadowed during the holidays by games and gadgets featuring the latest technology. A best-selling toy these days has to reflect market research, sell at a certain price and spur interest from customers even before it is on shelves. But Mr. Nichols seems to have a hit on his hands.
''They hit the sweet spot for what's hot in girls these days,'' said Gerrick Johnson, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.
Squinkies are sold out or on back order at many stores, and Mr. Nichols is busily expanding the line, with sets for boys based on characters like Spider-Man and new dolls based on Barbie and Hello Kitty.
Mr. Nichols began by walking through stores, finding an opening in what's known as the small-doll aisle, where My Little Pony and Littlest Pet Shop had reigned for years. ''All of those brands have been there for a long time, and there's not a lot of innovation,'' he said.
In the eight years since he founded Blip Toys, Mr. Nichols has had enough success with novelty items that he can get meetings with Target, Toys ''R'' Us and Wal-Mart. From Wal-Mart, he heard that vending-machine concepts were popular in its Japanese division, Seiyu.
Mr. Nichols researched the size of the industry. Vending machines sold billions of dollars of goods a year. That prompted the idea for the toys, squishy rubber characters about the size of a knuckle that come in plastic bubbles.
Kids can also buy play sets, like one that resembles a gumball machine, and insert plastic coins to dispense Squinkies. ''Kids are seeing this every day, when they're walking into every mall they go to,'' he said. ''There's no learning curve.''
Though he was aiming for an affordable toy, he also wanted to make them collectible, like last year's hit toy, the plush hamsters called Zhu Zhu Pets. Blip created hundreds of characters, and each package of Squinkies includes at least four characters. ''With one purchase, the child will become an instant collector,'' he said.
Mr. Johnson, the toy analyst, said that was smart. ''You're creating a reason for kids to go out and buy more,'' he said.
Mr. Nichols presented his ideas to the three major toy retailers last December. Rather than having a toy sculptor create samples, he had a factory in China produce and spray-paint the dolls, to prove that this could be done at a low price. Asked if Wal-Mart executives thought it could be done well at the small scale, ''we didn't,'' said Ms. Phillips, the Wal-Mart executive in charge of toys. ''But he really worked hard on the execution.''
The retailers liked the Squinkies well enough. ''The orders were good, but nothing like what we anticipated this could be,'' Mr. Nichols said.
He knew the retailers would test it in August. To pique interest before Squinkies were even on sale anywhere, he reached out to more than 300 bloggers, sending them products for review and giveaways.
Anne McGowan, who runs the blog DealWiseMommy.net, said her son and her nieces understood what the toy was right away, from playing with vending machines in restaurants. And she was relieved at the low price. ''That's one of the best things about the toy: they're not very expensive,'' Ms. McGowan said.
In Waterloo, Ont., Erica Kloetstra, who runs BassGiraffe.com, said the collectible angle pulled in her 4-year-old daughter. ''She's like 'Now we have to get this, and this, and that.' That's why we have so many,'' she said.
While tiny toys can be choking hazards, the retailers and Blip emphasize that the toys are for children age 4 and up. And bloggers noted the same. ''Due to the small size, my son (which is 2) has placed them in his mouth,'' Amanda Blake, who runs FairyGoodMommy.com, wrote, saying that her older daughter now plays with them in her own room. ''I do not recommend anyone under the age listed on the package to play with them or have them lying around.''
''Mommy bloggers are incredibly powerful,'' said Ms. Phillips of Wal-Mart, in part because they explain to their readers what a toy does or what age it's appropriate for. ''Just getting customers aware of what they are, how do they work, what do I do with them'' is quite helpful, Ms. Phillips said.
When the toy hit shelves in August, ''the read was fantastic,'' she said.
At Target, ''we reacted quickly to meet that ongoing demand,'' Casey Carl, who oversees toys and sporting goods for Target, said in an e-mail. Target even created a special in-store display to highlight the Squinkies.
''The initial sales came in so far above plan, it was just amazing,'' said Mr. Nichols, who declined to specify how many Squinkies had sold over all. The retailers all raised their orders. But, with a 60-day turnaround, Mr. Nichols couldn't get the product back in stock quickly enough. As Black Friday approached, Squinkies reached the hot toy list at Toys ''R'' Us, and they were nominated for the Toy of the Year Awards. Retailers were using expensive air freight to ship the toys in time for Black Friday.
Mr. Nichols said he was rushing Squinkies to stores to ride this holiday wave while it lasted.
''Kids move on very quickly,'' he said.

PHOTOS (B3) CHART: Toy Fads: In the toy industry, like in Hollywood, there can be surprise hits. ''Most of the time it's an item that retailers don't expect to be huge, and they underorder,'' said Jim Silver, editor in chief of TimetoPlayMag.com, a toy site.

HEADLINE: U.S. ASKING CHINA TO HELP REIN IN NORTH KOREANS

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and MARTIN FACKLER; Helene Cooper reported from Washington, and Martin Fackler from Seoul, South Korea. Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Wednesday began a broad effort to enlist China to help rein in North Korea in the wake of its deadly attack Tuesday on South Korea.
Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urged China to act, calling Beijing ''absolutely critical'' to the international effort to get North Korea to stop its military provocations. ''It's very important for China to lead,'' Admiral Mullen said Wednesday on the ABC program ''The View.'' ''The one country that has influence in Pyongyang is China.''
President Obama was preparing to make a personal telephone plea to President Hu Jintao of China, White House officials said. They added that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is likely to call China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, to follow up on similar calls from other senior American officials to their Chinese counterparts.
But few analysts expect China, wary of destabilizing the North, its unpredictable neighbor, to employ its economic and military leverage in any substantial way to try to alter its behavior. And in Seoul, the South Korean government was left struggling to find the right response, as President Lee Myung-bak found himself with no clear way to proceed despite his past vows to take a hard line against the North. 
Mr. Lee spent Wednesday conferring with stern-faced generals and talking on the phone with world leaders like Mr. Obama, who offered him sympathy and support over the artillery attack on Tuesday on a South Korean island, the latest in a series of provocations by the North.
Mr. Lee's government traded threats with the North, warning of heavy retaliation should it attack again, while the North warned against even the slightest incursions into its territory.
But despite the strong words, South Korea is showing few signs of planning a more forceful retaliation to the attack on Yeonpyeong Island, which killed two civilians and two marines. While it placed its armed forces on high alert and sent F-15 fighter jets to the area, South Korea's only military response so far came during the attack itself, when marines on the island returned fire at North Korean positions.
On Thursday, the South's government ordered the deployment of extra troops on islands near the disputed border with North Korea, Reuters reported
On Wednesday, during an emergency session of the National Assembly, South Korea's legislature, right-wing lawmakers called for bolder military action in response to the shelling and criticized Mr. Lee for not retaliating with greater force right away.
''North Korea's artillery stronghold should have been destroyed three minutes after the attack,'' said one lawmaker, Song Kwang-ho. ''South Korea's air force sallied forth but did not attack. The gong sounded, and it's too late now. Where were our resolute measures?''
The impasse underscored the quandary both countries face: neither the strengthened sanctions Mr. Obama and Mr. Lee pushed after a North Korean nuclear test last year, nor the resumed aid and diplomacy Mr. Lee tried just a few months ago, have persuaded the North to cooperate with the outside world.
For that reason, both have looked to China for crucial assistance. The reclusive government in North Korea is diplomatically isolated to begin with; its sole big supporter is China.
But while China has in the past tried to influence North Korea, it has been reluctant to do so in recent months. The reason in part, analysts say, is that Beijing does not want to destabilize the North when it is in the middle of a succession process brought on by the illness of its leader, Kim Jong-il, who is believed to be making way for one of his sons, Kim Jong-un, to take over.
''Beijing doesn't want the collapse of the regime,'' said Victor Cha, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. China, said Mr. Cha, who worked at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, has ''made the core strategic calculation that unification of the North and the South, with the United States as an ally, is not in Chinese interests.''
That puts the Obama administration and South Korea in the precarious position of trying to press Beijing to take a stand that China's leaders do not believe to be in China's best interests -- a tough job under any circumstances, but particularly now, during North Korea's succession.
Mr. Obama's decision to accelerate the deployment of an American aircraft carrier group to the region is intended to prod the Chinese. American officials hope that by presenting Beijing with an unpalatable result -- the expansion of American maneuvers off its shores -- China will decide that pressing North Korea is the lesser of two evils.
Pentagon officials said the joint exercise in waters west of the Korean Peninsula would run Sunday to Wednesday. Military officials said the carrier George Washington had been preparing to sail from its port in Japan to join the Japanese Navy in an exercise to begin Dec. 3. After the artillery exchange between the two Koreas, the carrier was ordered to drill with South Korea's navy before joining the Japanese.
''To the Chinese, the message is that if North Korea undertakes actions such as uranium enrichment or the attack on the South that threaten our equities, the U.S. will respond in ways that negatively affect China's perceived interests,'' a senior administration official said on Wednesday. ''The response is directed at messaging North Korea and reassuring South Korea, but China clearly does not like to see U.S. aircraft carriers, for example, in the Yellow Sea.''
The administration is also considering additional joint exercises with South Korea, administration officials said, although they declined to say exactly what form those largely symbolic exercises might take. One administration official said the additional exercises could include naval and air exercises, or even exercises involving ground troops.
Beijing was largely silent eight months ago, when North Korea was accused of sinking a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, and killing 46 sailors.
Similarly, Beijing did not have much to say this week, after a visiting American nuclear scientist reported that North Korea had shown him what was described as a just completed centrifuge plant that, if it becomes fully operational, could enable North Korea to enrich uranium into nuclear fuel and add to its arsenal of 8 to 12 nuclear weapons.
''We would welcome a more clear-cut Chinese position, differentiating between the aggressor and the victim in the attack,'' the Obama administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity under diplomatic rules. ''And making clear the unacceptability of uranium enrichment. We'd like to see a more clear-cut Chinese position on both of those issues.''
Mr. Lee, who took office taking a tough line against the North, now finds himself under pressure for not being tough enough. ''There is widespread disappointment with Lee Myung-bak for being too prudent and restrained,'' said Oh Kyoung-seok, a researcher on inter-Korean relations at the Sejong Institute. ''First we endured the Cheonan and now this. We are sending North Korea the message that they can do whatever they please.''

HEADLINE: North Korea Will Never Play Nice

BYLINE: By B. R. MYERS. 
B. R. Myers, the director of the international studies department at Dongseo University, is the author of ''The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves -- and Why It Matters.''

 BODY:
Busan, South Korea
WHILE it is cowardly and foolish not to resist an act of aggression, the best way to deal with a provocation is to ignore it -- or so we are taught. By refusing to be provoked, one frustrates and therefore ''beats'' the provoker; generations of bullied children have been consoled with this logic. And so it is that the South Korean and American governments usually refer to North Korea's acts of aggression as ''provocations.''
The North's artillery attack on a populated South Korean island is now getting the same treatment, with the South's president, Lee Myung-bak, vowing that Pyongyang will be ''held responsible'' and that ''additional provocative acts'' will be punished ''several times over.'' 
There is no reason that North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong-il, should take those words seriously. Mr. Lee made similar noises in March, when the North was accused of killing 46 South Korean sailors by torpedoing a naval vessel, the Cheonan, and what was the result? A pacifist South Korean electorate punished Mr. Lee's party in regional elections, and the attack faded from the headlines.
The North's attack on Yeonpyeong Island has been more shocking to South Koreans, but not much more. At my local train station the morning after the attack, a grinning crowd watched coverage of the Asian Games in China on a giant TV screen. The same ethno-nationalism that makes South Koreans such avid followers of international sports also dilutes their indignation at their Northern brethren. South Korea's left-wing press, which tends to shape young opinion, is describing the shelling of the island as the inevitable product of ''misunderstandings'' resulting from a lack of dialogue.
Sadly, South Korea's subdued response to such incidents makes them more likely to happen again. This poses a serious problem for the United States; we have already been drawn into one war on the peninsula because our ally seemed unlikely to defend itself.
Unfortunately, Washington shares to a certain degree the South Korean tendency to play down North Korean ''provocations.'' In our usage, the word reflects the America-centric perception that everything Kim Jong-il does is aimed at eliciting a reaction from Washington. His actions are trivialized accordingly, to the extent that our top policymakers have publicly compared him to a squalling, attention-hungry child.
Not surprisingly, then, the artillery attack on Yeonpyeong is seen by many Americans as an effort to force us to make concessions, to reopen negotiations, and so on. Thus we can pretend that simply by leaving sanctions in place, we are really hanging tough, even pursuing a ''hard-line'' policy.
The provocation view of North Korea's actions also prevents us from seeing them in context. Since a first naval skirmish in the Yellow Sea near Yeonpyeong in 1999, there has been a steady escalation in North Korea's efforts to destabilize the peninsula. In 2002, another naval skirmish killed at least four South Korean sailors; in 2006 the North conducted an underground nuclear test; in 2009 it launched missiles over the Sea of Japan, had another nuclear test and declared the Korean War armistice invalid; and in March the Cheonan was sunk.
This behavior is fully in keeping with the ultramilitaristic ideology of a regime that remains publicly committed to uniting the peninsula by force: ''Reunification is at the ends of our bayonets,'' as the omnipresent slogan in the North goes.
North Korea cannot hope to win an all-out war, but it may well believe that by incrementally escalating its aggression it can bully the South into giving up -- or at least sharing power in a confederation.
The provocation view of North Korean behavior also distorts our understanding of the domestic situation. Analysts tend to focus too much on the succession issue; they interpret the attack on the island as an effort to bolster the reputation of Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il's son and anointed successor. Their conclusion is that North Korea will play nice once the young man is firmly in power.
In fact, as both its adversaries and supporters should realize, the North can never play nice. Just as our own economy-first governments must ensure growth to stay in power, a military-first regime must deliver a steady stream of victories or lose all reason to exist.
There is no easy solution to the North Korea problem, but to begin to solve it, we must realize that its behavior is aggressive, not provocative, and that its aggression is ideologically built in. Pyongyang is thus virtually predestined to push Seoul and Washington too far, thereby bringing about its own ruin.
The Chinese should take note of this, since their rationalization for continuing to support North Korea derives from the vain hope that they can prop it up indefinitely. The military-first state is going to collapse at some stage; let's do what we can to make that happen sooner rather than later.

HEADLINE: Trained for Battle, Now Operating A Small Business

BYLINE: By PAMELA RYCKMAN

 BODY:
In November 2004, during Justin Bajema's second tour of duty in Iraq, his LAV-25 infantry fighting vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device. Surrounded by heavy machine-gun fire, he was pinned under 28,000 pounds in a drained canal for 40 minutes. ''It threw my vehicle in the air like a toy,'' he recalled. ''I almost lost my leg, almost bled out and died.''
He endured eight operations and spent six weeks in the hospital, but doctors were able to save his left leg. He learned to walk again on a limb with no sensory nerves. ''That experience made me question everything,'' said Mr. Bajema, a Marine corporal. ''I later dropped out of business school because they were teaching me to get a job, but I knew I was here to do more than the daily grind. So I made the decision to start this business.''
In 2008, Mr. Bajema returned to Grand Rapids, Mich., his hometown, and began buying and renovating foreclosed properties with money he had saved while in the service. He was trying to regain the confidence he lost when he was injured in war. ''I was sick of taking orders,'' he said. ''I was looking for a bigger purpose.'' 
While combat veterans face countless challenges in their transitions back to civilian life, Mr. Bajema and many of his peers credit the military with giving them the courage, discipline and determination to start businesses. They believe even harrowing experiences, if managed and overcome, can lend perspective and fearlessness in commerce and provoke that ''healthy discontent with the status quo'' that galvanizes entrepreneurs.
''The Marine Corps instilled a lot of things I've applied to the business world,'' said Mark Llano, who fought in Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf and who, in 2003, founded Source One Distributors, a company based in Wellington, Fla., that simplifies the procurement of tactical equipment by government and law enforcement agencies. ''When I saw an opportunity for this business, I hustled every day, working 80 hours a week. Because of my experience in the Marines, the hard work didn't scare me.''
Like Mr. Llano, many veterans who become entrepreneurs cultivate as clients government agencies that give preference to businesses owned by veterans, especially if they are disabled. ''If you have served in the military and you understand the government, you have knowledge other people don't,'' Mr. Llano said. ''If you can apply that niche to business, it's a home run.''
Veterans have other advantages as well. ''If two people walk in the door with the same idea for a lemonade stand, the veteran will get more assistance than the civilian,'' said James Mingey, a Vietnam veteran and entrepreneur who is president and chief executive of the Veterans Corporation, a nonprofit that fosters business opportunities for veterans.
Mr. Mingey and others in the field said they did not know of anyone keeping definitive statistics on rates of entrepreneurship for veterans, but that they believed the percentage remained small. Those veterans who do start businesses can benefit from many nonprofits and mentoring organizations and vast networks of veterans willing to help, but they also face challenges that veterans of earlier wars did not.
''World War II veterans were a large part of the work force,'' said Kevin McDermott, who in 2007 helped found Patriot Taxiway Industries, an airfield and aircraft lighting provider based in Lomira, Wis., with a fellow Air Force veteran. ''The 1950s workplace they created was a reflection of military culture.'' Recent veterans, however, struggle to reconcile the disparate cultures of the military, which is regimented and hierarchical, and the entrepreneurial realm, which values critical thinking and innovation.
''In the military you're told what you're going to do from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,'' Mr. McDermott said. ''Veterans need to adjust. We give goals or objectives and they need to learn to set their own schedules.''
While military training provides relevant lessons in loyalty and leadership, moving to the private sector can be agonizing. ''When you get out of the military, it's like being hit in the face by a brick wall,'' Mr. Bajema said. ''You don't even know where to start.''
Veterans often lack business education and the ability to translate their skills into desirable qualifications for an employer or client. ''A veteran thinks if he cleaned guns in the military, he'll probably have to do that when he gets out,'' said John Raftery, who was a member of the First Marine Division during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and who founded Patriot Contractors, based in Red Oak, Tex. ''But if you can identify the skills you learned -- like keeping an inventory -- you can apply that to something like a retail career.'' To facilitate the shift, Mr. Raftery and Mr. Bajema attended the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities, a program at Syracuse University that teaches skills like defining a value proposition and taking a product to market.
Communication can be a hurdle. Most civilian employees expect greater diplomacy and tact than is normally afforded military personnel. Mr. Bajema said a substandard employee once cried during a performance review, and later quit. ''It was an eye-opener for me,'' he said. ''In the military there's no sensitivity. I've toned it down and tried to improve myself by asking people I respect how to deliver feedback.''
Some veterans continue to suffer psychological torment long after physical injuries have healed. Of an employee with post-traumatic stress disorder, Mr. McDermott said, ''Some days he's our greatest employee, and other days we have to give him a ride home.''
''We've had over one million people rotate through Iraq -- a million people who've seen their buddies killed and have taken lives,'' Mr. Bajema said. ''We were a heavy combat unit. Three-quarters of my platoon got purple hearts. Those are deep scars. Even if you're not wounded by shrapnel, you're wounded on the inside.''
Still, Mr. Bajema maintains that veterans are disproportionately suited to the sweat and toil of entrepreneurship. His company, Access Property Management, rents residential units Mr. Bajema owns and also leases and manages buildings for others. With eight employees overseeing assets worth nearly $10 million, Mr. Bajema said the company is profitable on revenue of a little more than $1 million a year.
''I saw an incredible opportunity in real estate here,'' he said. ''We bought foreclosures at a deep discount.'' While his hometown has a high unemployment rate, he is betting that a blossoming health science industry will attract people to Grand Rapids and that they will choose to rent, rather than buy, their homes. ''People are scared to buy,'' he said. ''We're seeing increased demand for our properties.''
Now, as he tries to expand Access into a regional company, Mr. Bajema is relying once again on his military training.
''At first it was just me, the lone man in the trenches fighting for survival,'' he said. ''I was trying to do everything myself instead of delegating authority, and I was cheap when I should have spent money to grow my business. I've had to change on the fly.''
Eventually, the increased volume of inquiries persuaded him to hire additional sales representatives.
''It's the same in the military,'' he said. ''You never have the complete picture, but you need to make a decision. You act or you get killed.''
Though he recognizes additional hiring requires a risky outlay of cash, Mr. Bajema is searching for a senior manager or ''lieutenant'' to help spearhead growth.

HEADLINE: Everyday Appliances and Big Ideas

BYLINE: By RIMA SUQI

 BODY:
Clad head to toe in black and carrying a black zippered attache case, Alberto Alessi sat in the lobby of the Gramercy Park Hotel one morning this week looking every bit a member of the Italian design intelligentsia. Mr. Alessi, who is the president and director of marketing strategies and design management of Alessi S.p.A., a company started by his grandfather Giovanni in 1921, was in town after the opening on Sunday of ''Alessi: Ethical and Radical'' at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The exhibition documents the company's collaborations since 1955 with Ron Arad, Michael Graves, the Campana brothers, Ettore Sottsass, Philippe Starck, Alessandro Mendini (who also designed the exhibit) and others.
Sounds like you grew up around some interesting people. 
I started meeting the designers when I was 14 or 15. But when I was very young there was only the factory. I didn't like the factory at all because it was gray, dark and boring. That was my impression. I remember for two years, when I was 13 and 14, during summertime my father made me work in the workshop where they make the metal molds for the products. It was very bad.
Is that why you went to law school?
Law was a compromise with my father. He wanted me to study economics and become a businessman, which was against all my feelings. I wished I could do architecture, and I was interested in art.
But you did use your love of art -- you got Dali to design for you. How did that happen?
Our Spanish agent contacted his agent, and then we met.
It was that easy?
You just have to pay. The idea was instead of the boring coffee makers, we use the same machines and materials for making art multiples. The first collection was five artists, Dali was the sixth. The collection was presented in 1971 and grew to be a big fiasco.
It sounds like an incredible project.
That was the very first thing I did at the company, and I did it by hiding from my father what I was doing.
You have said that by 1974 you proved designer items could sell. What exactly did you have to prove, and to whom?
After the art multiples, I started with more realistic typologies, like asking designers to design trays or baskets. We got important commercial success, so my father started to think maybe I wasn't completely out of the reality. His reality was different than mine.
What was his?
The reality of a businessman running an industrial company after the war.
What was yours?
Mine was to try to change the identity of this boring industrial company, introducing some fun and aesthetics.
So you were a rebel?
Rebel is a big word.
You did succeed in introducing fun and maybe some kitsch, especially with the plastics.
The idea was that the proper design is a good expression of its times. In the beginning of the '90s, we felt it was time to open to young designers, and they brought with them the pressure to open with new materials.
You've said that designers have to tap into the public mood.
Design is a very difficult discipline. You have to feel, to smell the spirit of the times and be able to translate this spirit into a new form, and then to have that form be understood by the marketplace.
I've heard you describe a collection as using the ''child code.'' What does that mean?
I am referring to the theory of affective codes developed by an Italian psychoanalyst named Franco Fornari, based on Kleinian ideals. To make this basic, if you take an object that is very round and soft, this is related to the maternal code. If, instead, you take an angled object, very hard, this is related to the paternal code. Then there are the other codes -- the child code, the erotic code and the birth and death code. So it happens that I classify designers according to the use of these codes.
So Philippe Starck -- -- ?
He is clearly working into the area of the code of birth and death, and the erotic code. If you take Giovannoni, his plastic Alessi product is clearly working with the maternal code and the child code. Minimalists like Piero Lissoni or Jasper Morrison mainly use the paternal code.
How do you know about these codes?
It is part of my job. It's the Italian way to be a design manager.
Meaning you have to be a psychologist?
Yes, I think it may help.
Did you enjoy the opening?
On Friday, I saw Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown after more than 20 years. He was very important to me. And then the following day Michael Graves came to the exhibition in his wheelchair. I didn't see him for maybe 15 years. It was strange to feel that time is passing for all of us. But I have still some maestros alive -- Sapper, Mendini ... .
There may be more -- you just haven't met them yet.
I feel maybe there is no longer a generation of maestros, at least not among the people I am working with. Maybe a great architect, maybe Zumthor.
That sounds pessimistic.
We had, in the 1950s, this phenomenal concentration of talents which has not been repeated -- the brothers Castiglioni, Gae Aulenti, Vico Magistretti, even Gio Ponti. It would be impossible to imagine every 10 or even 20 years to have such a concentration of important people.
Through April 10 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art; information: (215) 763-8100 or philamuseum.org.

HEADLINE: All Is Sparkly For Tiffany

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and GEORGE HAY

 BODY:
Europe may be burning and the United States is smoldering, but the comfortably off are splurging on their blue-boxed trinkets. Tiffany & Company is reaping the benefits, posting double-digit sales growth across the globe in its third quarter, most notably in Europe where receipts rose 22 percent in the period. Together with a bright outlook, that suggests well-heeled and aspirational consumers are not expecting another painful downturn.
In 2008, the near collapse of the financial system unnerved the usually confident, comfortable class. Tiffany's sales tumbled. Its holiday season that year was a disaster, with sales plunging 21 percent. 
It wasn't just consumers wanting to spend their way up the social ladder that dropped off. Even the retailer's traditional customers cut back. That proved that even those with plenty of money -- with the possible exception of the billionaires' club -- needed confidence if they were to indulge themselves.
Now Tiffany's customers are back. Net income rose 27 percent in the quarter ending in October, and the company managed something unthinkable to many other retailers: it successfully passed on price increases. The expectation is for a strong holiday season this year.
One implication of Tiffany's rebound is that the wealthy don't seem concerned about persistently high unemployment in the United States or the potential risks of central banks on both sides of the Atlantic printing money. In Europe, they don't seem held back by worries that the Irish bailout could spill over or that the governments of Portugal and Spain are overstretched.
They didn't see the 2008 financial crisis coming either. But having been bitten then, richer consumers don't seem to be twice shy. Sure, they are insulated from many everyday financial concerns. But if Tiffany's experience is anything to go by, there's little fear of a slide back into the economic abyss. Events could change that, but for now it's one indicator that should give economic worriers a glimmer of hope.
Shrinking Irish Banks
Ireland's bloated banking sector needs fewer, smaller lenders. The expected European bailout should provide breathing space to perform a radical restructuring. But a fire sale of Irish banking assets is not the only way to cut the banks down to size.
The combined liabilities of Ireland's domestic lenders, both private and government-owned, exceed 500 billion euros ($666 billion), or four times the size of the Irish economy. The country's estimated 90-billion-euro bailout will deliver resources to recapitalize the banks and guarantee wholesale financing for several years. In that time, the sector could be redrawn.
Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide are already fully state-owned and their assets are being gradually sold off. The larger Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland have heavy state involvement, with Dublin poised to take majority control of Bank of Ireland.
Allied Irish Bank has about 100 billion euros of loans financed by about 61 billion of deposits. Bank of Ireland has 121 billion euros of loans backed by 75 billion euros of deposits. That implies an uncomfortably high loan-to-deposit ratio of about 160 percent.
Jettisoning noncore British businesses looks like the obvious way to shrink the balance sheets of both large banks. These account for 19 billion euros of loan assets at Allied Irish Banks and 52 billion euros at Bank of Ireland. But selling them outright would mean shedding vital deposits as well, and buyers for just the loan assets would probably drive a hard bargain right now. Shrinking the balance sheet is best deferred until markets improve.
But Ireland could make an early start in shoring up the two big banks' financing mix. One way would be to replace a portion of their wholesale liabilities with Anglo Irish's and Irish Nationwide's 27 billion euros of deposits. That would cut Allied Irish Banks' and Bank of Ireland's loan-to-deposit ratios to about 135 percent.
The Irish banking sector would then have a more appropriate structure. Anglo Irish and Irish Nationwide would no longer take deposits, and their remaining assets would run off under direct state ownership.
Left behind would be two strong domestic players, with effective competition ensured by the presence of a decent foreign-owned rival, Ulster Bank. Over time, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland could also sell their noncore assets and further reduce their reliance on wholesale financing. The journey back to sustainability will take time, but the road map seems clear.

HEADLINE: Reviewing Options for Tax Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Left, Right and Wrong on Taxes'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 16):
Glenn Hubbard articulates a predictable response to the deficit proposal, coming from an economic adviser to President George W. Bush. If cutting marginal tax rates would spur savings and employment, Mr. Hubbard fails to explain why the Bush tax cuts, mostly benefiting corporations and wealthy individuals, generated only a paltry 1.08 million jobs during his presidency. Businesses used those tax breaks to benefit their bottom line and reward themselves in the boardroom with larger bonuses.
Conversely, even with the higher tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals under President Bill Clinton, the economy created 22.7 million jobs. Lack of investment is not the problem. Wall Street has enjoyed a robust decade. But investments have been in capital instead of people, and the dearth of jobs created stagnant wages and few opportunities for everyone else. 
In the face of this empirical evidence, I don't believe that Mr. Hubbard's claims hold up.
Sean LaPides Sunnyvale, Calif., Nov. 16, 2010
To the Editor:
I strongly disagree with Glenn Hubbard's suggestion that tax deductions for mortgage interest payments are most valuable for ''affluent'' households. The wealthy often pay cash for their homes. But the elimination of this deduction would powerfully affect the already strapped middle-class homeowner struggling to forestall foreclosure.
Further, the elimination of the deduction for charitable contributions acts as a strong disincentive for affluent and middle-class taxpayers to take up the slack in services to the poor and underserved in our communities.
If government is compelled to cut funding for arts, education and food for the needy, the community welcomes the largess of those willing and able to help. At the very least, help at tax time is a gesture of appreciation.
Changes in tax policy like these will further stratify the American economy and accelerate the erosion of our quality of life.
Toby DeVoss Las Cruces, N.M., Nov. 17, 2010
To the Editor:
Our ''difficult situation,'' as Glenn Hubbard puts it, is not ''because we have designed entitlements for a welfare state we cannot afford.'' Our ''difficult situation'' is a result of undertaxing the extremely rich, overspending on the military and deregulating the financial system.
In short, our difficult situation is entirely because of the ability of the right to protect the extremely rich from taxes and regulation and the inability of the left to get popular support for needed tax reforms.
We can afford to help those who need help, to provide a robust Social Security system and to provide health care. We cannot not afford these programs. It is our overly complicated tax system full of loopholes secured by lobbyists, our military spending and general waste that have put us in debt.
We need to increase tax rates on the very rich, reduce their deductions, have a national sales tax, impose a revenue tax on corporations, impose a luxury tax on high-end cars, paintings, clothes and jewelry, and maintain ''entitlements'' that are well run, while reducing our debt.
The free ride we have given the rich has not helped our economy or our ability to maintain a surplus in the Treasury. Sadly, the Obama administration has failed to get this message across or to take meaningful action.
Joel E. Davidson Orangeburg, N.Y., Nov. 17, 2010
To the Editor:
In addressing the report of the Bowles-Simpson commission, Glenn Hubbard writes that ''tax policies must be changed to encourage productive investment over consumption.''
Why then does he suggest that ''the proposed increase in gasoline taxes seems designed simply to plug a budget hole, not to spur energy innovation''?
To my mind, taxing gasoline to the point that we are paying the equivalent of the price in Europe will discourage consumption, and the money generated will pay for the infrastructure projects that we so desperately need.

HEADLINE: Positive Economic Reports Push Dow Up 150 Points

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The major indexes rallied on Wednesday, buoyed by several economic reports that suggested improvement in the economy, including in the job market.
Investors overcame lingering concerns over debt problems in the euro zone as well as worries over tensions between North and South Korea to push stocks sharply higher before the Thanksgiving holiday.
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 150.91 points, or 1.37 percent, to 11,187.28. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 17.62 points, or 1.49 percent, to 1,198.35, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 48.17 points, or 1.93 percent, to 2,543.12. 
Bond prices sank. The price on the 10-year Treasury note dropped 1 6/32, to 97 17/32, pushing the yield up to 2.91 percent, from 2.77 percent on Tuesday.
The Labor Department said that filings for first-time unemployment benefits declined to 407,000 in the week ended Saturday, down from a revised 441,000 the previous week and well below analysts' forecasts of 435,000.
The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure, dropped for a third week, to 436,000.
Ryan Wang, the United States economist for HSBC, said the trend in lower claims was ''long enough and significant enough to really pay attention to.''
''If we continue to see claims trend lower, it is a sign that we can finally see some positive progress,'' he said.
The market also rose after a number of reports on consumer sentiment and spending.
The S.& P.'s consumer discretionary sector was up more than 2 percent, along with industrial shares.
Shares of Tiffany rose $3.06, or 5.25 percent, to $61.33, after it reported a 27 percent increase in third-quarter profit.
Amazon was up $9.05, or 5.38 percent, to $177.25.
The dollar rose slightly against a range of currencies, including the euro, which was at $1.3317.
The economic data led to hopes that the American economy was coming out of a soft patch, said Philip J. Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. ''The market seemed like it kicked into another gear,'' he said.
Analysts said there were indications that consumer sentiment was picking up. The Commerce Department said personal income rose 0.5 percent in October, while spending was up 0.4 percent. The savings rate rose to 5.7 percent in October, from 5.6 percent in September, in line with expectations.
''Rising savings and rising consumption spending are constructive signs,'' Steven Ricchiuto, chief United States economist for Mizuho Securities, said in a research note.
In addition, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index on consumer sentiment rose to 71.6 this month, from 67.7 the previous month.
But reasons for concern remain. The survey showed consumers remained anxious about the job market.
Mr. Wang said a further decline in claims below the 400,000 mark could be a sign that job growth was accelerating toward the pace needed to meet new Federal Reserve forecasts.
On the downside, a report for orders of durable goods came in below expectations. Orders for durable goods, which are products meant to last more than three years, like washing machines and office equipment, decreased $6.8 billion, or 3.3 percent, to $196 billion in October.
In another closely watched sector, housing sales slipped in October. According to government figures for October, new-home sales showed a decline of 8.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 283,000, compared with 308,000 in September.
The October rate fell below expectations by analysts of 312,000.
Median home prices were at their lowest levels since October 2003, falling to $194,900, from $226,300 in September.
''The sales numbers should improve starting in early 2011 because the economy is starting to generate new jobs,'' said Patrick Newport, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
Markets are closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving and reopen on Friday.

HEADLINE: New Focus on North's Food Shortage

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL and MARK McDONALD; Alan Cowell reported from Paris, and Mark McDonald from Seoul.

 BODY:
PARIS -- As outsiders from Beijing to Washington struggle to see a pattern in the secretive dynamics of the North Korean leadership, one part of the tangled puzzle seems beyond dispute: the country's 25 million people cannot feed themselves and face acute food shortages as they have done for many years.
But that has not prevented -- and indeed may have encouraged -- the regime in Pyongyang in actions such as Tuesday's shelling of a populated South Korean island or a weekend disclosure concerning what seems a new and ambitious effort to reactivate North Korea's nuclear enrichment program. 
Just last month, South Korea resumed aid shipments of rice and instant noodles for the first time since early 2008 as part of an $8.5 million package that, though largely symbolic in relation to the crushing food shortages, was seen as the result of diplomatic overtures by the North in response to its economic plight.
''It could be the starting point of a new chapter in inter-Korean relations,'' Choi Jin-wook, a North Korea expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said at the time.
Such hopes seem to be drowned out Tuesday by the thunder of artillery barrages.
''They're in a desperate situation, and they want food immediately, not next year,'' Mr. Choi said on Wednesday. ''Food is the No. 1 issue.''
Others used harsher terms.
''This incident seems to fit the pattern of a Mafia shakedown,'' said Tim Peters, a longtime resident in Seoul and head of Helping Hands Korea, an nongovernmental organization that works with North Korean defectors. ''It's a Mafia extortion by the Kim regime. And it has worked for them before: It's the feed-us-or-we'll-shoot-you approach. And now with winter coming on, they're trying to get more food aid.''
''The regime wants just enough food to keep the population from turning.''
Just days before the shelling, a joint report by two United Nations agencies -- the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization -- said that, despite a relatively good autumn harvest, North Korea remained in acute need of food, especially for its youngest children, pregnant women and the elderly.
Around one-fifth of the 25 million population would continue to face food shortages, the report said. So critical was the situation that North Korea was short of around half a million tons of food and government hand-outs were inadequate.
Rations provided by the government through its Public Distribution System ''would likely contribute about half the daily energy requirements,'' the report said, leaving many citizens to eke a living from black market food supplies or modest plots and gardens.
''A small shock in the future could trigger a severe negative impact and will be difficult to contain if these chronic deficits are not effectively managed,'' said Joyce Luma, the head of the World Food Program's Food Security Analysis Unit who was a co-leader of a mission to North Korea in September.
The report said that between now and next October, North Korea would need to import an estimated 867,000 tons of food. The government plans to buy around 325,000 tons, leaving 542,000 tons as a shortfall. The two United Nations agencies recommended providing 305,000 tons in international food assistance to the most vulnerable population.
Battered by severe floods, North Korea's own agricultural sector -- which the report called ''the main contributor to the national income'' -- showed an increase in staple food production of only three percent in the current year compared to the previous year. The country's main crops are unmilled rice followed by corn, potatoes, wheat and barley and soybeans.

HEADLINE: Mother Who Always Helped Now Needs Some Help

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
In 1991, as graduation approached at Thomas Jefferson High School in East New York, Brooklyn, stress weighed on Octavia Little, who the previous year had given birth to a daughter, Illiquana Ash.
She enrolled at Baruch College, but had to drop out after a few months and take a job as a bank teller to support her child.
Vowing that her daughter's teenage years would be more carefree than her own, Ms. Little made a difficult decision in early 2008, after being given a diagnosis of Stage 2 cervical cancer. 
Instead of starting the grueling chemotherapy and radiation treatments at once, she waited until her daughter had packed her bags for the culinary school at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I. ''I wanted her to be happy,'' Ms. Little, 36, said.
When the treatments began in the fall of 2008, they were every bit as draining as Ms. Little had feared.
Arriving at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center at 9 a.m., after an overnight shift as a station agent in the subway, Ms. Little was subjected to eight-hour sessions that left her feeling limp. Still, she never complained to her daughter, she said, fearing that worry would make her lose focus on her studies.
But during Thanksgiving break, there was no hiding from her daughter that Ms. Little, already slender, was 50 pounds lighter and so weak she could barely muster a hug.
''She just looked at me and sat on the bed and just started crying,'' Ms. Little said.
Subsequent surgery prompted Ms. Little to take disability leave, and a steep drop in pay, from $950 to $170 a week. She could no longer afford the $9,000 for housing at Johnson & Wales.
In what seemed to Ms. Little an unsettling parallel, her daughter also had to leave college, after just a year, and move back home. Today, plastic bins of Ms. Ash's clothes crowd the small two-bedroom apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, that mother and daughter share once more.
While Ms. Ash's new school, Monroe College in New Rochelle, N.Y., isn't as interesting to her as cooking school, it leaves her time to pitch in, and she now works five days a week at Macy's.
''She raised me to give me a better life than she had,'' Ms. Ash said. ''This is the right thing to do.''
Perhaps the harshest blow came in the spring of 2010, when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority laid off Ms. Little, along with about 200 other station agents, just as her health was stabilizing.
''I was angry,'' she said. But self-pity was not an option.
To improve her chances for a new career, she enrolled at the Grace Institute, which provides free job training to women.
There, Ms. Little is learning computer skills, with the hope of becoming a receptionist at Sloan-Kettering. ''I just thought I could be helpful to the patients, knowing what they have to go through,'' she said.
In the meantime, though, it has been hard to make ends meet on the $430 she receives weekly in state unemployment benefits. A social worker at Grace introduced her to Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, which is one of the seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
In November, the fund gave her $450, though it barely dented her $1,150 in rent and $230 in utilities. And further setbacks might loom.
A doctor recently noticed a ''shadow'' on a CT scan of Ms. Little's bladder. Chemotherapy is so enervating, she said she would rather take her chances with less aggressive remedies.
''How can I keep going like this?'' she asked, sitting in her apartment, a glass of unsweetened apple juice by her side. ''I'm not even 40 yet.''
HOW TO HELP: Checks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund may be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245.

HEADLINE: Art Inflation: Macy's Murakamis

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
It is not uncommon for people to react with awe to their first up-close encounter with a balloon from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. But when Takashi Murakami saw his contributions to Thursday's event, he bowed. Twice.
On Wednesday afternoon, on a stretch of West 81st Street in Manhattan where brightly colored, 30-foot-tall inflatable versions of his characters Kaikai and Kiki were wriggling and writhing underneath a huge net, Mr. Murakami, the Japanese pop artist, held a brief Shinto ceremony for purity and luck. He stood at a table where he poured out a glass of water and a glass of sake in front of two plates, one of white rice and one of sea salt. He gave two bows and clapped twice, then declared the ritual complete. 
Kaikai, a childlike character in a rabbit costume, and Kiki, an impish figure with three eyes and two dangling fangs, were ready to greet the parade-watching public.
In an interview after the ceremony Mr. Murakami, his bushy hair tied in a knot, seemed exuberant. He said he was less concerned about whether Kaikai and Kiki -- who do not promote any television cartoon shows or breakfast cereals, and are merely ambassadors of Mr. Murakami's own playfully esoteric art -- could hold their own in the Macy's parade than about Thursday morning's weather.
''I was thinking about sunshine,'' Mr. Murakami said in his broken English. ''Tomorrow the report is a little bit rainy. But I already talk with my feng shui master in Taiwan, and he already take care about that.''
For the organizers of the Macy's parade the addition of Mr. Murakami and his characters to its lineup is the fulfillment of a longtime goal and several years of work.
Robin Hall, the executive producer of the parade, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Murakami was one of a handful of artists Macy's sought out when it started its series of balloons designed by internationally recognized artists in 2005.
The parade, Mr. Hall said, ''is a snapshot of American culture.'' While much of its roster is dedicated to readily identifiable figures like SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer, he said, ''I do believe there's room in this parade -- and have always believed this -- for high art.''
In that spirit the sculptor Tom Otterness created a Humpty Dumpty balloon for Macy's in 2005, depicting that nursery-rhyme character suspended upside-down in a perpetual tumble. In 2007 the parade added a shimmering silver rabbit designed by Jeff Koons, and the following year incorporated a giant Keith Haring figure holding up a heart, to mark what would have been the artist's 50th birthday.
In 2008 Macy's also began communicating with Mr. Murakami, who in the global art scene is known as much for his inflatable sculptures of psychedelic anime-style cartoon characters as for the Louis Vuitton handbags and Casio watches he designs. But at that time he was preparing for a retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum and could not immediately contribute to the parade.
This year Mr. Murakami sent word that he wanted to create balloons of Kaikai and Kiki. In response to e-mailed questions, he explained that the characters ''in many ways represent the aesthetic philosophy behind my work.''
''They are cute yet fearsome,'' he wrote, ''modern and yet connected to the past. They embody eccentric beauty.''
The Macy's parade studio in Hoboken, N.J., had only a few months to work on the designs with Mr. Murakami. Of particular concern to John Piper, the vice president of the studio, was whether the balloonified characters, with their gigantic heads and teeny-tiny limbs, would be able to achieve what he called free lift -- meaning, Mr. Piper said, ''that there's enough helium inside the balloon to not only compensate for its weight but to make it fly.''
At an accelerated pace Mr. Piper and his team exchanged sketches with Mr. Murakami and his staff, and over the summer Mr. Piper chaperoned two small clay sculptures of the balloons on a trip to the artist's Tokyo studio. (The sculptures, Mr. Piper said, traveled in ''a very big, very sturdy piece of luggage, inside of which was a whole other steel structure to absorb any shock.'')
The completed balloons were flown for the first time this month at a Macy's testing facility in South Dakota, but Mr. Murakami -- who plans to accompany them in the parade wearing a flower costume of his own design -- had not seen the finished works until Wednesday.
Nor, for that matter, have the thousands of children who will watch the parade live -- or the millions who will watch on television -- Thursday morning, and have likely never heard of Mr. Murakami.
Mr. Hall acknowledged that Kaikai and Kiki's mix of cuteness and weirdness was pushing boundaries for Macy's. ''There are details about them that, I think in isolation, as they're described, sound kind of grotesque,'' Mr. Hall said. But, he added, ''the final thing is not so bad.''
Ultimately, Mr. Hall said, Macy's criterion for its parade balloons is ''not a question of: Will the kids recognize it?''
''Our rule here,'' he continued, ''is whether the kids understand it or not? Will the kids like it?''
Watching the inflation of Kaikai and Kiki on 81st Street, Tami Marsden and her son Alex, 6, were less sure about what they were seeing.
''We don't know who that is, but he knows Kung Fu Panda,'' Ms. Marden said, indicating another nearby balloon. ''I thought it was a Pokemon thing.''
She added: ''I hate to say it, but boys really don't like anything that's pink.''

HEADLINE: The Barbershop Renaissance

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
EARLIER this month, Tristan Chirico was trying to do some last-minute errands in New York before flying back to Jordan and his job teaching theater at a prep school there. The most pressing item on his list was a haircut.
His plan was to head into Manhattan from the friend's apartment in Brooklyn where he was staying. But then, right there on Smith Street, the main drag of Carroll Gardens, he happened across a brand-new barbershop, Persons of Interest, and decided to pop in.
It was a revelation.
''As soon as I saw the place, I felt this deep, inner yearning,'' he said. ''It's very striking, with these red barber chairs and this fantastic photo-mural. And it's rare to see well-dressed, well-groomed men cutting the hair of equally well-dressed guys.'' 
He was convinced that he'd found the spot where he could get the short, early-1960s-model haircut -- complete with a neat side part -- that he had wanted for years. And he was right.
Moreover, Mr. Chirico, 26, discovered what other young men in New York have begun to notice in recent months: In the city's more style-conscious ZIP codes, there has been a renaissance of that much-loved old neighborhood standby, the barbershop.
Proving Fran Lebowitz's oft-cited dictum that ''you're only as good as your last haircut,'' authentic-looking barbershops have popped up all over lower Manhattan. Done up with, say, vintage lighting fixtures, antique barber chairs and, of course, a big glass jar of blue Barbicide on the counter, they are offering good, solid haircuts and shaves for less than half the price of a fancy salon cut. And in a kind of tonsorial version of chicken-or-the-egg, their arrival is perfectly timed, coinciding with the twin desires among urbane young men to tame their unruly locks and look neater and sharper from the neck up, and do it in all-American, gentlemanly, modestly priced fashion, far from the salon smells of peroxide and perfume.
That spot in Carroll Gardens aside, Lower Manhattan seems to be the epicenter of it all, where these new-old-fashioned places range from the punk-rock-plain (like Frank's Chop Shop on the Lower East Side) to the fancy-pants (the New York Shaving Company in NoLIta) to the gimmicky (the Blind Barber in the East Village is also a bar). Prices at those places run from $30 to $40 for a haircut and $25 to $40 for a straight-razor hot shave (which has itself become a popular choice).
At C. O. Bigelow in Greenwich Village, sales of high-quality brushes and combs from English firms like Kent, along with straight razors that cost $100 and up, and even old-fashioned leather sharpening strops have all risen 200 percent in the last two years, said the company's president, Ian Ginsberg. ''Guys are coming in here and asking for military brushes, and I can't even believe they know the term,'' Mr. Ginsberg said, referring to the traditional oval men's hairbrush that has no handle.
But New Yorkers aren't the only ones fueling this trend. On eBay, according to a spokeswoman, there's been a surge of interest in vintage shaving, grooming and barbershop paraphernalia. In comparing a two-week period earlier this month with a two-week period six months ago, she said sales of merchandise returned by the search term barbershop were up 77 percent, sales of Barbicide were up 60 percent, and sales of items found by searching for the words vintage barbershop sign were up 251 percent. On Amazon, archaic devices like straight razors and safety razors, and grooming products (including mustache wax and combs) from Gilded-Age-y brands like Edwin Jagger and Colonel Conk have been selling so well that Amazon created a special category -- ''classic shave'' -- to showcase them all. Charles Kirkpatrick, the executive officer of the National Association of Barber Boards of America, said that the number of licensed barbers had grown roughly 10 percent in the last two years, to 245,000 from 225,000.
F.S.C. Barber, a barbershop within the Freemans Sporting Club clothing boutique on the Lower East Side, was the first proper hipster barbershop to open its doors back in 2006, complete with old barber chairs, hexagonal floor tiles, antique lighting fixtures, and no shortage of electric clippers. A second branch opened in the West Village in 2008; both branches are now hipster mob scenes on Saturdays.
''We wanted to be very firm and not take appointments,'' said one of the shop's owners, Sam Buffa, whose idea it was to open a barbershop as part of the Freemans brand. ''We wanted it to work for the guy who wakes up and thinks, 'I need a haircut.' So you go put your name down, you have a drink, you read a magazine, you shop for some clothes, and you're up.''
There's usually a healthy wait at Geno's Barberia a few blocks away, which was opened last summer by Dzenad Bicic -- a k a Geno. A Yugoslavian-born barber who for the last 10 years built a loyal following at another neighborhood shop, Mr. Bicic now has his own place for tending the locks of an impressive roster of clients, from the venerable, like the Broadway producer Arthur Laurents, to the trendy, like the bad-boy artist Dan Colen. And that's just the east side of the street. Right across Greenwich Avenue is Ernest and Olivia, another newly opened barbershop.
Then there is one of the pioneers, which, to be honest, isn't really a barbershop at all. When Ricky Pannell opened his West Village salon Snip 'N' Sip 10 years ago, he did it up with vintage barbershop fixtures he found on eBay. Now bigger and more barber-y than ever, the place has become such a font of authenticity and inspiration that Mr. Pannell was enlisted by The Inside Source, eBay's online magazine, to give readers a checklist of what to look for.
However, he's not a traditional barber, and doesn't charge like one. ''People are so confused, because they see the place and come in, and they think you are going to give the $15 barber cut,'' said Mr. Pannell, who charges $100 for a man's haircut. ''A true barber wants to do four cuts an hour,'' he said. ''I don't even own clippers.''
As cute or contrived as these places might seem -- many are selling a kind of false nostalgia to customers too young to remember the real thing -- several factors are coming together to make this a barbershop renaissance. Foremost among them, Mr. Buffa said, is that young men, in this depressed economy, can't afford to look unprofessional today, and don't want to spend too much to keep it up. ''I hear it all the time: 'I need to cut my hair off, I have to go to interviews,' '' he said. ''That includes me. I used to have hair down to my shoulders. It's also part of becoming men -- we're not boys anymore just hanging around the Lower East Side getting drunk.''
Another factor has to do with why men turned away from barbershops in the first place, finding it hard to get the more stylish, individual or careful haircuts they wanted from the outdated style sheet and cookie-cutter process practiced by so many barbers..
''I actually have tried to get this haircut before,'' said Mr. Chirico, referring to the 1960s Don Draper cut he got last week at Persons of Interest. ''I went to one of these neighborhood barber shops where the barber was probably named Sal, and I figured that's the kind of haircut I'd get, but he gave me the haircut he would have given Keanu Reeves in 1993 -- all gelled and up and terrible. That put me off barbershops forever.''
Mr. Buffa of F.S.C. Barber said it was exactly that kind of discerning customer they were after.
Not a hairstylist himself, Mr. Buffa recruited his barbers from hair salons, finding stylists game to take a different crack at the salon idea. They are going for a vibe that feels like a cross between Bedford Falls, circa 1946, and a GQ photo shoot, circa 2010. To wit: on a visit to Freemans last week, the muscled and tattooed guy in the chair next to mine told his -- his stylist? his barber? his barbista? -- that he was a union pipe welder, but the problem was that he hadn't worked in two years and his unemployment was ending Dec. 1. Meanwhile, in another chair was a chap who -- in looks, dress and bearing -- could have passed for a model. (Despite looking so neatly cropped that he could have been leaving instead of coming, he was there for a trim.)
They do give a decent haircut at Freemans, and can give you a straight-razor shave if you want it. But be warned: to men used to the Trac II or Mach3, the straight razor shave will come as a surprise. You feel as if you are trapped in a chair while your beard is intently licked off by a mountain lion with an 80-grit-sandpaper tongue. The word ''luxury'' does not come to mind.
And for all the charm of places like this, there may still be something to be said for an appointment at a salon.
''They cut great hair at Freemans,'' said David Binder, a theater producer who lives a block from F.S.C. Barber's West Village branch. ''But what's so funny about this illusion of old Main-Street America, where you pop in and get a haircut, is how it just doesn't jibe with reality. The last time I tried to get one there I was told there was a three-hour-and-20 minute wait. And not only do I think there has not ever been a barbershop on any Main Street that had a three-hour-and-20 minute wait, I don't know a single New Yorker who can afford to wait that long for a haircut.''
For a table, maybe, but never a chair.

HEADLINE: 3 Numbers to Rate Volt's Fuel Economy

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Shoppers trying to determine the fuel efficiency of the Chevrolet Volt will see a window label that offers multiple ratings for different driving patterns, General Motors said on Wednesday.
The complex label, which the Environmental Protection Agency worked with G.M. to create, will rate the fuel economy of the Volt plug-in hybrid as 60 miles a gallon. The number was determined through E.P.A. tests that simulated various driving conditions and included a combination of the gas engine and the battery.
Driven on battery power alone, the Volt has a fuel economy equivalent to 93 m.p.g., the E.P.A. determined, using a formula that converts kilowatt-hours of electricity to gallons of gas. The Volt's gas engine was rated at 37 m.p.g. 
The 93 and 37 m.p.g. figures appear most prominently on the window label, while the 60 m.p.g. figure is in much smaller type toward the bottom. The Nissan Leaf, a pure electric car, was rated this week as getting the equivalent of 99 m.p.g.
The label also shows that the cost to drive the Volt, which goes on sale in December in some parts of the United States, can vary from 4 cents a mile if the gasoline engine is never used to 9 cents a mile if the battery is never charged. The label shows the battery-only range for the Volt as 35 miles, a little less than the 40 miles that G.M. had estimated as the car was developed.
''We have said as often as we could that this will vary significantly with conditions and how you drive,'' Doug Parks, G.M.'s vehicle line executive for the Volt, said on a conference call with reporters. ''If you try to boil this down to a single number, it becomes quite difficult.''
All of the numbers, of course, are well below the 230 m.p.g. rating that G.M.'s former chief executive, Fritz Henderson, said in 2009 the Volt would receive. G.M. said that number was calculated based on a draft proposal for rating electric cars that the E.P.A. later rejected. (Nissan had said the Leaf, using the same proposed formula, would be rated at 367 m.p.g.)
The Volt's label said driving the car 15,000 miles a year only on battery power would cost $601. That compares with an estimated annual cost of $561 for the Leaf.
On gasoline alone, the estimated annual cost rises to $1,302. That compares with $1,542 for the base model of G.M.'s recently introduced Chevrolet Cruze, which like the Volt is classified as a compact car.
G.M. executives said they thought most Volt owners would drive on battery power most of the time, so their costs would be toward the lower end of the range.
The label shows a total range for the Volt, on a full charge and gas tank, of 379 miles, including 344 on gas alone. G.M. says the Volt allows drivers to go much further than electric-only cars like the Leaf, eliminating a phenomenon it calls ''range anxiety.'' That added convenience is a primary reason the Volt is priced $8,220 more than the Leaf, though both will be available to lease for about $350 a month.
The Volt is scheduled to go on sale first in California, Michigan, metropolitan New York, Washington and Austin, Tex., before becoming available in the rest of the country by 2012.
G.M. has said it plans to build about 10,000 Volts by the end of 2011, and 45,000 in 2012.

HEADLINE: Fed Considered Setting Target for Interest Rates on Some Bonds

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Tucked into minutes released this week by the Federal Reserve was a disclosure that came as a surprise to economists and historians alike: on Oct. 15, Fed policy makers discussed whether to set a target for interest rates on certain government bonds.
While the Fed did not move forward with the idea, the fact that it was even discussed -- along with proposals for an explicit inflation target and for periodic press briefings by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke -- suggested that officials were trying to think outside the box as they grappled with the sluggish pace of the recovery. 
The idea would be an extension of, but distinct from, the unorthodox actions the Fed has already taken to try to prop up the economy. Not since the Korean War has the central bank directly sought to manage specific long-term interest rates.
On Nov. 3, the Fed announced a plan to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities through June, the resumption of an effort, known as quantitative easing, to lower long-term interest rates and thereby stimulate the economy by making it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow, consume and invest.
The strategy has shown some signs of working, but its effectiveness is not guaranteed. Since early August, when the Fed first hinted that the economy might need additional monetary stimulus because unemployment was so high, growth so weak and inflation so low, stock prices have risen and long-term interest rates have fallen -- just as the Fed wanted.
But in the last few weeks, yields on government bonds have moved around somewhat unpredictably, and those erratic movements have been a source of concern. For example, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.53 percent on Nov. 4, but surged to 2.92 percent on Nov. 15.
By purchasing government bonds, the Fed is exerting upward pressure on the prices of those bonds, and downward pressure on yields, or interest rates, since bond prices move inversely to yields. But the markets have at times resisted those tendencies, for reasons that are not entirely clear. On Wednesday, the yield for the 10-year note rose again to just about the same level it reached on Nov. 15.
The Fed plans to re-examine its $600 billion goal as conditions warrant. But instead of limiting its purchases to a certain dollar amount, it could instead announce a ceiling for yields on Treasury debt -- say, bonds maturing within the next two years -- by ''committing to make unlimited purchases'' of those bonds to drive the yields down to the desired target.
That idea was suggested by none other than Mr. Bernanke, in a speech he made in November 2002, shortly after he joined the Fed's board of governors but about three years before he became chairman.
''If this program were successful, not only would yields on medium-term Treasury securities fall, but (because of links operating through expectations of future interest rates) yields on longer-term public and private debt (such as mortgages) would likely fall as well,'' Mr. Bernanke said then.
Mr. Bernanke has not repudiated that speech, which described how the Fed could avoid painful deflation of the sort that has beleaguered Japan since the late 1990s, but Fed officials emphasize that such an interest-rate peg is not on his agenda.
As Fed officials in the Oct. 15 meeting noted, the strategy would involve ''potentially large risks,'' primarily the risk that the Fed ''might find itself buying undesirably large amounts'' of a particular security to keep its yield close to the target level.
Indeed, Stephen H. Axilrod, who worked for decades at the Fed and wrote ''Inside the Fed,'' a history of its monetary policy since the 1950s, said, ''I think it's a sign of desperation about what they can really constructively do to help the economy.''
But there is an important precedent for the idea.
For nearly a decade, from April 1942 to March 1951, the Fed maintained a ceiling of 2.5 percent on long-term Treasury bonds. The pegging of interest rates was introduced during World War II to help the federal government finance its extensive wartime borrowing.
It was lifted only after a standoff between President Harry S. Truman and his Treasury Department, which wanted to keep the yields low, and the Fed, which was worried about the inflationary results of the peg after the end of the 1948-9 recession and the start of the Korean War. The Fed's defiance was led by Chairman Thomas B. McCabe, a paper executive who had been appointed by Truman, and Allan Sproul, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
That standoff resulted in an agreement known as the Treasury-Fed Accord, signed on March 4, 1951, which freed the Fed from having to fix yields on government debt. The episode is celebrated in the annals of Fed history as the central bank's ''Independence Day,'' as the economists Robert L. Hetzel and Ralph F. Leach called it in a 2001 article published by the Richmond Fed describing the standoff.

HEADLINE: Netflix's Move Onto the Web Stirs Rivalries

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and DAVID CARR

 BODY:
In a matter of months, the movie delivery company Netflix has gone from being the fastest-growing first-class mail customer of the United States Postal Service to the biggest source of streaming Web traffic in North America during peak evening hours.
That transformation -- from a mail-order business to a technology company -- is revolutionizing the way millions of people watch television, but it's also proving to be a big headache for TV providers and movie studios, which increasingly see Netflix as a competitive threat, even as they sell Netflix their content.
The dilemma for Hollywood was neatly spelled out in a Netflix announcement Monday of a new subscription service: $7.99 a month for unlimited streaming of movies and television shows, compared with $19.99 a month for a plan that allows the subscriber to have three discs out at a time, sent through the mail, plus unlimited streaming. For studios that only a few years ago were selling new DVDs for $30, that represents a huge drop in profits.
''Right now, Netflix is a distribution platform, and has very little competition, but that's changing,'' said Warren N. Lieberfarb, a consultant who played a critical role in creating the DVD while at Warner Brothers. 
For the first time, the company will spend more over the holidays to stream movies than to ship DVDs in its familiar red envelopes (although it is still spending more than half a billion dollars on postage this year). And that shift coincides with an ominous development for cable companies, which long controlled home entertainment: for the first time in their history, cable television subscriptions fell in the United States in the last two quarters -- a trend some attribute to the rise of Netflix, which allows consumers to bypass their cable box to stream movies and shows.
Netflix now has the frothy stock price to show for its success. The stock has enjoyed a Google-like rise, nearly quadrupling from its 52-week low in January, and with a market value of nearly $10 billion, Netflix is now worth more than some of the Hollywood studios that license movies to it.
In some ways, the closest parallel as a one-stop digital marketplace is iTunes, the Apple service that has put itself at the center of the digital world and has used that power to demand concessions from its suppliers.
''How did Hollywood end up supplying Netflix in the first place, particularly a product that was given to them on a flat-rate, wholesale basis?'' said Jonathan A. Knee, a media investment banker and co-author of ''The Curse of the Mogul.''
As recently as a few years ago, Netflix didn't look like a case study in success: if anything, it seemed to be just the latest media company destined to be run over by technology.
From the company's beginning in 1997, Reed Hastings, the chief executive and co-founder, had always thought of Netflix as an entertainment distribution service rather than a mail-order company, and by 2000, the company was experimenting with delivering movies over the Internet. In 2003, Netflix came up with a hardware solution, a $300 hard drive that would download films. But slow speeds -- it could take six to eight hours to download a feature length film -- doomed that effort. (Mr. Hastings declined to be interviewed for this article.)
But the advent of streaming -- watching video in real time as opposed to downloading -- gained prominence in 2005 with the explosive success of YouTube. Mr. Hastings decided that software, not hardware, was the key to delivering films over the Internet and pushed to develop high-quality streaming technology. Pricing remained an issue, however, and in a move that gave Netflix a big head start, the company decided to give the service away to existing mail-order customers.
Netflix now has more than 16 million subscribers. The company does not release figures on the most popular films or television shows streamed, but as a general rule, films that can be streamed instantly are not fresh out of theaters or plucked from the current TV season. People who want to relive past seasons of ''The Office'' can do so instantly, but if they are looking for the current season -- or any season of ''Mad Men'' -- they are out of luck.
''We are very proud to announce that by every measure we are now a streaming company, which also offers DVD-by-mail,'' Mr. Hastings recently told Wall Street analysts.
Just as important, Netflix arrived with an open checkbook at a time when the film industry's main source of profits, the sale of DVDs, was plummeting.
''As the home entertainment industry comes under pressure, they are the only guy standing there in a red shirt writing checks,'' said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research. ''That makes Netflix really unique right now.''
The biggest check came a few months ago, when the company spent nearly $1 billion to stream movies from three Hollywood studios -- Paramount, MGM and Lionsgate.
Steve Swasey, the company's vice president for communications, said, ''As we move from paying U.S. postage to acquiring movies and television episodes from the studios and networks, Netflix can become one of their top customers.''
But digital economics can be much less lucrative to content companies. For example, under the terms of Netflix's deal with Starz, the pay-TV channel, which allows Netflix to stream movies from Sony and Disney, Netflix pays about 15 cents a month for each subscriber, much less than the $4 to $5 a month that cable and satellite owners pay for access to Starz, according to research by Mr. Greenfield.
For that reason, Netflix is increasingly viewed as a threat by cable companies and movie studios, who are considering a variety of ways to put the brakes on the company's growth.
For example, big media companies like Time Warner are moving quickly to offer their own streaming products. Studios have pushed back on release dates, requiring Netflix to wait through a window of 28 days while studios pushed more expensive and lucrative sales of the DVD and on-demand versions on cable.
And the studios are positioning themselves to demand more money in future negotiations over streaming rights, especially next year when Netflix's deal with Starz expires.
''Though already a significant customer, they've grown faster than anyone anticipated, and going forward we expect the economics to improve significantly,'' said John Calkins, executive vice president of digital and commercial innovation at Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.
For now, Netflix has become a barometer of the apparently voracious consumer appetite for streaming movies: a recent study by Sandvine, a broadband equipment maker, showed that Netflix, surprisingly, accounted for more than 20 percent of all Internet download traffic in North America in peak evening hours.
''Netflix used an open-source network, the U.S. Postal Service, to launch an alternative distribution business without asking anyone for permission,'' said Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor and author of ''The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires.'' ''Now they are using another open-source network, the Internet, to transform the business. It is much easier for Netflix to change, because they don't have to undergo a kind of religious conversion like media companies will have to.''

HEADLINE: Black Friday Expectations Are High

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Buy more, save more seems to be the mantra going into the holiday shopping season.
Analysts are expecting one of the most heavily trafficked Fridays after Thanksgiving in years, and to attract those customers, retailers are expected to offer a rash of sales and door-buster specials that may eat into their profits.
But the turnout may be a little lower, given predictions of snowstorms moving from the West to the Midwest and New England, and rainstorms in the New York area.
The day after Thanksgiving is called Black Friday because it is the day that retailers hope to turn from unprofitable (in the red, in accounting terms) to profitable (in the black) for the year. Last year, consumers spent $18.6 billion on Black Friday, according to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect November sales for stores open at least a year to increase 3.5 percent, a sharp uptick after last year, when sales increased just 0.5 percent.
Hoping that consumers might finally be returning, retailers are trying just about anything to capture their cash. Many stores began running special offers in October this year. Online sites for Staples, Macy's and Kohl's offered Thanksgiving Day specials. Sears, Kmart and many Gap and Old Navy stores were open on Thanksgiving Day, with Toys ''R'' Us opening its doors at 10 p.m. on the holiday, and most Wal-Marts opening at midnight.
''You've seen retailers getting much deeper in their discounts, but also much earlier and more aggressive -- they're doing anything they can to get the consumer to spend money,'' said David Bassuk, managing director of retail at the consulting firm AlixPartners.
''This holiday is going to be a big view into who's winning and who's losing,'' he said. ''The first data that's going to be available is sales, and people are going to want to show sales. There's a lot of ways to finagle the profit story later.''
Here are five other trends that should define this shopping season:
CROWDS, AT LAST Mall traffic this year is up more than 12 percent over last year, according to Remote Sensing Metrics, which uses satellite images to track how full mall parking lots are. And traffic has been increasing through November.
Several malls owned by the developer Taubman reported that traffic was up the weekend before Thanksgiving.
It was ''clearly better than last year,'' said Nick LeMasters, general manager of the Cherry Creek Shopping Center in Denver. That was echoed by malls nationwide, including ones in Auburn Hills, Mich.; Clinton Township, Mich.; Short Hills, N.J.; Plano, Tex.; and Norfolk, Va.
''Several merchants reported better-than-expected, and better-than-last-year, numbers,'' said Karen Winters, marketing director for the MacArthur Center in Norfolk.
Bill Vetter, the general manager of Lawrence, part of the Tensator Group, which helps stores like Wal-Mart and Target with crowd control, said clients were expecting the highest traffic since 2006.
Retailers are still quite cautious about security, he said, since a Wal-Mart employee was trampled to death when doors opened on Black Friday in 2008. One way they are trying to calm crowds is with single-file lines at the register, which Kohl's, Target and T. J. Maxx are testing in busy stores this year.
''You take the anxiety out of the guest experience,'' Mr. Vetter said.
SALES, SALES EVERYWHERE Especially in categories that have been sluggish this year, like electronics and adult apparel, analysts are expecting heavy promotions across the board.
Last year on the Friday after Thanksgiving, Americans bought $1.3 billion worth of electronics -- twice as much as the second most important day for electronics last year, which was Saturday Dec. 19, according to SpendingPulse.
The electronics stores seem to have mastered the promotional push. At Best Buy last year, for example, an average of 700 people lined up outside each store on the Friday after Thanksgiving, the chain said. This year should be extraordinarily competitive because Wal-Mart has promised to match any competitor's door-buster price as long as consumers bring in the competitor's ads.
In adult clothes, too, analysts are expecting heavy promotions. John D. Morris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets who tracks how deep retail discounts are, estimated that this year was more promotion-heavy than last year, especially in the adult stores.
Another reason so many adult clothes are marked down is that parents seem to be spending on their children first, then buying for themselves. ''Women's apparel numbers have really suffered at the expense of protecting spending on children,'' said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis for SpendingPulse. Still, he said, women's apparel spending picked up in October and early November.
Brad Wilson, who runs the site BlackFriday2010.com, said that deals over all were better than last year. ''The big stores are being so aggressive on price,'' he said.
WELL, ALMOST EVERYWHERE The one place shoppers should not expect big discounts is at luxury stores. High-end retail companies like Hermes, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Tiffany have been reporting spikes in revenue recently.
''There's a lot of pent-up demand in that consumer base, and they're out spending,'' Mr. Bassuk said.
In the third quarter, consumer spending on luxury apparel and accessories rose 5 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to American Express Business Insights, which analyzes cardholders' transaction data. Spending at luxury department stores increased 10 percent.
''They're spending more now than they were in 2007, before the recession,'' said Ed Jay, senior vice president of the research unit.
At Cherry Creek Shopping Center, Mr. LeMasters noted that while most retailers were running sales, ''upper-moderate to luxury merchants have not shown a propensity for promoting aggressively.''
The International Council of Shopping Centers expects November and December sales at luxury stores to be up 6 to 8 percent at stores open at least a year, versus 3 to 3.5 percent for chain stores as a whole.
A CASH CHRISTMAS About 90 percent of Americans plan to use cash for their holiday gifts this year, according to a survey from the United Services Automobile Association, which provides insurance to military members and their families. Only 8 percent said they would charge more to their credit cards, while 35 percent said they would use more cash this year than last. The top reasons for using cash were avoiding debt and staying within a budget.
''Cash allows them to set a limit based on how much cash they actually bring with them,'' Seok Chung, marketing and sponsorship director at the Mall at Partridge Creek in suburban Detroit, said in an e-mail. She said stores at her mall reported an increase in the number of people paying with cash.
THANKS FOR THE ...SWEATER Mr. Morris predicts that one of the top holiday gifts this year will be the humble sweater.
''It's driven by a return towards traditional gifting,'' Mr. Morris said. And with new-again styles like argyle, Fair Isle and ruffled ''waterfall'' sweaters, people have a lot to pick from. ''They want to go back to giving real gifts again,'' he said.
But there is some hope for sweater-haters who are expecting gifts from men this year. According to a Consumer Reports poll, by November, a majority of men -- 71 percent -- had not yet started holiday shopping.

HEADLINE: A Windfall, Blown Away

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
WAMEGO, Kan. -- Grateful to have found work in this tough economy, Nick Martin teaches grape growing and winemaking each Saturday to a class of seven students in a simple metal building here at a satellite campus of Highland Community College.
Then he drives 14 miles in an 11-year-old Ford Explorer to a sparsely furnished tract house that he rents for $900 a month on a dead-end street in McFarland, a smaller town. Just across the backyard is a shed that a neighbor uses to make cartridges for shooting the prairie dogs that infest the adjacent fields.
It is a far cry from the life that Mr. Martin and his family enjoyed until recently at their Adirondacks waterfront camp at Tupper Lake, N.Y. Their garage held three stylish cars, including a yellow Aston Martin; they owned three horses, one that cost $173,000; and Mr. Martin treated his wife, Kate, to a birthday weekend at the Waldorf-Astoria, with dinner at the ''21'' Club and a $7,000 mink coat.
That luxurious world was fueled by a check Mr. Martin received in 1998 for $14 million, his share of the $600 million sale of Martin Media, an outdoor advertising business begun by his father in California in the 1950s. After taxes, he kept about $10 million. 
But as so often happens to those lucky enough to realize the American dream of sudden riches, the money slipped through the Martins' fingers faster than they ever imagined.
They faced temptations to indulge, with the complexities and pressures of new wealth. And a pounding recession pummeled the value of their real estate and new financial investments, rendering their properties unaffordable.
The fortune evaporated in little more than a decade.
While many millions of Americans have suffered through this recession with only unemployment benefits to sustain them, Mr. Martin has reason to give thanks -- he has landed a job at 59, however far away. He also had assets to sell to help tide his family over.
Still, Mr. Martin, a strapping man with a disarming bluntness, seemed dazed by it all. ''We are basically broke,'' he said.
Though he faulted the conventional wisdom of investing in stocks and real estate for some of his woes, along with poor financial advice, he accepted much of the blame himself.
''We spent too much,'' he conceded. ''I have a fourth grader, an eighth grader and a girl who just finished high school. I should have kept working and put the money in bonds.''
Mrs. Martin recalled the summer night in 1998 when the family was having a spaghetti dinner at home in Paso Robles, in central California, and a bank representative called to ask where to wire the money. ''It seemed like an unbelievable amount,'' she said regretfully.
Soon after the money arrived, the family decided to leave Paso Robles, amid some lingering tensions that Mr. Martin felt with his brother and brother-in law, who had run the business. Mr. Martin had never been in management at the billboard company, though he had been on the board and worked at Martin Brothers Winery, another family business.
First, the Martins bought a house in Somerset, England, near the home of Mrs. Martin's parents, and he decided to write a novel. At about the same time, they spent $250,000 on the 3.5-acre camp with four structures on Tupper Lake, deep in the Adirondacks, as a summer home. They began extensive renovations at the lake, adding a stunning three-story boathouse and two other buildings.
Clouds gathered quickly. Life in England turned sour when Mr. Martin's novel, ''Anthony: Conniver's Lament,'' did not sell, and the family's living costs -- school fees, taxes and even advice for filing tax returns -- swelled. In 2002, fed up with England, the Martins chose a new base, Vermont, and plunked down about $650,000 for a home there, as renovations continued on the Tupper Lake property.
By March 2007, the Martins were determined to move to the lake full time.
They managed their expenses for a while, but the costs mounted and mounted some more as they worked at refurbishing the Adirondack property -- eventually totaling a staggering $5.3 million, Mr. Martin said. He poured another $600,000 into the Vermont property, he said.
He vacillates between blaming the builders and blaming himself for letting costs get out of hand. ''We should have built something quite modest,'' he conceded.
Tensions rose in 2007 as summer came without any offers for the Vermont home.
''I thought that housing was going into a tailspin,'' he said. ''I had the feeling that something bad was happening.''
So ''we started selling cars, shotguns, antique furniture, whatever,'' Mr. Martin said. The Aston Martin fetched $395,000. With a big gap in his employment history, he found a job teaching English at Paul Smith's College near his home in Tupper Lake for $14,000 a year. For an additional $7,000, he coached the school's cross-country runners.
Then came the financial crisis. The markets plunged, as did the value of the Martins' trust. By fall 2008, with much of the family's net worth tied up in housing, Mr. Martin faced a series of margin calls. He needed more cash in his brokerage accounts because he had been tapping into a credit line with his investments as collateral. In January 2009, he cashed in a retirement account worth roughly $91,000.
The houses could not be sold quickly. Though if they had been, some of the pressure would have lifted. ''To maintain those things, you have to have a pretty good cash flow,'' Mr. Martin said.
The family ultimately put the Adirondacks property on the market for $4.9 million, then quickly slashed the price by half. Last month, the Martins got an offer for just half of the latest $2.5 million asking price.
They have stopped making payments on their $1.1 million mortgage and their $53,000 in annual property taxes in the Adirondacks as well as the mortgage and taxes on their Vermont home. They cannot afford those obligations on Mr. Martin's current salary of $51,000. Their household income is down from $250,000 four years ago.
At the moment, they are working with a loan modification unit at their bank. The lender proposed a new payment of $3,550 a month, reduced from $7,400. Given his current status, Mr. Martin argued, that it does not make much sense. He predicts that the house will ultimately be sold or taken over by the bank. Meanwhile, for the Christmas holidays and some of next summer, the family has found renters for the main house to help cover some of the costs.
Over lunch recently at Barleycorn's Downtown Bar and Deli in Wamego, Mr. Martin said he believed ''the worst is behind us.''
Perhaps. But a forced restructuring can be difficult for children and spouses even in longstanding marriages.
Sometimes he and his wife took it out on each other, he said. ''She bought a bunch of horses. I blamed her for the horses. I bought cars. She blamed me for the cars -- and the house being too big. We had a rough time,'' he acknowledged. ''But I think we have gotten over that.''
Until Christmas, when she plans to join him, Mrs. Martin continues to work as a substitute teacher with autistic children at an Adirondacks elementary school: a $12,000-a-year job she loves in a place she says she is hesitant to leave. With their younger daughter, she has moved into a smaller building on their big property.
A lively woman who loves bike riding and horses, she has built a close network of friends. ''What is the place in Kansas like?'' she asked a reporter with some trepidation before her first visit at Thanksgiving.
Mr. Martin, who moved to Kansas last April, brought the couple's 13-year-old son, Edward, to join him in the fall. He has been counting the days until his wife and Sophia, 9, come permanently. The older daughter, Mrs. Martin's from a previous marriage, has found work in Florida after finishing high school.
In the meantime, Mr. Martin is also overseeing a one-acre vineyard beside the Oregon Trail Road, drawing on his knowledge of the wine industry from his California days.
He does what he can to lessen the family strains.
''I have a temper. I have to control my temper,'' he said. ''I could drink like a fish, but if you have problems in your life, drinking does not help.''
And he recites a quotation he holds dear : ''The measure of a man is not whether he falls down, but whether he gets up again.'' Still, Mr. Martin is prone to ruminate over the loss of so much money. He is furious at the banks and the bankers, who he thinks gave him bad advice, and he still sounds angry at his brother and others who decided to sell the company and who he says gave him little voice. Some of them got more than $100 million each, he said, while he got $14 million, as did his father and his sister Ann, because they were all minority shareholders.
His brother-in-law David Weyrich said that if Mr. Martin had objections to the sale, he did not voice them.
Mrs. Martin says she believes the move from California was motivated in part because he resented his brother and brother-in-law's bigger role in the community.
She also speculates that the Adirondacks estate was alluring partly as a way of keeping up. ''I think he wanted to show his brother and brother-in-law that he had a big home, too,'' she said over dinner recently in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
Mr. Martin disagreed. ''We are Irish Catholics, and we thought it would be a compound for our family over generations,'' he said. After the cramped rooms at their house in England, he liked the big rooms, he said. ''Sometimes, things don't work out.''

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, Big Step Ahead For Mass Transit

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- This auto-obsessed city -- a place where people love their cars almost as much as they hate the traffic -- has embarked on the biggest expansion of its mass transit system in decades, an effort to change the way people navigate its sprawling and clogged streets and freeways.
Los Angeles transit officials, after years of debate, have approved an 8.6-mile extension of the Purple Line subway, from Koreatown through a crowded corridor of offices, homes, museums, schools and shopping centers in Beverly Hills, Century City and Westwood.
What once seemed a quixotic vision -- the ''Subway to the Sea,'' connecting Union Station in downtown to the Pacific Ocean in Santa Monica -- no longer seems quite so quixotic. 
At the same time, Los Angeles received $546 million from the federal government to build, over the next 10 years, an 8.5-mile above-ground light-rail line from the Crenshaw district to Los Angeles International Airport.
An 11-mile extension of the Metro Gold Line, which starts in East Los Angeles and will eventually go out to Montclair, began in June, and construction is set to begin this year extending the Exposition Light Rail Line from Culver City to Santa Monica.
Taken together, these developments have emboldened mass transit enthusiasts here and lent credibility to what has become something of a legacy project for Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa, who ran for office pledging to build a transit system that would upend long-established commuting habits and ease what has long been a bane of life in Los Angeles.
''This put to rest all this talk of, 'Will we ever build a subway?' '' Mr. Villaraigosa said, somewhat triumphantly, in an interview. ''This is a big deal. People have been talking about it for years. And they were making fun of me: 'Where is the subway?!' ''
Los Angeles once had a large, intricate and thriving public transportation system, with so-called Yellow Car trolleys that ran on downtown streets and a vast network of Red Cars, operated by the Pacific Electric Railroad, that ran throughout the region. This was dismantled amid the city's fervent embrace of the automobile (encouraged, in no small part, by oil interests in Los Angeles that realized the economic potential of the car).
But with a vote by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority's board last month to approve the Purple Line expansion, there is a consensus that these projects are going to be built, even among those who describe them as a waste of money in a region that will never embrace mass transit. The projects are being financed by a half-cent sales tax surcharge approved by Los Angeles voters two years ago and expected to raise $40 billion over the next 30 years.
Not to say that there aren't battles left to be fought.
Beverly Hills officials oppose a proposed stretch of the Purple Line because it would burrow under a public high school; they want the line moved a few blocks north. That has its own complications: skirting the high school would put the subway cheek by jowl against an earthquake fault that runs down Santa Monica Boulevard.
''We very much want the Subway to the Sea, but we are very strongly against the high school route,'' said Jimmy Delshad, the mayor of Beverly Hills.
Most immediately, the Republican takeover of the United States House this month threatens to undermine a fiscal maneuver pressed by Mr. Villaraigosa in Washington to accelerate construction of the projects. The mayor had asked the federal government to give an advance loan against those sales tax revenues, allowing the work to be done in 10 years, an idea that seemed to be gaining steam until Election Day.
''Let's face it, after the midterm election we're in a new world,'' said Joel Epstein, a mass transit advocate.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, the Democrat who represents the area, said he hoped Republicans would not block a plan that, he argued, would create jobs, improve the transit system and not cost the federal government a significant sum of money.
''This is the kind of idea that some Republicans may even find attractive,'' Mr. Waxman said. ''It's tremendously important. I see that whenever I'm at home and in my car: it's just terrible traffic.''
Still, the most intriguing question may be whether a place that has so embraced the culture of cars -- and, with its sprawl, could not be more different from subway-friendly cities like New York, London and Paris -- will make the kind of lifestyle adjustment envisioned by mass transit enthusiasts. There were an average of 295,000 daily riders on the 79 miles of subway and light-rail lines in October, and 1.2 million on city buses.
Tom Rubin, a mass transit consultant in Oakland, called the subway project fiscal folly that would serve only to take resources away from the widely used, if less efficient, network of buses.
''They have been pushing rail expansion for decades now,'' Mr. Rubin said, ''and it has not had much of an impact in terms of increasing transit ridership. The big problem is that these are very, very expensive, and we wind up spending so much money on building these rail lines that there is not enough to operate bus service. So we wind up cutting back on bus operations and then raising fares, which drives the riders away.''
Robert B. Cervero, the director of the University of California Transportation Center in Berkeley, said that if the subway expansion cut commuting time as promised, it would indeed change ridership habits. Transit officials said the ride from Koreatown to Westwood by subway would take 24 minutes, compared with 50 minutes during the rush in a car or on a bus.
''The science of public transit is not too complicated,'' Mr. Cervero said in an e-mail message. ''It comes down to how time-competitive transit is with the private car. If it takes two to three times longer to get from Point A to Point B by transit, the vast majority of folks will drive. If it's faster going by bus or train, then most will forsake their car and ride transit.''
Mr. Epstein said that changing demographics and population patterns -- and ever-rising frustration over traffic -- would inevitably drive people from cars underground.
''There's a whole new type of Angeleno who has no cultural opposition to riding,'' he said. ''The whole old-school L.A. thinking that people don't ride subways, that's a thing of the past.''

HEADLINE: Texas A&M Stakes Claim As Leader in Pharmaceuticals

BYLINE: By REEVE HAMILTON. 
rhamilton@texastribune.org

 BODY:
One hundred miles from the nearest major city, where there was nothing but flat earth seven months ago, a 145,000-square-foot facility has sprung up on the Texas A&M Health Science Center campus. Starting in January, its cavernous rooms will be filled with racks of tobacco-like plants expected to produce as many influenza vaccines in a single month as a traditional lab does in one year, at a fraction of the cost.
Dr. Brett Giroir, the vice chancellor for research at the Texas A&M University System, calls it the most exciting project of its kind in the world, the potential savior in the next pandemic. And, he said, ''It's in Bryan. Go figure.''
Dr. Giroir said he believed that a confluence of factors had primed Bryan and neighboring College Station, where Texas A&M's flagship campus is, to be the country's ''third coast'' of pharmaceutical manufacturing, with dozens of companies cropping up in the next 5 to 10 years -- a tall order for a highly agricultural area with a population of around 200,000 and an economy driven almost solely by the university. 
Mayor Jason Bienski of Bryan said that a few years ago he considered it a success if the region lured businesses offering minimum-wage jobs. Now, the city is courting biotech companies promising six-figure salaries. Indeed, Bryan-College Station is an active partner in what has become a public-private effort; more than 1,400 acres of a proposed 3,500-acre biotech research corridor is on city and county land.
Project GreenVax, the vaccine-producing collaboration between the A&M System and G-Con, L.L.C., a private company, based in Bryan will be the first major test of the area's potential -- and it has already received a $40 million vote of confidence from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, the research and development office of the United States Department of Defense.
From the federal perspective, the developments at Texas A&M are strategically well-timed. In August, in the wake of a frustratingly slow response to the swine flu pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report calling for ''the nimble, flexible capacity'' to produce medical countermeasures like vaccines ''in the face of any attack or threat, known or unknown.''
Nimble and flexible is what A&M hopes to do best, thanks to G-Con's customizable mobile labs: interchangeable ''pods'' that can float in and out of a facility on air bearings. Another new campus facility, the National Center for Therapeutics Manufacturing, scheduled for completion late next year, will include a 104,000-square-foot bioprocessing wing with space for up to 20 pods. Project GreenVax will also use the pods, allowing the simultaneous production of multiple vaccines and -- it is hoped -- other drugs.
But federal support does not guarantee success. Matt Winkler, a biotech entrepreneur based in Austin, has watched the capital city's biotech industry grow from nothing to ''almost critical mass,'' but it took 25 years. Bryan-College Station may face an even tougher road, Mr. Winkler said.
''People would rather live in California or Massachusetts than live in Austin,'' he said, ''and people would rather live in Austin than College Station.''
Dr. Giroir said that recruiting talent from the coasts had not been difficult. Despite its recessionary woes, he said, Texas is ''like the Garden of Eden,'' compared with California and Massachusetts in terms of economy and opportunity.
He speaks from experience. When Dr. Giroir visited A&M for the first time in 2007, it was not with the intention of joining the staff. He was there because he was the director of the defense science office at Darpa and was seeking a way to save soldiers bleeding out on the battlefield. He found what he was looking for -- animal models that could simulate hemorrhaging soldiers -- at the Texas A&M Institute for Preclinical Studies, which specializes in studying disease therapies in large animals.
''It was very clear to me that there was a core of a bigger piece that clearly the federal government needed, but probably Texas needed, too,'' Dr. Giroir said.
By 2008, he had accepted his current position and had begun to lay the groundwork for a biotech cluster.
Public perception is hard to change. Though Texas is considered a leader in basic biomedical research, the well-established research hubs on the East and West Coasts dwarf the state's biopharmaceutical infrastructure.
Texas is working to change that. For starters, as Barry Holtz, the G-Con president puts it, the state has ''declared a major in cancer,'' funneling money to research and development projects through two major state-run grant programs: the Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund.
Some suspect that A&M's ability to leverage those resources depends largely on the generosity of its most powerful alumnus: Gov. Rick Perry. But Mr. Perry's support has come with some complications: When the Emerging Technology Fund granted $50 million to the National Center for Therapeutic Manufacturing without going through the usual channels, lawmakers balked. Mr. Perry's Texas Enterprise Fund, designed to stimulate economic development through relocation incentives, made headlines by spending $15 million for the Texas A&M Institute for Genomic Medicine, a genetic research center that has taken years to get off the ground.
That the governor's ties to A&M are credited anytime money flows to the university bothers Dr. Giroir. ''It's much more than that,'' he said. ''Certain kind of things come here because this is the best place in the world to do them.''
But with a biennial state budget shortfall that could be $20 billion or more, state grant programs face an uncertain future.
Even so, Texas could do more to roll out the red carpet, said Thomas Kowalski, president of the Texas Healthcare & Bioscience Institute, the industry's state advocacy organization. Texas is one of a handful of states that do not offer research and development tax credits, Mr. Kowalski said.
''It's a competitive industry,'' he said. ''All 50 states are engaged now. Globally, you have India, China, Japan. The race is on.''
Dr. Giroir said people needed to understand that the innovations in Bryan-College Station had not been tried anywhere else. They come with incalculable risks, he said, but they are subsiding all the time.
''Is there a chance that all of this can fail? Yes,'' he said. ''Is that chance a whole lot lower today than it was two years ago? Absolutely.''

HEADLINE: Pages to Turn Through the Year

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER

 BODY:
THE BEST OF IT: NEW AND SELECTED POEMSby Kay Ryan. Kay Ryan's poems are as slim as runway models, so tiny you could almost make them Twitter messages. They are also, as it happens, riddled with heartbreak and loss, and possess an essential gawkiness that, despite their wit, draws you close. Ms. Ryan's poems are, in 2010, about as good as American poetry gets. (Grove, $24)
HITCH-22: A MEMOIRby Christopher Hitchens. Mr. Hitchens's memoir traces his coming of age as a public intellectual and as a man, and it's both electric and electrifying. Mr. Hitchens embraces the serious things, the things that matter: social justice, learning, direct language, the free play of the mind, loyalty, holding public figures to high standards. His book is also a lovely paean to the dearness of one's friends. (Twelve, $26.99) 
THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKSby Rebecca Skloot. This thorny and provocative first book -- it's about cancer, racism, scientific ethics and crippling poverty -- floods over you like a narrative dam break. It's one of the most graceful and moving nonfiction books I've read in a very long time. More than 10 years in the making, it feels like a book Rebecca Skloot was born to write. (Crown, $26)
SIMON WIESENTHAL: THE LIFE AND LEGENDSby Tom Segev. A meticulous and forceful biography of the legendary Nazi hunter, a man who led one of the 20th century's most interesting lives. Tom Segev's book begins in medias res -- with the hunt for Adolf Eichmann -- and rarely slows to catch its breath. This biography captures a character, and is cleareyed about its subject's many character flaws. (Doubleday, $35)
MOURNING DIARYby Roland Barthes. On Oct. 26, 1977, the day after his mother's death, the French theorist and literary critic Roland Barthes began keeping a diary of his suffering. Now, 30 years after his own death, it has been published. This book's unvarnished quality is the source of its wrecking cumulative power. Barthes's ironic intellect is here wrapped around his nakedly beating heart. (Hill and Wang, $25)
THE LAST HERO: A LIFE OF HENRY AARONby Howard Bryant. This confident and brawny book is, incredibly, the first full-dress biography of the man who, in 1974, broke Babe Ruth's home run record and did so as a black man playing for Major League Baseball's first franchise in the Deep South. It's also a striking and elegiac assessment of race relations in America in the mid-20th century, and a rich portrait of a complex, introverted man. (Pantheon, $29.95)
I.O.U.: WHY EVERYONE OWES EVERYONE AND NO ONE CAN PAYby John Lanchester. Mr. Lanchester, who is British, isn't an economist or a business journalist. He's a novelist (and a talented one) who happened to become obsessed with the global banking crisis, and who has written a shrewd, bleakly funny book about it. He explains complicated things like credit default swaps with rigor, but he is also guided by perception and instinct. (Simon & Schuster, $25)
THE POSSESSED: ADVENTURES WITH RUSSIAN BOOKS AND THE PEOPLE WHO READ THEMby Elif Batuman. Ms. Batuman's funny and melancholy first book is ostensibly about her favorite Russian authors but is actually about a million other things: grad school, literary theory, translation, biography, love affairs and how to choose a nice watermelon in Uzbekistan. It asks this plaintive question: How do we bring our lives closer to our favorite books? (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15)
OPERATION MINCEMEAT: HOW A DEAD MAN AND A BIZARRE PLAN FOOLED THE NAZIS AND ASSURED AN ALLIED VICTORYby Ben Macintyre. What makes ''Operation Mincemeat'' -- a book about a corpse with false papers that Allied spies set afloat off the coast of Spain during World War II -- so winning, beyond the author's research, is his elegant, jaunty and very British high style. The major players seem to have emerged from an Evelyn Waugh novel that's been tweaked by P. G. Wodehouse. (Harmony Books, $25.99)
PARISIANS: AN ADVENTURE HISTORY OF PARISby Graham Robb. Mr. Robb's ebullient book is a defiantly nonlinear history of Paris from the dawn of the French Revolution through the 2005 riots in Clichy-sous-Bois, told from unlikely perspectives and focusing on lesser-known but reverberating moments in the city's history. Mr. Robb smuggles into his text a tremendous amount of real feeling and playfulness, those unmistakable signs of a mind that's wide awake and breathing on the page. (W. W. Norton & Company, 28.95)

HEADLINE: Twentysomethings in Memphis

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
Kentucker Audley's $17,000 third feature, ''Open Five,'' has a shape to it, as well as a look and a rhythm, and at that price, those are accomplishments. The coherence of the story, about four twentysomethings hanging out and hooking up during a weekend in Memphis, and the relative polish of the camerawork and editing may indicate either growth or capitulation on Mr. Audley's part, depending on your point of view. They certainly reflect a valuable contribution by the better-known director Joe Swanberg, who served as cinematographer. 
Coherence and polish don't compensate for bad writing or not knowing how to direct actors, however, and in the end ''Open Five'' is a nice-looking bore (a drag, if you're feeling uncharitable) that seems long at 66 minutes. We're supposed to be getting something important, or at least interesting, from the barely dramatized wanderings and conversations of the four principals: two Memphis men, a musician (Jake Rabinbach) and a filmmaker (Mr. Audley), and the two New York actresses (Shannon Esper and Genevieve Angelson) who come to visit them. But we just get sex-and-art banalities and tiny epiphanies, whether scripted or improvised. Mr. Audley has said that his films can be called documentaries, but documentaries need interesting characters too.
It's possible to watch the lesser examples of this style of film -- mumblecore, lo-fi -- in a kind of self-narcotized state where you appreciate the work of the actors and the surface fidelity to a post-college, creatively and economically frustrated, largely white milieu (if that's a world you're familiar with). Ms. Esper, Ms. Angelson and Amy Seimetz, as the former girlfriend of one of the men, help in that regard, bringing some complicated life to the film's barely sketched-in women. They give performances; Mr. Rabinbach tries and fails, while Mr. Audley doesn't appear to try. Even playing yourself -- the men are named Jake and Kentucker -- takes some effort.
Mr. Swanberg, meanwhile, gets some lovely, autumnal images on-screen, like a shot of the foursome sitting in lawn chairs on a roof while a movie looms behind them, unspooling on an outdoor screen. There are also diverting, regrettably short visits to Graceland and a Sunday gospel service.

HEADLINE: European Markets Higher as U.S. Takes the Day Off

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Shares in Europe rose on Thursday after an upbeat finish on Wall Street before the Thanksgiving break, but the euro failed to get much of a lift amid concerns that Europe's debt crisis could soon embroil Portugal or, more dangerous, Spain.
In Europe, the FTSE 100 in London was up 49.06 points, or 0.87 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt rose 59.93 points, or 0.88 percent. The CAC 40 in France climbed 16.88 points, or 0.45 percent. 
The week had a bumpy start when worries about Europe's debt crisis became more acute after Ireland's request for a huge financial bailout and tensions mounted on the Korean peninsula, but stocks have recovered their poise. The lift came mostly from data released on Wednesday showing a sharp drop in weekly jobless claims in the United States and encouraging consumer confidence figures ahead of the crucial Christmas shopping season.
The American economic data confirmed that the recovery continued and might be picking up pace.
Investors remain cautious, however, about whether the improvement will do much to get the American unemployment rate down from near 10 percent. That is a priority for both the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve, which earlier this month announced that it was pumping up to $600 billion into the economy over the coming months to help get unemployment down and prevent a dangerous bout of deflation -- that is, falling prices.
Investors also remain watchful of developments in Europe's debt crisis, which has already forced both Greece and Ireland to tap their partners in the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund for bailout money.
On Wednesday, the Irish government introduced another 15 billion euros' worth of austerity measures in return for a financial lifeline estimated at 85 billion euros, or $113 billion.
It has done little to shore up confidence in the bond markets as investors continue to fret about the country's political instability -- on Tuesday, Ireland's premier, Brian Cowen, bowed to the inevitable and confirmed that the country would be going to the polls early next year if the 2011 budget was passed.
''Complicating matters further, the leading opposition party signaled that they will re-examine any I.M.F.-E.U. deal if they come to power in an early 2011 general election,'' said Carl Campus, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.
As a result, the euro is finding it difficult to reclaim much lost ground despite the general rise in risk appetite since the United States jobless claims figures were released.
The improvement in risk appetite would normally give the euro a boost against the dollar -- when investors have a greater interest in riskier investments, stocks usually get a boost while the dollar loses some of its appeal as a perceived haven.
The euro gained 0.2 percent, to $1.3360, at 5 p.m. in New York, up from $1.3285 on Wednesday.
The big concern in the markets, though, remains whether Portugal or Spain will be dragged into the mire.
The prevailing view in the markets is that Europe may be able to support Portugal but that a bailout of Spain would be one step too far, potentially putting the euro project itself in jeopardy. Spain accounts for around 10 percent of the euro zone economy, in contrast with the other three countries, which account for around 2 percent each.
Bond yields in the so-called periphery countries continued to edge up on Thursday, in a further sign that the euro zone's debt crisis was a long way from being solved. The yield on Spain's 10-year bonds was up another 0.13 percentage point, at 5.19 percent, while Portugal's held steady, at 7 percent.
Investors are also keeping a close watch on developments in east Asia after Tuesday's exchange of artillery between North Korea and South Korea.
''Whilst Seoul may have shown restraint over recent events, there's still the uncertainty of what Pyongyang could do next to bear in mind,'' a research analyst at IG Markets, Ben Potter, said.
Asian markets ended mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average rose 0.5 percent, to 10,079.76 points, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 0.1 percent, to 23,054.68.
Chinese shares closed higher on Thursday, tracking overseas gains, buoyed by property and oil refiners. The benchmark Shanghai composite index gained 1.3 percent, to 2,898.26 points, while the Shenzhen composite index for China's smaller second exchange edged 0.3 percent higher, to 1,337.83.

PERSON: Chalmers Johnson 

HEADLINE: Chalmers Johnson, 79, Critic Of American Role in World

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Chalmers Johnson, an Asian studies scholar who stirred controversy with books contending that the United States was trying to create a global empire and was paying a stiff price for it, died Saturday at his home in Cardiff-by-the Sea, Calif. He was 79.
The cause was complications of rheumatoid arthritis, his wife, Sheila, said. 
Dr. Johnson, who considered himself a longtime cold warrior, was a consultant to the Central Intelligence Agency for many years. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union he became concerned that the United States was increasingly using its military presence to gain power over the global economy.
In ''Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire'' (Metropolitan Books, 2000), Dr. Johnson wondered why America's military spending continued to rise after the cold war had ended. He concluded that through a network of more than 700 strategic bases around the world, the United States was committed to creating global hegemony. And he worried about the consequences for American democracy.
It was a theme he expanded upon in three subsequent books, ''The Sorrows of Empire'' (2004), ''Nemesis'' (2006) and ''Dismantling the Empire'' (2010).
Summarizing the series in ''Dismantling the Empire,'' Dr. Johnson said that ''blowback'' means more than a negative, sometimes violent reaction to United States policy. ''It refers to retaliation for the numerous illegal operations we have carried out abroad that were kept totally secret from the American public,'' he wrote.
''This means that when the retaliation comes, as it did so spectacularly on Sept. 11, 2001, the American public is unable to put the events in context. So they tend to support acts intended to lash out against the perpetrators, thereby most commonly preparing the ground for yet another cycle of blowback.''
To maintain its empire, he said, the United States ''will inevitably undercut domestic democracy.''
In a review of ''The Sorrows of Empire'' in The New York Times, Ronald Asmus, a deputy assistant secretary of state under President Bill Clinton, wrote that the book was ''a cry from the heart of an intelligent person who fears that the basic values of our republic are in danger.'' He added that it ''conveys a sense of impending doom rooted in a belief that the United States has entered a perpetual state of war that will drain our economy and destroy our constitutional freedoms.''
E. B. Keehn, past president of the Japan Society of Southern California and a former lecturer at Cambridge University, said in an interview on Monday that Dr. Johnson ''did not go into his work with an agenda.''
''If the data pointed to a conclusion that made people uncomfortable, including himself,'' Dr. Keehn said, ''he would never shy away from it.''
That was true not only of the ''blowback'' series, Dr. Keehn said, but of Dr. Johnson's studies of Chinese Communism and of the role Japan's government played in its economy.
His 1982 book, ''MITI and the Japanese Miracle'' (MITI stands for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry), challenged conventional wisdom with its premise that Japan was a ''capitalist developmental state'' that combined government industrial strategy with free-market forces. His ideas contradicted those of economists who insisted that Japan's economic rise was almost entirely based on the free market.
The heavily state-influenced economic model that Dr. Johnson elucidated can now be seen in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China. ''This,'' Dr. Keehn said, ''is how you can have a contradiction that the world's last remaining powerful Communist country is also the world's greatest rising capitalist success.''
Born in Phoenix on Aug. 6, 1931, Chalmers Ashby Johnson was one of two children of Katherine and David Johnson Jr. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1953, with a degree in economics, he served in the Navy in the Korean War; it was the start of his fascination with Asia. ''His assault boat landing craft was constantly being repaired in Yokohama,'' his wife said, ''so he started to study Japanese.''
After receiving his master's degree in 1957 and his doctorate in 1961, both from Berkeley, he joined the university's political science faculty. He headed the China Center at Berkeley from 1967 to 1972 and was chairman of the political science department from 1976 to 1980. In 1988 he moved to the University of California, San Diego, to teach at its new School of International Relations and Pacific Studies. He retired in 1992.
Besides his wife, the former Sheila Knipscheer, he is survived by his sister, Barbara Johnson.

HEADLINE: In California, Carports That Can Generate Electricity

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
SAN JOSE, Calif. -- And California begat cars, and the cars begat asphalt parking lots. And the lots spawned electricity, transforming the hills and the deserts.
Ersatz roofs made of solar panels have sprouted above dozens of school parking lots in the state, altering vistas and promoting a philosophy of green thinking among the young. Yet the primary driver of the solar roofs is economic.
By forming partnerships with banks and other backers, school districts get guarantees of reliably cheap electricity for their buildings for as long as 20 years. The institutions, which finance the systems and sell the electricity back to the schools, also receive tax incentives from the federal and state governments. 
So far, solar carports have been installed at some 75 elementary, high school and community college campuses in California, the majority of them in the San Francisco area. Some are designed as a broad fan of panels canting slightly upward and supported by a single pole; more often they are an ode to rectilinearity, parallel to the asphalt and supported by a line of poles between the rows of parking spaces.
Walter Hood, a designer based in Oakland, said he sees the seeds of a new suburban aesthetic in the proliferation of the photovoltaic panels. ''It's an interesting piece of infrastructure,'' he said, adding, ''So maybe in the future we're thinking of parking lots as something that is always covered.''
Schools were not the first to move in this direction. Leading the way in this re-creation of the suburban landscape was Google, which added solar canopies to the parking lots at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., three years ago. Some come with outlets for solar-charging electric cars.
''At the Googleplex, the P.V. is almost acting like a grove of trees,'' Mr. Hood said.
But schools are now at the leading edge of the trend. ''This will soon be the norm,'' said Michelle O'Shea, a science teacher at Leland High School in southwestern San Jose, where the parking lot went solar a year ago. ''It will be hard to imagine that we didn't do this.''
For students, the new structures can offer an education in how clean electricity is generated. ''Schoolchildren are growing up with it, so it becomes ingrained in their perception of how a society functions,'' said Brad Parker, a consultant on a solar carport project for the San Luis Coastal Unified School District in central California.
And interest in the systems is growing. ''I've gotten calls from Hawaii, from Canada, from all over California,'' said John Cimino, the director of maintenance, operations and transportation for the Milpitas Unified School District, northeast of San Jose.
The solar panels fulfill 75 percent of his district's annual electricity needs during the school year, he said, and 100 percent of its summer needs.
The company that brokered the district's deal was Chevron Energy Solutions, a subsidiary of Chevron and perhaps the most active of a dozen such intermediaries working around California. The same company helped create a 2.1-megawatt parking lot system on the Fresno campus of California State University.
Brian Swanson, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, the utility that serves most communities in the Bay Area, said that the overall capacity of school-based photovoltaic systems there grew nearly fivefold from 2008 to 2009, to 15.5 megawatts from 327 kilowatts. This year, the cumulative total was 20 megawatts, enough to power 3,500 homes.
Yet in the Southern California city of Lancaster, a single parking-lot solar system being constructed by the Antelope Valley Unified School District could reach 9.6 megawatts, according to Mat Havens, the district's director of facilities.
The estimated savings over the 20-year life of a generating contract can run from $12 million for a district like Milpitas (although savings last year were a much more modest $51,000) to $40 million for Antelope Valley.
Yet solar parking lots are not solely a California or Southwest phenomenon. In New Jersey, two elementary schools and a middle school in Newark plan to install them in addition to rooftop photovoltaic installations on the school buildings. Boonton High School in Morris County, N.J., is building solar coverings for its parking lots to supplement photovoltaic systems being installed on the roofs of its ice rinks.
While the solar parking lots have generally been welcomed by local residents, people in one town in San Luis Obispo County were less receptive. A community advisory board in the small coastal town of Los Osos voted 8 to 1 to oppose the panels on parking lots at a local middle and elementary school, with one panel member warning of ''visual blight.''
Indeed, the current generation of solar carports does have a utilitarian feel and the bare-bones aesthetic of a Quonset hut.
But Mr. Hood, the Oakland designer, suggested that designers could work with manufacturers to change that, treating the photovoltaic materials as a potentially beguiling ''surface treatment'' rather than a mere assemblage of panels.
''They are becoming more ubiquitous in our landscape,'' he said. ''It's not just parking lots.''
From schools to offices to malls, photovoltaic arrays could one day become as familiar as fire hydrants, Mr. Hood said.
''Once they become ubiquitous, they disappear,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Construction Has Halted At Los Angeles Museum

BYLINE: Compiled by RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
The directors of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art have ordered work to stop on the second phase of a three-part, $450 million renovation and expansion plan until they can raise more money, The Los Angeles Times reported. The decision to halt the project was prompted by a report on the museum's finances issued by Moody's Investors Services last week. The report showed that while the museum retained its A2 investment rating, considered a good credit risk, on its $383 million in construction bonds, a negative rating was expected in the future should it be unable to maintain a certain degree of liquidity. Construction costs and a drop in private donations during the recession have both taken a toll. The museum is hoping to raise an additional $100 million in donations before continuing work. Under Phase 1 the Broad Contemporary Art Museum and the BP Grand Entrance were opened in 2008 and the Resnick Exhibition Pavilion in September. The second phase will turn a former department store into new offices and galleries. Specifics about the third phase, which involves renovations to older buildings, have not yet been disclosed.

HEADLINE: A Pit Stop for Extraterrestrials, and the Humans Who Love Them

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
HOOPER, Colo. -- ''I like humans, they're fun,'' Judy Messoline said as she showed a visitor through her vortex garden, which psychics have said contains not just one, but two separate portals to a parallel universe.
Many of the humans who come to Ms. Messoline's U.F.O. Watchtower, hard by the dueling vortexes, may be fun, but they are also wounded. About 95 percent, by her estimate -- and she makes a point of asking -- have experienced something, a shudder in the fabric of the ordinary, the sighting of an unidentified flying object that to one degree or another has haunted them and drawn them to this otherwise empty spot in south-central Colorado. Having fun in thinking about extraterrestrials, she said, is usually bound up with something deeper right here on the home planet. 
''The world needs a place where people can go to talk about their experiences and not be laughed at,'' she said.
People do laugh here. One of Ms. Messoline's principles in building the Watchtower a decade ago, in an attempt to raise cash as her cattle ranch collapsed in economic ruin, was that U.F.O.-spotting should be a hoot, and whenever possible, a party.
''The best sightings have been when people are just out enjoying the evening,'' she said. Fifty-nine events -- lights that move erratically or, during the day, objects that defy explanation in shape or movement -- have been witnessed from the tower since 2000, Ms. Messoline said, sometimes by dozens of people at the same time.
No one knows the count before that, since no local institution existed for counting. Many residents, though, say the San Luis Valley, just north of the New Mexico state line, has been a hotspot for decades. U.F.O. reports reach all the way back to the early settlements of the 1600s, with a particularly noted wave in the late 1960s.
The turmoil of modern life is also in evidence near the tower, at the house once occupied by Ms. Messoline's son and his family, now vacant and in foreclosure since the couple's divorce.
''Broke my heart,'' she said. Adding to the pain, she said, is that the house will probably never sell. ''Who wants to live next to a U.F.O. Watchtower?'' she said.
Truth be told, the Watchtower -- really just a framed metal platform perhaps 10 feet off the ground -- is not much of a moneymaker at $2 a head for admission. Ms. Messoline, 65, a former housecleaner from the Denver area who moved to Hooper in the mid-1990s, still needs the paycheck from Miss Deb's, a convenience store down the road, identified by the giant chicken out in front, to make ends meet.
But that is the interconnection of a lot of things in Hooper, a dot of perhaps 100 souls in a vast and lonely place. Harsh realities in economics and climate -- high poverty rates and brutal winters -- are interlaced with vistas of breathtaking beauty and a local culture that has long prized and cultivated the offbeat.
Ms. Messoline furthered that spirit by encouraging visitors to leave something in her vortex garden. One recent offering: a two-foot-tall Superman doll with one hand extended, holding a bottle of hot sauce, perhaps in greeting or in supplication.
Another visitor left a primer for extraterrestrials who might find themselves confused about human tableware. A folding knife-and-spoon was marked with text and helpful arrows pointing in the direction of each object: ''This is a knife and a spoon, alien,'' it said.
Even the winds are strange. One corner of the San Luis Valley, banked on all sides by mountains, somehow became a collecting spot for blown sand over the past few thousand years, since the drying up of an ancient lake bed. The result: a little bit of the Sahara in Colorado at Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, about 15 miles from here.
The sky, with barely a town to break the landscape, is black at night -- a riot of stars not visible from the big city -- and huge at all hours. And people here are used to being out and aware of their surroundings, which makes them perhaps more likely than city folk to see things in the great Out There.
''There's not a lot of activity, so people have more opportunity to be watching what's around them,'' said JoDene Newmyer, 64, who works with Ms. Messoline at the convenience store.
Ms. Newmyer's own U.F.O. story -- and most people here seem to have one -- occurred on the Friday morning of Memorial Day weekend, 1972. She was driving her daughter to the baby sitter at 7 a.m. when she stopped cold at the sight of a huge angular silver object just above the horizon.
''Flying saucer? I will not say that,'' Ms. Newmyer said. ''But unidentifiable it definitely was, because I've never seen anything like it.''
Ms. Messoline says the years of scanning the sky and of meeting people who are drawn to her and her tower have changed her.
She decided recently to put the patch of ground under the tower and the vortex garden in her will, donating it to a U.F.O. research group in Denver to continue the work, or the fun, after she's gone, even though she knows that a tower in perpetuity will probably doom any chance of a sale of her son's former home.

HEADLINE: A Small, Young Theater Company Aims High

BYLINE: By CHLOE VELTMAN. 
cveltman@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
In ''Coraline,'' a dark fantasy novel by Neil Gaiman, a young girl explores a surreal parallel universe where life resembles the world she knows, and yet defies all of her expectations.
In some ways, the protagonist's experience is like attending performances at SF Playhouse, the theater based in downtown San Francisco, where a musical adaptation of ''Coraline'' by the composer Stephin Merritt (of the rock group The Magnetic Fields) and the playwright David Greenspan is having its West Coast premiere through Jan. 15.
SF Playhouse is just like many other small theater companies. It produces plays on a shoestring budget in cramped surroundings with a minimal, multitasking staff. Its artistic director, Bill English, acts, directs, programs and designs, and Susi Damilano, the producing director, acts, directs and produces. 
But unlike others of its size, the company stages some of the most consistently high-quality work around in its unassuming, 100-seat black-box space at 533 Sutter Street. SF Playhouse attracts some of the top actors in the Bay Area and delivers a level of set, lighting, costume and sound design more commonly associated with theaters five times its size.
The combination of SF Playhouse's small Off Off Off Broadway setup and sophisticated Off Broadway sensibility sets it apart.
''The company often sells out completely even with new, untried work,'' said Brad Erickson, the executive director of Theatre Bay Area, a performing arts support organization.
Theater companies typically take years to build an audience and develop their artistic identity. But SF Playhouse has flourished on both counts since its founding in 2003 by the husband-and-wife team of Mr. English and Ms. Damilano. Two years ago, its subscriber base, currently at 1,400, increased by half. And the company's programming has evolved from mainly popular fare like ''Our Town'' by Thornton Wilder to riskier productions.
Crowd-pleasing shows like ''The Fantasticks'' still appear on the roster alongside proven works by contemporary playwrights like Sarah Ruhl and Tracy Letts. But SF Playhouse is also investing deeply in the work of local dramatists. It has five Bay Area playwrights under commission: Lauren Gunderson, Aaron Loeb, William Bivins, Jon Tracy and Tim Barsky.
Its world premiere of Mr. Loeb's ''Abraham Lincoln's Big Gay Dance Party'' during the 2008-9 season went on to be a highlight of the 2009 New York International Fringe Festival and received a run Off Broadway this year.
The company's new ''Sandbox'' series distinguishes itself from other outlets for new writing by presenting lengthy, fully staged runs of works in progress by Bay Area authors in its 49-seat studio space.
''It's unusual to find a major albeit small house that likes to nurture such strong relationships with local playwrights,'' said Mr. Bivins, whose drama ''The Apotheosis of Pig Husbandry'' was produced under the Sandbox mantle last spring.
SF Playhouse has ambitious plans. In addition to hiring additional staff members in the coming months, it is searching for space near Union Square in which to build a 200-seat auditorium that can alternate between proscenium arch, thrust stage and theater-in-the-round layouts.
But scaling up will be challenging.
Donations to the theater have increased recently, but box office revenue has remained flat for three seasons, a product, Mr. English said, of the flagging economy and the fact that the company is reaching capacity in its small auditorium.
''Right now,'' he said, ''we're looking at keeping the box office consistent as a minor victory.''
As SF Playhouse becomes more visible, its failures stand out as much as its successes. Earning the rights to stage the West Coast premiere of ''Coraline,'' a major coup for the small company, may now be overshadowed by the production's mostly lackluster reviews.
Still, SF Playhouse excels in its ability to do a lot with a little. Most of its performers are on Actors' Equity contracts, meaning they are paid more than non-union performers. The company is producing six main-stage shows this season on its $910,000 annual budget plus two Sandbox productions. In contrast, the Magic Theater, an organization of comparable size, has a budget of more than $1.3 million and is staging four plays.
Mr. English's background in the construction business helps the theater to source materials economically. ''I can get more done for less money,'' said Mr. English, who designs many of the sets, including the one for ''Coraline.''
Ms. Damilano's accounting skills also contribute to the thriftiness.
''Bill is expansive but demanding, and Susi is nurturing but tough-minded about the bottom line,'' said Chris Smith, who has directed two productions at SF Playhouse. ''It's a good balance.''
The relative maturity of SF Playhouse's founders (Ms. Damilano is in her 40s and Mr. English, in his 50s) and their decades of working in Bay Area theater are another asset.
''Most companies are started by recent graduates where everyone's on a steep learning curve,'' Mr. Erickson said. ''But Bill and Susi have been able to jump ahead by building on their considerable experience and relationships.''

HEADLINE: Another Christo Project, To Engage and Divide

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
SALIDA, Colo. -- When two decades ago the artist Christo proposed a gigantic art installation spanning 42 miles of the Arkansas River with sections of suspended luminescent fabric, he knew it would incite public debate. He said those discussions -- over nature, its place and its purpose -- would be part of the art.
And on that point, if on nothing else in this deeply controversial project, both sides agree. ''Over the River,'' as the proposed installation is called, has already created something new here in this central Colorado community -- a shared experience, a kind of civic performance art -- however people feel about the specifics. The recent public comment period, which drew 3,500 responses, reflected civic engagement in full boil.
''The debate, the controversy, the people who are against it, stating their opinions -- it all becomes part of the project,'' said Linda Frances, 68, an artist and gallery owner who passionately supports the project. 
Some argued that the economy would boom, others that the bighorn sheep population would crash, or that Salida's local arts community would be discovered by Christo fans, or that traffic fatalities in the narrow canyons along the site would soar.
Now everyone here awaits a final decision, expected early next year from the federal officials who oversee public lands on whether ''Over the River'' -- at a cost of $50 million or more and years behind schedule -- will ever actually be over the river.
Many people say that things have changed in the years since Christo proposed the project in 1992. The fundamentals of the local economy, still connected in many ways to the old anchors of mining and freight, have shifted toward service and tourism. An arts community that barely existed has emerged and flowered, with people drawn by low rents and sweeping mountain vistas.
The recession, supporters say, has made ''Over the River'' more desirable in a community that is bound more to economic engines of tourism than it used to be.
''This would just be a gift, and we don't even have to do anything,'' said Matt Landry, 35, a co-owner of Headwaters, an outdoor clothing shop in downtown Salida.
''As soon as this is made public, people are going to start Googling Salida,'' Mr. Landry said.
Carlo Boyd, 58, a landscape designer who was in Headwaters on a recent morning, took the opposite tack. Yes, he said, the money would flow, and that is exactly the problem.
''It's all about the almighty buck,'' Mr. Boyd said. ''It's the destruction of Mother Earth and the life blood of the river for money.''
The project, financed by Christo through sales of lithographs and other pieces, would take two years to build and would be displayed for two weeks in the summer of 2014 at the earliest.
In the meantime, a kind of exhausted draw has settled over parts of the field of battle here, with warriors on both sides saying there just are not many minds left to change.
''My thing now is just to keep on painting,'' said Paulette Brodeur, an artist and gallery owner in Salida. ''Whatever is meant to be will be.''
Ms. Brodeur's feelings have ebbed and flowed over the years, she said. She opposed the project because of the possible environmental effects. She supported it because of the economic benefits. Now in the final act, she said, she has settled into a kind of weary abstention.
Greg Felt, a co-owner of a local fly-fishing and river guide service called ArkAnglers, opposes the project but has a similar fatigue.
The project would drape fabric over 5.9 miles of the river in eight sections between Salida and Canon City. ''I'm about done talking,'' said Mr. Felt, who said the two-year construction schedule would chase away fly-fishers who come here for the nature and solitude. ''If someone hasn't taken the time to read the environmental-impact statement, then I just don't have anything more to say to them.''
A final decision will come at a time when attitudes toward faraway economic powers-that-be -- whether in government or business, or art for that matter -- have shifted in the recession, many people here said. When so much in the world seems broken or bent, people said they feared losing something in the community fabric that still worked.
''We never sacrificed the real small-town nature of this place for quick development,'' Mr. Felt said. ''I don't see any need to change that pace and risk fundamentally changing the nature of what we cherish so much here.''
Environmental groups remain divided over the project. The local chapter of the Sierra Club has voiced support, while the statewide chapter has been neutral. In October, during the public comment period, a coalition of local environmental groups across Colorado denounced the plan.
''It amounts to an industrial-scale facility that would be constructed in an area prized for its mostly natural environment,'' the groups said in a letter.
Some residents said that they thought the effects -- positive or negative -- had been exaggerated in the heat of argument, and that much of the intense feeling was really just about the fear that nothing would be same afterward.
''It's probably not going to be the impact they're blowing it up to be, but we've had this little valley all our lives, most of us, and we would just like to not see it change,'' said Stan Embry, 58, a building contractor. ''It's just this guy is coming in, and he's got the bucks so we feel like he's controlling and intruding in our little life.''
Supporters say that Christo's projects -- from the wrapping of the Reichstag Parliament building in Berlin in 1995 to ''The Gates,'' a meandering path of orange awnings through Central Park in New York in 2005 -- are typically misunderstood beforehand as ideas and only really appreciated when they become reality.
''To take our beautiful landscape and then work something incredibly massive, to enhance it for a short period of time -- I frankly can't understand why anybody is against it,'' said Ms. Frances, who owns the Four Winds Gallery.
Jerry Hixon, who owns a cabinetmaking shop along the river near the proposed site, said he had some ambivalence. He also owns a liquor store in Salida that would probably see a jump in business, he said. But he knows the area is changing with or without the project.
''I might have to lock my front door,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cuba-Texas Trade Is Languishing In Poor Economy

BYLINE: By JULIAN AGUILAR. 
jaguilar@texastribune.org

 BODY:
When the global shipping giant CMA CGM announced in April that it had obtained a license to ship container vessels to Cuba via the Port of Houston, business executives and trade experts marveled: Unabashedly Republican Texas would soon become the Communist island nation's leading United States trade partner.
Seven months later, the relationship between two very different kind of red states has not quite lived up to expectations. 
As of September, fewer than 20 percent of the large containers that were expected to leave Houston for Cuba had set sail, said George Armaos, the director of strategic accounts at CMA CGM in Houston. Though the company planned to move 200 to 300 containers by October, so far just 30 or 40 have gone -- the result, Mr. Armaos said, of Cuba's insistence on engaging only with like-minded governments in a foundering global economy.
''Venezuela may be influencing the Cubans not to buy too much from the U.S. producers,'' he said. ''We spoke with some shippers here in the U.S., and they do have some orders, but finances are coming very, very slow.''
Countries like Venezuela, China, Brazil and Vietnam offer more trade incentives to the Cuban government than the private sector in the United States does, said John S. Kavulich, a senior policy adviser with the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council Inc., a nonprofit based in Washington that deals directly with the Cuban government. Cuba is ''focusing on countries that will give them substantial government credits that they know they won't have to pay back,'' Mr. Kavulich said.
According to the economic council's latest report, those countries provide more ''favorable payment terms and less publicity when those payment terms are not honored,'' which is expected given the lack of foreign investment.
''There is absolutely no incentive for the government of Raul Castro to seek any re-engagement with the United States,'' Mr. Kavulich said, ''because any re-engagement with the United States has one guarantee, and that is uncertainty.''
Although Texas only recently got permission to ship large containers to Cuba, it has consistently traded in smaller shipments. In 2009 it trailed only Louisiana in terms of the value of cargo that left its ports for Cuba. But trade with Cuba at both the state and national levels has slipped in the last year.
C. Parr Rosson III, director of the Center for North American Studies at Texas A&M University, said that in 2009, $85 million in goods left Texas bound for Havana, compared with $143 million in 2008. These goods are not necessarily manufactured in Texas but depart from there, Dr. Rosson said, creating jobs and boosting the state's economy.
From January through September this year, Texas ports shipped $18.2 million to Cuba, but Dr. Rosson estimated that only $354,000 of that left through large container shipments from Houston.
Meanwhile, the United States as a whole sent $528 million in goods to Cuba in 2009, a dip from the $710 million shipped in 2008. Should the trend hold for 2010, it would represent the third consecutive year in which Cuba's trade with the United States has diminished. The U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council estimates total American trade with Cuba this year through September is about $288 million -- just slightly more than half of last year's total.
Dr. Rosson said a contributing factor was the steady decline of the price of nickel, Cuba's leading commodity, which makes the country less likely to engage in trade.
Despite the downward trend, Todd Staples, the Texas commissioner of agriculture, said the state should continue to expand the dialogue -- and trade opportunities -- between Cuba and the United States.
''I support allowing Texas farmers and ranchers to engage in fair competition when selling their agricultural products to Cuba,'' Mr. Staples said in a statement. ''Texans will benefit through job growth, and Cubans can see the success of democracy and a free-market society.''

HEADLINE: Looking to Make Even Prosaic Food A Little More Festive

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
FORGET visions of sugar plums. The treats dancing in the heads on Madison Avenue are the prosaic products found on supermarket shelves.
The weeks before Christmas always bring increased spending on campaigns for packaged foods like soup, candy, soft drinks, flour, canned and frozen vegetables, gravy, coffee, cake mixes, broth and cookies. For this holiday season, such advertising is being stepped up because food marketers have been intensifying efforts to reach the millions of cash-short consumers who are eating and entertaining at home more often.
''Our consumers are telling us, now more than ever, they want to save money,'' said Keith Vines, vice president for sales and marketing at House-Autry Mills in Four Oaks, N.C., which makes products like corn meal, hushpuppy mix and chicken breading. ''We've had a lot more visitors to our Web site downloading recipes.'' 
So House-Autry is inviting cooks to enter a holiday contest, called I'm Dreaming of a Fried Christmas, by uploading video clips to a section of the Web site The company is also asking consumers to visit Facebook and join an organization fancifully named the Southern Cooking Preservation Society.
''With the economy, people are looking for simple ways to make their holidays special,'' said Lora Van Velsor, vice president of marketing for baking and syrups at the Pinnacle Foods Group in Mountain Lakes, N.J.
As a result, Pinnacle is taking steps like introducing bottles of its Mrs. Butterworth's syrup in three Christmas designs -- the first time in the brand's 50-year history it has been dressed for the holidays -- and bringing out a range of dessert toppings, Amazing Glazes, under the Duncan Hines name.
The goal is to help shoppers ''add a little flair without a lot of cost,'' Ms. Van Velsor said. ''We all aspire to be 'cake boss,' but very few of us are, myself included.''
BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, is the creative agency for Pinnacle.For Christmas 2010, Godiva chocolate is adding television to its campaign, which until now has run only in magazines and stores. A commercial plays up the brand's Belgian heritage by using the actor David Suchet -- who portrayed Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie's Belgian detective -- as the voice-over announcer.
''The time was right to be moving onto TV,'' said Lauri Kien Kotcher, chief marketing officer and senior vice president for global brand development at Godiva Chocolatier in New York, part of the Ulker Group unit of Yildiz Holding. The reason was the broader distribution for the brand as a result of a new line, Godiva Gems, which is priced lower than traditional Godiva offerings.
To underline the message that Gems help make Godiva ''more accessible,'' Ms. Kien Kotcher said, the ads show hundreds of pieces of chocolate and carry the theme ''May your life be filled with Godiva.'' The campaign is being created by the Acme Idea Company in South Norwalk, Conn.
''The core of the strategy is 'Don't save your Godiva for a special occasion two or three times a year,' '' said Scott Kulok, creative head at Acme, because ''is there not a special occasion every day?''
For decades, the Campbell Soup Company has run magazine ads before Christmas to promote products like Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, Swanson chicken broth and Pepperidge Farm stuffing, featuring recipes for mainstay dishes like green bean casserole. This year, the company also has online ads, iAds for the Apple iPhone, applications for smartphones and a presence in social media like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
''We're trying to be where consumers are,'' said Lisa Walker, a vice president at Campbell Soup in Camden, N.J., and, in particular, ''engage younger consumers.''
That means ''pushing out more in the digital space than ever before,'' she added. For instance, a campaign for Swanson broths, housed on a Web site, offers light-hearted discussions of whether to say ''stuffing'' or ''dressing'' and whether it should be served inside or outside the bird. And the brand is offering a chance to post and read ''turkey tweets'' on Twitter.
Agencies that work for Campbell include BBDO New York and two owned by WPP, the G2 unit of the Grey Group and the Y&R New York unit of Young & Rubicam Brands.At Starbucks Corporation, ''we're talking more about our Christmas Blend coffee than we have historically,'' said Terry Davenport, senior vice president for global brand and creative at Starbucks in Seattle, referring to the seasonal packaged coffee beans sold in supermarkets and the company's stores.
For 2010, Starbucks is bringing out a Christmas Blend version of its VIA Ready Brew instant coffee. Ads by BBDO New York pair the two varieties and promise, ''You'll jingle all day long.'' The ads are part of a holiday campaign that carries the theme ''Share in the taste of the season with Starbucks.''
''Last year, we had a very strong holiday,'' Mr. Davenport said, and the company hopes to repeat that with a promotion, ''The 12 days of sharing,'' which he said would offer customers in Starbucks stores ''a hot deal of the day each day for 12 days'' starting Dec. 1.
Supermarket distribution of Christmas Blend is limited, Mr. Davenport said, to maintain its special character.
''The day after Christmas, those red bags of coffee start to look like last season,'' he said, adding: ''We can just open them and brew them. It's a little hard for supermarkets to do that.''

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, Mayoral Aide Weighs Bid for Higher City Hall Perch

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- About a year ago, Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa turned to a Wall Street investment banker, Austin Beutner, to become first deputy mayor. He was put in charge of 13 city agencies and asked to help shepherd the city's ailing economy back to health.
It was the latest example of a City Hall turning to the private sector for assistance navigating public water: think Daniel L. Doctoroff, who held a similar position in New York. 
Now, Mr. Beutner says that he may be setting his sights a bit higher -- moving, in effect, from being a Doctoroff to being a Bloomberg.
In an interview this week in his modest 13th-floor office in City Hall, Mr. Beutner said he was thinking of running for mayor when Mr. Villaraigosa's term expires in 2013, leading some of his colleagues to draw comparisons to another business leader who went into politics, Michael R. Bloomberg.
''I've had a few people who have taken notice of what I'm doing and urged me to give some thought to it,'' he said. ''I have never run for office. I didn't take this office intending to run for office, and 2013 is a long time away. I figured I should give it some thought.''
Mr. Beutner, 50, who has lived in Los Angeles for just over 10 years, would certainly not be the first business executive to take a look at government and decide that it is a job he could do (though unlike most others, he has had an inside perch at this City Hall over the past year). And as a rule, the transition from business to campaigning is not easy, as Meg Whitman, the business executive who got crushed after spending over $140 million of her own money running for California governor this year, could tell Mr. Beutner.
At the very least, should Mr. Beutner run, he could inject a new element into an early field that consists so far of fairly well-known Los Angeles public officials who have worked their way up the system. By dint of name recognition, public record and network of connections in political, labor, fund-raising and business circles, any of them could be formidable opponents.
Among those considering a race are Zev Yaroslavsky, a longtime member of the County Board of Supervisors; Wendy Greuel, the city controller; Eric Garcetti, the City Council president; and State Senator Alex Padilla, who represents the city in Sacramento.
Mr. Beutner is strikingly low-key and low-profile (he does not even have his own listing in Wikipedia, though presumably that is about to change). He is given, in conversation, to lapsing into the jargon of government and business; it remains to be seen what kind of strength or spirit he could bring as a candidate.
What is more, his previous career in investment banking-- he was a partner at the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm, and a cofounder of Evercore Partners, a boutique investment firm -- would no doubt be closely examined by rivals should he get into the race.
Mr. Beutner was recruited for the City Hall job by Jay Carson, the former Los Angeles chief deputy mayor who now works for Mr. Bloomberg's private foundation. Mr. Carson said he had been encouraging Mr. Beutner to run.
In theory, at least, Mr. Beutner could use his personal fortune, which has allowed him to retire and work at City Hall for $1 a year, to have a financial advantage. But in the interview, he said that he did not intend to do that, arguing that it was important for a candidate to build a network of financial supporters as a part of an effort to present himself to voters.
''I certainly believe in myself,'' he said, ''but I really think it's important that whoever runs for office be prepared to go through a vetting process, not only community groups, but the media. If you don't put yourself out there and let voters get a real sense of who you are good or bad, you are not going to win.''
In that sense, barring last-minute changes of heart, he would be different from Mr. Bloomberg, who has never shown a moment's hesitancy in financing his own campaigns: he has spent well over $200 million in his various races for mayor. (Though it should said that Mr. Bloomberg's wealth, estimated at close to $18 billion, puts him in a different financial stratosphere than Mr. Beutner.)
Mr. Beutner retired as an investment banker after breaking his neck in an accident while biking on the pitched trails in the Santa Monica Mountains, near his home in Malibu, in 2007. He was born in New York and grew up in Grand Rapids, Mich.
In a suggestion of the kind of argument he might offer should he run, he said that Los Angeles needed someone with broad business experience to help it through a difficult economic time and rebuild its economic base.
''We are facing challenges that this city hasn't seen since its birth, in my view,'' he said. ''We are facing record unemployment, long-range fiscal deficits, great challenges in educating our youths.''
Asked if he had told the current mayor his thinking, he responded, ''If I decide to run, I'll talk to him.''

HEADLINE: Pages to Turn Through the Year

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
LIFEby Keith Richards with James Fox. Written with uncommon candor, eloquence and humor, this electrifying memoir channels its author's love of music, even as it creates an indelible portrait of the era when rock 'n' roll came of age. It's a book that does a high-def, high-velocity job of conjuring the past, be it the author's small-town childhood or the madness that was life on the road with the Rolling Stones -- a book in which Mr. Richards has magically translated the fierce emotion of his guitar playing to the page. (Little, Brown & Company, $29.99)
CLEOPATRA: A LIFEby Stacy Schiff. In her captivating new biography Ms. Schiff adroitly strips away the accretions of myth that have built up around the Egyptian queen and plucks off the imaginative embroiderings of Shakespeare, Shaw and Elizabeth Taylor. In place of history's sex kitten Cleopatra stands revealed as a charismatic and capable politician -- a historical figure way more complex and compelling than any fictional creation. (Little, Brown & Company, $29.99) 
LETTERS by Saul Bellow.Edited by Benjamin Taylor. By turns cranky and charming, ruminative and cocky, Saul Bellow was a gifted and emotionally voluble letter writer. And this absorbing collection of his correspondence creates a sharp-edged self-portrait of the artist as a close spiritual relative of his heroes: a seeker and searcher, vacillating between the emotional poles of exuberance and depression; a self-made writer, adept at spinning his philosophical ideas and romantic ups and downs into fiction. (Viking, $35)
SUPER SAD TRUE LOVE STORYby Gary Shteyngart. This super-sad, super-funny novel not only showcases its author's super-caffeinated comic gifts, but also uncovers his abilities to write movingly about love and heartbreak. Set in the near future in a toxic New York City, this is a novel that manages to mash up an apocalyptic satire with a tragic romance and make the whole thing wondrously work. (Random House, $26)
FREEDOM by Jonathan Franzen. The author's most deeply felt novel yet, ''Freedom'' is both a gripping portrait of a dysfunctional family and a telling, wide-angled snapshot of our troubled times. The book showcases its author's impressive literary tool kit -- all the essential storytelling skills, along with lots of bells and whistles -- and his ability to throw open a big, Updikean window on American middle-class life.(Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28)
FRANK: THE VOICEby James Kaplan. This is a biography that reads like a novel, a portrait of Frank Sinatra that captures his gifts and contradictions: the tough guy known for his tender love songs; the ring-a-ding-ding Vegas sophisticate with an existential outlook on life; the jaunty heartthrob who turned his own heartache over Ava Gardner into classic torch songs. Mr. Kaplan does a nimble, brightly evocative job of tracing the development of Sinatra's art, and his remarkable rise and fall and rise again before the age of 40. (Doubleday, $35)
CRISIS ECONOMICS: A CRASH COURSE IN THE FUTURE OF FINANCEby Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm. Although Mr. Roubini's pessimistic forecasts once earned him the sobriquet Dr. Doom, his predictions of fiscal disaster came frighteningly true in 2008, when the global financial system teetered on the edge of the abyss. In ''Crisis Economics,'' he uses his gifts as a teacher to give the lay reader a lucid and engrossing account of the causes and consequences of that great meltdown.(Penguin Press, $27.95)
THE LOST BOOKS OF THE ODYSSEY by Zachary Mason. This ingenious debut novel performs a series of jazzy, postmodernist variations on ''The Odyssey,'' imagining alternate fates for Homer's characters and reinventing his hero's relationships with his wife, his mistress and his comrades in arms. The book addresses Homer's original themes -- the dangers of pride, the protean nature of identity -- while at the same time raising new questions about art and originality and the nature of storytelling. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24)
YOU ARE NOT A GADGET: A MANIFESTOby Jaron Lanier. A pioneer in the development of virtual reality and a Silicon Valley veteran, Mr. Lanier is a digital-world insider concerned with the effect that online collectivism and the current enshrinement of ''the wisdom of the crowd'' is having on artists, intellectual property rights and the larger social and cultural landscape. In taking on such issues, he's written an illuminating book that is as provocative as it is impassioned. (Alfred A. Knopf, $24.95)
THE THOUSAND AUTUMNS OF JACOB DE ZOETby David Mitchell. Best known in the past for his experimental, puzzlelike fiction, Mr. Mitchell has turned his hand, this time, to creating a historical novel set in Edo-era Japan. His suspenseful and meticulously observed story of forbidden love -- between a young Dutchman and a Japanese midwife, who is abducted by a mysterious group of monks -- unfurls, musically, to become a meditation on East and West, superstition and science, tradition and change. (Random House, $26)

HEADLINE: Petitions for Mayor Offer First Clues of Campaign

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS; Idalmy Carrera and Bridget O'Shea contributed reporting.. 
dmihalopoulos@chicago newscoop.org

 BODY:
When aides to Rahm Emanuel recently wheeled a cart loaded with tall stacks of his nominating petitions into the city election board's downtown offices, the more than 90,000 voter signatures were a show of force meant to prove deep grass-roots support across the city for the former White House chief of staff.
A few hours later, Mr. Emanuel's campaign invited the news media to watch him buy lunch at a Hyde Park cafeteria for two South Side volunteers, including a man he described as the most prolific signature gatherer for his bid to succeed Mayor Richard M. Daley. Mr. Emanuel told reporters that their work to help him qualify for the Feb. 22 ballot had been motivated by their love for the city of Chicago.
In reality, his petition drive had received even greater support from many campaign workers who live far beyond the city limits, according to documents filed last week with elections authorities. Within Chicago, most of Mr. Emanuel's petition helpers came from the North Side, from his old Congressional district. 
The Chicago News Cooperative's review of all of the nearly 5,300 petitions for the Emanuel campaign found that a man from Mundelein, which is almost 40 miles from City Hall, circulated more signature pages than any other supporter. The analysis found that 4 of Mr. Emanuel's top 6 circulators and 7 of his 20 busiest operatives wrote in home addresses for themselves outside Chicago at the bottom of the sworn affidavits that they had asked Chicago voters to sign. Almost 25 percent of the petition pages for Mr. Emanuel were circulated by campaign workers who do not live in Chicago, the analysis found.
Ben LaBolt, Mr. Emanuel's spokesman, said that voters from every one of the city's 50 wards had signed his nominating paper and that many of the out-of-town collectors were paid campaign staff members, who gathered almost half of all petition signatures.
The results of the signature-collecting efforts on behalf of Mr. Emanuel and his mayoral rivals provided the first glimpse at the inner workings of the race to succeed Mr. Daley, who is retiring. The petitions reveal how the candidates have cobbled together networks of supporters for election-season grunt work, where each candidate's greatest support lies and where weak spots could surface.
Democratic patronage armies traditionally provided most of the labor for petition drives and other campaign chores, once helping Mr. Daley amass about 200,000 signatures for a re-election bid. This time, after federal corruption investigations focused on City Hall patronage hiring, virtually all of the major campaigns for mayor had to pay at least some of their petition passers, a practice that election laws allow.
Many of the would-be replacements for Mayor Daley collected far more than the necessary 12,500 signatures from Chicago voters, to ensure that rivals cannot knock them off the ballot through a legal challenge.
In the wake of Mr. Daley's retirement announcement, many local politicians publicly played coy and declined to state their favorite to be the new mayor. The nominating petitions provided proof of who was quietly aiding which contender.
Mr. Emanuel received help from scores of campaign workers loyal to longtime Democratic ward bosses on the North and Northwest Sides. He had a conspicuous lack of such help from what have historically been the most powerful ward groups from the Southwest Side.
Campaign foot soldiers for Alderman Edward Burke, from the 14th Ward on the Southwest Side, instead helped Gery Chico, whose mayoral campaign gathered about 50,000 signatures. Mr. Burke, the longest-serving alderman and chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, had not previously declared his preference for mayor. He told the Chicago News Cooperative this week that he directed the 14th Ward Democratic workers whose names appeared as circulators on petitions for Mr. Chico, a native of the Southwest Side.
''We haven't officially made an endorsement, but it would be close to that,'' Mr. Burke said, citing Mr. Chico's experience in high-level Daley appointments, including chief of staff and city school board president.
Carol Moseley Braun, the former United States senator, claimed more signatures than any other mayoral contender. Her campaign manager, Mike Noonan, said the campaign relied greatly on paid workers to supplement volunteers.
Ms. Braun's petitions were circulated mostly by supporters from the South and West Sides, with relatively few from outside the city. ''Our work force came from a lot of people who are out looking for jobs in this bad economy,'' Mr. Noonan said.
Of the most prominent candidates, only State Senator James T. Meeks said he relied almost exclusively on volunteers to gather signatures. Ninety-eight percent of Mr. Meeks's petition circulators were unpaid, said Bryan Zises, his spokesman.
Mr. Meeks alone could rely on a strong existing base of volunteers at Salem Baptist Church, the 20,000-member, far South Side congregation that he has led for two decades. The church's political arm has more than 1,600 members, the largest group on the city's list of about 6,000 voter registrars affiliated with various organizations.
Mr. Emanuel was aided by operatives for the Democratic organizations in the 36th, 39th, 40th, 44th, 45th and 47th Wards, according to his petitions and other public records.
But Mr. LaBolt said volunteers made up the ''vast majority'' of the almost 850 circulators for Mr. Emanuel, with some campaign staff members paid to coordinate the petition effort.
Mr. LaBolt said 44.5 percent of signatures had been collected by paid staff members, 41.8 percent by volunteers and 13.7 percent by allies from established ward organizations. ''Like many campaigns, we had a full-time staff in place,'' he said, ''and they both organized the volunteers and collected signatures themselves.''
At lunch on Nov. 15, the day his petitions were filed, Mr. Emanuel said a volunteer from Hyde Park had been the campaign's top circulator. But records show 16 circulators passed more petitions than the volunteer, with those 16 campaign aides accounting for almost 40 percent of all pages in Mr. Emanuel's submission to the election board.
The analysis found that the true top circulator for Mr. Emanuel was Christian Moree of Mundelein, who signed his name at the bottom of 185 petition pages. Some of his other top signature gatherers were from Schaumburg, Glenview, Dolton and Kenosha, Wis. Others put down addresses as far away as Portland, Ore., and Washington, D.C.
Mr. LaBolt said that anyone who collected more signatures than the Hyde Park volunteer was a paid campaign staff member.
Mr. Chico's support came from some more familiar sources in local political circles. The names of four of his petition passers appeared as members of Mr. Burke's 14th Ward Democrats on the ''clout list'' entered as evidence in the 2006 federal trial of Robert Sorich, the former Daley patronage chief who was convicted of rigging hiring to favor political cronies.
In addition to Mr. Burke's loyalists, Mr. Chico also received support from many 31st Ward Democrats, led by Joseph Berrios, the Cook County Democratic Party chairman.
Mr. Berrios said his ward organization's involvement in helping Mr. Chico qualify for the ballot did not necessarily negate the possibility that the 31st Ward Democrats might officially endorse another candidate before the election.

HEADLINE: In Paris, One Luxury Retailer Is Suspicious of the Intentions of Another

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY; Suzy Menkes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PARIS -- In the world of luxury brands, Hermes International has cultivated an image of purity by remaining true to its roots, shunning the mass production and outsourcing that many rivals have employed to improve profitability.
Lately, however, it has been attracting attention less for its expensive silk scarves and artisan-crafted handbags and more for the unwelcome approach of Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury goods giant.
As he has often done, Mr. Arnault, one of the world's wealthiest men, came in quietly, surprising the family-controlled Hermes last month with the news that he had acquired a 17.1 percent stake. 
LVMH said its objective was ''to be a long-term shareholder of Hermes and to contribute to the preservation of the family and French attributes which are at the heart of the global success of this iconic brand.''
Nevertheless, many analysts, having watched Mr. Arnault assemble his empire, say they believe he would like nothing more than to have Hermes as another trophy.
By whatever measure, Hermes seems to be thriving, posting 289 million euros (about $390 million) in net income last year. Sales, which held up during the financial crisis better than those of its rivals, rose 25 percent in the first nine months of 2010 from 2009, and are on track for at least 2.3 billion euros for the year. The stock is up 51 percent this year.
Patrick Thomas, chief executive of Hermes, argues that the company must remain independent to pursue its focus on craftsmanship and creativity. ''We have adopted a strategy of the ultimate quality, the value strategy as opposed to the volume strategy,'' Mr. Thomas said during a recent interview. ''We've never been tempted by mass-market techniques because it's not part of our culture.''
Mr. Thomas is the first nonfamily member to run the group. He assumed the title of chief executive in 2005, after Jean-Louis Dumas, the fifth-generation family leader, stepped down. Mr. Dumas's son, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, is now the company's creative director.
Some companies have chosen to follow a ''financial strategy,'' growing through acquisitions and putting together as many good brands as they can under a single roof, he said. Only a few operate similarly to Hermes, including a handful of Swiss watchmakers and some makers of fine spirits. ''But Hermes is sort of a unique exception that has managed to grow and still stick to its roots,'' he said.
Manfredi Ricca, managing director of Interbrand Milan, a branding consulting firm, said that Hermes seemed to have found the right balance in its strategy. By virtue of a ''very focused, very cautious'' approach to growth over the years, Mr. Ricca said, ''Hermes is probably the quintessence of luxury today, in the sense of the purity of the brand, in the way the brand has preserved its meaning from the origin.''
Founded in Paris by Thierry Hermes in 1837, Hermes began life as a harness maker, later evolving into a saddle maker. In the 1920s, with the automobile era in full swing, Emile-Maurice Hermes, grandson of the founder, introduced couture accessories and broadened the array of leather goods -- which still make up about half the company's sales.
Trendsetters like Princess Grace and Jane Birkin have helped over the years to bolster the brand's appeal, but Hermes has managed to stay relevant, even edgy, by constantly introducing new colors and materials while maintaining its attraction to traditionalists.
Today the company employs more than 100 designers, and its roughly 3,500 craftworkers make about 85 percent of the products sold in its stores. Its products are sold at 313 exclusive stores and 21 other outlets worldwide.
The reputation for handcrafted quality comes at a price. A Birkin bag can easily cost more than $10,000 -- if one is available. The company's scarves, neckties, clothing and watches and jewelry are comparably priced.
Hermes has also started moving into home furnishings, as it demonstrated last Thursday with the opening of an audacious Paris store in a reconstructed swimming pool. The store, designed by the Paris architect Denis Montel, is Hermes's first on the Left Bank, and has a florist, a tea nook and a book shop.
On Friday, a well-heeled crowd browsed the spacious interior while sampling Champagne and pastries.
People around Mr. Arnault say he has long admired Hermes and that he made his move partly to ensure that the company would not end up in the hands of a rival. They also say Mr. Arnault, who declined to comment for this article, believes cooperation between the two companies -- in negotiating retailing space and pooling advertising budgets, for example -- could sharply lift Hermes's profitability.
Marc Willaume, who covers the luxury sector as an analyst at Raymond James in Paris, said Mr. Arnault was probably sincere when he said he was interested in a long-term relationship. ''If one day things change -- if, for example, family members a few generations from now decide they want to sell -- Mr. Arnault will have positioned himself to be the referee,'' Mr. Willaume said.
While Hermes trades on the Paris bourse, 73 percent of the shares are in the hands of the three controlling families -- the Puechs, Guerrands and Dumases -- and a limited partnership structure makes it impossible for an outsider to gain control against their wishes.
Mr. Thomas said that the families had not been the sellers of Mr. Arnault's stake, and that they had in fact raised their holdings slightly this year. The French authorities are investigating the opaque derivative instruments that Mr. Arnault used to build his stake, amid concerns that he might have violated disclosure laws.
Mr. Ricca said Hermes probably could have grown much faster with a different strategy, but then it would be risking its reputation for quality. ''It's very hard to build up to luxury status,'' he said, ''but it's very easy to lose it.''
Mr. Thomas took pains to credit the company's ''strong heritage.''
''I am the C.E.O. of this beautiful company and it's my job to do my best to prolong it or develop it,'' he said. ''But it's so strong as a business project and model that it would be a shame to put it in danger one way or another.''

ISRAELI PREMIER DENOUNCES
Palestinian Statement
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel strongly denounced a Palestinian Authority paper that denied any Jewish connection to the Western Wall, the holy site and place of Jewish worship in the Old City of Jerusalem, describing the report as ''reprehensible and scandalous.'' The episode appeared to signal a worsening atmosphere after a two-month hiatus in peace talks. Page A4
3 ADRIFT TEENS LOCATED
Three teenagers who were adrift in the South Pacific Ocean for 50 days have been found alive by a fishing vessel, officials in New Zealand said. The two 15-year-olds and one 14-year-old, from the Tokelau Islands of New Zealand, had long been presumed dead when their small aluminum rowboat was spotted on Wednesday afternoon by the fishing boat San Nikuna.

ALL EYES ON SENATOR KYL
Senator Jon Kyl has the attention of the Oval Office these days. More than any other Republican in Congress, Mr. Kyl has become the target of administration energy as it seeks to persuade him to support a new arms control treaty with Russia -- or figure out how to circumvent him if he does not. ''They are much more focused now,'' Mr. Kyl said in an interview. Page A8
RUSSIA ANGRY OVER PROPOSAL
Russia responded angrily to a proposal that would deny European visas to a list of 60 officials who have been implicated in the death of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in pretrial detention in Moscow last year. The proposal remains far from becoming policy. First, it must be approved by the full European Parliament in December. Page A16

The simplified spelling from the academy, a musty Madrid institution that is the chief arbiter of all things grammatical, should be welcome news to the world's 450 million Spanish-speakers, not to mention anybody struggling to learn the language. But no. Everyone, it seems, has a bone to pick with the academy -- starting with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. Page A16
QUESTION ON FATAL STAMPEDE
More than two days after hundreds of people died in a huge, tightly packed crowd on the last night of a water festival in Cambodia, both the cause and the death toll remained unclear. Rather than being trampled, most of the victims suffocated or were crushed to death by a dense, immobile crowd in which some people were trapped for hours. Page A10

A remarkable change is coming to Wisconsin: Representative Jeff Fitzgerald was picked to be the next speaker of Wisconsin's State Assembly, and his brother, Senator Scott Fitzgerald, was chosen as majority leader of the State Senate, creating a rare fraternal alignment, experts say, for any state in recent memory.

CHRISTO PROJECT ENGAGES
When two decades ago the artist Christo proposed a gigantic art installation spanning 42 miles of the Arkansas River with sections of suspended luminescent fabric, he knew it would incite public debate. This deeply controversial project has created a kind of civic performance art. The recent public comment period, which drew 3,500 responses, reflected civic engagement in full boil. Page A20
TENSION OVER BEACH CURFEW
Like many coastal California cities, Los Angeles has a nighttime beach curfew. But the decades-old curfew is now at the center of a confrontation over who controls the beach, with the California dream of beaches that are free and open to the public at all hours pitted against city efforts to combat urban problems like gang violence and homelessness.

The issue is the annual Macy's parade and the police barricading one gilded stretch of the Upper West Side: West 61st Street between Broadway and Central Park West. Dominating the south side of that street is the Trump International Hotel and Tower. No street was off-limits to the flood of parents and children that flood that area every year for the parade, except that one. Page A28

HEAVY RETAIL TRAFFIC
Expected, Analysts Say
Analysts are expecting one of the most heavily trafficked Fridays after Thanksgiving in years, and to attract those customers, retailers are expected to offer a rash of sales and door-buster specials that may eat into their profits. But the turnout may be a little lower, given grim weather predictions. Page B1
INQUEST FOR CANADIAN MINE

The opposition Liberal Party said that it would ask for a criminal investigation as well. Page B5
GERMAN BANKS STILL AT RISK
The Bundesbank, the German central bank, said that the country's banks were better off now than they were a year ago, benefiting from a strong domestic economy. But, the bank said, German institutions continue to engage in risky practices that make them vulnerable to a rise in interest rates. Page B3

THE KING'S ENGLISH
With a Twisted Tongue
''The King's Speech,'' is a film about the stuttering son of King George V of England who would be king, and his speech therapist. It stars Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter, and while it has its moments, writes Manohla Dargis, it comes with two heaping spoonfuls of sugar and takes a relatively benign view of the monarchy.

HEADLINE: A Crisis Needing More Sacrifice

BYLINE: By HUGO DIXON

 BODY:
Rahm Emanuel, President Obama's former chief of staff, popularized the idea that a good crisis should not be wasted. But there is a severe risk that this is precisely what the world has been doing by being excessively soft when bailing out banks and countries.
Bailouts, like the one being negotiated for Ireland, may be needed to prevent a descent into chaos. But the attached conditions must be tough. Otherwise, the world will not learn the lessons from the crisis and justice will not seem to have been done. 
Ireland's original bailout of its banks in 2008 after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy is one of the most egregious cases of excessive softness. Ireland gave a blanket guarantee of its banks' liabilities, including deposits and wholesale financing. A more targeted guarantee focusing on retail deposits would have been far better. Not only would the creditors have been punished for their own excesses, but the government itself would not now need its own bailout.
But it was not just the Irish who were soft. The United States government gave its top banks excessively cheap capital in October 2008. And many European governments helped sweep the problems with their banks under the carpet post-Lehman.
Even last summer's stress tests in Europe were a half-hearted affair. One consequence of this laxness is that banks in supposedly strong countries like Germany are still too weak to withstand the bankruptcy of a relatively small country like Greece or Ireland. Another is that the world is still stuck with banks that are too big to fail -- a problem that the new Basel III banking rules will only partly remedy.
The excessive softness has also distorted monetary policy. Interest rates have been kept at ultralow levels, and liquidity has been sprayed at banks on incredibly attractive terms. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have taken the extraordinary measure of, in essence, printing money to increase economic activity.
Extreme circumstances call for extreme measures. But the hot phase of the crisis in most countries has passed, and so should the extreme measures. What is left is a long grind back to prosperity.
As unfortunate as that is, the excesses of the bubble years cannot simply be conjured away. Remember that banks were not the only ones living it up.
During the boom, many ordinary people -- whether in Ireland, Greece, Britain, Spain or the United States -- did, too. World leaders, especially Mr. Obama, have failed to adequately indicate that sacrifices have to be made across the board.
In Europe, the strongest disciplinarians have been David Cameron of Britain and Angela Merkel of Germany. It is fashionable to criticize them. But the criticisms are largely misguided.
Mr. Cameron is said to have gone in too hard with his austerity. But his country has earned praise from the markets by doing so.
Would it really have been sensible for Britain to be soft when Ireland is blowing up on its border? Portugal and possibly Spain are in danger of being sucked into the vortex precisely because their governments have been slow to appreciate the gravity of the situation.
Meanwhile, Ms. Merkel has been called too harsh in setting the terms for Greece's bailout -- and for pushing the idea that, in the future, bondholders should face losses when governments are bailed out.
The bondholder haircut idea could, admittedly, have been timed better, but it is still exactly the right principle. As for Greece, its feet had to be held to the fire before its leaders would agree to fight corruption and root out decades of financial mismanagement.
The bailout conditions for Ireland have yet to be revealed. Another dose of conventional austerity -- including the welfare benefit cuts and tax increases laid out in this week's budget -- is part of what is needed.
But from the perspective of fairness, it is also necessary to inflict as much pain as legally possible on the creditors of rescued Irish banks. That would be the right balance of bailout and punishment. HUGO DIXON

HEADLINE: How Medicare Sets Hospital Prices: A Primer

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The Medicare formula for payments to hospitals would be improved if it were based on value delivered rather than costs, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
In a previous post, I described how Medicare came to adopt price schedules for hospitals and physicians that are now derided as Soviet in origin. Actually, as I noted, this was a home-grown American idea that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush embraced and introduced to Medicare.
In this and the next post I would like to describe how this system works, starting with inpatient hospital services. I will draw on the excellent literature provided by Medpac, the independent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission established in 1997 by Congress to advise it on issues affecting the Medicare program.
 How private insurers pay hospitals 
Private insurers pay hospitals mainly on the basis of negotiated per-diem rates, sometimes adjusted for case severity and the particular day in a hospital episode (because the early days of an episode generally incur higher costs than subsequent days), for the individual service going into a hospital episode or for some standard procedures, on a case basis. 
The levels of these payments are negotiated one on one between individual insurers and individual hospitals or hospital chains, as I have described previously.

A natural byproduct of one-on-one negotiations is price discrimination, which means that a hospital charges different insurers different prices for the same service, and that a given health insurer pays different hospitals substantially different prices for the same service, as the tables below make clear (more detailed information is available in Chapter 6, "Hospital Economics 101"). A more recent study shows the same phenomenon.
I know of no research or other evidence to suggest that these enormous price differentials reflect different levels of quality or value of services. Rather, they seem to be driven mainly by the relative market power of the negotiators and the process of negotiation.
As I noted in "The Pricing of U.S. Hospital Services: Chaos Behind a Veil of Secrecy," the prices actually paid by private payers are not transparent to all market participants, because they have always been treated as proprietary trade secrets.
 How Medicare pays hospitals 
Medicare's payment systems must be fair to all hospitals, a constraint not faced by private payers. To appear fair, the government must be able to defend openly how it pays individual hospitals, and its prices must be fully transparent to all market participants.
Unfortunately, the price of fairness and transparency is a certain rigidity in the system, as every change must be defended publicly, sometimes after lengthy study and debate.
So how does this payment system work?
Basically, Medicare uses what is known as the "case base" system for paying hospitals for inpatient care, which means that hospitals receive one single payment for an entire inpatient episode of a given type.
To implement this system, Medicare categorizes all hospital inpatient care into 746 distinct "medical-severity adjusted, diagnosis-related groupings," known in the trade as MS-DRGs. Inpatient episodes are first grouped by principal diagnosis and then subdivided by the nature of co-morbidities or complications, if any.
The idea is that cases falling into a particular case grouping address similar clinical problems and should have similar costs in hospitals with average efficiency.
For a given case grouping, Medicare pays hospitals one single, bundled payment to cover the cost of all the supplies and services that a hospital with average efficiency would use in managing that particular case. The chart below shows how Medicare arrives at the distinct, bundled payments for each of the 746 distinct cases. (Medicare's own chart is available here).
Medicare starts the process by calculating the average operating and capital costs for the average case across all cases - the "base case."
Thus, at this initial stage, Medicare assumes, in effect, that all hospitals treat only one type of medical case - the hypothetical base case.
Operating costs cover labor and supplies; capital costs cover depreciation, rent and other costs related to capital. For example, for fiscal year 2011, starting in October 2010, the operating cost for the base case is $5,164. The capital cost for the base case in fiscal year 2011 is $420.
Roughly two-thirds of operating costs are thought to represent labor costs. Because wages vary across this vast country, the labor component of operating costs is adjusted, in a rather complicated way, with a geographic hospital-wage index, as shown in the upper left corner of the chart.
The sum of the wage-adjusted operating costs and the capital costs for the base case is shown in the chart as the "base rate adjusted for geographic factors."
That sum is then adjusted for case severity. Medicare does this by multiplying the "base rate adjusted for geographic factors" with an index of the relative costliness of the particular grouping into which the inpatient case in question falls. The index for the base case is set to 1.
For example, an appendectomy without complicated principal diagnosis and without other co-morbidities or complications has a case weight of 0.9042, while an appendectomy with a "complicated principal diagnosis" and "major co-morbidities or complications" has a weight of 3.1760. (For the weights of other groupings, click on "Final MS-DRG Weights" here.)
From this case-severity adjustment emerges the "adjusted base payment rate," shown in the blue box in lower left corner of the chart. This rate is then adjusted for a number of characteristics of the hospital being paid.
A teaching hospital, for example, is paid more, to acknowledge the added indirect costs of medical education that such hospitals incur.
A hospital that treats a disproportionate number of uninsured patients or patients covered by Medicaid receives another extra payment, because neither the uninsured nor Medicaid fully compensates hospitals for the cost of treating such patients.
These disproportionate-share payments, known as D.S.H., are generally referred to in the trade as "dish" payments.
If a patient in a particular grouping stayed significantly fewer days in the hospital than is typical for that case, or if a case is transferred to another hospital, the hospital is paid a per-diem rate for the actual days, rather than the entire case base.
The end result of all these adjustments is what is shown as "Payment" in the yellow box in lower right corner of the chart - what a particular hospital with its characteristics and location would be paid for a particular case, unless that case turned out to be extraordinarily complicated.
In that case, the hospital would receive what is known as an outlier payment that makes Medicare and the hospital share the added cost attributable to the unusual severity of the case.
In an interview, Tom Scully, then administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the first term of President George W. Bush, told me, "Medicare is a dumb price-fixer." That may be true in particular instances - for example, the case he cites in the interview.
But I fail to see what is so dumb about the case-based payments used by Medicare to pay hospitals for inpatient care. If it were dumb, why have so many nations copied it?
Medicare's payment system does have an underlying rationale that can be explained to market participants. It is fully transparent. And it does strive for horizontal equity, meaning that it pays hospitals in similar situations the same price for the same service.
Although this system can and does accommodate adjustments for local market conditions and sometimes even rewards what policy makers value - extra payments for services provided to underserved areas - it is primarily cost-based rather than value-based, which I and other policy analysts would prefer.
The only consolation is that the prices in the private health care market do not seem to be value-based, either. Because they are not transparent, it is hard to know what they actually reflect.

HEADLINE: Its Burgers Sell Like Crazy, But Restaurant Stays on the Market

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON and ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- As real estate deals go, the sale of Ann's Snack Bar may be a true test of the value of cult food in a bad economy.
In other words, just how much is a Ghetto Burger worth?
After 38 years of serving her messy, hand-pressed burgers to an endless parade of restaurant critics, celebrities like Sean Combs and, lately, a horde of Twitter-driven food enthusiasts, Ann Price decided it was time to put down her spatula and get a little return on her investment. 
She thought about all those years of work and her growing national reputation and set the price at $1.5 million in August 2009. After all, one national food critic even said she made the best burger in the country.
''People come here from all over the world, people from every race,'' said Ms. Price, 67, who personally makes every burger. ''Everybody wants to know: what is a Ghetto Burger?''
Of course, a bad real estate market is a bad real estate market, even for a restaurant so popular that people will wait outside for hours to snag one of the eight stools. Now, she will let the shop go for $450,000.
The cheeseburger that put her on the map is constructed from two big patties of generic ground beef, fried with big pieces of onion and seasoned with something she won't tell you about unless you buy the place. She lightens it up with bacon, a little chili sauce and lettuce and tomato. It costs $9.50 with fries, and she has lawyers working on trademarking the name.
Although one might argue that many of the hundreds of hamburgers made by chefs in this burger-crazy nation are better, it is hard to argue that hers has less cachet.
Anna Monzon, 30, an Atlanta resident who works for a West Coast skateboard company, was the first in the door one recent day. She ordered five to take with her to Los Angeles. Her brother, such a food fanatic that he follows 20 food carts on Twitter, told her not to board the plane without them.
''I'm not a big burger person,'' Ms. Monzon said, ''but this is the one burger I'd wait a couple hours in line for.''
That does not translate into a big real estate deal, though -- especially in a city where 14 percent of retail property is vacant.
''The way the real estate market is selling, there was no way we could make that sale in the next couple years,'' said Willie J. Burks, the agent who originally put the property up for $1.5 million.
Still, people who know Ms. Price and know what she has brought to the neighborhood believe she should not sell herself short.
''The brand alone and the nature of the culture here makes a million about right,'' said James McCauly, 25, who drove in with his uncle from a suburb north of Atlanta when they heard the place was going to be sold. ''Anybody who is anybody in Atlanta knows about this place.''
Now, why did she call it a Ghetto Burger? A customer first suggested it, as a kind of joke. But a fast food restaurant had just opened down the block, and the neighborhood was really in the economic dumps.
So Ms. Price doubled down on ingredients, creating a beefier patty and adding some extra toppings. She sold it for $4. For a little variety, she swapped coleslaw for lettuce and tomato and called that one the Hood Burger.
''I had to do something to get people's attention,'' she said.
Much has changed in the Kirkwood neighborhood in east Atlanta since Ms. Price -- known as ''Miss Ann'' to fans -- bought the tiny shop in 1972. Upscale houses and a golf course opened up the street. And clients now include people like Atlanta politicians and the actor Robert Duvall.
''This isn't really the ghetto anymore,'' said John Byrd, 70, a retired repairman who has been getting to-go burgers there for years.
The shop remained a local secret until 1998, when The Atlanta Constitution featured her in an article. The next morning, she said, she had about 15 pounds of ground beef from the grocery down the street and a line waiting for her to open. Ms. Price was so panicked by the crowd that she almost did not open. A friend had to track down more ground beef, but even that was not enough. She was off to the races.
With success has come confidence. A little too much, maybe. Posted rules include no cursing. A patron may come in to eat only when one of the eight stools opens up. Couples who show up when only one stool is left are forced to split up and eat one at a time. And the smart customer knows not to ask questions when the little grill is filled with meat.
Ms. Price, the fourth child of a Georgia farm family, has never married. She cooks eight hours a day, six days a week. She has a list of health problems, although she hauls bags of ice and 50 pounds of burger into her shop every day.
She wants to retire so she can take a nap. She wants to remodel her house and garden and sit on one of the white rockers on her front porch.
''I just hope somebody gives me a good price,'' she said, ''so I can get up out of here.''

HEADLINE: The Power Of Failure

BYLINE: By WILLIAM D. COHAN. 
William D. Cohan, a columnist for nytimes.com, is the author of a forthcoming book on Goldman Sachs. Charles M. Blow and Gail Collins are off today.

 BODY:
Despite the very dire consequences of the latest financial crisis that Wall Street perpetrated on the world, America cannot seem to shake its infatuation with Wall Street bankers and traders.
We continue to shower them with riches, prestige and glory. We make movies about them. We write books about them. We seriously overpay and then envy them. This year alone, while millions of others suffer from the Great Recession, bankers and traders are expected to be paid - incredibly - another estimated $144 billion in compensation and benefits. Accordingly, Wall Street remains the No. 1 destination for our best and brightest.
The question is why? Why do we tolerate the questionable morality and behavior that too many on Wall Street get rewarded to exhibit? Why do we put up with repeated Wall Street-generated financial calamities? Why do we seem to excuse one insider-trading and pay-for-play scandal after another? Why haven't we woken up from our generational slumber and realized that we would be better off rewarding real engineers, not financial engineers? 
Part of what we must overcome here is human nature. Not for nothing did the Renaissance poet Samuel Daniel write in ''Lady Margaret'': ''Unless above himself he can erect himself, how poor a thing is man.''
We are a species that is always striving. ''When we observe other species, they live the way they live,'' explained Richard Brodhead, the president of Duke University, at a recent meeting at the school's Kenan Institute for Ethics (of which I am a board member). ''But you don't see them trying to live beyond themselves or wanting to become the best chimpanzee they can be.''
Unfortunately, this focus on achievement has now been pushed back earlier and earlier in life. Where, once upon a time, little was expected of children in childhood, Brodhead continued, ''that's not true anymore. Achievement is aspired to from the moment of birth, if not before.'' Nowadays parents hire tutors to correct the pitching motions of little leaguers. ''There has been a kind of 'totalization of aspiration' in our culture,'' he said. Brodhead wondered about the consequences ''when you imbibe a culture of aspiration from someone else, do you really care about the values that are driving you so hard? Because at some point you want people to actually care about the value of the thing that is regulating their life.'' For too many, success on Wall Street is the ultimate elixir.
Part of what we must come to grips with is the fact that in the past two decades Wall Street has failed us time and time again. Worse, its top executives refuse to admit their mistakes - while still making sure to get paid millions of dollars - and, therefore, cannot possibly learn from them. They prefer to speak about ''once-in-a-lifetime tsunamis'' or complain about taxpayers bailing out other firms but not Lehman Brothers. ''Until the day they put me in the ground, I will wonder'' why Lehman failed, bemoaned Richard Fuld, Lehman's former chief executive, in October 2008. Not once has Fuld admitted that perhaps he shared in the responsibility for what happened at his firm. He is not alone, of course. Declared Jamie Dimon of JPMorganChase at the beginning of the year: ''I am a little tired of the constant vilification'' of Wall Street.
But true leaders understand the importance of making mistakes and learning from them. In a legendary graduation speech at Stanford University, in 2005, Steve Jobs emphasized the importance of failure to success, particularly after he was fired, at age 30, from Apple, the company he co-founded. ''It turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me,'' he said. ''The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods in my life.''
In his May 2009 baccalaureate address to Duke's graduating class, Sam Wells, the dean of Duke University Chapel, hoped the students would ''never be dazzled by your own success ... and not pretend success is everything or success makes you immortal. And, most of all, that you'll let your life begin the day you really, seriously fail, and let that day be the day you discover who you truly are and whether that failure is really in a cause that will finally succeed. ... The most powerful person in the world is the one who isn't paralyzed by the fear of their own failure.''
There is enormous power in failure, especially when one learns from it. Wall Street has been making a lot of mistakes lately. But will it bother to ever learn from them? And will we have the courage to return Wall Street to a less exalted place? The answer to these questions will increasingly come to define what America is all about in the future.

HEADLINE: Shoppers Flock Back to the Mall To Hunt Deals

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD; Contributing reporting were Patrick Borzi, Robbie Brown, Karen Ann Cullotta, Ian Lovett, Nate Schweber, Ted Siefer and Malia Wollan.

 BODY:
Americans are shopping selfishly again.
On this year's Black Friday, retailers and analysts said they saw a surge in traffic at stores and malls over last year, and also were noticing that shoppers snapped up discretionary items for themselves rather than gifts or necessities.
Still, the shop-a-thon that began late on Thanksgiving night was not a free-for-all. Burned by the recession and its aftershocks even now, many consumers looked for major deals, or stayed within strict budgets by limiting themselves to cash.
There were longer lines than in recent years, from the hundreds of people who spent the night outside a Best Buy in Oakland, Calif., to the 75 people outside an Atlanta-area Macy's at 4 a.m. When the doors opened, the crowd was so excited that one bleary-eyed man ran smack into a glass window. (''The window looked like a door,'' said the man, who was unhurt. ''It's too early.'') 
Near Chicago, Wal-Mart tried a crowd-control technique: handing wrist bands to shoppers who wanted access to the 5 a.m. electronics prices, so admission would be limited and there would be less of a frenzy. At an upscale mall outside Los Angeles, although shoppers were treating themselves to items like limited-edition Nike shoes and jewelry, many paid in cash.
''You can just feel it in the air -- people want to spend money again,'' said Karen Stanek, manager of an Old Navy store in Arlington Heights, Ill. ''The mood of the customers is more positive than it's been in years.''
Analysts, mall owners and retailers said that traffic was higher than last November and that people seemed to be spending more. But concrete assessments as to whether sales were up over a year ago, and if so, whether they were enough to lift major retailers out of their long-term, recession-driven slumps, were not available. The first sales figures for Black Friday will not be available until later this weekend.
''I spent more this year, but we got great savings,'' said Pamela Anderson, 50, who had been shopping at the Macy's flagship store in New York for more than six hours. Her black hair was still perfectly curled, but she was starting to sweat as she fought the crowds.
Trying to get upstairs to check the price on a pair of corduroys, she encountered a three-minute line just to get on the escalator. ''You have to keep moving. Please do not stop,'' guards shouted, directing shoppers getting off the escalators.
Ms. Anderson, a mental health and chemical abuse specialist, had bought two pairs of boots, coats, sweaters and four bottles of perfume.
''I did all my Christmas shopping already,'' she said. ''I saved Black Friday for me.''
Huddling against a column near the men's ties, Renae Shoulders, 31, and her aunt Donna Winemiller, 51, looked for their friends as shoppers rushed by.
''I spent more on myself this year, definitely,'' Ms. Shoulders said, adding that promotions like ''buy one, get one free'' on clothes had led her to increase her spending.
Like Ms. Anderson, many people seemed to be enjoying more frivolous purchases -- good news for an economy in which nonessential spending has been weak.
At an Oakland Best Buy, Jan Paolo Patena, a 19-year-old college student, was waiting to buy an external hard drive.
''Black Friday is all about me,'' he said. ''I'm not here for anyone else. This is not about Christmas presents. If somebody else wants something, they can stay out here in the cold all night.''
Rebecca Bolivar, 19, a college student who was shopping at the Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J., said she came to buy shoes, jackets and gifts for her boyfriend, in that order.
''If I run out of money, I go first,'' she said.
At a Best Buy in Patchogue, N.Y., despite a chilly rain, the line for the 5 a.m. opening stretched about 350 yards down the street. Julio Jaber, 25, was there to buy a 55-inch TV. ''It's for myself,'' he said, shaking his head as rain fell on him. ''For somebody else? Forget it.''
Malls, like the Fair Oaks Mall in Fairfax, Va., and the Beverly Center in Los Angeles, Calif., reported similar sentiments. At Sears and Kmart, many shoppers bought on layaway, said a spokesman, Tom Aiello, indicating that the items were not gifts.
''You have more spontaneous shoppers buying things for themselves,'' said Maureen Bausch, executive vice president of business development at the Mall of America.
For example, at the Macy's in Ross Park Mall in Pittsburgh, there was a one-hour wait to try on and buy shoes, while at the Gucci outlet in Desert Hills Premium Outlets in Cabazon, Calif., more than 1,000 people lined up for the midnight opening.
''Across the board, it looks better this year than last year,'' said Charles O'Shea, senior retail analyst at Moody's. ''There's more traffic this year than last year, the stores are fuller, the parking lots are fuller.''
Several malls reported jammed parking lots, including in Indiana, Washington State, Ohio and Tampa, Fla. By midnight, when the Dolphin Mall in Miami opened, its parking lot was completely full, while at Great Lakes Crossing Outlets in Auburn Hills, Mich., the lot was full by 1 a.m.
Stores, too, were reporting long lines. More than 7,000 people were outside the Macy's flagship store in Manhattan when it opened at 4 a.m., a spokesman, Jim Sluzewski, said, compared with about 5,000 last year.
There were 350 people lined up outside the Victoria's Secret in Fairlane Town Center in Dearborn, Mich., when it opened; 100 waited outside the Saks at Stony Point Fashion Park in Richmond, Va.; and Kmart said that at most stores, 300 or more people lined up before the 5 a.m. openings, a higher number than last year. At the Best Buy in Oakland, Calif., about 500 people were in line when the store opened at 5 a.m., substantially more than last year, employees said.
''It was like a shantytown out there,'' the store manager, Nick Ramos, said, adding that almost 200 people had camped out Thursday night. By Friday morning, fast-food containers, empty cans of energy and coffee drinks, and empty beer bottles were strewn on the sidewalk.
A small and dirty white couch was left after the crowds rushed into the store. ''I hope someone comes to get that couch,'' Mr. Ramos said. ''But I have a feeling we're going to be stuck with it.''
One sector that seemed weak was dollar stores. At the Family Dollar on a dingy stretch in working-class South Boston, shoppers were mostly buying basics or holiday decorations.
''It's not as busy as we expected,'' said Robert Brennan, the store's assistant manager. ''We've got to compete with Wal-Mart and those other stores that opened at 4 a.m.''
Stores were quite competitive about deals this year, with most running heavy promotions. Shoppers seemed to be responding -- in Kmart in Midtown Manhattan, Katherine O'Donnell, 42, a nurse, had dropped her four shopping bags, stuffed with clothes and boxed items like a hairdryer and a toaster, by the baby-clothes section.
''I brought this from home,'' she said, gesturing at a rolling suitcase she would use to carry her purchases home. ''I thought it was all I was going to need, but, no.'' She had found deals on sneakers, boots, cast-iron cookware, home appliances and costume jewelry, she said.
Gwen Watson, who was shopping at the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, said she didn't even plan on doing Black Friday shopping, but this year the prices were too good, like a $19.99 toaster that was exactly like one she had bought for $60.
''The deals are unbelievable,'' she said, struggling to lift a half-dozen bags. ''I need a cup of coffee because I got up so early, and I can't get a cup of coffee because there's no way for me to carry it because my arms are so full.
Shoppers were not doing much frenzied spending. Many carried circulars or had researched prices on the Web, and several said they were just paying with cash this year.
Valerie Dean, 50, an administrator at the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority who was shopping at Santa Monica Place, spent about $800, and paid entirely with a debit card.
''I'm probably spending the same as last year, but I'm not charging,'' she said. ''It seems like now with credit cards, even if you have good credit, it's too much, the rates are too high.''
Donna Laemont, who was shopping at Target in Arlington Heights, Ill., said she was also avoiding debt.
''I never use a credit card anymore, because I remember always regretting having to pay everything back after the holidays,'' she said.
Jonathan Blanco, 23, a pharmacy assistant at the University of California, Los Angeles who was shopping with a debit card at the Nike Store at Santa Monica Place, had a similar take. ''When you have the actual money, why not spend it, as opposed to going into debt and paying interest?'' he said. ''Last year, it took me six months to pay it off.''
Claudia Ramirez, 18, a student, was also spending with just cash, 10 crisp $20 bills that she had taken out so she could budget.
''I wanted to limit myself,'' she said.
At the Mall of America in Minnesota, Julie Melchor, 38, and her husband Ozzie, 36, of Kankakee, Ill., said they were spending a bit more this year. (It had been a good year at the cornmeal factory where Ozzie works.) But they had gotten rid of their credit cards two years ago and were paying with a debit card. ''We've been married 12 years, and it took 10 years to pay them off,'' Mr. Melchor said. ''No more credit cards.''
In Oakland, Aleida Lyons said that though she was feeling good about the economy because of the stock market, she was sticking to cash for her $1,000 in Christmas gifts.
Ms. Lyons was leaving Best Buy empty-handed because the laptop she wanted had sold out. ''It's so crowded,'' she said. ''I don't think I can handle this.''
That was good news for the ultra-competitive shoppers like Mr. Patena. He had been waiting for the Best Buy to open since Thanksgiving night, bringing lawn chairs, a Golden State Warriors fleece blanket and Thanksgiving leftovers. ''People who don't know what Black Friday is all about don't know what they're getting into,'' he said. ''You have to be prepared.''

HEADLINE: Glazer Family Gains Victories But Not Approval

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
This time a year ago, the Glazer family was a pinata for sports fans on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
In Tampa, Buccaneers fans blamed them for letting go of the team's stars, slashing the payroll and fielding a squad that went on to the franchise's worst record (3-13) in nearly two decades. That, combined with a brutal recession, led season-ticket holders to leave in droves.
In England, Manchester United was still a soccer power, but its fans fretted that the Glazers had loaded so much debt onto the team that there would be no money left for signing new players. Worse, its archrival, Chelsea, reclaimed the Premier League title from United.
Yet in recent weeks, the Glazer family, led by the brothers and chairmen Joel, Bryan and Edward, has won a reprieve. At 7-3, the Buccaneers -- the youngest team in the N.F.L. -- have won four more games than last season's team and are one of the surprise stories of the season. Josh Freeman has answered skeptics by turning into a big-time quarterback, and the Buccaneers' defense has regained its stride. Although the Buccaneers have yet to topple a top-tier team, they have beaten their easier opponents. 
In Manchester, United has not lost a league match and is tied with Chelsea atop the Premier League. Critically, the Glazers this week repaid about $350 million in high-interest loans without using the team's money. The team's financial losses have also narrowed.
It may take more time, though, for fans to give credit to the Glazers. Anxiety in Manchester remains high, not just because of free-spending foes like Chelsea, but also because investors from Abu Dhabi have spent freely to turn United's crosstown rival, Manchester City, into a formidable opponent. Some United fans are so disgusted with the Glazers that they now support a semiprofessional team, F.C. United of Manchester.
The Glazers do not expect to sell out any home games this year in Tampa for the first time in more than a decade, meaning Buccaneers games are not shown on local television. Although the economy is in part to blame, many fans believe the Glazers are stocking the team with young players to save money, not to build a sustainable winner, as the Glazers claim.
''They're going through a cycle, and they have ownership that is disciplined, and that doesn't get well received by the fans sometimes,'' Marc Ganis, the president of SportsCorp, a sports consulting firm, said of the Glazers' strategy. But if the Glazers are successful, he said, ''three years from now they'll be a winning team for a three- or four-year cycle.''
Fans remain skeptical of the financial and on-field improvements of the Buccaneers and United partly because Malcolm Glazer and his five sons have spoken sparingly in public since 1995, when they bought the Buccaneers, and even less so since they bought United in 2005 in a takeover. Their absence has left fans to reach their own conclusions, often negative, about the direction of the teams. The Glazer family, through a Buccaneers spokesman, refused requests to be interviewed for this article.
Though the Glazers have said otherwise, many observers of the teams in England and the United States say -- often without offering proof -- that the Glazers' core business, which includes leasing space at shopping malls, is so battered that the family has been forced to cut spending and borrow from its sports teams.
In fact, the Buccaneers have one of the lowest payrolls in the N.F.L. United, meanwhile, paid 40.6 million pounds in interest (about $63 million) on its debts in the April-June quarter, a big reason the club lost a record 83.6 million pounds (about $130 million) in the fiscal year that ended in June. It has not helped their image that two other American owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr., also borrowed heavily to finance the purchase of a Premier League team, Liverpool, and then had the club sold against their wishes.
Though Manchester United is considered the most valuable sports franchise in the world and continues to bring in record revenue, the fact that the Glazers are infrequently seen at home games has led some fans to assume the owners are in such distress that they are unwilling to show their faces.
''People expect the owners to be at the stadium and walk in the town where they play, and if they can't, then something is very wrong,'' said John Williams, the director of the Center for the Sociology of Sport at the University of Leicester. ''In some respects, they're the victim of circumstance because there's been an almighty problem with Liverpool. They're reaping the negative dividend of the terrible stewardship of Hicks and Gillett.''
The Glazers may never win the public-relations war with British fans who appear to hold deep grudges. Fans in Tampa, however, may turn out to be more tolerant of the Glazers if the Buccaneers continue to play well. The N.F.L.'s revenue-sharing policies, which include dividing the league's television contract evenly among all teams, gives smaller-market teams like Tampa enough revenue to compete with rivals from bigger cities.
''Even with season tickets, by the time you're done, it's expensive,'' said Philip Porter, who studies the business of sports at the University of South Florida. ''We're like a big ship. They have to build up their season-ticket fan base. It may be like this next season as well.''
This season, though, the Buccaneers could make the playoffs and complete an improbable turnaround after last year's finish. They have 14 rookies on their 53-man roster, including receivers Mike Williams and Arrelious Benn and their leading rusher, LeGarrette Blount. They also have the youngest coach in the league, Raheem Morris, 34, as well as Mark Dominik, one of the youngest general managers.
Dominik said the Buccaneers were poised for success because Freeman and his receivers would grow together.
''We wanted to really build the foundation of the team,'' Dominik said. ''The timing, the camaraderie takes time to build.''
Though the Buccaneers are playing in front of sometimes 20,000 empty seats in Tampa, their fans are happy they are on the upswing. Tiffani Sherman, who has had season tickets for 11 seasons, said she considered giving up her two seats on the 45-yard line but then realized she might not be able to get them back once the team rebounded. Now, she is glad she kept them.
''It's sad to see the empty seats,'' Sherman said. ''I didn't want to give something up that I enjoy and regret it. This is a fun-to-watch team. They're exceeding expectations.''

HEADLINE: In Transition For Cuomo, A Profusion Of Insiders

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
When Andrew M. Cuomo named members to his transition committees this month, he described them as experienced leaders with broad experience in the public and the private sectors, selected to help him recruit the best and brightest New Yorkers to his new administration.
But another group is also heavily represented: Campaign contributors to Mr. Cuomo, lobbyists and others likely to seek access to the new administration as the next governor grapples with an enormous state budget gap and issues that include natural gas drilling in the Catskills and overhauling the state Medicaid system. 
Of the more than 170 people named to one of Mr. Cuomo's 7 transition committees or his new council of economic advisers, 84 are registered lobbyists or work for businesses, trade associations or labor unions that lobbied state government last year, according to a review of state lobbying records.
Collectively, those groups spent more than $22 million on lobbying last year, on issues like whether grocery stores should be allowed to sell wine and whether individual state universities should be allowed to set their own tuition.
At least 43 committee members personally contributed money to Mr. Cuomo's campaign for governor during this election cycle, according to campaign finance records. Their contributions in total represent more than $826,000 of Mr. Cuomo's fund-raising. More than half of those donors have given over $10,000, including the financier Jeffrey Leeds, who gave $55,790; and a lawyer, Abby S. Milstein, who gave $50,000.
Thirty-five others work for companies or unions that have contributed to Mr. Cuomo directly or through political action committees -- more than $933,000 in total contributions.
The inclusion of so many donors and lobbyists reflects a familiar paradox for incoming governors and other elected officials: Those people with the most knowledge about government and the biggest Rolodexes of recruitable talent are often the same people with a substantial stake in the outcome of governmental decisions, whether it is the budget, other legislation or regulation.
The contradiction is particularly acute for Mr. Cuomo, an insider's outsider who has sworn to remake New York's troubled state government. Many of his transition advisers are members of the Albany establishment, though Mr. Cuomo has pledged to upend that very system
His transition committee on job growth and labor, for example, includes George Gresham, the head of S.E.I.U. 1199, the powerful health-workers union, while his committee on health and education includes the presidents of both of New York's major hospital associations, Daniel Sisto and Kenneth E. Raske. Together, the three groups have spent millions of dollars on television advertisements in recent years to reduce cuts to Medicaid services. (Notably, however, the committee includes no representatives of teachers unions.)
Aides to Mr. Cuomo said that the governor-elect sought to limit potential conflicts in part by confining the transition teams to the task of recruitment, although the economic advisory council by definition will be advising Mr. Cuomo on budget and other fiscal issues.
''Often, those with great expertise in an area also work for organizations who deal directly with the government in their areas of expertise,'' said Josh Vlasto, a transition spokesman for Mr. Cuomo. ''There is nothing wrong with having such individuals on the transition team, and we welcome their expertise and counsel.''
All transition team appointees were required to agree in writing to a set of ethics guidelines, including a broad prohibition on using their position on the transition to secure special privileges or advantages for themselves or others. None are prohibited from lobbying or contributing to Mr. Cuomo or his administration after he becomes governor.
Aides said that Mr. Cuomo had also sought to ensure that each transition committee was balanced so that no one view would dominate discussions on recruiting. The 25-member committee dealing with environmental and energy issues, for example, includes representatives from about a dozen environmental groups in addition to 4 officials involved with the power industry.
Like one of his predecessors, Eliot Spitzer, Mr. Cuomo has included no ''third-party'' lobbyists -- those paid to work on behalf of other groups -- on his transition team. Instead, the registered lobbyists on the team are those who lobby only on behalf of their employer, such as Lisa Rosenblum, a senior vice president at Cablevision, and Ashok Gupta, an official at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Yet the power to help recruit personnel for an incoming administration is hardly a trivial one. The Washington adage -- personnel is policy -- holds true in Albany, too. Some observers noted that Mr. Cuomo had relied relatively little on academic experts or those from outside New York who might have fewer ties to organizations with business before the state.
''The transition team broadens or narrows the options for the governor,'' said Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonpartisan watchdog organization. ''Obviously the governor makes the choices. But if he is picking from a pool of people that are recruited by people with business before government, the size of the Rolodex gets narrowed.''

HEADLINE: Equity Markets Fall as Concern Shifts to Portugal

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Raphael Minder contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Shares on Wall Street fell on Friday while the dollar and debt prices rose as European financial troubles weighed on the markets.
With no domestic economic data scheduled, events in Europe and Asia stoked some feelings of risk aversion on Wall Street.
Europe's sovereign debt crisis began to play out in Portugal on Friday, raising the possibility that the country would need help before its borrowing costs rise too high. Many traders and analysts also questioned whether Spain might be the next to face credit problems. In Dublin, Standard & Poor's lowered the credit rating on four big Irish banks, including Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland. 
''We are basically picking up the trend coming out of Europe, which is sovereign credit risk-oriented,'' said Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at First American Funds. ''But it looks like there is domestic pressure to reverse that trend.''
The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell more than 100 points soon after opening, closed down 95.28 points, or 0.85 percent, at 11,092. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 8.95 points, or 0.75 percent, at 1,189.40.
The two indexes were down less than 1 percent in the week.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 8.56 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,534.56, on Friday, ending the week less than 1 percent higher.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 2.87 percent Friday, down from 2.91 percent late Wednesday.
Wall Street was closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and traded for only a half-day session Friday.
Mr. Hembre said a backdrop of recent upbeat domestic data, and the prospect of the Federal Reserve injecting more liquidity into the markets over the next few months in its planned purchases of $600 billion in government securities, were likely to provide some buoyancy to trading.
Materials, energy and financial shares were all down around 1 percent or more. DuPont fell 75 cents, or 1.59 percent, to $46.31, and Alcoa was down 14 cents, or 1.05 percent, to $13.17.
Bank shares were down after Ireland's credit rating was lowered. Shares in JPMorgan Chase dropped 66 cents, or 1.73 percent, to $37.50. Citigroup fell 6 cents, or 1.39 percent, to $4.11, and Bank of America dropped 16 cents, or 1.42 percent, at $11.12.
Del Monte rose 84 cents, or 4.67 percent, to $18.83 on the first trading day after it agreed to sell itself for $5.3 billion, including debt, in what is the biggest leveraged buyout this year.
In London, the FTSE 100 index was down 30.23 points, or 0.53 percent, at 5,668.70 while the DAX in Frankfurt fell 30.68 points, or 0.45 percent, at 6,848.98. The CAC 40 in France was 31.77 points, or 0.84 percent, lower at 3,728.65.
On Wednesday, the major indexes on Wall Street rallied more than 1 percent after several reports suggested improvement in the economy, including in the job market and consumer spending.
That was despite lingering concerns over debt problems in the euro zone, especially in Ireland, as well as worries over tensions between North and South Korea.
The Irish government capitulated to bond market pressures by requesting rescue money on Sunday, and investors have been concerned that similar troubles could spread to other countries that use the euro.
On Friday, some of the concern shifted to Portugal, where lawmakers approved a budget plan for 2011 aimed at reassuring nervous lenders that the country could avoid a bailout by meeting its deficit-cutting targets.
But Portuguese and other European officials rejected reports that Portugal was being pressed by its partners to accept a bailout. ''This is not the position of the ministry,'' a spokesman for the German finance ministry, Bertrand Benoit, said.
Adrian Cronje, the chief investment officer of Balentine, said that investors were unsettled by the ''piecemeal'' approach to each country's financial troubles and that there needed to be a solution for the euro zone as an entire system. ''Until that happens, you are going to find a lot of uncertainty in global markets,'' he said.
Concerns about finances have pushed up borrowing costs in Portugal and Spain as well as Ireland in recent days.
The dollar rose against the euro, ending at $1.3237.
Global equity markets lost ground as concerns about Europe and Asia persisted and despite the likely announcement of a rescue package for Ireland, currency strategists from Brown Brothers Harriman said in a research note. The euro was declining as prospects grew for Portugal to accept a bailout, they added.

HEADLINE: Animal Lovers, Beware Of Ownership Costs

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
PEOPLE love their pets, but how often do they think about the costs? The question is akin to asking which child we love more.
Yet the reality is that pets cost far more than many people expect. And right now, as the economy continues to stumble, those costs have become a burden to many people, like the cat lover who cannot afford medical care or the horse owner struggling with boarding fees.
The problem is that the general information out there is not realistic. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals estimates the cost for a large dog at $875 a year for food, medical expenses, toys and a few related expenses, and $560 for first-year setup costs. The estimate for a cat is $670 a year, with first-year expenses of $365, for a total of $1,035.
When I looked at these numbers, I thought they were taken from Voltaire's ''Candide'': derived from the best of all possible worlds. This month alone, my wife and I spent $600 on one Labrador retriever with a bladder infection who needed some kidney tests and $300 on the other one for an injured paw. This did not include the food for the two of them and our Maine Coon cat, nor their monthly flea and tick medicine or heartworm pills. 
So with the holiday gift-giving season under way, I write this column for parents who may be asked by children for a dog or a horse. Remember that the costs need to be factored in.
RESPONSIBILITY FACTOR Many pet lovers scoff at talk about expenses. Dan Denbow, co-manager of USAA's precious metals and minerals fund, said he had purposely never added up all the expenses from his four dogs, two cats, hermit crab and aquarium.
''No, I'd be afraid to,'' said Mr. Denbow, who lives in a rural town north of San Antonio. ''It's a lot of money, but it's just something we've ended up doing.''
But the expenses have added up. One spaniel charged a porcupine five times -- with a cost to remove the quills at $250 per poke. Another dog had buckshot removed from its hindquarters. Only the hermit crab has been cheap: food, water and an occasional cage cleaning.
Mr. Denbow said he was fortunate to have a good job to cover the costs, but added. ''I realize some people have to make that decision -- can I spend $300 to have this fixed?''
City pets can be a more expensive proposition.
Andrew and Julie Sacks of New York estimated that they spent $15,000 a year on Skye, their black Labrador. Skye has a dog walker to take care of him when they are at work. And he goes to camp in Pennsylvania when they go away.
''It's all about the right team,'' Mrs. Sacks said. ''We've been so lucky to have them.''
Some people may find this excessive, but what else are they going to do with him? He needs to be walked during the day and he needs to be boarded when they go away. Kennels are not cheap, with board costing a minimum of $50 a night.
But they are not complaining. Mr. Sacks, who runs Agency Sacks, a consultant that works with the affluent, said Skye's brother Moose recently had a sock removed from his stomach at a cost of about $6,000.
HORSE SENSE Of course, people who have horses will say that dogs and cats are cheap in comparison. And this is where otherwise intelligent people can make expensive mistakes.
A thoroughbred racehorse can be purchased for as little as $1,000 at Keeneland, the premier horse auction in America. But Chauncey Morris, its sales marketing associate, cautions against thinking a less expensive horse will be less expensive in the long run. Just because the price tag is far below the $4.2 million paid by Benjamin Leon Jr., a Miami health care executive, at Keeneland's yearling auction in September, does not mean that the maintenance costs are far less, too.
''To keep a horse in training in the U.S., it will average $40,000 a year,'' Mr. Morris said. ''It's the same for the $1,000 horse or the $4.2 million horse.''
(For dreamers, Mr. Morris said Zenyatta, the champion mare, was purchased at the 2005 yearling sale for $60,000 and won about $7 million in her racing career.)
Not everyone who buys horses trains them to race. But the fixed cost is still high. Andrea Redmond, a consultant in Chicago and a lifelong horsewoman, owns the Bull Run Equestrian Center in Elburn, Ill., where she said she cautioned newcomers to ease into the sport. She said boarding alone was $750 a month, but could stretch into thousands of dollars at other barns.
That fee does not include the farrier who shoes the horses -- about $200 every four to six weeks -- or the veterinarian bills. There are also the costs of the saddle, bridle, blankets, boots and brushes to get started.
''I had three horses die in the past 12 months,'' Ms. Redmond said. ''One was old. The others were fluke accidents.''
She said she had recently reduced the mortality insurance -- such insurance is common for high-value animals or those with earning potential, like race horses and breeding animals -- for a 12-year-old horse that died, but she was glad she had not dropped it entirely. ''I learned the hard way to insure them,'' she said.
The costs of insuring horses depends on what they do. Holly Griffin, executive director of the equine department at the insurance broker Hub International and a former show jumper, said the least expensive was a dressage horse with an annual premium of 3 percent of the purchase price. The most expensive are steeplechase horses at 9 percent.
Ms. Griffin estimated total fees for a horse at about $2,200 a month. ''When you're not around, that's more for someone to exercise the horse,'' she said.
Health insurance exists for dogs and cats as well. But the Sackses said they dropped their pet health insurance because getting reimbursed for claims was time-consuming and frustrating.
CHEAPER OPTIONS What can you do if your children are clamoring for a pet this year? Saying no is an option, but it rarely works.
With a dog outside of a city -- meaning no dog walker -- the fixed costs can be fairly low, but a family needs to have a cushion for those times when the medical care costs increase.
As my wife and I know, pet owners have few choices when their pets are sick. I remember a woman at Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston whose job it was to make sure we could pay before they began caring for our cat ($2,600 for liver problems) and later a dog ($1,250 for relief from a sausage that irritated his intestines). On this woman's desk were brochures for payment plans, the same type people use for funerals or cosmetic dental work. But these plans only spread out the bill -- with interest.
Horses are different. With continuing costs of $9,000 to $40,000 a year, they should be for the rich only. Still, lots of children from more modest families want to ride, too.
Lessons on a school horse are the cheapest at about $50 to $100 for 45 minutes. Beyond this, people have traditionally leased horses, by covering the boarding and insurance costs for the person who owns it. Ms. Redmond said that horse shares had recently become popular. In this sense, families are taking a half or quarter of a horse's riding time in return for covering that amount in expenses.
The biggest problem is when people cannot afford their animals. Lori Muhlenberg, a senior vice president at National Penn Investors Trust Company, takes care of 23 retired racehorses.
Her family has owned 60 acres of pasture in Pennsylvania for decades, which she does not count in calculating expenses, and her horses spend their days grazing outside unless it is too cold. Still, she estimates that each one costs $5 a day to feed and an additional $6 a day for the four months when they need to be inside -- or about $58,000 if nothing goes wrong.
But the responsibility of caring for them cannot be simply calculated as an out-of-pocket expense. ''You have to have the compassion and the commitment,'' Ms. Muhlenberg said. ''It's not just the funds. You have to worry about them.''

HEADLINE: A New Push to Rescue The Xanadu Mall Project

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Lenders and state officials in New Jersey are desperately trying to cobble together the second rescue of Xanadu, one of the nation's largest, most expensive and still incomplete retail and entertainment malls.
The 2.4-million-square-foot project, which began in 2003 with futuristic visions of an indoor ski slope, a super-size Ferris wheel, a concert hall, movie theaters, bowling alleys, restaurants and expensive shops, ran through two owners and a staggering $1.9 billion before work came to a halt nearly two years ago amid the financial crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
The lenders are now hoping to strike a deal by the end of 2010 with a new developer and a new financial partner willing to put up more than $500 million to finish the five-story mall in the Meadowlands, six miles from Times Square. 
''We've been working closely with the bank group in an effort to have a mutual accord on a new developer for the project,'' said Jon F. Hanson, a top adviser to Gov. Chris Christie. ''We are hopeful that, shortly, we can all agree as to who that developer will be.''
The difference this time is that the governor, who has made cost-cutting a hallmark of his administration, is willing to provide some low-interest financing and forgo sales tax revenues for a time, according to officials and executives involved in the talks. The plan is to resume work immediately so that the complex can open sometime in the second half of 2012.
But the resuscitation of the project faces daunting economic and strategic obstacles, according to retail experts and developers.
''It's an awfully deep hole they have to dig out of,'' said James Sullivan, a retailing specialist at Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm. ''It doesn't mean it can't be done. But which retailers will step up and be part of the solution remains to be seen.''
Already more than three years behind schedule, Xanadu has to overcome a troubled reputation, experts say.
Xanadu, which once had a million square feet of leases with a variety of retailers, including Cabela's, the outdoor sports and clothing chain, must start over, luring tenants at a time when retailers are hesitant to spend cash on opening new shops.
The retail environment is particularly challenging. In nearby Yonkers, Forest City Ratner has leased only 35 percent of its 1.2-million-square-foot retail and entertainment complex at Ridge Hill, while another developer, O'Neil Properties Group, is marketing its recreation and retail project 30 minutes south of Manhattan in Sayreville, N.J.
Financing also remains expensive and hard to come by.
And to further complicate matters, Xanadu, which blends retailing with entertainment, must comply with regulations unheard of at most malls, like local blue laws, which prohibit retail sales on Sundays, and restrictions on mall activity imposed by their next-door neighbor, the Giants football team, on game days during the football season.
''It's kind of a chicken-and-egg thing,'' said Richard Brunelli, president of R. J. Brunelli, a retail consultant. ''Until they get a credible developer known to have the financial resources to complete it, I don't know how they'll get tenants to pay attention. And they probably need to get it pre-leased to get the financing wrapped up.''
Proponents say that Xanadu still has undeniable strengths, including its location at the center of a vast network of highways and its proximity to high-income communities and tourist-rich Manhattan. And Mr. Hanson, a real estate investor himself, is confident that Xanadu can be completed and successful.
The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority picked the Mills Corporation to build the Xanadu complex in 2003 on 104 acres in the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which includes an arena, a stadium and a racetrack.
But in 2006, with Mills in financial trouble and cost overruns plaguing Xanadu, a partnership led by Colony Capital, a private equity firm based in Los Angeles, took over the project, without changing the original concept. But early in 2009, Colony and its partners ran into their own problems when a subsidiary of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers cut off the promised construction financing for Xanadu.
Early this year, Colony began talks with Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related Companies, to bring in fresh capital to finish the project. Mr. Ross, whose company built the $1.7 billion Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, went trolling for tenants at a trade show in Las Vegas.
But Mr. Ross was unable to reach a final agreement, so in August the senior lenders for the project, who had invested $500 million, foreclosed, essentially wiping out the $1.4 billion put into Xanadu by Mills and Colony, Dune Capital and Kan Am.
Since then, the lenders and their advisers, Moelis & Company and Jones Lang LaSalle, have talked to a variety of possible partners, including the Triple Five group, which owns the Mall of America in Minnesota and the West Edmonton Mall in Canada, two of the largest in the world; General Growth Properties; and Vornado Realty Trust.
''We are pleased with the level of interest we have received from prospective developers, and hope to name a new developer for the project shortly,'' said Michael Beckerman, a spokesman for the lenders.
The new partners would have to put up $600 million to $800 million, according to executives involved in the talks. But they would be the first to reap any potential profits, because the lenders' $500 million would be subordinate to the new investment.
In addition, the Christie administration is likely to provide about $180 million in low-interest bonds, which would be repaid by diverting 75 percent of the projected sales tax revenues from Xanadu. Although the state's advisers once described Xanadu as a ''failed business model,'' they have since softened their stance.
The Christie administration is eager to see Xanadu restarted, especially since the adjacent racetrack loses money, the Izod arena is without a tenant and the newly built stadium for the Jets and the Giants pays less in rent and fees than the old stadium.
But Mr. Brunelli, the retail adviser, said that he would surprised to see Governor Christie ''put taxpayer money into this.''
''It would fly in the face of what he's been preaching,'' he added. ''Nor do I believe taxpayers should put money into the project. The market should determine whether the project goes forward, not politicians.''

HEADLINE: An Eclectic Shopping Hub Wonders What's Next

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

 BODY:
A trickle of shoppers wandered the repaved sidewalks of the Fulton Street Mall one recent evening, under new streetlamps, a model the city calls the ''Fulton Pole,'' and freshly planted Kentucky coffee trees. They walked past the pizzeria that will close soon to make way for a Shake Shack, Danny Meyer's hyper-popular hamburger chain, and past the workers putting the mannequins in the windows of Aeropostale, the teenage clothing store that opened last week.
Only one or two of them made their way to Dolly Kakwani's jewelry counter, Shiv Creations, at the entrance of a sprawling housewares store, where she leafed anxiously through a ledger, unable to alter its disappointing math. Sales for the month of October were down $6,000 from the year earlier. On top of that, the owners of the housewares store recently announced they were closing, forcing the jewelry counter, which has been open since 1984, to move or close. That evening, Ms. Kakwani spotted another Fulton Mall store owner facing similar problems. She waxed hopeful, speculating that Aeropostale and H & M, another incoming clothing giant, might bring the smaller vendors like them new customers. The other owner laughed and said the newcomers would kill off the tiny old-timers. 
''Where will you go?'' Ms. Kakwani asked, having no idea where she would go.
Amid the worries and struggles of such shopkeepers are excitement and high hopes, as the eight or so blocks of Fulton Street in Downtown Brooklyn undergo their latest transformation in a long history as the borough's commercial heart. Thousands of Manhattanites and other young professionals have in recent years moved into the gleaming new high-rise condominiums and restored brownstones in the neighborhoods surrounding the neglected mall, and developers are hoping the influx of brand-name chains will finally lure them into what for decades has been a cherished destination for working-class shoppers.
''You're going to see a whole new Fulton Street in the next 12 months,'' said Isaac S. Chera, one of the area's biggest property owners, whose grandfather owned a children's store in the 1940s, when the street was lined with department stores.
Those words, or similar ones, have been uttered before.
The street, once anchored by retailers like Abraham & Strauss and the white-tablecloth dining at Gage & Tollner, has cycled through periods of prosperity and hardship since its emergence as a shopping destination in the late 1800s. After World War II, civic leaders talked about Fulton Street as a rival to Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. In the 1960s, despite challenges from emerging shopping centers in other parts of Brooklyn, Fulton Street's biggest retailers -- J. W. Mays Inc. and Martin's -- were thriving. In an interview with The New York Times in 1968, Max L. Shulman, the chairman of Mays, said: ''The future of this street is bright and promising because of all the urban renewal work that has been and is still going on.'' But two decades later, Mays and other retailers had closed, even as the city spent millions to rehabilitate Fulton Street in the hopes of luring new stores.
But the street, always one of the busiest shopping corridors in the city, survived. Abraham & Strauss became Macy's, and the shoppers, many of them low- and middle-income people of color, kept coming. Today the mall is better known for sneaker stores, wig shops and cellphone counters. The hope, for property owners and public officials, is that Fulton Street can become something like 34th Street or Lower Broadway in Manhattan. Rents are soaring, and a $15 million renovation is tidying the ramshackle strip, which will soon have a new Filene's Basement.
Many current shopkeepers agree with Mr. Chera that big changes are afoot. They worried that shoppers' tastes might change, and several said they would close their stores or relocate, blaming the recession, rising rents and construction on the street for a year of paltry profits.
For the moment, the mall's vaunted future and its eclectic present co-exist as the place settles into new rhythms.
Street vendors still prowl the sidewalks, sharing pavement with construction workers. Longtime shoppers still come but greet fewer familiar faces every day. A man with a sandwich sign still offers unbeatable deals on cellphones, but the soft sell and the hard bargain are being eclipsed, by ''going out of business'' signs and corporate oversight. In places, the old and new worlds get along. Outside Eric Busuttil's new cellphone store -- a sliver of space that rents for $14,000 a month -- a group of young men hawking rap CDs show up daily, encouraged by Mr. Busuttil, who said they bring him business during tough times.
The young men were a reminder of Fulton Street's more recent storied past, as a linchpin of the hip-hop scene, a place for young artists that was immortalized in rap lyrics.
Some change was inevitable -- even desirable. ''People wanted more shopping options,'' said Vicki Weiner, the director of planning and preservation at the Pratt Center for Community Development, who co-wrote a comprehensive study of the area in 2006. ''The plans are positive. We in fact recommended stores like H & M, which appeal to both gentrified areas and the traditional customer base, which comes from all over Brooklyn.''
In the borough's rapidly shifting landscape, Fulton Street has found itself with nearby rivals, including Smith Street and its boutiques and Atlantic Avenue with its new Barneys Co-op. The key to its renewal may be found in not trying too hard.
''Is Hermes coming to the Fulton Mall? Probably not,'' said Joe Chan, the president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a nonprofit development corporation. ''The sweet spot is affordable, accessible retailers that can cater to the entire borough and that will bring added cachet to Downtown Brooklyn.''
For Fulton Mall store owners like Gavriel Pinhasov, something -- anything -- had to change. His jewelry store, near a heap of construction, has suffered in the 11 months since he opened. ''It was a horrible year,'' he said. ''I barely survived.''
The other day, a few customers stopped in, weighing their purchases carefully. Mr. Pinhasov, who goes by Gabby, tried to reassure them. ''I'm here for you,'' he would say. As they left, he stepped out onto Fulton Street, lighted a cigarette and considered the future. ''It's not Fifth Avenue and it's not Lexington,'' he said. ''These people struggle every day.''

HEADLINE: Think Twice Before Signing Up for That Medical Credit Card

BYLINE: By WALECIA KONRAD

 BODY:
IF you are like most people, you have probably used a credit card to pay some of your medical bills. With rising health costs and gaps in insurance coverage, it's almost unavoidable.
Patients pay about $45 billion worth of health care costs with plastic, according to a report from McKinsey & Company. By 2015, that number could more than triple to an estimated $150 billion. And big finance companies and medical providers have taken note.
Companies like GE Money, Citibank and JPMorgan Chase have issued medical credit cards or lines of credit intended to be used specifically for elective health care expenses not covered by insurance, including certain dental procedures, Lasik surgery, some cosmetic surgery and even veterinary care. The cards are not used for continuing medical care or emergency room visits.
The issuers market these cards not so much to consumers but to doctors, dentists and other health care providers, who in turn offer them to patients as a payment option. Patients like medical credit cards because payments for care can be spread out over many months and the cards can be used at multiple providers. The providers have embraced them as a way of offloading billing headaches and expenses. 
But even as medical credit cards become increasingly popular, they are getting more scrutiny -- not much of it flattering. Critics and patient advocates claim that aggressive and misleading marketing tactics can lead to serious headaches for consumers.
In extreme cases, medical providers and associations marketing the cards have been accused of receiving financial incentives for signing up patients or of falsifying financial information to make it easier for patients to qualify for cards.
More commonly, critics say, patients may be led to assume that their providers are simply offering payment plans, not a credit card with all the potential fees, interest rate increases and the impact on credit scores that can entail.
''Ironically, these cards may be best suited to people who already have financial resources,'' said Mark Rukavina, executive director of the Access Project, a consumer advocacy group in Boston, and co-author of a study on medical debt. ''But it's usually people with limited resources who sign up.''
Consumer complaints concerning aggressive marketing tactics prompted the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, to start an investigation into medical credit cards earlier this year. In Minnesota, the state attorney general, Lori Swanson, has filed lawsuits against two chiropractors whose staff is accused of signing up patients for medical credit cards without their knowledge.
A medical credit card is ''one payment option among several a provider may offer and represents a very small component of health care financing for elective procedures,'' said Stephen White, a spokesman for CareCredit, a medical credit card issued by GE Money. ''Benefits to consumers include the ability to plan, budget and pay for certain elective health care procedures over time.''
Whether you view these cards as a convenient way to pay medical expenses or just another way for credit card companies to collect interest and fees, here are some things to consider if your provider approaches you.
ASK FOR ALTERNATIVES First, try to negotiate a lower fee with your provider; he may be more flexible than you think. Then ask about payment options. Your doctor may well offer a payment plan of his or her own, without the high interest rates often charged by a medical credit card company.
''I encourage people to negotiate with their provider, then get an extended payment plan directly from that office with a monthly payment and time period you are comfortable with,'' said Mr. Rukavina. ''I think most providers are willing to work for patients in this way.''
If you do opt for a payment plan, ask whether you will be paying the provider directly or a third party. If there's a third party involved, you may well wind up with a medical credit card. If you choose to sign up for it, be sure you've read through the terms carefully and that you understand the interest rates and late payment fees.
If your income is low enough, be aware that you may qualify for a public assistance program, especially for dental costs.
DODGE THE HARD SELL ''Some patients report feeling pressured by their clinics to use the card to pay for procedures or treatments they may not need or can't afford,'' Ms. Swanson said. That's no surprise, since these cards are intended, at least in part, to drive more business to dentists, chiropractors, cosmetic and eye surgeons, weight loss programs, hearing aid dispensers and other providers.
But the intense marketing can lead to unethical behavior, according to Ms. Swanson.
One of the lawsuits filed by her office claims that staff members at a chiropractic office told patients they were not signing up for a credit card but rather just going through a credit check. Instead, Ms. Swanson charges, the staff members submitted applications in the patients' names and falsified patient's yearly income information to make sure they qualified.
If you sense you're being pushed, that things are moving too quickly, remember that you don't have to sign up for anything on the spot. Take a day or two to read through materials thoroughly and research your options.
BEWARE THOSE TEASER RATES Almost all medical credit cards claim zero percent financing. This is what makes them attractive: you can spread out your payments and pay no interest.
But it is important to read the fine print. As with most credit cards marketed this way, the zero percent rate lasts only for an initial promotional period, usually from six to 24 months. Once that time is up, you will start to pay interest -- sometimes high interest.
For GE's CareCredit, for instance, rates jump to 26.99 percent. (The company does offer a fixed rate of 14.9 percent for extended periods up to 60 months.)
High interest isn't your only concern. Be sure to check your minimum payment, advised Ms. Swanson. If you pay only the minimum, your payments may extend beyond the zero percent financing period, and you'll end up with the higher rate.
What's more, if you make just one late payment or go over the initial promotion period, some cards will charge you a high interest rate retroactively on the original balance, Ms. Swanson noted. That can suddenly add hundreds of dollars to your bill.
PAY AS YOU GO Some providers will charge your medical card for an entire multivisit procedure, like a dental implant, all at once. If you change providers midway through, or do not go through the entire procedure for some other reason, it can be difficult and time-consuming to get a refund, warned Mr. Rukavina.
If you are entering into a treatment or procedure that will take more than one visit, make sure your provider is billing you by the visit, not in a lump sum.
You can find more background on medical credit cards from the Minnesota attorney general's office at www.ag.state.mn.us/Consumer/Publications/HealthCareCreditCards.asp.

HEADLINE: Winning The Class War

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The class war that no one wants to talk about continues unabated.
Even as millions of out-of-work and otherwise struggling Americans are tightening their belts for the holidays, the nation's elite are lacing up their dancing shoes and partying like royalty as the millions and billions keep rolling in.
Recessions are for the little people, not for the corporate chiefs and the titans of Wall Street who are at the heart of the American aristocracy. They have waged economic warfare against everybody else and are winning big time. 
The ranks of the poor may be swelling and families forced out of their foreclosed homes may be enduring a nightmarish holiday season, but American companies have just experienced their most profitable quarter ever. As The Times reported this week, U.S. firms earned profits at an annual rate of $1.659 trillion in the third quarter -- the highest total since the government began keeping track more than six decades ago.
The corporate fat cats are becoming alarmingly rotund. Their profits have surged over the past seven quarters at a pace that is among the fastest ever seen, and they can barely contain their glee. On the same day that The Times ran its article about the third-quarter surge in profits, it ran a piece on the front page that carried the headline: ''With a Swagger, Wallets Out, Wall Street Dares to Celebrate.''
Anyone who thinks there is something beneficial in this vast disconnect between the fortunes of the American elite and those of the struggling masses is just silly. It's not even good for the elite.
There is no way to bring America's consumer economy back to robust health if unemployment is chronically high, wages remain stagnant and the jobs that are created are poor ones. Without ordinary Americans spending their earnings from good jobs, any hope of a meaningful, long-term recovery is doomed.
Beyond that, extreme economic inequality is a recipe for social instability. Families on the wrong side of the divide find themselves under increasing pressure to just hold things together: to find the money to pay rent or the mortgage, to fend off bill collectors, to cope with illness and emergencies, and deal with the daily doses of extreme anxiety.
Societal conflicts metastasize as resentments fester and scapegoats are sought. Demagogues inevitably emerge to feast on the poisonous stew of such an environment. The rich may think that the public won't ever turn against them. But to hold that belief, you have to ignore the turbulent history of the 1930s.
A stark example of the potential for real conflict is being played out in New York City, where the multibillionaire mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has selected a glittering example of the American aristocracy to be the city's schools chancellor. Cathleen Black, chairwoman of Hearst Magazines, has a reputation as a crackerjack corporate executive but absolutely no background in education.
Ms. Black travels in the rarefied environs of the very rich. Her own children went to private boarding schools. She owns a penthouse on Park Avenue and a $4 million home in Southampton. She was able to loan a $47,600 Bulgari bracelet to a museum for an exhibit showing off the baubles of the city's most successful women.
Ms. Black will be peering across an almost unbridgeable gap between her and the largely poor and working-class parents and students she will be expected to serve. Worse, Mr. Bloomberg, heralding Ms. Black as a ''superstar manager,'' has made it clear that because of budget shortfalls she will be focused on managing cutbacks to the school system.
So here we have the billionaire and the millionaire telling the poor and the struggling -- the little people -- that they will just have to make do with less. You can almost feel the bitterness rising.
Extreme inequality is already contributing mightily to political and other forms of polarization in the U.S. And it is a major force undermining the idea that as citizens we should try to face the nation's problems, economic and otherwise, in a reasonably united fashion. When so many people are tumbling toward the bottom, the tendency is to fight among each other for increasingly scarce resources.
What's really needed is for working Americans to form alliances and try, in a spirit of good will, to work out equitable solutions to the myriad problems facing so many ordinary individuals and families. Strong leaders are needed to develop such alliances and fight back against the forces that nearly destroyed the economy and have left working Americans in the lurch.
Aristocrats were supposed to be anathema to Americans. Now, while much of the rest of the nation is suffering, they are the only ones who can afford to smile.

HEADLINE: China Addresses Rising Korean Tensions, but With a Warning to the U.S.

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON and MARTIN FACKLER; Ian Johnson reported from Beijing, and Martin Fackler from Seoul, South Korea. Su-Hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul, and Mark Landler and Thom Shanker from Washington.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity on Friday, three days after a North Korean artillery attack on South Korean civilians, but its most public message was directed at the United States, which is about to begin joint exercises with South Korea's Navy.
In a statement from its Foreign Ministry, China warned against ''any military acts in our exclusive economic zone without permission,'' the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Friday. But virtually all the waters to the west of the Korean Peninsula, where the United States said the exercises would take place, lie within that zone, and American naval traffic is far from uncommon there.
Adding yet more tension to the situation, the North's state-run media also warned that the maneuvers could push the Korean Peninsula closer to ''the brink of war.'' 
The West has hoped that China would use its leverage as the North's traditional ally to press it to refrain from further attacks, but the Chinese statement on Friday failed even to criticize the North for its shelling on Tuesday of a garrison island that is also home to about 1,350 civilians, mainly fishermen. The attack killed four people.
The Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, met with the North Korean ambassador on Friday and spoke by phone with his South Korean and American counterparts, but few details emerged about the content of their conversations. A State Department spokesman said that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had called Mr. Yang.
Xinhua reported that Mr. Yang stressed that China was ''very concerned'' about the situation, saying, ''The pressing task now is to put the situation under control and prevent a recurrence of similar incidents.''
In a statement about the joint naval exercises, which are scheduled to begin on Sunday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said: ''We hold a consistent and clear-cut stance on the issue. We oppose any party to take any military acts in our exclusive economic zone without permission.''
This introduced into the mix China's decade-old efforts to equate economic waters, which usually extend about 200 nautical miles off a country's coast, with territorial waters, which usually reach about 12 nautical miles off a coast. In 2001, Chinese fighters intercepted and collided with a United States spy plane flying outside territorial waters but inside the economic zone, saying the American plane had violated China's sovereignty.
A statement from the United States Navy's Seventh Fleet, issued in apparent anticipation of Chinese complaints about the exercise, listed the number of times American aircraft carriers had operated in the waters west of the Korean Peninsula, including a mission in October 2009. The statement also noted that American aircraft carriers frequently visited South Korea and conducted port visits, including the aircraft carrier George Washington earlier this year, the John C. Stennis in March 2009, and the Ronald Reagan, the Nimitz and the George Washington in 2008.
The United States, which had already sent the George Washington to the region in response to the North Korean attack, made another show of solidarity with the South on Friday; the commander of American forces in South Korea, Gen. Walter L. Sharp, visited Yeonpyeong Island to survey the damage from the hourlong bombardment on Tuesday, which killed two civilians and two South Korean marines.
But North Korea remained defiant, firing off artillery rounds right after the general's visit. The rounds did not fall on South Korean territory, but rattled nerves on the island nonetheless.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, Kwon Ki-hyeon, said the shots appeared to stay within North Korean territory, suggesting that they had been part of a drill or perhaps an effort to frighten the South Korean garrison on the island, which lies within sight of the North Korean mainland.
News flashes about the new artillery fire set off a brief wave of alarm in Seoul, where Tuesday's attack has stirred anxiety and outrage. Local television there has been inundated with images of the damage to the island's once tranquil fishing town, where rows of homes had collapsed or been blackened by fire.
Most of the island's civilian residents have fled, leaving only a few dozen mostly elderly holdouts, some of whom were shown scurrying into bomb shelters when the artillery was heard Friday. They told local TV stations that the barrage on Tuesday turned the town into a ''sea of fire,'' sending stunned and panicked residents running into the streets in confusion.
Video showed shattered furniture and scattered children's toys amid the rubble, and deserted streets whose only sign of movement was a few stray dogs. While much of the town was undamaged, the attack seemed aimed at important civilian structures like a supermarket and a post office, the reports said.
The scenes of civilian destruction and of the mothers of the dead civilians wailing at their funerals have driven home the threat posed by the North to a greater extent than previous provocations, like the sinking of a South Korean warship in March, which involved only military casualties.
Many of the rounds shot by the North during the hourlong attack struck Yeonpyeong's garrison of 1,000 South Korean marines, who are dug in around the island in concrete bunkers and machine-gun nests. Local TV showed photos taken during the barrage, in which fortified bunkers were engulfed in fireballs and pockmarked by exploding shrapnel.
The renewed shooting and stern warning by the North on Friday have raised concerns here that the North could respond violently to the naval exercises on Sunday.
American officials have been encouraging China to use its influence with North Korea to urge restraint. On Friday, Mrs. Clinton called her Chinese counterpart, Mr. Yang, American officials said. ''Secretary Clinton urged China to send a clear message that the North's behavior is unacceptable,'' said the State Department's spokesman, Philip J. Crowley.
Mr. Yang also met on Friday with the North Korean ambassador in Beijing and had telephone conversations with the South Korean foreign minister. ''The pressing task now is to put the situation under control and prevent a recurrence of similar incidents,'' Mr. Yang said in a statement.
North Korea represents a difficult foreign policy challenge for China. Among other things, China continues to stand by its neighbor for fear that its collapse would extend the boundaries of pro-Western South Korea to China's borders.
''The record is very clear: China is not going to implement any measures that impose any costs on North Korea,'' said Daniel Pinkston, North Asia analyst for the International Crisis Group. ''What else is there left for North Korea to do? Missile tests, a nuclear program and now an artillery attack.''
The South Korean government has come under intense criticism domestically for an inadequate retaliation for the attack on Tuesday. South Korean officials said their forces were unable to fully respond because they had been trained and equipped to thwart an amphibious assault, not a prolonged artillery bombardment. Only three of the garrison's half-dozen 155-millimeter cannons were able to shoot back, officials said.
Stung by the criticism, the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, ordered reinforcements to Yeonpyeong and four nearby islands, as well as more heavy weapons, and has already replaced his defense minister.
The exercise was announced over the summer without a date's being set; that announcement was expected around now. But after North Korea shelled the island, President Obama announced the date, making it a sign of Washington's resolve to support its ally in Seoul.
In its final form, the joint exercise will take the same shape as had been planned since the summer, according to military officers, and has not been altered by the North Korean attack.
Starting on Sunday, the George Washington, which makes its home port in Yokosuka, Japan, and sails with a complete wing of combat aircraft, will lead four other American surface warships in the exercise with the South Korean Navy.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 4, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Saturday about a flurry of diplomatic activity by China three days after a North Korean artillery attack on a South Korean garrison island misstated the island's civilian population at one point. As the article noted elsewhere, Yeonpyeong Island has about 1,350 civilians, not 1,600.

HEADLINE: Debt Crisis Highlights I.M.F.'s Renewed Role

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Ireland's reluctant acceptance of a bailout supported by the International Monetary Fund is the latest in a string of developments since 2007 that have thrust the monetary fund into a new position of authority and prominence.
The fund, which earlier in the decade seemed dormant and even irrelevant, is back in a big way. This year alone, it has inaugurated loan packages or credit lines to Colombia, El Salvador, Greece, Jamaica, Mexico, Poland and Ukraine, among others. As Ireland joins the list, many investors are raising questions about Portugal and Spain.
The biggest economies have turned to the monetary fund to monitor the trade imbalances and currency tensions that threaten global cooperation. The fund is lecturing Europe -- the Continent whose devastation led to its creation in 1944 -- on the need for economic changes. Its bungling of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, widely regarded as a low point that soured emerging markets on the monetary fund, has been seemingly forgiven, if not forgotten.
Even as the I.M.F. expands its presence, the institution is being transformed in ways that reflect the emerging economic order, with Asia leading the recovery; Latin America, the Middle East and Africa growing steadily; and the richest economies of Western Europe, North America and Japan lagging behind. 
''Almost overnight the I.M.F. seems to have regained some of its legitimacy and some of its customers -- or at least it's found new customers,'' said David Andrew Singer, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''The I.M.F. is back in business, and its legitimacy is on the rise, but it's also being tested in new ways.''
Under pressure from the United States, Europe has ceded two seats on the fund's board as part of a broader effort to better represent China and other fast-growing developing countries in decision-making.
The I.M.F. has reassessed some of its long-held orthodoxies, like its aversion to capital controls and its insistence that central banks maintain a very low target for inflation.
The public face of the I.M.F. is being revisited as well. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French economist and politician who has led the fund since 2007, might be the last managing director chosen under the World War II-era custom of having a Western European lead the fund while an American heads its sister institution, the World Bank.
''I find it inconceivable that they'll have a Western European or North American as the next managing director,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist at the I.M.F.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a charismatic figure who is credited with shepherding the I.M.F. back into the spotlight and whose popularity at home has risen, might run for the French presidency in 2012.
Whatever he decides, his successor is likely to be someone from the developing world. Frequently mentioned names include Mohamed A. El-Erian, the American-born son of an Egyptian diplomat and an economist who leads the giant bond investor Pimco; Montek Singh Ahluwalia, a senior Indian planning official; and Arminio Fraga and Guillermo Ortiz, former heads of the central banks of Brazil and Mexico respectively.
For now, Mr. Strauss-Kahn has declined to discuss his political future, focusing on the economic woes of Europe.
At a European Central Bank conference in Frankfurt on Nov. 19, he said that the Continent's stellar growth in the postwar decades -- fueled by technological adoption, growing integration and a strong banking system -- stalled in the early 1980s.
He cited hurdles to growth: chronically high unemployment (and its high social costs), stagnant productivity in southern Europe and a financial sector focused more on arcane innovation than on support for the small start-up businesses that drive job creation.
''As the postcrisis world takes shape, Europe risks being left even further behind, especially as the dynamic regions of the world are bolting out of the stables,'' he said. ''Europe must break the shackles of low growth and stop settling for second best. This is the only way to save the social model and fulfill the common European destiny.''
Mr. Strauss-Kahn urged changes to bring about a ''single labor market'' like the European Union's common market for goods, and raised the delicate issue of rebalancing growth within Europe, gently prodding Germany -- the export powerhouse at the center of the union -- to stimulate domestic demand.
And he urged national governments to grant more authority in matters like research and development and budgetary policy to the European Union, saying that ''peer pressure has not served Europe very well'' and ''countries must be willing to cede more authority to the center.''
In giving tough advice to Europe, ''in a sense the I.M.F. is returning to its roots,'' said James Raymond Vreeland, a political scientist at Georgetown University. After all the I.M.F.'s first loan was made to France, in 1947; its first conditional loan arrangement with a developing country was with Peru, in 1954.
The fund's advice is in some ways even more significant than its financing, which is based on contributions from member countries and has increased as a result of the crisis. The European Union is financing most of the bailout for Greece, for example, but is relying on the I.M.F. to monitor the fiscal and tax changes there, and the repair of the banking system in Ireland.
''It's not so much that they need the I.M.F.'s money, but that they need the I.M.F.'s mechanism for being able to monitor policy reforms,'' Mr. Vreeland said of the Europeans.
While the realignment of economic power has been painful for rich countries, it has provided an unanticipated boon for the I.M.F.'s mandate.
''In many ways, the I.M.F. has been blessed with the power shift under way in the global economy,'' said Robert R. Bench, an authority on international financial regulation at the Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law at Boston University.
The Group of 20 economic powers has given the I.M.F. the task of helping to untangle the thorniest problem threatening global economic coordination: the persistent balance-of-payments imbalances that bind Asia and America in an uneasy embrace.
The instability that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis has been attributed in part to the persistent tendency of surplus countries, like China and Germany, to save and export too much and of deficit countries, like the United States and Britain, to borrow and spend too much.
A summit meeting of the G-20 leaders, including President Obama, in Seoul, South Korea, ended on Nov. 12 with vague and convoluted promises to redress global imbalances, but little detail on how to go about doing it.
But the nations did agree to rely on an I.M.F.-led mechanism, known as the mutual assessment process, for monitoring the imbalances and suggesting ways to repair them.
Only ''limited progress'' has been made toward fixing the imbalances, the I.M.F. concluded in a report released in Seoul.
Whether the fund can persuade Beijing and Washington, and not merely Dublin and Athens, is likely to be one its greatest challenges in the coming months.

HEADLINE: Banks Start to Dig Out From Troubled Loans

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
AFTER several years of decline, this is shaping up to be the year in which the problems of America's banks began to recede.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationreported this week that the proportion of troubled loans on bank books fell to 9.1 percent at the end of September, down by more than a percentage point from the record 10.3 percent figure posted at the end of 2009.
''The industry continues making progress in recovering from the financial crisis,'' said Sheila C. Bair, the F.D.I.C. chairwoman. ''Credit performance has been improving, and we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook.'' 
The improvement was not across the board. Loans secured by commercial real estate became a little worse, and some smaller banks that specialize in such loans have reason to be worried. The number of banks labeled as troubled by the F.D.I.C. continued to rise.
The figures for problem loans combine the proportion of loans that are at least 30 days behind in payment, those that are no longer expected to pay and thus are in nonaccrual status and those that are being written off. All three categories are falling, and the total loan write-offs, at $47 billion in the third quarter, was the lowest in six quarters.
Bank fortunes have also improved because the extremely low interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve mean that banks can borrow money almost for nothing, and then they can lend it out for something. During the quarter, the average cost of funds for the nation's banks fell to 0.91 percent.
It is the largest banks, with assets of more than $10 billion, that pay the least. Their cost of funds was just 0.8 percent, while those banks with less than $10 billion are still paying over 1 percent.
For most of the decade before the financial crisis, banks as a group reported returns on equity of more than 12 percent, a performance that should have set off alarms in a period of declining interest rates. To get such returns on a consistent basis should have provided a hint that banks were taking on serious risks, either in the category of assets they owned or in the leverage they took on to produce the earnings.
For the third quarter, banks as a group posted a 3.9 percent return on equity, a rate that has been falling this year in part because banks are being forced to hold more equity. Under the tougher capital rules that are expected to be phased in, it is unlikely that the banking industry will soon be able to post the kind of returns that seemed normal only a few years ago.
One caution about the results was sounded by Ms. Bair, who noted that a significant part of the banks' profit improvement has come from reducing the amounts set aside as provisions for future loan losses. ''At this point in the credit cycle, it is too early for institutions to be reducing reserves without strong evidence of sustainable, improving loan performance and reduced loss rates,'' she said.
Just how much better things really are may become clearer when banks report their full-year results. Historically, the industry reports more red ink, and writes off more bad loans, in the fourth quarter than it does in other periods. That may be because auditors and regulators look more closely at full-year numbers than they do at interim reports, and that sometimes require banks to be a little less optimistic in the estimates that go into calculating profits and losses.

HEADLINE: Health Law Faces Threat Of Undercut From Courts

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the Obama administration presses ahead with the health care law, officials are bracing for the possibility that a federal judge in Virginia will soon reject its central provision as unconstitutional and, in the worst case for the White House, halt its enforcement until higher courts can rule.
The judge, Henry E. Hudson of Federal District Court in Richmond, has promised to rule by the end of the year on the constitutionality of the law's requirement that most Americans obtain insurance, which takes effect in 2014.
Although administration officials remain confident that it is constitutionally valid to compel people to obtain health insurance, they also acknowledge that Judge Hudson's preliminary opinions and comments could presage the first ruling against the law. 
''He's asked a number of questions that express skepticism,'' said one administration official who is examining whether a ruling against part of the law would undermine other provisions. ''We have been trying to think through that set of questions,'' said the official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case freely.
While many newly empowered Republican lawmakers have vowed to repeal the health care law in Congress, a more immediate threat may rest in the federal courts in cases brought by Republican officials in dozens of states. Not only would an adverse ruling confuse Americans and attack the law's underpinnings, it could frustrate the steps hospitals, insurers and government agencies are taking to carry out the law.
''Any ruling against the act creates another P.R. problem for the Democrats, who need to resell the law to insured Americans,'' said Jonathan Oberlander, a University of North Carolina political scientist, who wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine last week that such a ruling ''could add to health care reform's legitimacy problem.''
So far, there has been only one ruling on the merits among nearly two dozen legal challenges to the health care act. Last month, a federal district judge in Michigan upheld the law. But another judge, Roger Vinson of Federal District Court in Pensacola, Fla., has joined Judge Hudson in writing preliminary opinions that seemingly accept key arguments made by state officials challenging the law.
Unlike the judge in Michigan, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, both Judge Hudson and Judge Vinson were appointed by Republican presidents.
''We are not operating under the assumption that those two judges are inevitably going to rule against us,'' the administration official said. ''But of course we're planning for the possibility that judges will reach different conclusions.''
The novel question before the courts is whether the government can require citizens to buy a commercial product like health insurance.
Because the Supreme Court has said the commerce clause of the Constitution allows Congress to regulate ''activities that substantially affect interstate commerce,'' the judges must decide whether the failure to obtain insurance can be defined as an ''activity.''
Lawyers on both sides expect the issue eventually to be decided by the Supreme Court. But the appellate path to that decision could take two years. In the meantime, any district court judge who rules against the law would have to decide whether to block enforcement of one or more of its provisions, potentially creating bureaucratic chaos.
Such a decision would prompt a flurry of appeals, as the Justice Department almost certainly would ask the judge and then the appellate courts to stay, or delay, the injunction pending the outcome of higher court rulings.
Administration officials, as well as some lawyers for the plaintiffs, agree that Judge Hudson seems unlikely, based on his comments from the bench, to enjoin the entire law. The judge volunteered at a hearing last month that his courtroom was ''just one brief stop on the way to the Supreme Court.''
If he does not enjoin the law, the immediate impact of a finding against the insurance mandate would be limited because that provision, and others that might fall with it, do not take effect for more than three years.
Virginia's attorney general, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, a Republican who filed the Richmond lawsuit, argues that if Judge Hudson rejects the insurance requirement he should instantly invalidate the entire act on a nationwide basis.
Mr. Cuccinelli and the plaintiffs in the Florida case, who include attorneys general or governors from 20 states, have emphasized that Congressional bill writers did not include a ''severability clause'' that would explicitly protect other parts of the sprawling law if certain provisions were struck down.
An earlier version of the legislation, which passed the House last November, included severability language. But that clause did not make it into the Senate version, which ultimately became law. A Democratic aide who helped write the bill characterized the omission as an oversight.
Without such language, the Supreme Court, through its prior rulings, essentially requires judges to try to determine whether Congress would have enacted the rest of a law without the unconstitutional provisions.
The Justice Department, which represents the Obama administration, acknowledges that several of the law's central provisions, like the requirement that insurers cover those with pre-existing conditions, cannot work unless both the healthy and the unhealthy are mandated to have insurance. Otherwise, consumers could simply buy coverage when they needed treatment, causing the insurance market to ''implode,'' the federal government asserts.
The administration argues that other key provisions do not depend on the insurance mandate. Those provisions include establishing health insurance exchanges, subsidizing premiums through tax credits and expanding Medicaid eligibility, all scheduled for 2014.
Nor, administration officials said, would an adverse ruling necessarily undermine certain insurance regulations that recently took effect, like the requirement that insurers cover children younger than 26 on their parents' policies.
In a hearing last month, Judge Hudson remarked on the difficulty of determining Congress's intent regarding a law with hundreds of disparate provisions. ''This bill has more moving parts than a Swiss watch,'' he said.
Lawyers for Virginia have sought to turn one of the federal government's arguments on its head. They note that the health law explicitly refers to the insurance requirement as ''an essential part'' of the act's regulatory scheme, and that Justice Department lawyers -- in pressing their point that the law permissibly regulates commerce -- have called it the ''linchpin.''
If it is so essential, Virginia's lawyers have asked, why should a judge believe that Congress intended for the rest of the act to stand without it?
Any illusion that the cases are not highly politicized was lost when Republican leaders raced this month to file friend-of-the-court briefs in Pensacola, and Democrats responded with briefs from state legislators and supportive economists. Among the Republicans intervening in the case are Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the future speaker; 32 United States senators; and Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a possible presidential candidate.
A White House official said that in the meantime ''the litigation is really not having an impact'' on the pace of putting the law into effect: ''I talk weekly to officials in states that have sued us, and in states that have not. I cannot tell the difference between them.''

HEADLINE: BLUEPRINTS FOR THE MIDEAST; Building Museums, and a Fresh Arab Identity

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- It is an audacious experiment: two small, oil-rich countries in the Middle East are using architecture and art to reshape their national identities virtually overnight, and in the process to redeem the tarnished image of Arabs abroad while showing the way toward a modern society within the boundaries of Islam.
Here, on a barren island on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi, workers have dug the foundations for three colossal museums: an $800 million Frank Gehry-designed branch of the Guggenheim 12 times the size of its New York flagship; a half-billion-dollar outpost of the Louvre by Jean Nouvel; and a showcase for national history by Foster & Partners, the design for which was unveiled on Thursday. And plans are moving ahead for yet another museum, about maritime history, to be designed by Tadao Ando. 
Nearly 200 miles across the Persian Gulf, Doha, the capital of Qatar, has been mapping out its own extravagant cultural vision. A Museum of Islamic Art, a bone-white I. M. Pei-designed temple, opened in 2008 and dazzled the international museum establishment. In December the government will open a museum of modern Arab art with a collection that spans the mid-19th-century to the present. Construction has just begun on a museum of Qatari history, also by Mr. Nouvel, and the design for a museum of Orientalist art by the Swiss firm Herzog & de Meuron is to be made public next year.
To a critic traveling through the region, the speed at which museums are being built in Abu Dhabi -- and the international brand names attached to some of them -- conjured culture-flavored versions of the overwrought real-estate spectacles that famously shaped its fellow emirate, Dubai. By contrast, Doha's vision seemed a more calculated attempt to find a balance between modernization and Islam.
But in both cases leaders also see their construction sprees as part of sweeping efforts to retool their societies for a post-Sept. 11, post-oil world. Their goal is not only to build a more positive image of the Middle East at a time when anti-Islamic sentiment continues to build across Europe and the United States, but also to create a kind of latter-day Silk Road, one on which their countries are powerful cultural and economic hinges between the West and rising powers like India and China.
And they are betting that they can do this without alienating significant parts of the Arab world, which may see in these undertakings the same kind of Western-oriented cosmopolitanism that flourished in places like Cairo and Tehran not so long ago, and that helped fuel the rise of militant fundamentalism.
Building a New Narrative
A little over a half-century ago Abu Dhabi was a Bedouin village with no literary or scientific traditions to speak of, no urban history. Its few thousand inhabitants, mostly poor and illiterate, survived largely on animal herding, fishing and pearl diving.
After oil production began here in the 1960s, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, who founded the country by bringing several emirates together under Abu Dhabi's leadership in the early 1970s, made deals with Western oil companies that financed the area's first paved roads, hospitals and schools. The emirates became a kind of Switzerland of the Middle East, a haven of calm and prosperity surrounded by big, aggressive neighbors, Iran and Iraq to the north and Saudi Arabia to the west.
But by the time Sheik Zayed's descendants began coming to power in the 1990s, that low-key approach felt out of date. Globalism was the catchword of the moment, and the construction boom in neighboring Dubai was demonstrating, despite its later bust, how completely a city could transform itself in just a few years.
As important, reliance on economic ties with the West began to seem imprudent after Sept. 11, as Western governments scrutinized all sorts of Arab financial dealings with increasing intensity, and even travel to the West became a sometimes degrading experience for Arabs.
In 2005 Sheikh Zayed's son and heir, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, approached Thomas Krens, who was the director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York, with the idea of creating a new branch of the Guggenheim Museum -- a Middle Eastern version of what Mr. Krens and Mr. Gehry had accomplished a decade earlier in Bilbao, Spain. But the sheik's ambitions were never so small: within a few years the proposed site of the project, Saadiyat Island, a 10-square-mile development zone just north of Abu Dhabi's urban center, was being planned as a miniature city built around culture and leisure, with some of the most recognizable names from the creative world.
Abu Dhabi's blockbuster deal with the Louvre was signed in 2007; another deal, with the British Museum, to design exhibitions for Foster & Partners' Zayed National Museum, was signed two years later. The maritime museum by Mr. Ando and a performing arts center by Zaha Hadid are still being planned. These cultural megaprojects will be joined by a campus of New York University on Saadiyat Island's southern shore and, in a location to be determined, a four-million-square-foot development for media companies and film studios meant partly to provide job training and opportunities for young Emiratis.
Sheik Khalifa and his government want all this to instill national pride in a new generation of Emiratis while providing citizens with tools, both intellectual and psychological, for living in a global society. The idea, several people told me on a recent visit, is to tell a new story, one that breaks with a long history of regional decline, including the recent upheavals caused by militant fundamentalism, and to re-establish a semblance of cultural parity with the West.
''There are religious extremists everywhere in the Middle East -- even here,'' said an Arab consultant who has worked on several developments and spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired. The sheik, this person said, believes the cosmopolitan influences of the projects may help ''open up the minds of these younger Emiratis before they go down that road.''
Of all the projects, the Louvre outpost seems the most natural fit with Abu Dhabi's globalist aspirations. On top of a generous construction budget, the government is paying France $1.3 billion, mainly to establish an art-borrowing agreement that will ensure that it gets the pick of the Louvre's encyclopedic collections, as well as art from several other museums. The range and depth of those collections will allow the Louvre Abu Dhabi, which is being marketed as a ''universal museum,'' to show off the cultural achievements of civilizations from every corner of the world.
And Mr. Nouvel's design for this museum -- a maze of gallery buildings and canals, all covered by a huge stainless-steel dome -- is a wonderfully romantic evocation of a Middle East at ease with technology. Sunlight will penetrate its perforated skin, creating hundreds of beams that recall the interiors of great mosques, or even the filtering of light through the tree canopies in an oasis. Tucked under the dome, the galleries and their watery setting refer to Venice -- an emblem, Mr. Nouvel has said, of the fertile cultural crosscurrents that once existed between East and West.
Globalism or Colonialism?
But while the Louvre will be able to draw on thousands of years of shifting cultural influences, the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, which is focused on 1965 to the present, a period culturally dominated by the West, reveals the problems that arise when the political message you are trying to send collides with historical reality.
Mr. Krens envisioned a ''global museum'' that nonetheless seemed to acknowledge the primacy of Western contemporary art. The museum -- from the outside, a chaotic pileup of translucent cones and gigantic children's building blocks -- was organized around a cluster of first-floor galleries representing key movements in Europe and the United States. Islamic collections would be housed two floors above, while warehouselike galleries would radiate out from the core, each devoted to a different region -- the Far East, India, Africa. The plan's Western bent didn't fly for the clients, or for Richard Armstrong, who replaced Mr. Krens as the director of the Guggenheim Foundation in 2008.
Nine months ago Mr. Armstrong began developing an alternative plan, in which artists from all over the world would be grouped together in theme galleries: abstract art, Pop Art, performance art and so on. Even in this scheme, however, Mr. Armstrong admits that galleries will end up being organized around major anchor pieces that are, by and large, by blue-chip Western artists like Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Anselm Kiefer.
The Guggenheim Abu Dhabi has a team of three curators working in New York to build a collection with a budget of up to $600 million, more than 200 times the annual acquisitions budget of the Guggenheim in Manhattan. But they need to be done in time for the museum's opening in just three years -- a time frame that many people in the museum world regard as absurdly short.
Similar issues arose with the plan for the Zayed National Museum, the institution that most directly speaks to the country's identity. The museum was intended to explore the United Arab Emirates' relatively sparse historical record through the life of Sheik Zayed, a man known for his humility, who died in 2004. Yet after Norman Foster presented his initial design proposal, in 2007, he was told that the country's leadership wanted something grander, even though there was still no clear idea of what, exactly, would go inside.
Mr. Foster was sent back to the drawing board, and a team of curators from the British Museum worked out an exhibition program. The new design features an enormous landscaped mound capped by five featherlike wind towers -- the tallest one rising 300 feet -- an attempt to evoke falconry, a favorite pastime of Arab royals.
That the collections of both the Guggenheim and the National Museum are being planned in the West raises a larger issue: while the money for all these developments comes from Emirati oil, the projects themselves are being shaped almost exclusively by foreigners. Abu Dhabi has become a revolving door of museum directors, architects, curators and other high-level consultants, and the hectic pace at which their plans are being pushed through has contributed to a sense among some here that what is being touted as a societywide embrace of global culture will end up being just another example of cultural colonialism.
The Media Zone will have a similarly strong international flavor. The government hopes that its mix of corporate offices and production studios will attract foreign news companies, as well as Bollywood studios. And an early design -- clusters of sleekly contoured towers set atop six superblocks -- involved a whole cast of celebrated Western architects, including Bernard Tschumi, Diller Scofidio & Renfro and UNStudio.
Just east of the city's museum district, workers have broken ground on a 27-acre New York University campus, vaguely Beaux-Arts in plan, where classes will be taught in English and where there will be no quotas ensuring that Emiratis or other Arabs are given a significant number of places.
Insiders and Outsiders
The Arab world has been down a similar road. An earlier wave of Western consultants -- businessmen, foreign service types, engineers and architects -- poured into the Middle East in the 1950s and '60s, selling a cold war brand of modernity that would uplift Arab societies, in particular by fostering a thriving middle class. In practice the changes often simply reinforced divisions between a privileged elite -- modern, educated, in tune with the West -- and a struggling underclass, something that was not a small factor in the rise of fundamentalist violence.
No one would claim that a country as small and rich as the United Arab Emirates has the same combustible mix of social problems as, say, Egypt or Iran, but there are obvious echoes when you consider whom these cultural megaprojects will probably serve.
The new museums will be embedded in a kind of suburban opulence that can be found all over the Middle East, but rarely in such isolation and on such an expansive scale as in Abu Dhabi. The concrete frames of a new St. Regis hotel and resort and a Park Hyatt are rising just down the coast from the museum district, along Saadiyat Beach. Nearby, a 2,000-home walled community is going up along an 18-hole golf course designed by Gary Player, to be joined eventually by several more luxury residential developments and two marinas for hundreds of yachts. A tram will loop around Saadiyat, connecting these developments to the museums.
As telling, in its way, is the Workers' Village that I was taken to see during a tour of the island. The camp, still under construction, is expected to house 40,000 foreigners brought in to build this paradise.
It is neatly divided into three-story prefabricated housing blocks, which are interspersed with pretty courtyards. A two-story structure, just off one of the courtyards, serves as a communal hall, with dining on the ground floor and a library upstairs with books arranged by language: Arabic, Hindi, Nepalese, Tamil, Malaysian. The same languages blare from TV rooms off a balcony.
In some sense this village embodies a version of the cosmopolitanism Abu Dhabi says it is trying to create. But even if it is completed as planned, it will house only a small fraction of the city's hundreds of thousands of migrant laborers; the rest will presumably live in cramped quarters in the city's industrial sector or in faraway desert encampments. And once the museums are completed, a spokesman for the government development agency told me, it will be bulldozed to make room for more hotels and luxury housing.
Arabic Tradition in Qatar
Doha, like Abu Dhabi, was built from a small trading village into a city of about a million in the last 50 years. But both the museums being built around Doha and the art and artifacts to which they are dedicated -- private collections amassed over decades by members of the ruling family -- reflect a more patient, gradual approach to culture building than that of Abu Dhabi, and one that looks less to the West. If the cultural identities that both cities are trying to create are to some extent fictions, Doha's is one woven largely of the cosmopolitan traditions of the region -- that is, of places like Damascus, Istanbul and Cairo.
The three major Qatari national collections were assembled by the emir's cousins Sheik Hassan al-Thani and Sheik Saud al-Thani, who began collecting in the 1980s, when art was still viewed as dubious, even unmanly, among the country's elites.
''If I talked about modern art, no one understood me,'' Sheik Hassan told me when we met in Doha. ''It was impossible to even start this conversation.''
In the 1990s a new emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, began to liberalize many institutions and to open the door cautiously to the outside world. In 1995 he announced plans for Education City: a sprawling campus whose programs are now run by American universities like Texas A&M and Georgetown, but with agreements to ensure that a large proportion of its students are Qatari nationals. A year later he established the news network Al Jazeera.
The museum projects were also part of this liberalization effort. After Sheik Saud agreed to donate his collection of Islamic art to the state, Sheik Hamad hired Mr. Pei to design a building for it. When the resulting Museum of Islamic Art opened, it was celebrated as a successful Modernist interpretation of Islamic precedents, from the ablution fountain of the Ibn Tulun mosque in Cairo to old Islamic fortresses in North Africa. Its monumental forms express Mr. Pei's ideal of a world in which modernity and tradition exist in perfect balance.
As striking as Mr. Pei's architecture, however, was the obvious subtext of the collection, whose treasures range from Iraqi ceramics to Spanish silk curtains and Indian jewelry. If these pieces were assembled with an eye to exploring the richness of Islamic art -- and the historic reach of Islam -- their presentation was also a way to emphasize the cultural crosscurrents that produced them. The message, directed at both local and foreign audiences, is that much of what is great in Western, Eastern and Middle Eastern traditions is based on their connections to one another.
''My father often says, in order to have peace, we need to first respect each other's cultures,'' said Sheika al-Mayassa Bint Hamad Al Thani, the emir's 28-year-old daughter and the main force behind the museum building program in Qatar. ''And people in the West don't understand the Middle East. They come with bin Laden in their heads.''
The museums, she hopes, will help ''to change that mind-set.''
The newer national collections, parts of which will be unveiled to the public over the next few months, will take that idea into more provocative territory. The Orientalism collection in particular seems like an improbable focus for a museum in the Arab world. The collection, displayed in a town house until its new home is completed, centers on depictions of Arab life by 19th-century French and English artists. In one room a caricature of a squatting North African warrior hangs near a painting of Algerian women performing a seductive dance. There are also portraits of sultans and pashas by Italian artists, extending back to the 16th century, when the cultural scales were tipping away from the Ottoman Empire and toward Renaissance Europe.
To a Westerner, the 19th-century paintings can be especially uncomfortable -- they present what now seem cliches of Arab life that reflect back our own prejudices. But to many Arabs they are also vividly detailed historical records of a period that is otherwise undocumented. Realistic painting did not exist then in the Arab world; photography was not common until the late 19th century. As Sheik Hassan saw it when he was building the collection, these were the only records of a life that was fast fading from memory.
''I recognize this life,'' Sheik Hassan said. ''The sheik sitting in his tent, I know these costumes are 100 percent right -- even the tint of the button. The hare, it is from North Africa.''
The paintings are not simply relics of cultural imperialism, he added. ''You should think of all of this as part of a cultural movement, an exchange of ideas.''
Still, by shining a light into the darker corners of Arab history, as well as at its ancient glories, the Orientalist museum suggests an understanding -- rare anywhere -- that the foundations of any healthy culture must be built on an unflinching appraisal of the past. Rather than airbrush that past, the government intends to put it up to public scrutiny.
A similar impulse is shaping Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art, which will open in a temporary home at the end of December. When I first visited the collection, which was still in storage, I felt the weight of the West's cultural influence in frequent derivative references to artists like Picasso. Just as many works, however, were inspired expressions of the artist's struggle to come to terms with that influence without losing touch with his or her own identity.
Piecing together the fragments of that 20th-century history and linking them to present-day Qatar will be one of the museum's core missions, said Wassan al-Khudhairi, its Iraqi-born director, as she gave a tour of the rooms. ''Baghdad, Cairo, Beirut, North Africa, Syria, Jordan,'' she said. ''This is the culture.''
Not that Doha is overlooking its own less glamorous past. In contrast to Mr. Foster's evocation of the sport of Arabian kings in Abu Dhabi's National Museum, Mr. Nouvel's design for the Qatar National Museum draws on the forms of local sand roses: tiny pink encrustations buried just under the desert's surface. The building will be composed of clusters of concrete discs that seem to have tumbled across the site, gently encircling a palm-shaded courtyard. Inside, displays of tents, fabrics, saddles and other objects, as well as enormous video screens that will immerse the visitor in the experience of the desert, are meant to convey both the humble origins of Qatar's royal family and the nobility of Bedouin life.
Like all of Doha's new cultural buildings, the National Museum is being carefully integrated into the city, rather than set apart in a special zone. It will be built within the boundaries of the original settlement, now the city's center, on the site of an early-20th-century palace of a former emir. Mr. Pei's Museum of Islamic Art, though on a man-made island, stands just off the corniche, not far from the old souks. The government is considering several downtown sites for the permanent home of Mathaf.
Radical Social Transformation
Doha's methodical approach to culture building is echoed in an even broader plan to re-engineer the demographics of the city, according to Stan Wypych, an Australian consultant for the city's planning authority. The population of Doha is expected to grow to 2.3 million by 2032. By then, with the current construction boom over, the bulk of its 700,000 laborers, mostly from South and Southeast Asia, will have gone home, replaced, the government hopes, with the kind of educated, white-collar workers whom it sees as the future of the new society.
Some of these new professionals would be housed in places like Lusail City, a 14-square-mile district of apartment towers, villas and marinas under construction at the city's edge. Other developments, designed with more traditional courtyards and within walking distance of mosques or plazas, are being marketed to Arabs, including Qataris who fled the city to suburban villas decades ago, as part of an effort to entice them to the historic city center. The idea is to integrate the new expatriates without sacrificing Doha's Arab character.
''The social transformation is pretty radical,'' Mr. Wypych said. ''It's happening pretty fast.''
As comprehensive as this vision seems, however, questions still linger, as in Abu Dhabi, about whom it will speak to. Few fundamentalists are likely to distinguish between one approach to modernization and another. Even many educated Arabs in and outside Qatar -- among the museums' target audience -- see a disturbing inconsistency in these grand plans.
''Some have lived here 50 years,'' said Fares Braizat, a Jordanian professor at Qatar University who has been working on a census of foreign nationals. ''They speak Arabic with a Qatari dialect, but they are still not allowed Qatari citizenship'' or any of the enviable perks that go with it: free education and health care, interest-free government loans, preference in hiring, a sense of equality.
Mr. Braizat's point zeroes in on what could turn out to be the great flaw in the plans of both cities. Leaders are investing enormous amounts in these projects, and they are likely to leave behind some extraordinary buildings and institutions. But if they can't get over that final hurdle and persuade enough people that they have a shared stake in this future, they will never realize their most ambitious goals. Worse, they may end up reinforcing the cynicism about engagement with the West that brought down Western-style modernism in this part of the world decades ago.

NEW HAVEN
THE moment the side panel of the Cheese Truck opens, Daksha Rajagopalan is there. Though it's barely 11 in the morning, this third-year Yale student orders grilled cheese ''with roasted reds -- that's peppers -- and grilled onions,'' and then patiently waits while Jeff Weaver gets the griddle going with the first batch of what could be a couple of hundred grilled cheese sandwiches before the afternoon is out.
''It reminds me of that scene in 'Ratatouille,' you know that Disney movie,'' said Ms. Rajagopalan, who grew up in Singapore, where grilled cheese was not a part of life. ''He eats that smoked mushroom and then he eats that cheese and there's like this big explosion of color and whirl in his head. That's what I like about the grilled cheese.'' 
The Cheese Truck (a mobile offshoot of Caseus, a New Haven cheese shop and bistro) and Cheeseboy's Grilled Cheese to Go in the Connecticut Post Mall in nearby Milford seem to be riding the cusp of a new minitrend in the New Haven area: grilled cheese on the run. ''Crispy melty,'' Mr. Weaver said in a how-can-you-not-know-that tone. ''That's it. Everybody loves it.''
For decades, grilled cheese has been the purview of desperate parents, poor college students, kiddie menu frequenters and the kitchen-challenged, taking the form of less-than-natural cheese melted between cheap, additive-laced bread. It's had a recent star turn with pricey, gourmet versions served at upscale eateries -- including Caseus, whose menu includes a $12 thick-slabbed monster. But there's only a handful of street- or fast-food grilled cheese enterprises nationwide and almost as many flopped endeavors.
Jason Sobocinski, owner of Caseus, and his brother Tom had been trying to figure out a way to take a down-scaled version of their grilled cheese on the road; what they came up with hit the streets last winter. It had thinner, though still large, locally baked sourdough bread slices, and a vastly diminished price: $5 with $1 apiece for add-ons like tomato, arugula, jambon de Paris, applewood smoked bacon, guacamole and those roasted reds and grilled onions. There's always tomato soup -- hot this time of year, gazpacho in warm weather -- for $3. And there's a daily special -- Monte Cristos; mustard greens and Camembert; beehive cheese and caramelized apple, to name a few. This day it's ''stinky'' cheese and skirt steak.
The truck technique is nearly identical to the restaurant one. Sandwich halves are fried open-faced in generous amounts of Cabot unsalted butter, then topped with six shredded cheeses (Comte, provolone, extra-sharp Vermont cheddar, gruyere, raclette, two-year aged Gouda), plus a seventh from whatever's left over in the shop, except blue-veined cheeses -- consistent inconsistency, Mr. Sobocinski calls it.
In the restaurant, the halves get their final melt in the oven before they're slapped together. In the truck, which has a full mobile kitchen, but no oven, it's all done on the griddle, with the add-ins last. All orders come with Roland brand whole-grain Dijon mustard and cornichons.
By 1 p.m. on this chilly autumn day, the line along a side street on the Yale campus numbers more than a dozen, with another half-dozen or so waiting for orders.
''I don't know if it's a comfort thing when it's cold: you get this hot tomato soup and this hot grilled cheese, and it's just wonderful,'' said Charles Gyer, a sophomore at Yale from Louisiana who ordered a classic plain with soup and a Coke (Mexican, in bottles). Pointing to a nearby building, he said, ''I have class every day in that building that lets out at 12:30, and if the truck's here, you can't really pass it up. It's pretty hard to just say no.''
Aside from the daily street rounds, the truck is in demand for catering, from business meetings to weddings. ''What's better than crispy melty?'' Mr. Sobocinski asked, invoking that phrase again, but also admitting that the recession-driven comfort food craze hasn't hurt.
''I definitely didn't invent the grilled cheese, and I certainly didn't invent the rage for grilled cheese,'' he said. ''I think I just keyed in on it and did it at the right time.''
That's what Michael Inwald, a grilled cheese lover and maker since childhood, is counting on with Grilled Cheese to Go. On leave from his M.B.A. studies at Yale to, in his words, ''pursue grilled cheese,'' Mr. Inwald is thinking along a franchised fast-food platform; his second location opened last month in Boston.
His model is also soup and sandwich. Soups change daily, and the most basic sandwich is $2.99. Customers have a choice of four breads and five cheeses, all fresh-sliced as needed, and at least a dozen add-ins, including bacon, turkey and pepperoni at 99 cents each, or basil, tomato, pickles and jalapeno at 49 cents each. The sandwiches are cooked in butter on a flat panini-style press.
''Grilled cheese is the epitome of comfort food,'' Mr. Inwald said, citing a statistic that Americans eat 2.2 billion grilled cheese sandwiches a year. ''It's when you want something that's not too heavy, tastes great, reminds you of childhood.''
And that reminder can come anytime if the Saturday New Haven Farmers' Market is any indication. The Cheese Truck can count on takers there when it opens at 9 a.m. On a recent Saturday, it was pushing 11 when Paul Berry, a professor of music history and Cheese Truck regular, ordered the day's special, grilled cheese with brisket. ''It's just good food,'' he said.
The Cheese Truck is at the Saturday farmers' market in New Haven from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. (check cityseed.org for the market's winter hours). From 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, the truck follows a more-or-less regular route through New Haven. Check its Twitter feed and Web site (thecheesetruck.com) for times and locations.

HEADLINE: Compromising, but Carrying On

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
EVEN though the market remains troubled and financing is as elusive for projects as for individual mortgages, at least two residential developers in Westchester are forging ahead, despite the compromises being forced on them by the economy.
In Port Chester, Frank Boccanfuso, the managing partner of FMB Asset Management and Phoenix Capital Partners, has broken ground on two luxury projects on sites near the Byram River. And in Yonkers, Fleet Mill Street -- an offshoot of SFC, the company planning the massive redevelopment of the Yonkers downtown -- will rehabilitate a vacant building in the densely populated Getty Square area near the Hudson River.
In both instances one basic compromise has involved relying on either their own sources of capital or government grants to get their projects under way. Another has required giving up on the idea of selling units in favor of rentals -- since that sector of the housing market, according to property management groups, continues to be strong. 
''Everyone's nervous these days when it comes to the for-sale market,'' said Terry Danner, the president of Riverstone Residential Group of Dallas, a property management advisory group that manages 650 complexes throughout the country. ''We're seeing lots of companies not willing or able to sit with empty units,'' Mr. Danner added, ''so they're running with rentals for now with the possibility of converting to for-sale units at a future date.''
Mr. Boccanfuso is using his own capital for the $40 million Port Chester project. He acquired the land several years ago with the idea of building condominiums, ''but the market changed,'' he said. ''Last year I didn't plan anything at all because there was just too much uncertainty in the market. This year it seems safe to move ahead but with a different approach than I had in mind at first.''
Fleet Mill Street's project in Yonkers will repurpose a three-story structure that had been the home of the Yonkers Public Library, and before that, in the early part of the 20th century, a popular department store.
The new mixed-use plan calls for up to 16 live-work rental lofts on the two upper floors and 8,000 square feet of retail space at street level. Fleet Mill Street is seeking to attract young professionals like accountants and architects to the studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments, which it plans to rent for as much as $1,700 per month.
''For so long we were focusing only on the big projects, the grand-slam home runs like our Trump buildings and the Ritz-Carlton,'' said Joseph V. Apicella, a senior vice president of Cappelli Enterprises in Valhalla, which is a partner in SFC with Fidelco Realty Group of Millburn, N.J.
Before the recession, Cappelli Enterprises built two Trump residential towers with for-sale units, one in White Plains and another in New Rochelle. The firm changed the face of White Plains with the construction of several residential and retail buildings, and of New Rochelle with New Roc City, a $190 million entertainment center, hotel and apartment complex. But it has put most of its coming projects on hold.
''This project isn't a home run in terms of what we've done in the past,'' Mr. Apicella said of the Yonkers library conversion, ''but it's definitely a single or double, and in this economy that's pretty good.'' Not only is it difficult for buyers to obtain mortgages, he said, but also ''it's extremely difficult for developers like us to obtain financing for large-scale projects.''
Toward that end, the Yonkers Community Development Agency has designated the Fleet Mill Street group as a qualified developer for the reconstruction project, which makes it eligible for a $5.4 million Restore New York grant from the Empire State Development Corporation -- a program to help old cities rebuild.
Philip A. Amicone, the mayor, said he saw the library project as a good interim step for Yonkers, given that the more ambitious ones planned earlier cannot be taken in this environment. ''It's still a bad market out there,'' Mr. Amicone said. But he said that it is an ''encouraging sign'' that smaller projects like this are being pursued while the city waits for SFC to move ahead with its larger projects.
The two sites that Mr. Boccanfuso acquired in Port Chester, each 1.5 acres in size, required differing levels of preparation before his rental projects could proceed. One site directly on the Byram River waterfront used to be a brownfield; he bought it for $5.5 million and spent an additional $2 million to remove industrial fill, metals and petroleum. The building under construction on the site, called the Mariner, will have 100 rental units and 25 boat slips. The one- and two-bedroom apartments will rent from $1,800 to $2,900 a month.
Mr. Boccanfuso paid $6 million to acquire the other site and has just finished demolition of the vacant buildings there. The 83 one- and two-bedroom units he plans at the Castle, as he is calling the brick and stone luxury development, will rent from $1,600 to $2,600 a month. He said he thought units would rent quickly because few if any other rental properties are coming on line now in the Greenwich-Rye-Purchase market.
Mr. Boccanfuso said he had watched the market weather ups and downs since starting FMB Real Estate Services as a corporate real estate consulting and brokerage company in 1990, and Phoenix Capital Partners for investments in 1999. There are often a few areas of demand that a developer can capitalize on even in hard times, he said.
''My research and experience indicates that there is a market now for urban pockets of relatively affordable new construction outside the city that are also near transportation and shopping,'' he said. ''The added bonus is that my units are also near a body of water.''

HEADLINE: That 2 BR Frame Of Mind

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
TWO-BEDROOM apartments have long been the workhorse of the New York City real estate market, accounting year after year for the largest percentage of apartments sold.
When the recession hit, buyers fled the market and prices fell across the board. After things stabilized in late 2009, the market share for two-bedrooms had dropped from a typical 40 percent to as low as 25 percent, because more people had found that they could afford three-bedrooms, which took sales away from two-bedrooms.
Now, after a lull that has lasted for more than a year, two-bedrooms are back.
The market share for two-bedrooms first dipped under 30 percent in early 2009, with smaller and larger apartments gobbling up more of the sales, according to data compiled by Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a market analyst for Prudential Douglas Elliman. But in recent months, that percentage has climbed back up to 39 percent. 
''We're finally in a period where we're not dealing with abnormalities with an unusually excessive amount of entry-level or large apartments selling,'' Mr. Miller said. ''We're moving toward a more balanced and more normal market.''
The median price for two-bedrooms seems to have stabilized. The median in Manhattan dropped 20 percent, from a high of $1.6 million, in 2008, to $1.272 million in 2009, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman data. It has since inched back to $1.3 million.
Interest in two-bedrooms definitely took a dive last year, said Diana Chung, an agent with Mark David & Company. After the recession hit, ''the first people to get back in the market were people who were priced out earlier,'' she said, ''and a lot of them were first-time buyers.'' These buyers often start with studios or one-bedrooms. ''Then you saw people trading up from cramped spaces, because three-bedrooms that might have been unattainable when the market was hot were suddenly affordable.''
As a result, Ms. Chung said, ''two-bedrooms were almost a no man's land.''
Last year, ''even the lookers we had weren't serious,'' she said. They tended to come to open houses on their own, never to be heard from again. But in recent months, she noted, most people are coming with brokers, usually a sign that they want to do more than just look.
Listings at nytimes.com also suggest that activity is up, with total inventory for two-bedrooms dropping from close to 3,000 in September 2009 to about 2,400 last month. The median listing price for two-bedrooms in Manhattan last month was $1.299 million, where it has hovered for most of the year.
Median prices vary significantly from neighborhood to neighborhood, though, ranging from as low as $399,000, in the Sugar Hill section of Harlem, to $3 million in SoHo. Median prices for apartments of all sizes and in all neighborhoods can be found at nytimes.com.
Ms. Chung has a two-bedroom three-bath listing at 20 West 72nd Street for $1.295 million, priced right at the median for the Upper West Side. The apartment was created by combining a two-bedroom with a studio, and Ms. Chung originally marketed it for $1.45 million as a potential three-bedroom because a third bedroom could easily be carved out of the oversize living room.
But many of the people who have come to see the apartment have liked the expansive city views from the living room's four south-facing windows, and Ms. Chung acknowledged that creating a third bedroom would make the living room a much less interesting space. So her client, who uses the place as a pied-a-terre, agreed to lower the price and to market the apartment as a two-bedroom.
Ms. Chung said most potential buyers for the apartment had been young couples who either have one child or are planning on starting a family. She has also fielded inquiries from couples whose children are grown and who are downsizing.
The profile of people hunting for two-bedrooms appears to vary slightly by neighborhood.
Buyers looking below 96th Street in Manhattan often branch out to areas like Harlem and Brooklyn Heights, both neighborhoods that attract young couples planning to expand their families.
Vicki Negron, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group, has a two-bedroom listed for $815,000 at 76 Remsen Street in Brooklyn Heights, where the median listing price is $820,000. The apartment has a dining room and a balcony that overlooks brownstone gardens.
Open-house traffic for two-bedrooms started to pick up about eight months ago, Ms. Negron said, and many of the interested buyers are young couples from Manhattan with no children.
Couples who already have one or two children seem to be asking for three-bedroom apartments, ''because the larger apartments are no longer out of reach for many young couples,'' she said.
Tony Von Meyers, a senior vice president of Halstead Property, has a $399,000 two-bedroom listing at 330 West 145th Street, which borders on Sugar Hill and Hamilton Heights. At the height of the market, many of the potential buyers might have trained their sights on a one-bedroom, Mr. Von Meyers said. ''But at these prices now, we're getting people who are looking in anticipation of life changes and eventually needing more space.''
The apartment, which has floor-to-ceiling windows and views of Jackie Robinson Park, went on the market in late July at $435,000, but was reduced last month to $399,000, the median price for Sugar Hill. It is in a building that went up in 2003 with city subsidies, and consequently has a household income limit of $192,000. Mr. Von Meyers and his partner, Neil Tilbury, said the price reflected the limits set by the income restriction.
Many of the people looking in Harlem are from the Upper West Side. ''The No. 1 question we get is: Am I getting the best value for my money?'' Mr. Von Meyers said.
Brokers say that buyers in the current market are often reluctant to act quickly. ''People are very slow to make decisions,'' Mr. Tilbury said. ''They're bringing a lot more people back with them to have a second, third or fourth look.'' That means involving ''parents, friends, lovers, even Aunt Sally,'' Mr. Von Meyers said.
Elizabeth Howng and Jim Connors, clients of Mr. Von Meyers, are first-time buyers who had been living on the Upper West Side. They started their search at the beginning of the year and finally bought and moved into a new two-bedroom condo in Harlem last month.
''With prices and mortgage rates where they are,'' Mr. Connors said, ''we felt it was time to do something.'' They focused on two-bedrooms, Ms. Howng said, ''because we lived in a small one-bedroom rental, and if we were going to go to the trouble of moving and putting down our life savings, why bother buying a one-bedroom?''
Had the market been stronger, though, they might easily have been priced out, they said. With a budget of $800,000 and a requirement that their home also have outdoor space, they found their choices limited.
Mr. Connors said that while the open houses they visited had seemed busy enough throughout the year, a heightened urgency seemed to take hold over the summer. They made an offer on an apartment in early July and were in negotiations with the sponsor when another buyer swooped in with a full-price offer.
''That might have been a one-off experience,'' Mr. Connors said. ''But that's when we realized we couldn't sit back, make a low offer, and wait for the market to come to us.''
Despite the one that got away, they're both very happy in their new home. ''I think we made the right decision,'' Ms. Howng said.
In the East Village, where the median listing price for two-bedrooms is $895,000, Tamara Marotta, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said she had seen a jump in buyer interest in the last two months.
Ms. Marotta has a $895,000 listing at 265 East Seventh Street that has been on the market since April, and she said that recent activity ''is almost at the level when we first put it on in the spring, and people seem to be serious and on a mission.'' The apartment is a floor-through in a walk-up building, and it has two bedrooms, a large dining room, an interior office and an eat-in kitchen with windows. The woodwork in several of the rooms has been refinished, revealing lovely original details, but the kitchen, bathroom and master bedroom need a fair amount of work. In the spring, people seemed reluctant to take on any kind of project, but Ms. Marotta thinks the climate may be different now.
Many of the house-hunters who have come through already live in the East Village, ''and they're making the next jump for them because they have a baby, but they want to stay in the East Village and maintain the lifestyle.''
At the high end, Nic Bottero, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, said buyer interest in two-bedrooms priced well over $1 million also seemed to have spiked recently. He has helped sell three two-bedrooms at 17 Cornelia Street, a condominium in Greenwich Village, in the last three months, all of them close to asking prices. Mr. Bottero has a $2.875 million listing for a two-bedroom at 505 Greenwich Street in SoHo with Erin Boisson Aries, a senior vice president of Brown Harris. A penthouse, it has two bathrooms and a large terrace with open city views to the north, south and east.
Potential buyers have included people looking for a pied-a-terre with space for entertaining indoors and out, and young couples who plan on starting a family, but only after enjoying their downtown address for a while. The current sellers fit that profile perfectly when they became the first owners of the condo five years ago. At the time, they had no children and used the second bedroom as a study and guest room. They have since had two children, and the second bedroom functions as both a study and a bedroom for the older one.
''Last year was very different, because buyers were so scared,'' Mr. Bottero said. ''But now there's not a lot of inventory, and if something is priced well and you're not being disrespectful by asking an outlandish price, it's going to sell.''

SHOCK OF GRAY
The Aging of the World's Population and How It Pits Young Against Old, Child Against Parent, Worker Against Boss, Company Against Rival, and Nation Against Nation
By Ted C. Fishman
401 pp. Scribner. $27.50
Three of the four people who care for my 94-year-old grandfather in his home near Washington were born outside America. None migrated to the United States to do this kind of work. But all remain, and earn a decent living, thanks to senior citizens like my bionic Pop-Pop, a retired doctor powered by a pacemaker and a defibrillator. 
I thought of my grandfather often as I read Ted C. Fishman's ''Shock of Gray,'' because his circumstances illustrate one of the book's central arguments: aging accelerates globalization. As science allows us to live longer and we choose to have fewer children, we will increasingly rely on the more affordable labor of foreigners.
If Fishman's point seems empirically obvious, the observations he makes about it are far-reaching and highly relevant to the current debate about the American economy. ''Shock of Gray'' grew out of the research for Fishman's first book, ''China, Inc.: How the Rise of the Next Superpower Challenges America and the World,'' and the two books share a fast pace, global scope and jaw-dropping facts.
By 2025, there will be 66 million Americans above the age of 65. Over the next four decades, the number of centenarians around the world will increase sevenfold, from 450,000 today to 3.2 million in 2050. Today, 5 percent of the population of Ecuador lives in Spain, in part to care for that country's elderly. In short, demographic shifts are already reshaping the global economy.
These are not distant phenomena. Among the changes to Social Security under consideration by a White House panel is an increase in the retirement age. Nearly one in five Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 were unemployed in July, the highest rate since statistics began to be collected in 1948. The French government's recent attempt to raise the legal minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 drew more than a million protesters to the streets there in September.
Demographic shifts are already affecting economies in Asia, home to one of the world's most rapidly aging populations (Japan) and its largest (China). Fishman makes a whistle-stop tour of the issues in both countries. Chinese and Japanese birth rates have fallen dramatically since the 1970s, creating what is known in China as the 4-2-1 problem (four grandparents, two parents, one child).
While that inverted pyramid inarguably helped drive China's extraordinary growth over the last three decades, it will become increasingly burdensome as the elderly population balloons and labor becomes more scarce. In the 10 years ending in 2015, the number of Chinese over 60 will double from 100 million to 200 million. By 2025, as Fishman says, ''China will be home to one-fifth of the world's population, but home to one-fourth of all people over 65.'' The challenge China faces, he argues, is to get as rich as possible before the country's seniors become a drag on growth.
From Japan, Fishman writes a gloomy postcard on the consequences of low birth rates and the world's longest life expectancy -- an extreme version of what is happening elsewhere in Asia, Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States. In Japan, universities are closing for lack of students, and a third of suicides are by the elderly. But the government has made little attempt to substantially increase the number of immigrants, who officially represent just 1 percent of the work force.
The book's liveliest material comes from closer to Fishman's Chicago home, from Rockford, Ill., an industrial town once known as ''the screw capital of the world.'' It is in Rockford that Fishman illustrates another of his central arguments: aging populations and globalization make it easier for companies to engage in ''age arbitrage,'' trading in their old employees for a younger, cheaper work force elsewhere.
''Age arbitrage is now an essential strategy for businesses trying to compete in the global economy,'' Fishman writes. ''If the companies that engineer the magic combination of younger workers and low wages win, management will continue to look for ways to jettison older, higher-wage workers.''
As shown by the recent rise in boomerangers -- Americans who move back in with their parents -- age arbitrage affects workers both young and old. If youth unemployment cannot be lowered, it could rob the United States of the benefits of having a relatively young labor force, Fishman argues.
Fishman has a keen ear for witticisms (he describes Sarasota, Fla., as ''a kind of Silicon Valley for aging services''; Spain in the year 2050, when it will have a higher proportion of people over 65 than any other nation, will be ''a country that is literally handicapped'') that helps him keep an otherwise wonky subject vital. And he motors enjoyably through a huge quantity of data and anecdotes, sending out provocative flares along the way.
But the book lays out problems without offering much in the way of solutions. Not everyone will be lucky enough to afford a staff of four to provide personal care. How will the less fortunate, not only those who were victims of ''age arbitrage'' but also those in developing countries, cope? Fishman doesn't say.

HEADLINE: Is the Fed's Plan Working? Look Abroad

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HOW will you know whether the Federal Reserve's plan to reinvigorate the economy by buying Treasury debt is working?
Simple: Look at how foreign stocks are behaving. Based on their performance last week, the Fed could be running into a problem.
Although one goal of the Fed's $600 billion monetary stimulus is to restore confidence in domestic stocks -- in the hope of bolstering consumer confidence and spending here at home -- the real canary in the coal mine for the central bank's plan is the performance of overseas equities. 
Why? Market strategists say they believe that the Fed's effort, its second foray into quantitative easing, known as QE2, will have several consequences, some of them apparently unintended. For starters, by keeping market interest rates low through buying intermediate-term Treasuries, the Fed hopes to prompt risk-taking among investors.
But risk-taking doesn't stop at America's shores, and since anticipation of QE2 began building, investors have bid up risky emerging-market stocks more than domestic equities. Since Aug. 31, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Index has surged more than 13 percent. That strong rally is a sign that the Fed's efforts packed initial punch, because it encouraged investors to take on risk.
Low interest rates also reduce demand for the dollar, though it has been rising quite recently. Over the longer haul, a falling dollar would lower the cost of American goods sold abroad, increasing exports and, ultimately, job creation.
But a declining dollar would also ''encourage U.S.-based investors to favor overseas investments,'' said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. That's because when the dollar sinks against other currencies, investors who put money to work abroad can profit on the currency exchange.
Since Aug. 31, the MSCI EAFE index of foreign stocks in developed markets has gained 5.9 percent. But despite the dollar's strength in November, the weakening of the currency in September and October nearly doubled those gains: 10.1 percent for Americans investing abroad.
Ultimately, the Fed's goal is to reflate the economy. That means producing inflation, perhaps by accelerating economic activity and setting off greater demand for goods and services. Because many emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are big producers of natural resources, increased consumption in the United States -- and rising prices of commodities -- should provide a nice lift to many stocks in those regions, market strategists say.
''QE2 should help stocks in general, but it will probably help foreign stocks more,'' said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
Until recently, that was clearly the way it looked. Since the markets started pricing in QE2, the trends have generally worked in favor of foreign stocks.
But now comes the first real test. The Fed's stimulus plan has begun to run up against another strong force: tightening monetary policies emerging in China.
Last week, speculation grew that China would raise interest rates further as government figures indicated that overall inflation for Chinese households rose 4.4 percent over the last year while food costs spiked more than 10 percent.
So far, officials in China have discussed imposing price controls, and its central bank has increased reserve requirements for financial institutions, in an effort to curb lending.
The fear is that if China must raise rates, ''people will start to worry about a hard landing in China,'' said Alec Young, international equity strategist at Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services. And because China is such a huge consumer of commodities, that in turn could hurt growth in other emerging markets.
Indeed, since Nov. 9, when the worries about China began to crop up, commodity prices have sunk around 6 percent and emerging-market stocks have been off around 5 percent.
Contributing to fears of another economic speed bump is the fresh round of concern out of Europe, with the talk of a financial bailout of Ireland. And, last week, geopolitical news came back into the financial mix, with North Korea's military strike on a South Korean island.
''It's hard to be pounding the table in positivity with these things in the news,'' Mr. Young said. He added that the rekindling of fear in the global economy recently caused the dollar to strengthen and commodities to fall.
For now, many market strategists are still betting that the Fed's spending can trump the potentially troubling headlines emerging from China and much of the rest of the world.
''You never see the positive news in headlines, like that Sweden is recovering nicely or how healthy Germany's economy is,'' said David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors.
What's more, Mr. Kotok says Chinese officials are well aware that they must balance their policies' effects on their domestic economy and on Western markets, a huge source of demand for Chinese goods and services.
Furthermore, Mr. Kleintop at LPL says he believes China's efforts to combat inflation won't lead to a hard economic landing. Rather, he predicts a ''very modest and targeted'' slowdown that won't negatively affect emerging-market growth or the success of the Fed's plan. Of course, if it does, investors in those foreign equities will be first to notice.

HEADLINE: Pro Hockey Is Taking Its Best Shot In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By STUART MILLER

 BODY:
The New York Aviators, a minor league hockey team based in Brooklyn, lost their first three games of the season on the road. After another long bus ride -- from Chenango, N.Y., to Alexandria Bay near the Canadian border -- they arrived later than expected for a game against the Thousand Island Privateers.
''We barely had time to warm up,'' defenseman David Inman said. ''And then we were losing, 3-0, in the first five minutes.'' 
But that game will be remembered as a turning point if the Aviators end up competing for the trophy in the fledgling Federal Hockey League. They chipped away and tied the score on Matthew Puntureri's goal more than midway through the third period. After a scoreless overtime, Puntureri drove home three shots in a shootout to give the Aviators their first victory. The team reached .500 by winning four of its next six games, including three at home, the Aviator Sports and Events Center at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn.
The Aviators recently became an official rung on the ladder to the N.H.L. The Federal Hockey League is an independent minor league, roughly equivalent to Class A in baseball. The Aviators became an affiliate of the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL, one of only two minor leagues directly connected to the N.H.L. The Nailers are affiliated with the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Montreal Canadiens.
''This is a big step on the long road to legitimacy,'' said Kevin McCabe, the founder and chief executive of the team and its home rink.
Two years ago, the Brooklyn Aces were a member of the four-team Eastern Professional Hockey League, which folded after one season. Last year McCabe founded the Aviators and joined the three-team North East Professional Hockey League, which played a shortened season.
''The quality of play in the F.H.L. is better than I thought it was going to be,'' said Aviators Coach Rob Miller, a Staten Island native who is also the team president.
Unlike some other leagues, the F.H.L. allows teams to import international players; it even has a Canadian team, the first-place Akwesasne Warriors of Ontario.
The floundering economy has helped. Other leagues have gone under, and unemployed college graduates are happy for a chance to play.
''There are a lot of players available who shouldn't be available,'' said Don Kirnan, the F.H.L. commissioner. ''The Thousand Islands Privateers have four former Division I captains.''
The Aviators offer the lure of New York and a steady franchise. Inman, 23, is a Yale graduate who played in Germany last year. His agent heard positive things about the team, and Inman was excited about being near his college friends in New York.
K. C. Timmons, 30, is from British Columbia. Playing full time since age 16, he has traveled to Europe and Australia and has played in the American Hockey League, which is one step from the N.H.L. But tired of living in small towns, he moved to Brooklyn and found the Aviators.
Players earn $200 to $350 per week for the four-month season.
Timmons, who also works in a bar a few nights a week and in a recording studio in the off-season, said: ''I can't say enough about how well they treat us here. It is better than in some of the higher leagues I've played in. We get good sticks and we get paid on time. This is also a nice place to play.''
Being linked to the ECHL should help on several levels. ''It will make everyone work a little harder,'' Miller said, especially young players with potential like Angelo Serse, Inman and Puntureri, who has ECHL experience.
Jim Brooks, co-owner of the Nailers, said his team had sent more than 40 players to the N.H.L. in 18 years. He will call up the Aviators' most talented players and send down players to develop specific areas of their games.
McCabe said the affiliation with the Nailers would not only attract talent, but also inspire Brooklynites playing in the Aviator complex's junior hockey program.
''We learn a lot from watching them,'' said Loren Bluvstein, 17, of Manhattan Beach. ''But we also want to show our support because they give us a lot of help.''
The Aviators have scrimmaged with the junior players, said Eugene Fanesi, 18 of Mill Basin, and some, like Andrew Scampoli, have gone to junior practice to share skating and shooting tips.
Marketing remains the most daunting project for the Aviators. Although they averaged 550 fans for their first two home games, Danbury and Akwesasne drew 1,500 to 2,000. Those teams do not compete with all the other sports and entertainment options in New York. Hoping to raise attendance to 1,000 per game, McCabe has partnered with the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team on cross-promotion and reached out to local school groups and colleges. He said he was considering hiring buses to entice people from Brooklyn and Staten Island neighborhoods who do not want to drive to Aviators games.
Although Brooklynites quickly embraced the high-profile arrival of the Cyclones in 2001, many do not realize that minor league hockey exists in their borough.
''People still sometimes think this is a semipro team,'' McCabe said.
Danny Murphy, from Bath Beach, said that he watched the Aviators regularly last season but that the games were not competitive.
''This is good-quality hockey,'' he said at a recent game. ''These players are hungry.''

HEADLINE: Highfliers

BYLINE: By ROB WALKER

 BODY:
In March 2008, Gulfstream Aerospace, the maker of private jets, announced that it was working on its biggest, fastest and most luxurious model yet: the G650. The list price, $64.5 million, would set an industry benchmark. Given the direction of the global economy since, the timing seems pretty bad. But the private-jet business is unusual. Gulfstream, a division of General Dynamics, has held up fairly well through the Great Recession and recently announced surprisingly strong quarterly sales figures. The G650, meanwhile, made its first flights last year, and even though its F.A.A. certification process will take another year or so, Gulfstream already has contracts to make these planes for about 200 customers, which means that if you'd like to sign up right now, the earliest you would get yours is 2017. 
One reason I find the rapid takeoff of G650 sales intriguing is that it sounds like an imminently expendable expense in a period of economic uncertainty. But it occurs to me that what I'm really reacting to is what a private plane symbolizes (sickening riches) rather than what it is (a designed and engineered object that performs specific functions of great use to its possessor). Like most people, I assume, I've never evaluated a jet as a potential jet-shopper might. So when I learned that Gulfstream completed a version of the tricked-out interior on one of the five G650s it has built so far, I asked if I could have a look. To answer my questions about how such a rarefied and complicated product is developed, Preston Henne, Gulfstream's senior vice president of programs, engineering and test, met me at the company's headquarters near the airport in Savannah, Ga.
Given the money involved, it makes sense that Gulfstream's customer base is fairly small and extremely demanding. In fact, Gulfstream has a ''customer-advisory board,'' a group of about 50 representative clients that it brings together twice a year for feedback and brainstorming sessions that last two and a half days. Membership rotates, and there's a waiting list. In 2004, Henne says, the company asked the group what it wanted in a successor to the flagship G550. A lot; it took almost two years to devise a kind of blueprint. Thus began a project involving 37 Gulfstream departments, plus specialty outside vendors.
Some of the results are intuitive. The G650's cabin is 14 inches wider and 3 inches taller, and the big oval windows (a Gulfstream design signature) are a few inches bigger, too. With new-model engines made by Rolls-Royce, tweaked wing aerodynamics and other changes, the flight time for the 6,900-mile trip from New York to Tokyo is nearly an hour shorter. Its maximum flight speed of Mach .925 is faster than any civilian airplane. Less obvious to me, but apparently of great importance to private-jet consumers, the air pressure in the cabin of a G650 feels like the air pressure at 4,850 feet, even when the plane is cruising at 51,000 feet (zooming over the riffraff of commercial planes and much inclement weather). That's lower than the air pressure on the G550 and way lower than that of a commercial flight, and it matters because the lower the cabin pressure, the more the body has to keep its blood pumping, which is part of what makes air travel physically exhausting.
Henne also had a lot to say about how Gulfstream streamlined its design and production process during the development of the G650, but by now I was ready to see the thing. We rode on a golf cart past a half-dozen recently purchased Gulfstream jets of various sizes to the G650's hangar. Wayne Tsang, cabin-interior project manager for the G650, showed me the microwave, freezer and expanded counter space in the kitchen area; the 12-inch TV screens that fold out from the arm rests of the plush seats, which not only recline to fully horizontal at the touch of a button but also deliver a massage with the touch of another; and the redesigned ''divan'' that converts quickly to a bed. Buyers can choose from a dozen floor plans and a range of color schemes.
I was assured by my hosts that Gulfstream customers aren't looking to loll about in a posh environment for kicks -- the payoff comes in the form of productivity, efficiency and so on. (According to Gulfstream, 72 percent of its customers are businesses, 13 percent are individuals and the rest is a mix of governments and ''fractional'' owners.) If there's a touch of defensiveness in this, it's no doubt because most of us consider the G650 and its ilk in symbolic terms: a thing that greed-head executives fly to Congressional bailout hearings or that supposedly populist politicians flashily eschew. Even Warren Buffett famously named his private jet the Indefensible. And Gulfstream itself doesn't exactly reject the private jet's symbolic weight: ''Ownership is not for everyone,'' brags a promotional piece for the G650. But I get Henne's point: buyers of private jets do not warehouse or display the things; they use them. Makers of and shoppers for all sorts of objects almost always insist that they care about form and function, not symbolism. It may be that for Gulfstream and its customers, this is actually true.
Correction: December 12, 2010, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Consumed column on Nov. 28, about the manufacture of private jets, misstated the degree of air pressure in the cabin of the G650, made by Gulfstream Aerospace. It is higher than that of one of the company's earlier models and also higher than a commercial airplane's, not lower. The column also misstated the effect of cabin pressure on the human body. Lower cabin pressure, not higher, makes it harder for the body to pump blood.

HEADLINE: Economic Fix-Its

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
We are not going to shop our way out of this mess.
It's a cheerless truth about the post-Thanksgiving start of the Christmas season, traditionally the bell lap in America's year-long steeplechase of buying. There has been a rebound in consumption since the grimmest days of the Great Recession, but that has not been joined by an uptick in hiring or a robust expansion.
So the question of our anxious age: What will return our economy to full-throttled life? We're not talking about tactical measures that will ease fears of a double-dip recession, or maintain some upward momentum in the stock market, or even add another 151,000 new jobs, as the economy did in October.
What's needed is a path to sustained growth. That means a strategy for the millions who have lost their jobs in recent years and some hope for the more than 125,000 new entrants to the United States labor market each month. 
Got any ideas?
Many academics do, though fair warning: some of their concepts are a little out there, a reflection, perhaps, of the severity of our problems. Also, canvassing these people is depressing. If you are planning a holiday party and would like a bit of merriment with your tinsel and egg nog, a few of these big thinkers should be left off your list. Several preface their thoughts with brace-yourself sighs and even the ideas that excite them have a pretty grim cast.
''Age and disease will be our next engine of growth,'' says Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School. ''That's the really good news.''
As millions of baby boomers retire, she says, they will segue from their accumulation years into their spend-down years.
''They're going to be spending a lot on health care,'' Professor Ghilarducci said, ''to forestall disease, to make themselves look younger. Low-end services, high-end services. CT scans, face lifts, bionic knees. We all think that health care is a high percent of gross domestic product now, but we ain't seen nothing yet.''
But is it a good idea to nip, tuck and CT scan our way to prosperity?
''If I were predicting a huge new demand for straw brooms,'' she said, ''that would not be a reason for optimism, because there isn't room for technological breakthroughs when it comes to straw brooms, or a lot of high-paying jobs. But spending on health care yields all sorts of breakthroughs and jobs at every skill level, from very low to very high.''
The aging of America presents a different sort of opportunity to James K. Galbraith, a professor at the University of Texas, who opened an interview with this very succinct expression of pessimism:
''We're likely to see a situation that makes people angry and miserable for years.''
But Professor Galbraith said he saw a way to alleviate the misery of one large group of Americans: the jobless elderly. Instead of sending them unemployment checks, the government should temporarily allow workers who are, say, 62 years old, to retire with full Social Security benefits. In essence, he said, the government would continue providing these people with assistance, but through retirement benefits instead of unemployment insurance.
Not only would they no longer be forced to compete for jobs they are unlikely to get, they would have 22.5 percent more purchasing power than they would have if forced to wait until the age when full Social Security benefits currently kick in. Collectively, that added purchasing power would drive demand for a variety of health and home care services -- also known as jobs.
To economists from the conservative, free-market wing of the discipline this will sound like more of the medicine that put us in the hospital. Their main worry is that the government will intervene and make matters worse.
''Growth doesn't come from big federal programs,'' says John H. Cochrane of the University of Chicago. ''The government didn't tell us'' to create the vast variety of profitable businesses on the Internet, but ''it did tell us to buy houses and look what that got us.''
Professor Cochrane said he was not a forecaster. He is, however, an optimist.
''The fundamentals are there. We have had a financial panic, but in the long run, growth is determined by businesses with great ideas, and we still have plenty of those. Now, it's perfectly possible we're in for a miserable decade but only if the government screws it all up, with high tax rates, chaotic tax rates, or if we suffer as a result of the overhang of government debt.''
Professor Cochrane and others counseled against a search for quick fixes. Mark A. Calabria of the Cato Institute went further, emphasizing that time was a key ingredient to a recovery.
It could take years for the millions of people once employed by the housing industry -- from construction workers to real estate agents -- to find new careers or return to their former careers when and if a strong housing market returns.
''I think we also have a bubble in the labor market for state and local government employees,'' he said, ''and over the next two years we might see as many as one million of these employees lose their jobs.''
So don't expect a speedy return to 7 percent unemployment, he said. For silver linings, he pointed to exports, which he thinks will be a source of growth, given the weaker dollar. And he sees an upside in an unlikely place: inflation, which he says might go from 2 percent today to 3 or 4 percent in the coming years.
''If you have a house worth $200,000 and a mortgage of $250,000, inflation is going to raise the nominal value of your home,'' he said. ''But your mortgage will stay the same. For borrowers who are underwater, inflation will get their heads closer to above water.''
Before we start rooting for higher inflation, or re-jiggering Social Security, or scaling back government, let's ask a more basic question: Is there no technological marvel on the horizon that could create an unexpected bounty in jobs? The way the railroads did in the 19th century or the way the Internet and computer industries did starting in the early '80s?
Green-energy initiatives like solar power, wind power and fuel cells are often described as jobs machines just waiting for ignition. True?
''I think the potential is there but the question is when and the question is how,'' said Christian Menegatti of Roubini Global Economics. ''Investments like that are risky and they won't pay off for a number of years, and probably even longer. Those kind of projects will need public incentives.''
Public incentives, he noted, aren't likely to emerge from a Republican-dominated House.
How about a cheap technology that our mortal minds can't currently fathom? A decade ago, who could have imagined that more than a million people would pay $1 for a portable phone video game in which you slash watermelons with a Japanese sword? Who, in other words, could have envisioned the Fruit Ninja app?
''That's a pretty wispy hope,'' said Gar Alperovitz, a professor at the University of Maryland.
For hope that is a little more tangible, Professor Alperovitz pointed to local co-operatives that are sprouting up around the country. They tend to be employee owned, and get off the ground with private and foundation funding. Many of his favorite examples are found in Cleveland, of all places -- like the Evergreen Cooperative Laundry, an employee-owned firm that provides laundry services to hospitals, which started in 2009.
Professor Alperovitz tracks and catalogues enterprises like the cooperative laundry on a Web site, community-wealth.org. He says he sees in these companies the stirrings of a movement animated by the cold reality that neither the government nor private enterprise is on the verge of large-scale hiring.
''If the economy and the government don't have an answer to a problem,'' he says, ''people are forced to try social enterprise.''
Perhaps we are entering the era of the self-starter. Prof. Andrew Caplin of New York University thinks so. He begins with the premise that in the coming global economy some people will succeed and others will not, and income inequality will grow. While it's noble to focus on how to spread wealth around, he says that it might be wiser to think of ways the poor and middle class could cater to the economy's biggest winners.
''Unfortunately, there will be income inequality,'' he says, ''but enough people will make money that those who don't would do well, in as much as they understand the needs of that group.''
He says he expects a rise in what he calls ''artisanal services,'' like cooks, nutritionists, small-scale farmers. He sees services emerging that aid the wealthy at the intersection of health and genetic science. He imagines a rise in technology services, too -- experts who keep clients current about technology which can advance their interests in business, in the media, on search engines and so on.
Professor Caplin worries that this concept might be caricatured as ''cater to the rich.'' But he suggested that this country could use a lot more non-judgmental thinking about the future of the United States economy. Any argument on that subject that starts with the word ''should,'' he said, is not nearly as useful as one that starts with ''could'' and has a firm grasp on ''is.''
''If you start with 'should' you get arguments where nobody makes any sense and where you can claim that some people are good and other people are bad,'' he said, referring to recent skirmishes over Fed policy, deficits and other contentious topics. ''With that sleight of hand you've ensured that you will not discuss anything of substance. You've just lined up two camps to fire at one another.'' In the spirit of the coming holidays, it seems downright unseasonal to end with an image that sounds lifted from the Battle of the Somme. So, a little solace.
Many interviewees made the point that America's higher education system is still drawing the greatest minds from around the world. That insures a regular influx of the innovative, motivated thinkers, a resource of enormous value, though one that is impossible to quantify.
And that's not all. When asked for something uplifting, Mr. Menegatti deadpanned:
''Things could be much worse.''
Correction: December 5, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about various ideas by economists to return the economy to life misstated the retirement age for full Social Security benefits. Full benefits are provided on a sliding scale based on the year of birth; they are not available to everyone when he or she turns 65. (The age recently rose to 66 for people born after 1942 and will rise to 67 for people born after 1959.)

HEADLINE: Can the Chinese Discover the Urge to Splurge?

 BODY:
When the Wuqi International Hotel was completed this spring, it immediately dominated the modest skyline of Wuqi, a small city in north central China. The hotel stands 21 stories tall and is wrapped in gleaming gray metal, with two glass elevators running up the outside. On a recent stay there, I had a clear view of the nearby mountains from my 19th-floor room.
The hotel is part of an effort by local officials to reshape their city in ways that many economists, both inside and outside China, have been recommending for the country as a whole. The government of Wuqi (pronounced, roughly, Wu-tzi) offers more generous health insurance to its citizens than many places. Its schools are free all the way through high school, rather than through only ninth grade, as is usual in China, and have been the subject of admiring stories in the Chinese media. Over the last decade, the city has embarked on an ambitious tree-planting program that has brought green to the yellow-brown hills of the Loess Plateau, where Wuqi is located. The Communists ended their Long March in those hills in 1935, and the Wuqi International Hotel is meant to host tourists who come for this history. 
The larger idea is to build a more sustainable economy, or what Chinese leaders have called a balanced and harmonious society. In that economy, families would not have to save 20 percent of their income in order to pay for schooling and medical care, as many do now. They would instead be able to afford more of the comforts of modern life -- better housing, clothing, transportation and communication. In time, China would become the world's next great consumer society.
That term may have negative connotations in the United States, particularly after the last decade of debt excess. But the term means something very different for China. A Chinese consumer society would improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people. The benefits of the industrial boom that began in the 1980s would spread more rapidly beyond the country's eastern coast. The service sector would grow, and the economy would no longer be quite so dependent on smoke-spewing factories.
For the rest of the world, the Chinese consumer is one of the best hopes for future economic growth. In the years ahead, when the United States, Europe and Japan will have no choice but to slow their spending and pay off their debts, China could pick up the slack. Millions of Americans -- yes, millions -- could end up with jobs that exist, at least in part, to design, make or sell goods and services to China. This possibility helps explain why Democrats, Republicans, economists, business consultants, corporate executives and labor leaders all devote so much time to urging China to consume more. One subtext of the recent G-20 meeting in Seoul was the encouragement of Chinese consumption.
What's striking about Wuqi is just how serious its officials are about making this transition happen -- and yet how difficult it nonetheless will be. The Wuqi International Hotel was as comfortable as most Marriotts or Hiltons in the United States, but the surrounding streets had the dusty feel of a backwater. The hardware, liquor and food stores down the block were each the size of a storage closet and about as well lighted. In the evenings, when Wuqi residents gathered in a public square to talk or perform exercises together, many of the stores were closed. The parents I met were thrilled that high school was free but were still saving an enormous portion of their modest incomes to pay for college or a new home. Those savings create a self-reinforcing cycle, in which stores don't flourish because people don't shop much and people don't shop much partly because there aren't many good stores. As Feng Zhendong, Wuqi's reform-minded Communist Party secretary, says, ''There's only so much to spend on.''
Then there was the hotel itself. During my first night there, I don't think I saw a single other guest -- in the lobby, the restaurant, the elevator or on the 19th floor. After I used the hotel gym, the front desk called to ask if I would be using it the next morning as well. In that case, someone would make sure it was unlocked.
No one believes the Chinese economy will transform itself overnight. But how long will it take and how difficult will it be? Preoccupied with our own economic insecurity, Americans may well be underestimating the challenges -- and fears -- of their new rival.
The rise of China can often seem inevitable. It is the world's most populous country, now reclaiming its long-lost power. Its economy recently passed Japan's as the second-biggest in the world, leaving economists to debate whether China was on pace to overtake the United States by the year 2025 or 2030. Yet China's rise has been anything but inevitable. Consider other poor countries -- in South America, Africa and even Asia -- with vast pools of cheap labor, which nonetheless have not been able to grow rapidly. Or consider other once-socialist countries, mostly in Eastern Europe, still suffering from a post-Soviet hangover. Even look at India, which is often paired with China as the great growth story of modern times. As recently as 1990, India had a comparable per-capita income to China. Today, China's is more than twice as high. So having a lot of cheap labor or moving toward a market system, or even both, does not guarantee the phenomenal growth China has experienced.
That growth -- among the most rapid in human history -- has been a result of strategy and good fortune. The Maoist period was brutal and repressive, but despite the terrible famines and the Cultural Revolution's assault on education, China did emerge with an unusually literate and healthy population for a poor country. Toward the end of that period, even before the one-child policy, a baby boom ended, creating a relatively small group of children and elderly to be supported by a large group of able workers. Into this fertile economic ground, Deng Xiaoping and his fellow reformers planted the seeds of a market evolution. Workers gained an incentive to succeed, while central planners, unconstrained by democracy, made the investments to turn China into the world's factory.
This model is part of something that has been called the Beijing Consensus, and it is understandably appealing to other poor countries. Yet in many respects it is not new. Politics aside, China's story is the classic one of economic development: investments in physical capital and education make a society more productive and are combined with a huge shift of people from farms to factories. England, Germany, the United States, Japan and South Korea have all followed the model over the last 250 years. The economist Gregory Clark, author of ''A Farewell to Alms,'' calls it the only story of economic development.
And this same story explains why China's continued rise is no more inevitable than its recent rise. From far away, China may look like an unstoppable colossus. From the inside, it looks more vulnerable. Indeed, Chinese economists, business executives and Communist Party officials are debating, sometimes passionately, just how vulnerable it is. ''In the short and medium term, there should be no problem,'' says Yu Yongding, a prominent economist. Among other things, the government has built up enough savings to spend its way out of most problems over the next several years. ''But there are fundamental contradictions in the Chinese economy. We can waste our strengths in one or two decades. If we exhaust these strengths, then we'll be in a big trouble.''
To continue growing rapidly, China needs to make the next transition, from sweatshop economy to innovation economy. This transition is the one that has often proved difficult elsewhere. Once a country has turned itself into an export factory, it cannot keep growing by repeating the exercise. It can't move a worker from an inefficient farm to a modern factory more than once. It cannot even retain its industrial might forever. As a country industrializes, workers will demand their share of the bounty, as has started happening in China, and some factories will start moving to poorer countries. Eventually, a rising economy needs to take two crucial steps: manufacture goods that aren't just cheaper than the competition, but better; and create a thriving domestic market, so that its own consumers can pick up the slack when exports inevitably slow. These steps go hand in hand. Big consumer markets become laboratories where companies know that innovations will be tested and the successful ones richly rewarded. Those products can then expand into countries with less mature consumer markets. Look at the telephone, the personal computer and the iPhone and iPad, all of which were designed in the United States and are now sold around the world.
Today's China cannot claim any such achievement, a fact that weighs on Chinese policymakers. They worry about the country's ability to innovate and, in particular, about the quality of its education system. When I met with Guo Shuqing, a party official and the chairman of China Construction Bank, in his office high above Beijing's financial district, he mentioned that a recent ranking of the world's top 100 universities included 53 from the United States but just three from mainland China. Even those numbers, Guo said, probably overstated the strengths of China's universities: ''In terms of innovation -- really original, creative ideas -- they're very weak,'' he told me. By contrast, the American education system helped make possible Google and other companies.
Clearly, many of China's weaknesses can be ascribed to its stage of development. Yet there is no iron law that it will reach the next stage. Japan and the Soviet Union, in different ways, both failed to make the transition to an innovation economy. While they may seem like unimpressive comparisons today, they once occupied a position much like China's. They were rising powers that appeared to have found a new model for growth. In a 1994 essay in Foreign Affairs, Paul Krugman, the economist who is now a New York Times columnist, pointed out that Americans were then talking about Japan and the so-called East Asian tigers in ways remarkably similar to how they had talked about the Soviet bloc in the 1960s. ''Once upon a time,'' he wrote, ''Western opinion leaders found themselves both impressed and frightened by the extraordinary growth rates achieved by a set of Eastern economies.''
The Soviet Union, of course, utterly failed to take the next steps. Japan did nurture some of the world's most successful exporters, like Sony and Toyota, and developed just-in-time manufacturing processes that were widely copied. But its domestic market remains sheltered and inefficient, especially in the service sector, which has held back growth and innovation. Japan has not merely slowed down, as is inevitable when countries get richer; it has become a global symbol of economic mismanagement. These troubles seem directly relevant to China, given that China, too, has protected much of its domestic economy from competition.
The United States, for all of our current problems, is still easily the world's largest economy, which is partly because we made the transition from an industrial economy to a consumer economy. Income in the United States remains about 30 percent higher than in Germany or England on a per-capita basis, 40 percent higher than in Japan and more than six times as high as in China.
China does have advantages that other countries did not, starting with its size. But it still will not find the transition easy. A consumer economy revolves around individual choice, and Beijing's authoritarian government is often hostile to the idea of choice. The government is also filled with many officials who have known only industrial-led growth -- and have benefited from it -- and who are at least as influential as the economic reformers preaching the virtues of domestic consumption. These reformers will have to persuade their colleagues to step back from the most aggressive industrialization any country has ever undertaken. China now spends about 50 percent of its gross domestic product on a broad category economists call investment -- roads, bridges, trains, ports, technology, factories and office buildings. That is the highest share in recorded history. During their great booms in the 1960s and '70s, Japan and South Korea never topped 40 percent. China itself was spending 35 percent only a decade ago.
Already, there are signs that China is bumping up against the limits of its industrial revolution. Other countries are frustrated with its growing share of exports and are pressing China to raise the value of its currency, the renminbi. And the demographic wind that has been at China's back is on the verge of switching direction, leaving the country with fewer workers and more retirees. Without a seemingly endless supply of cheap labor, companies will have to raise wages, which -- like a higher renminbi -- would make Chinese exports less competitive. Even before the demographic trends put pressure on pay, this year's strikes at a Honda plant in Guangdong Province, among other factories, led some companies to lift wages more than 20 percent. Twenty-eight provincial governments increased their minimum wage between 12 percent and 32 percent.
Perhaps the most telling sign that China's economic model is reaching its limits is a decline in its efficiency. To maintain 10 percent annual economic growth, it has had to invest more and more in roads, buildings and the like. In other words, the return on its investments has begun to fall, which is never a good sign. ''We've got a problem,'' Guo, the bank chairman, told me. ''We realize this kind of growth is not sustainable. It's not the kind of problem like a financial crisis. But if such inefficiencies accumulate for quite a long time, you reach the point where, suddenly, maybe things burst.''
During my recent stay in China, I came away, as many Westerners do, awed by the country's accomplishments. Cities have sprouted from nothing, allowing peasants to leap a century of economic history in a decade. Rural areas have highways that are smoother than in many major American cities. One bullet train I took could cover the distance between New York and Washington in an hour. The United States is on course to have such a train approximately never.
But once you start to notice the signs of unsustainability, you start seeing them everywhere. Some highways are strangely empty. So are some buildings. When I tagged along with a group of American businessmen on a tour of what we thought was a new energy-efficient office building in Hangzhou, a coastal city a couple of hours south of Shanghai, we soon realized that it was -- hard as such a thing may be to imagine -- a sample office building. It had been built to show potential investors what their business might look like if it moved to Hangzhou.
This unsustainability is especially pronounced in the current real estate mania. Housing prices have been soaring, despite government efforts to cool the market. Relative to rents, housing prices in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou are higher than they were in most any American city at the peak of our housing bubble. In Beijing or Shanghai, four or five different real estate agencies might open on a single block. Other agents simply set up shop on the sidewalk, with a table and brochures. At traffic lights in Beijing, young men walk among the idling cars and hand out brochures for newly built apartments.
It is true that an economy growing as rapidly as China's can catch up to many of its excesses. But it will probably need to change to do so. Wages will have to rise faster, and people will have to spend more of their income. Otherwise, many infrastructure projects will end up resembling make-work, and house prices will fall. Banks and the government will then be saddled with bad loans, exhausting the fiscal strength that Yu and other economists see as China's biggest advantage.
None of this means China is on the verge of running out of steam. It probably has at least 5 or 10 years of rapid growth ahead, even if it simply doubles down on its current growth strategy, because it can still take more industrial market share from other countries. In a way, though, the country's short-term strengths in manufacturing and exporting may be another reason to wonder what the future holds. Those strengths will make it harder for China to summon the urgency to remake itself.
The debate over economic policy in China feels different from other political debates. People who will not mention the words ''Tibet,'' ''Falun Gong'' or ''1989'' in polite conversation talk openly and critically about the state of the economy. The criticism serves party leaders' purposes in some ways, because it tends to underscore that China remains a poor country, unable -- in their telling -- to reduce pollution or raise the value of the renminbi without causing economic misery for its citizens. The closest thing to a loyalty test in the public discussion of the economy is the renminbi. Chinese economists often harshly criticize the United States for putting pressure on China to appreciate its currency, even if they eventually get around to mentioning that they, too, think it should rise.
Yu, the economist who worries that China has only a decade or two to avoid trouble, qualifies as a moderate reformer. Sixty-two years old, with a mop of graying hair and long, loose sideburns, he is part of the generation that has lived through nearly all of the Communists' time in power. His great-grandparents immigrated to the United States as laborers in the 19th century, but the family eventually returned to China. His father was a journalist, and Yu himself was going to college in Beijing when the Cultural Revolution began in the mid-1960s. Branded an intellectual, he spent 10 years working as a semiskilled laborer at the Beijing Heavy Machinery Factory. ''If you were lucky, you went to a factory,'' he told me. The unlucky students were sent to remote provinces or worse. Still, he refers to his time in the factory as hard labor.
When not on the job, he read voraciously and realized he wanted to become an economist. He is not great at any one thing, he says, but is interested in many, including history and math. Economics seemed like the ideal profession. In 1979, he joined the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a research group founded as part of Deng's economic reforms. Except for the six years he spent at Oxford earning his doctorate, he has been at the academy ever since. Stephen Green, a Shanghai-based economist with Standard Chartered, the British bank, calls Yu one of the pioneers who brought statistically rigorous methods to Chinese economics and was willing to follow the evidence wherever it led. This doesn't make Yu a dissident, however. He calls himself quite conservative. ''I believe in gradualism,'' he told me.
China's gradualist approach to economic policy has been a big part of its success. The country avoided the turmoil that some of Eastern Europe experienced when it switched almost overnight to a market system. China has also escaped the fate of old-style centrally planned economies like Cuba's, because Deng and his followers were more pragmatic than ideological. If something worked -- if it led to growth and jobs -- they usually favored it. As Yu says: ''Growth has been the single-most-important objective of Chinese policies for decades. Without growth, there are not enough jobs, and there is instability.'' To create these jobs, the party has heavily subsidized companies, especially manufacturers that export goods. Some of these subsidies are direct and obvious, like those now benefiting China's clean-energy industry. But most are subtler. Yu ticked off a few:
The government holds down the price of coal, oil and other natural resources, hurting interior provinces that produce these resources to the benefit of coastal exporters that use them. Beijing also sets a ceiling on interest rates, which harms households trying to build a nest egg and helps capital-intensive businesses that borrow to expand. The price of labor is indirectly suppressed, too. Independent unions are illegal, and a household-registration system called hukou has long treated many migrants who move from distant provinces to cities to work as if they were illegal immigrants. Basic benefits -- free schooling, pension, health insurance -- are often unavailable to people who work outside their native regions.
The renminbi falls into the same category. By buying large amounts of United States Treasury bonds (and, to a lesser extent, Japanese and European bonds), China has kept its currency artificially low. The renminbi has roughly the same value today as it did in 1990, relative to a basket of other currencies, which is remarkable considering how much faster China's economy has grown than the world economy. The low renminbi holds down the price of Chinese-made goods in other countries, increasing exports. But it also means that foreign-made products are more expensive within China than they would otherwise be. In effect, China's government is deliberately reducing the buying power of its own consumers to subsidize its exporters.
On the currency, Yu takes the typical stance for a reform-oriented economist. ''For the sake of China, I am a strong supporter of renminbi appreciation,'' he told me. On the other hand, he is angered by Americans who argue that the exchange rate damages the United States. ''That's total rubbish,'' he says. ''The problem is not between China and the United States. The problem is between American companies that invest in China and American workers within the United States.'' This analysis may overstate the case; because exports are a larger part of China's economy than imports, it does seem to benefit on net from the low renminbi. But Yu is certainly correct that Western companies with a large presence inside China -- a long and influential list -- also benefit from the low renminbi. American workers who have lost their jobs to outsourcing do not.
On a September afternoon, Yu and I were sitting in the living room of a hotel suite on the outskirts of Beijing. He lives in the city with his wife, but he was staying at the hotel for a few nights to attend a conference for American and Chinese economists called the Summer Palace Dialogue. The Summer Palace was the emperor's country retreat, and the resort where the economists were staying tried to combine ancient grandeur with five-star amenities. ''I don't like this,'' Yu said, gesturing around the room with its finely appointed furniture. ''It is too much. It is not necessary.'' Such excess, he noted, ''is a problem with China's political system.''
The subsidies that China showers on its corporate sector have been crucial to building an industrial economy. But they have also led to a severe concentration of income. Some of it takes a form Americans are used to: the rich receive a much larger share of the national income than they did a few decades ago. Forbes reported early this year that mainland China and Hong Kong had 89 billionaires. Japan, with an economy almost as large as China's and per-capita income several times higher, had just 22. Shanghai now has three of its own Louis Vuitton stores.
In addition to the high degree of income concentration, China has another kind of inequality. All the corporate subsidies have allowed companies to accumulate enormous profits, and a corporation's gains and losses ultimately flow to individuals. In China, today's huge profits mostly benefit the well-off, be they executives, investors or party officials. The well-off not only have much higher take-home pay than the rank-and-file but also tend to be the ones who have access to the benefits of hoarded corporate cash. Many of the new Audi and Buick sedans on the streets -- China's versions of the Lincoln Town Car -- are company cars, and many of the guests at the Summer Palace resort are on expense accounts. State-owned companies have done especially well, even in resource industries where the price of their products is kept artificially low. Huang Yiping, an economist who previously worked at Citigroup, points out that state-owned banks tend to have much grander office buildings than their private, generally foreign rivals. In Wuqi, the only building that compares with the new hotel is another hotel owned by the local oil company.
Yet despite the long boom, most Chinese citizens remain fairly poor. Per-capita G.D.P. is about $7,000, and consumption makes up only 35 percent of the economy, thanks to the high levels of savings and corporate profits. So per-capita consumption -- the amount of money the average person spends -- is only about $2,500 a year. In the United States, by comparison, it is about $30,000. In Brazil, where per-capita G.D.P. is one and a half times that of China's, consumption is more than two and a half times as high, or about $7,000.
Of course, anyone who has lived through the global bubble and bust of the last few years may wonder what's so great about a consumer society. In the United States, the idea that we have reoriented our economy toward consumption and don't make things anymore has become a standard lament, not a sign of progress. But China is a long way from consuming too much. Saying that China does not have a big-enough consumer economy is really another way of saying that not enough of its resources reach the broad mass of its people. If they had more resources, they would surely spend more. This is why the recent labor strikes, and the pay increases that followed, were so important. They were a sign that Chinese households might start to enjoy more of the fruits of the long boom.
In coming years, the pressure to raise wages will increase. The size of China's labor force, relative to the rest of its population, will peak in the next few years, if it hasn't already. The country is still a long way from facing labor shortages, but the flow of young workers from the countryside will slow. Companies will probably have to respond by raising wages of their existing workers or by moving inland, where wages are lower, and paying workers there what they once paid workers on the coast. Either way, the effect will be to raise the average wage nationwide. Foxconn, which employs 920,000 people making iPhones and other technology products, is opening new factories in Chongqing, a large city 1,000 miles inland.
Given that China is not exactly a free-market economy, the extent to which wages rise will depend in no small part on government policy. Party officials are themselves torn over what to do. One businessman told me he knew that most outsiders thought of China as a top-down, centralized country. ''But China is a collection of special interests,'' he said, ''like the U.S.'' Leaders understand that suppressing labor unrest may help economic growth in the short term by holding down wages and thus the price of exports. But many also know that economic discontent risks political instability of the kind that in the last century alone toppled an emperor and Chiang Kai-shek, led to the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and threatened the current regime in Tiananmen Square.
Yu finds the allocation of resources to be perhaps the most frustrating aspect of today's economy. Even as companies and the largest cities are prospering, many parts of society are starved of resources. Last year, Yu's wife spent part of the summer tutoring the daughter of the woman who cleans their building. The girl was moving from her hometown to live with her mother in Beijing and needed to learn English to keep up with her new classmates. The rural school she came from did not teach English. (Her family also had to pay tuition, because the hukou household-registration system denied them free education outside their home province.) In some rural areas, the teachers themselves have not graduated from high school. As part of a lecture he recently gave, Yu included some photographs among the usual economic charts and graphs. One showed students at their desks in a rural classroom, surrounded by muddy puddles on a dirt floor. Others showed the spectacular new Beijing Opera House, a bullet train and a series of gaudy provincial government buildings.
It is worth pausing for a minute on this contrast. In the big cities of the coast, the creation of a Chinese consumer society is proceeding apace. Sometimes, it can even seem a step ahead of the United States. On the tunnel walls between some stops of the Beijing subway, video advertisements move at the same speed as the train, vying for riders' attention with televisions, also showing ads, inside the subway cars. Modern Chinese society hardly seems hostile to the idea of consumption. The problem is how little money so many people have.
Wuqi has been able to try a different economic model because it is neither too rich nor too poor. Located in Shaanxi Province, about a third of the way west from Beijing toward Tibet, it is too remote to be a factory boomtown. Indeed, it can feel more like part of China's past than its future. The billboards lining the mountain roads into Wuqi display Communist Party sayings like ''Support the military, and the military should love the people.'' The older homes in the area are the same kind as those in which Mao and his comrades lived during their Shaanxi exile: mountainside caves, fronted by a stone archway and facade. But Wuqi also has oil. Feng, the party secretary, has decided to spend a large portion of the oil money on education.
Growing up in a farmer's family in Shaanxi, Feng was the sixth child of seven, and the only one to go to college. When I asked him why, he said his family could not afford to send more than one child and decided he was the most clever. Most of his siblings are now farmers or laborers. Feng became a hydro-engineer at a state-owned company until the party told him to go into government. Today, at 44, he travels around Wuqi in a government-issued white Toyota Land Cruiser, frequently checking e-mail on his Coolpad smartphone.
Many of the teachers Feng had growing up were unqualified. As party secretary, he has closed more than 100 village schools and built new, centralized ones. Students as young as 6 spend Sunday through Thursday nights in brightly colored dormitory rooms that, like many newer local houses, have archways evoking the caves. Wuqi has also raided other cities to hire well-regarded teachers, sometimes offering annual salaries equivalent to $30,000, which is several times what a locally hired teacher makes.
In some ways, Wuqi's schools are impressive. Feng made sure a new preschool was built in advance of a neighboring low-income apartment complex, so that children who moved in would immediately be able to enroll. The steps of an elementary school I visited were painted with American sayings to help students learn (like ''That's all!'' and, oddly, ''I'm on a diet''). A middle school had a 2,500-seat sports stadium. At one Wuqi high school, uniformed students walked down a hallway beneath photographs of Amherst College and N.Y.U. In other ways, though, the schools have a long way to go. Every high-school class I saw, for instance, had more than 50 students. The fairest conclusion seemed to be that Wuqi's schools were improving and that local party leaders were serious about continuing to improve them.
Education has already played an underappreciated role in China's rise. For decades, Chinese children have spent more years in school than their peers in other countries; among the world's many cheap laborers, China's have been uncommonly skilled. As Arthur Kroeber, editor of the China Economic Quarterly, says, ''You can have a lot of cheap labor, but if that cheap labor can't read, can't follow instructions and is sick all the time, it doesn't help you.''
The next step is to educate people not just for factory work but for the white-collar work that would be a growing part of a consumer economy. Much of that work requires a full high-school education, if not college too. Today 55 percent of China's adult population has graduated from high school (compared with less than 10 percent in India). But only about 5 percent of Chinese adults have a college degree of some kind.
The uneven quality of China's colleges presents one problem. A recent book coined the term ''ant tribe'' to describe the many struggling recent graduates, particularly of second- and third-tier colleges. Over the long term, the bigger problem is that education beyond junior high school is financially out of reach to many families. In most parts of China, tuition starts when children are about 14. In a recent poll, Chinese families cited education as the main reason that they save money.
Even in Wuqi, many parents, thinking ahead to college, worry about being able to afford their children's education. On a drizzly Tuesday in September, just before the start of the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, I talked with a woman named Guo Xiuqin while she and her twin 4-year-old daughters waited outside a preschool for another child they were taking home. Guo, wearing a simple leather jacket, described how Wuqi had changed in recent years. ''The new houses are so different, with tiles and bricks and new colors,'' she said. Farmers are no longer tied to their land, thanks in part to a local program that gives them money to plant trees on it instead. Her husband spends most of his time on the road, running a small transportation business. In all, the family makes about $8,000 a year, and the free preschool has allowed them to increase savings. Guo guessed they now saved about half their income. ''College will cost a lot of money,'' she said, and she wants her daughters to go as far in school as they are able.
The rest of their income pays for food and clothing and to take care of elderly parents. I asked if there was anything Guo, who is 30, hoped to be able to buy in the future. ''I don't want anything,'' she said. What about an apartment in the village, closer to the school, rather than in the countryside? ''Of course,'' she replied, smiling, ''but how could I possibly dream of that?''
If China does ultimately build a consumer economy, it will probably depend more on Guo's daughters than on Guo herself. Today's teenagers were born after the Tiananmen massacre and have known nothing but boom times, and they may have a different attitude toward spending than their parents. For one thing, teenagers are surprisingly heavy users of technology, given China's income level. A recent study by the Boston Consulting Group found that people in China spent more time online and were more likely to buy goods online than people in any other large developing country, even richer ones, like Brazil and Russia. The study also found that in rural China, nearly half of all Internet users were under 20. Nearly 80 percent were under 30.
In Wuqi, Internet service works quite well, and personal computers have become common in the last few years. ''All my colleagues shop online,'' says Ma Jingye, 24, who works for the county government. She was using the Internet regularly while she was going to college in Beijing, and when she returned to Wuqi this summer, she was surprised to find it had caught on there, too. Ma said she spent about 200 to 300 renminbi a month, which translates into roughly $30 to $45, shopping on Taobao, China's version of Amazon.
Taobao makes for a nice example of the symbiotic relationship between consumption and innovation. Its parent company, Alibaba, which is based in Hangzhou, has grown to be one of the world's most valuable Internet companies, as have two other Chinese companies -- Tencent, an instant-messaging service, and Baidu, a search engine. They have been able to grow so large because of China's high Internet usage and because the industry, unlike many others in the service sector, is not dominated by powerful state-owned firms. Internet companies succeed by providing good service at a reasonable price.
But Chinese Internet companies are still a long way from being as innovative as American or European ones. Taobao, Tencent and Baidu do little that Western companies do not. The Chinese companies have succeeded by copying innovations from elsewhere and then executing them well in their home market. Many of today's start-ups are trying to follow the same business strategy. At Innovation Works, an incubator in Beijing founded by Lee Kai-Fu, the former head of Google's China division, fresh-faced entrepreneurs work long hours in adjoining cubicles trying to create the next Taobao. They are charmingly honest about the fact that they are not on the cutting edge. One engineer at Innovation Works explained to me that success didn't yet require innovation. The Chinese market is still hungry for the basics.
The dynamic is at work in industry after industry. One of the nicer stores in Wuqi is a small one run by Li Ning, a top Chinese sneaker and sporting- goods company. It resembles the kind of small sneaker store you might find in a low-end American mall. Even Li Ning's logo, on its products and on the front of the store, is familiar. It is a modified Nike swoosh.
In addition to the immature consumer market, China's education system also holds back innovation. Party leaders, from Feng to the highest levels in Beijing, worry that schools have not yet figured out how to create entrepreneurs who can build great businesses. ''The traditional education produces a problem,'' Feng said, ''in which people can do well in exams but don't have very innovative skills.'' To address the problem, Wuqi has added more art and music to the curriculum, on top of the usual math, Chinese and English. The high school with the Amherst and N.Y.U. photos on the wall has created clubs for handicrafts, physics, chemistry and singing. Feng admits he does not yet know how well the efforts are working.
Still, you can see how China's new entrepreneurs might begin to emerge. If schools began producing more innovation-minded students, they could feed off an increase in consumer spending to create products that really were different. If the government opened up more industries -- airlines, banking, telecommunications, retail -- to greater competition, the fight for customers would encourage innovation there, too. Eventually, ideas for new products might originate in Beijing or Hangzhou or even Wuqi. That would benefit the whole world, just as the world now benefits from American and European innovations. Imagine, say, if China developed a cheap form of clean energy. Above all, innovation would benefit China. Rather than merely having workers making $1 an hour to put together iPhones, it could also have software developers making $20 or $50 an hour to design the next iPhone.
After a Sichuan dinner in Wuqi one night -- complete with raw hot peppers, dipped in salt, a local way of eating them -- Feng asked if I wanted to climb the city's almost-finished monument to the Long March. The monument starts as a grand outdoor staircase and then becomes a paved path into the mountains, ascending about 1,000 feet over two miles, with scattered statues celebrating workers, peasants and soldiers. From the clearings, I could look down on Wuqi and imagine whether it might conceivably change as much over the next decade as coastal China changed over the last. Would tourists and business executives ultimately fill the new hotel? Would new industries come and stores open? I told Feng that, as impressive as Wuqi's efforts were, it was hard to see exactly how the city would build a self-sustaining economy in place of one that depended so much on hopeful construction. He did not exactly disagree. ''We can't tell what will be here in 10 years,'' he said. ''All I can do right now is build up Wuqi's environment and infrastructure and talent pool, for when the opportunity comes. We can only lay the foundation. It won't necessarily go as I plan.''
Feng, of course, is not a typical local leader. In many other cities and provinces, the party has pursued short-term growth regardless of the long-term consequences. The party evaluates and promotes officials in large measure based on G.D.P. statistics and not on measures of education, employment or living standards. No wonder, then, that despite all the reform talk from Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and President Hu Jintao, consumption has continued to be a smaller part of the economy, and investment a larger one, since they took office in 2003.
Nonetheless, there are reasons to believe that China is starting to change and that today's reformers will ultimately win out, just as Deng did in his time. Economic growth in poorer provinces like Shaanxi has been somewhat faster over the last three years than in the richest areas, like Beijing and Shanghai, according to the University of Michigan's China Data Center. For many years, the reverse was true, and the gap was widening. Many provinces are also relaxing the hukou household-registration system. Looking ahead, party officials have indicated that their next five-year plan, China's 12th, to be released in March, will focus on the quality of economic growth -- how it affects people's lives -- rather than the quantity. China watchers inside and outside the country are now trying to figure out how much Xi Jinping, who is likely to become president in 2013, truly supports reform.
The centerpiece of the government's recent efforts to transform China's economy was the stimulus program announced in 2008. Relative to the size of the economy, the stimulus was more than twice as large as America's. It focused on infrastructure, mostly highways, trains and housing. Infrastructure spending is heavy-duty investment that plays off China's existing strengths. When tens of millions of workers were losing their factory jobs at the depths of the global recession, the government was able to put many of them back to work quickly on construction projects. (In an authoritarian state that does not have to worry much about property rights or environmental laws, shovel-ready projects are easy enough to find.) ''The government does not have as strong instruments to influence consumption,'' as Yu says. ''Investment is easier.'' That is especially true in a consumer economy as immature as China's.
But infrastructure can also help to foster a consumer economy. The new apartment buildings going up in hundreds of cities will employ workers now and will later become homes for rural migrants. Once in the cities, those migrants will be able to earn more and spend more. The new train lines and highways will reduce commutes and help stitch together China's domestic economy, much as the Interstate System of highways did in the United States. While I was in Hangzhou, officials there were getting ready to open a new train line that would cut travel time to Shanghai, which is 120 miles away, to less than an hour. ''When it opens,'' Tu Dongdong, a deputy mayor, said, ''Hangzhou will become part of Shanghai.'' Some of the new highways may be empty, but Kroeber, the editor of the China Economic Quarterly, said the high-speed trains are mostly full.
Pessimists argue that China has only a few years to start making major changes. According to this line of thinking, the recent splurge on infrastructure will lead mostly to empty buildings and unrecoverable loans, and the weak global economy will soon cause other countries to put up trade barriers unless China raises the value of the renminbi. Optimists reply that China remains a poor country and still has a couple of decades to switch from a factory economy to a consumer economy. Guo, the party leader and bank chairman, said that he did not think change had come quickly enough in recent years. But, he added, ''I think we have plenty of time, plenty of tools and plenty of instruments to make a soft landing and a smooth transformation.'' Arthur Kroeber, who agrees, points out that China's per-capita income is still only where Japan's was in the mid-1960s.
One reason for optimism is that a version of the current strategy, what Guo calls ''build first,'' has worked before. Deng and the other post-Mao leaders built the coastal cities before they had been established as manufacturing hubs. They plowed ahead, and China's natural advantages -- size, location, literate population and, hard as it may be to quantify, Confucian work ethic -- allowed the strategy to pay off. If that happens again, not all of today's buildings and roads will be filled, but enough of them will be.
Kroeber first visited China in 1985 during the early stages of both Deng's reforms and the boom that has continued almost without interruption since. Even then, Kroeber said, he had a hard time imagining that China would find a way to make use of all of its new construction. During that visit, he would sometimes get around Beijing by biking on the recently built Second Ring Road, which encircled downtown. The road was big and wide, with few cars on it, and Kroeber remembers thinking it absurd that the city had spent the money to build it. Today, however, Second Ring Road is clogged with cars day and night. The subway is usually a faster way to travel. Third and Fourth Ring Roads are clogged, too. Fifth Ring Road, completed in 2003, and Sixth Ring Road, completed last year, are less congested. But you would not want to ride your bike on them.
In China's halting efforts to build a new economy today, there is an intriguing parallel to the United States: Both the world's largest economy and its latest challenger need to remake themselves. As Guo bluntly told me, ''You are facing transformation, too.'' The United States needs to shift away from debt-financed consumption with little long-term benefit and toward investments that can create good-paying jobs, like education, infrastructure, energy and scientific research. China needs to invest less and consume more -- to keep growing rapidly and, in the process, to stimulate economic growth around the world. In both countries, significant changes are necessary to create more sustainable growth. And in both countries, they inspire fierce internal opposition.
We tend to think of the United States and China as rivals, and they will continue to compete in coming years, over which will build the industries of the future and which will be the dominant power in Asia and the world. But our problems are also linked, just as the Chinese export boom and the American consumption boom depended on each other and, together, helped create the financial crisis. The worst outcome now, for both countries, might well be economic stagnation in China. That would slow U.S. growth and could lead to political chaos in China. The best outcome would be for both countries to reshape their economies gradually, benefiting both. In neither country will it be easy.

BYLINE: By RANDY COHEN

 BODY:
My same-sex partner and I are legally married in another country, a marriage not recognized by our state or (obviously) federal government, with significant negative consequences to our modest financial situation. My partner would be eligible for some government aid if she applied as a single person, but it feels disingenuous to do so, because as a family, we make well above the poverty line. In some sense, however, the government owes us this money since it unjustly disregards our marriage. Should she apply? NAME WITHHELD, PORTLAND, ME.
There's no ethical obstacle to her doing so. As you realize to your dismay, in this context ''single'' is a technical term with a precise meaning defined by law. Your partner's duty is to meet the criteria for aid and fill out those applications honestly. If, for the purposes of, for example, health-insurance subsidies, the agency administering the program regards her as single, she has every right -- ethical and legal -- to apply as such. 
''Family'' has various meanings to a religious body, to a state legislature, to a boss who hopes his employees won't unionize, to Don Corleone. I take it to be a synonym for ''insipid'' when it precedes the word ''film'' and for ''inedible'' when followed by the word ''restaurant.'' Context shapes meaning. What's more, marriage has long been, among other things, an economic institution. Your partner may take that into account when considering these applications.
This decision has nothing to do with the government's compensating her for rough treatment or being evenhanded or mitigating any injustice marriage law imposes on you both. Nor could you argue that because federal marriage law discriminates against same-sex couples, denying them equal treatment, you have an ethical right to balance the scales by cutting the line at the post office or punching a homophobe in the snoot, however appealing those actions might seem. But you have no duty to set stricter standards for such programs than the law itself. Similarly, although I favor a more progressive income tax, one that might compel a nice fellow like me to write a bigger check, I am not morally obliged to send the I.R.S. more money than current law prescribes.
I am a psychiatrist who happens to be an atheist. Occasionally a patient asks me what religion I follow and, displeased by my answer, seeks another psychiatrist. I am a physician, not a priest. Religious beliefs seem as relevant to my profession as they are to an accountant's. Nevertheless, candor sometimes costs me a patient. May I claim a belief in God to avoid damage to my credibility and business?
VAIDYANATH IYER, THE WOODLANDS, TEX.
To rephrase your question slightly: May you lie to a patient to initiate a relationship of trust? O.K., I've rephrased it totally and unflatteringly, but the answer -- no -- is provided by the American Psychiatric Association's ''Principles of Medical Ethics,'' which requires you to be ''honest in all professional interactions.'' And rightly so.
What you may do is decline to answer such questions. Glen O. Gabbard, a professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine, told me in an e-mail that ''it is not dishonest to use restraint in responding to questions of a personal nature.'' He added, ''One can also inquire about the reasons for the question.'' The patient's reply might offer insights useful in treatment.
The patient's question need not reflect mere prejudice but could express a desire for a psychiatrist whose personal experience will yield a deeper understanding of the patient. On such benign grounds, some women seek a female psychiatrist, some homosexuals a homosexual. But it is also true that you need not be a Presbyterian to effectively treat a Presbyterian. Even a gay female Presbyterian.
And so you should respond courteously to such queries, answering those about your training and technique but not those you deem irrelevant to the work. Are you Jewish? A Republican? An opera buff? This demurral could cost you a patient or two, but so be it. A patient's determination to make an unwise decision does not justify a doctor's deceit.

HEADLINE: Taxing The Rich: It's All Relative

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
IT'S not just Tea Party activists who are angry about taxes. A much larger and more diverse group appears outraged that Congress is considering allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire at year-end for families earning more than $250,000 and for individuals earning more than $200,000.
A financially prosperous friend of mine is a case in point. He watches a lot of angry talking heads on cable news, and he recently buttonholed me to ask whether I had any idea that our taxes were about to rise. Did I know that the president was not only planning to allow the Bush tax cuts to expire for relatively high-income people like us, but that he was also thinking of raising the ceiling for the payroll tax? Did I know that we might also face increases in Medicare and self-employment tax rates? And that taxes in New York State could go up, too? His face grew redder as he listed each outrage. 
I said I knew all about the scheduled expiration of the Bush tax cuts but hadn't heard much about the other proposals. When he expressed shock that I hadn't, I tried to explain why I didn't think it made sense to fret.
First, I said that with baby boomers entering retirement, there's no way that spending cuts alone could prevent federal debt from spiraling out of control. We also need additional revenue. Of course, there are many complex issues in weighing the effects of even a modest increase in top tax rates. (Would it reduce economic growth, for instance? There's no credible evidence that it would.)
But the most salient issue in taxpayers' minds is how the changes would affect their own standard of living. Truly wealthy families wouldn't have to alter their spending at all. Neither my friend nor I is in that league, but we've both saved a lot and could easily maintain our current spending levels even if the president's proposals were adopted.
Many families with income of $250,000 and more do spend everything they earn, and, of course, would have to cut back. As psychologists have long known, individuals typically find belt-tightening painful. But recent psychological research suggests that if all in that group spent less in unison, their perceptions of their standard of living would remain essentially unchanged.
That's because once consumers move out of the realm of necessities, they focus on what the late British economist Fred Hirsch called positional goods -- things that stand out from the ordinary, or whose value stems largely from the fact that not everyone can have them. Homes with spectacular views are an example, as are high-performance cars, designer clothes and gourmet meals. A modest increase in top tax rates would not compromise prosperous families' abilities to enjoy such pleasures.
Consider a hedge fund manager who wants an apartment with a sweeping view of Central Park. Because the supply of such apartments is limited, he must outbid others who also want one. If his tax rate rises, he won't be able to bid as much as before. But because others' tax rates will also climb, they won't be able to bid as much, either. So the tax increase, if it applies to all bidders, will not affect the outcome.
With less after-tax income, top earners also wouldn't be able to spend as much on cars or their children's weddings and coming-of-age parties. But why did they feel compelled to spend so much in the first place? In most cases, they simply wanted a car that felt spirited, or a celebration that seemed special. But concepts like ''spirited'' and ''special'' are inescapably relative: when others in your circle spend a lot, you must spend accordingly or else live with the disappointment that results from unmet expectations.
If the top tax rate were to rise, as scheduled, from 35 percent to 39.5 percent -- its level during the Clinton era -- many top earners would spend a little less on cars and parties, so the standards that define their expectations would adjust. But once the dust settled, their cars would feel no less spirited, and their celebrations no less special, than before.
In short, letting the Bush tax cuts for the most prosperous families expire next month would hardly hamper their ability to buy what they want.
The resulting revenue, however, could do a lot of good for our struggling economy. In the short term, it could be used for grants to state and local governments, which have been forced by their own revenue shortfalls to lay off hundreds of thousands of workers. And in the long term, it could help address legitimate concerns about burgeoning federal deficits.
I EXPLAINED all of this to my friend -- telling him that because the tax increases he listed would apply not only to him and me, but also to others like us, they wouldn't much affect our ability to acquire the things we want. That seemed to calm him down a bit.
If more people thought about the issue in these terms, there might be less anger and unhappiness in the land. And sensible, pragmatic solutions to our most pressing economic problems might be less likely to be rejected as politically unthinkable.

HEADLINE: The Unemployed Held Hostage, Again

 BODY:
It is hard to believe, as the holidays approach yet again amid economic hard times, but Congress looks as if it may let federal unemployment benefits lapse for the fourth time this year.
Lame duck lawmakers will have only one day when they return to work on Monday to renew the expiring benefits. If they don't, two million people will be cut off in December alone. This lack of regard for working Americans is shocking. Last summer, benefits were blocked for 51 days, as senators in both parties focused on preserving tax breaks for wealthy money managers and other affluent constituents.
This time, tax cuts for the rich are bound to drive and distort the debate again. Republicans and Democrats will almost certainly link the renewal of jobless benefits to an extension of the high-end Bush-era tax cuts. That would be a travesty. There is no good argument for letting jobless benefits expire, or for extending those cuts. 
The recession that began in 2007 has led to the worst unemployment in nearly 30 years. We have record levels of long-term unemployment. The jobless rate, 9.6 percent, has been essentially unchanged since May, and nearly 42 percent of the 14.8 million jobless workers have been sidelined for six months or more.
Some opponents of unemployment benefits -- mostly Republicans but a few Democrats as well -- would have you believe those figures are evidence of laziness, enabled by generous benefits. They conveniently ignore three facts. One, there are five unemployed people for every job opening -- a profound scarcity of jobs. Two, federal benefits average $290 a week, about half of what the typical family spends on basics and hardly enough to dissuade someone from working. Three, as unemployment has deepened, benefits have become less generous. Earlier this year, lawmakers ended a subsidy to help unemployed workers pay for health insurance and dropped an extra $25 a week that had been added to benefits by last year's stimulus law.
Other opponents would have you believe that the nation cannot afford to keep paying unemployment benefits: a yearlong extension would cost about $60 billion. The truth is, we cannot afford not to. The nation has never ended federal benefits when unemployment is as high as it is now, and for good reason: Without jobs, there is inadequate spending, and that means ever fewer jobs. A wide range of private and governmentstudies show that unemployment benefits combat that vicious cycle by ensuring that families can buy the basics.
Nor do jobless benefits bust the budget. Just the opposite. They do not add to dangerous long-term deficits because the spending is temporary. And because they support spending and jobs, they contribute powerfully to the economic growth that is vital for a healthy budget. Extending the Bush high-end tax cuts would be budget busting, because they are likely to endure, adding $700 billion to the deficit over 10 years. Tax cuts for the rich provide virtually no economic stimulus, because affluent people tend to save their bounty.
Ignoring facts and logic, several Republicans have said that any benefit extension must be paid for with spending cuts elsewhere. That would, in effect, be giving with one hand while taking away with the other. It is not only cruel, but foolish, because it would reduce the economic boost that benefits would provide.
President Obama should pound the table for a clean, yearlong extension of unemployment benefits, and should excoriate phony deficit hawks -- in both parties -- who say that jobless benefits are too costly, even as they pass vastly more expensive tax cuts for the rich.

HEADLINE: Heavyweight For a Requiem

BYLINE: By JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN

 BODY:
SOME people whine about the Automats' closing over lunch at the Russian Tea Room. Others buy cheap lumber at Home Depot but get misty-eyed about how there are no more locally owned hardware stores. Who really ever shopped at Woolworth's? But plenty of us say we miss it.
And a lot of us will pretend to miss the Mercury Grand Marquis when, any day now, the last new one is sold off some dealer's lot.
The Grand Marquis is the last of its kind, a relic of a past not that long past. It's the final full-size, full-frame, nonluxury American sedan with V-8 power, rear drive and a solid rear axle that is available for retail sale to the general public. 
It's the kind of car dad bought because his buddy at the Kiwanis Club owned the dealership and he didn't want something flashy like a Lincoln. A car you could wear a hat in.
General Motors produced its last full-size, rear-drive, body-on-frame cars in 1996; Chrysler's last sedan in this size class was the '81 Newport. Since 2008, Ford has restricted sales of the rugged, industrial-grade Crown Victoria (identical to the Grand Marquis except for the trim) to taxi and police fleets. And the Lincoln Town Car -- a close cousin and workhorse of the livery industry -- aspires to a grandeur that's beyond any Mercury. By the end of the 2011 model year, the Crown Vic and Town Car will be gone too.
Wallowing anachronism that it is, the Grand Ma has its charms. It has two bench seats big enough for six wide bottoms and a vast trunk that may well be able to hold enough tenor tubas for six pairs of lips. It rides as if the tires aren't just smothering out the road's divots, but giving each of them a somber, dignified burial.
For just over $30,000 the Grand Marquis buyer gets a car that's 212 inches long and 78.3 inches wide; that's nearly two feet longer and more than six inches wider than a Toyota Camry. It's even 5.5 inches longer than the big Mercedes-Benz S550 that starts around $92,000.
But it's not easy to get a new 2010 or 2011 Grand Marquis. Mercury dealers have been offering the car only by special order, and production for retail customers ceased in October. The few new Grand Marquis sedans that are left are anomalies: canceled orders or excess stock.
For the last two model years there was only one trim level, the LS, with a short list of options: chrome wheels, heated seats, adjustable pedals, a radio with a retro tape-cassette player, a leather-and-wood steering wheel and a ''smoker's package'' (a lighter and an ashtray that fills up one of the cup holders). If you checked all the boxes the $30,685 base price would swell just to $32,295.
No, there wasn't a ''de Sade package.'' (A worn-out joke? Yes -- for old times' sake.)
If you want a sunroof, bring a can opener. Bluetooth? MP3? GPS? Those are technologies from a whole other century than the one for which the Grand Marquis was designed.
Since Ford isn't keeping any Grand Marquis in its fleet of test cars, I rented one from Hertz at the Los Angeles airport. Rental prices vary insanely, sometimes within the space of a few hours or over the term of a single loan. My rate ran just $38 a day after a midloan renegotiation dropped the price down from more than $100 a day. Go figure.
With its bolt-upright cabin and long par-5 decklid, the Grand Marquis's basic styling looked old even when it was new way back in 1992. And much of the car's engineering dates back to the 1970s, not to mention a basic chassis design from 1965. Much of the car feels old. Opening the doors reveals power locks that operate with crude suddenness and black plastic handles that feel cheap to the touch. The doors shut with a hollow, metallic thud, but seal tightly. After two decades of production, Ford knows how to assemble the Grand Marquis, but sophistication isn't part of the deal.
Inside, the front and rear bench seats are covered in leather so plasticized that you don't recognize it as leather. The front bench is split with foldable armrests at the center, but it lacks any discernibly supportive shape. You don't so much sit in this seat as slide in atop it and hope the seat belts keep you from skidding around. It's impossible to find a comfortable conventional seating position.
The back seat, on the other hand, is so squishy-soft that you almost feel you're drowning in it. The space for legs is ample, but the Grand Marquis doesn't have the sort of rear stretch-out room you expect from a car so vast.
From his or her perch, the driver faces a simple instrument panel with a conventional circular speedometer and tachometer. In addition, there's a supplementary digital speedometer that's amazingly accurate -- Ford's cop car heritage shining through. This is one of the few cars around that mounts the shifter for its automatic transmission on the steering column, and it actually works well. And the space it frees up between the front seats is significant.
There are seat-mounted side air bags for driver and front passenger, as well as the expected front bags. But curtain bags over the doors, to protect heads in a side impact, are not available.
The shifter is hooked up to a transmission with only 4 forward gears. (Most automatics now have 5, 6 or more.) And in turn, the transmission is bolted behind a 4.6-liter 2-valve single-overhead-cam engine that makes a pokey 224 horsepower. The engine's initial response is strong, but it quickly runs out of breath and by 5,500 r.p.m. it's exhausted. The transmission sort of slides at that point into the next gear and heaves a sigh of relief.
There's a particular gear whine peculiar to Ford's full-size cars that anyone who rides regularly in Crown Victoria taxis can recognize. But that whine doesn't come after a couple hundred thousand miles of use; it was right there in the Grand Marquis rental car, which showed fewer than 1,000 miles on the odometer when I picked it up. That persistent groan from the rear end indicates just how little effort Ford has put into refining this car over the years.
In a recent test of a 2010 Grand Marquis, InsideLine.com clocked it accelerating from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. in a leisurely 9.3 seconds; it also plowed through a quarter-mile run in 16.8 seconds while reaching 83.9 mph. That's the sort of struggling performance expected of a barebones economy car, not a big sedan that carries a modest E.P.A. fuel economy rating: 16 m.p.g. in the city and 24 m.p.g. on the highway.
That said, somewhere along its developmental journey the Grand Marquis picked up power rack-and-pinion steering that is shockingly sweet, with good on-center feel, precise calibration and good feedback. Of course the feedback from the front P225/60R17 Michelin all-season radials often indicates they are struggling to get some grip, but the driver cannot say he wasn't informed of their desperation.
When pushed hard with the traction control switched off, the initial understeer will give way to a tail-wagging oversteer. But if you're pushing a car that hard, it's not likely to be this car.
With its antediluvian body-on-frame construction, sponge-cake suspension tuning and thick sound deadening, the Grand Marquis will float over an Interstate like a blimp. This is a car unconcerned with carving corners or blitzing across the autobahn. It's built for people who have lived long enough to have already had all the drama they want in their lives. And there's nothing this car does that other Ford products, like the Taurus, don't do better.
A few more of the big Mercurys are being made in St. Thomas, Ontario, for fleet customers. After that, the Grand Marquis will be just another thing that's not here anymore.
Nostalgia is, ultimately, a hard nut to crack. After all, the new Yankee Stadium is better than the old one in almost every way, and Shea Stadium was a pit before it was torn down. But Babe Ruth will never swing a bat in the new park and the Beatles will never rock Citi Field. And your dear departed grandfather will never drive a new Taurus.

HEADLINE: On Global Warming, Start Small

BYLINE: By BRUCE USHER. 
Bruce Usher, an executive in residence at Columbia Business School, is the former chief executive of a company that operates emission-reduction projects.

 BODY:
THE conference on climate change that begins tomorrow in Cancun, Mexico, will be the 13th such annual meeting since 1997, when the Kyoto Protocol, the first and only international agreement to place a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases, was written. This year there will be no such treaty. Why not? Excuses will abound, but finger-pointing misses the crux of the matter, which is that climate change is the most complicated and challenging problem mankind has ever faced.
Climate change is global, as emissions from one country enter the atmosphere and affect every other country. It is created by every form of economic activity, but its effects will not become critical for another generation. Today, it is practically impossible for more than 190 countries to negotiate -- and ultimately ratify -- an agreement that would affect all facets of their economies in order to deal with a problem so far in the future. 
But there is an alternative to this top-down approach to climate change: a bottom-up strategy that stands a much better chance of working. Rather than count on international negotiations to produce an effective strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the United States should build upon the innovative clean-energy developments already under way in individual states. (Disclosure: I invest in clean energy in America and abroad.)
Texas alone produces more electricity through wind power than all but five countries. In California and Arizona, solar energy will soon provide electricity for three million homes. Geothermal energy plants are being built in Nevada. Michigan is making electric cars. And these are only the leaders. Iowa, Oregon and Illinois are also building wind power generators; New Jersey and Florida are investing in solar, and Maine in biomass.
These state-level efforts are already having national impact. Last year, renewable energy accounted for more than half of all the new power generation plants nationwide. Another 40 percent was from natural gas, which emits only half as much carbon dioxide as coal.
Clean energy has strong bipartisan support in the states. Of the 31 that already have laws requiring increased production of renewable energy, 11 are states that vote largely Republican, including Arizona, Kansas, Montana and Texas.
The United States still has a very long way to go to curtail emissions, but the states are heading in the right direction, and national energy policy must build on their efforts. Congress should extend federal financing, tax credits and loan guarantees for renewable energy projects and for upgrading transmission lines. It should also develop clear environmental standards for extracting natural gas from shale. The American desire for energy security and for new jobs creates an opportunity to pass an energy bill in the next Congressional session.
With such a national energy plan in place, the United States could negotiate a bilateral climate agreement with China. Together these two countries account for 42 percent of global emissions of carbon dioxide. By focusing on our shared interests -- innovation in clean energy technology, for example, and the need to develop ways to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal-burning utilities -- our two countries could agree to mutually reduce emissions.
Then, with a strong renewable energy industry at home and a climate agreement with China in hand, the United States would be in a good position to re-engage with the broader international community to negotiate a global cap on greenhouse gas emissions. And given such a sturdy foundation, any agreement coming out of those talks would have a good chance of ratification by Congress.
After more than a decade of international negotiations, it might seem as if working our way through these steps from the bottom up would be like starting over. But it makes no sense to pin all our hopes for averting climate change on a diplomatic process that is difficult to negotiate and impossible to ratify. An approach that begins with changes in domestic policy is far more realistic.
The United Nations would still have a critical role to play, because 65 percent of the needed reductions in emissions will have to be made in the developing world. The United Nations must help developing countries institute the policies that will enable them to finance and deploy low-carbon technologies.
During the two weeks of climate talks in Cancun, more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide will be released into the atmosphere worldwide, adding to the nearly 30 billion tons emitted since last year's failed meeting in Copenhagen. This top-down approach is not effective. A plan that works from the bottom up could achieve the goal of capping global emissions. Before more time runs out, let's start building on the local American success stories already in progress.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expects Soccer's Rise If It Hosts Cup in 2022

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN; Jeffrey Marcus contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Interest in soccer has grown considerably in the United States since it hosted the 1994 World Cup. Major League Soccer is on solid footing, having just completed its 15th season of competition. And American television viewership for the quadrennial World Cup final now outdraws the average audience for the World Series.
Another significant lift will come Thursday if the United States is awarded the 2022 World Cup over Australia, Japan, Qatar and South Korea. On the same day, FIFA, soccer's world governing body, will also award the 2018 World Cup to a European bidder among England, Russia, Portugal/Spain, and Belgium/the Netherlands.
''I think it would change the sport here over the next 12 years,'' said Sunil Gulati, president of the United States Soccer Federation and the 2022 bid committee. ''What happened last summer, with the World Cup being a water-cooler moment, we can build on that. We won't be the N.F.L., but we would have a long run-up to build the game. A lot of cities want to be part of it. 
''I'm not talking about building stadiums or highways. We don't need that. I'm talking about after-school programs, supporting inner-city fields, M.L.S. and the women's game, the ability to play into all that over the next 12 years.''
The United States' bid is among the favorites, but the process has been marred by a corruption scandal. Two members of FIFA's executive committee, Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti, were barred from the sport and fined this month. The sanctions came after reporters from The Sunday Times of London, posing as lobbyists for an American business group, said the men had offered to sell their votes.
A former secretary general of FIFA also told the London newspaper on camera that officials of the joint Portugal/Spain bid for 2018 and the Qatar bid for 2022 had colluded to trade votes in an attempt to solidify their respective chances.
The officials denied any collusion, and FIFA said it found no evidence of vote swapping. Still, FIFA's reputation has been damaged. And many wonder whether Thursday's closed-door votes by 22 members of the soccer body's executive committee will be based on merit and free of unethical practices.
Gulati said he would not comment on the scandal.
''We've done everything we can regarding technical specifications and making our case to the people who are going to vote,'' he said. ''But it's an election. Elections are not always about computer-generated reports and technical specifications.''
The United States' bid finds its strength in experience and preparation. It held what is widely regarded as the most successful World Cup in 1994, one that set the attendance record, 3.5 million.
In 2022, the American bid projects five million ticket sales, worth $1 billion in revenue, and a total economic impact of $5 billion in today's dollars. Bid officials are quick to note that the most tickets bought outside host South Africa were sold in the United States for the 2010 World Cup and that this country's diversity would ensure full stadiums at all matches in 2022.
The monthlong tournament would be held at 9 to 12 stadiums around the United States, to be chosen from a preliminary pool of 18 cities and 21 stadiums, including New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Bid officials believe the American candidacy is particularly attractive because all the necessary stadiums, highways, convention centers and hotels exist.
''Given the world economy these days, and public deficits in places like Greece and Ireland, the ability to put on an event this size without a massive investment of public funds is a big positive,'' Gulati said.
Bid officials will also try to entice FIFA with the prospect of significantly enhanced television rights fees in the United States. ABC, ESPN and Univision paid $425 million to broadcast the 2010 and 2014 World Cups (along with the 2007 and 2011 women's World Cups). But that number is far short of the $894 million that NBC paid for rights to broadcast the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
''We've had a virtual doubling of rights fees'' with every World Cup, Gulati said. ''When you start doubling the sorts of numbers we're at now, they become very big.''
To augment the American bid, M.L.S. officials said they would consider a summer-to-spring schedule that would align with international league play. Sepp Blatter, the FIFA president, has for years urged M.L.S. to alter its schedule.
A revised schedule, among other advantages, would facilitate the signing of international players and ameliorate the problem of M.L.S. stars' leaving their teams for extended periods to play for their national teams, especially in a World Cup year.
Speaking in general of hosting the 2022 World Cup, Don Garber, the M.L.S. commissioner, said: ''There is nothing we could do that would be more important. Soccer is part of our lives. But what we hope the World Cup will do is take a very steady growth track and accelerate that to a place that would never happen without the World Cup, or rather, that will take us much longer.''
Perhaps the primary strengths of two competing bids, Australia and Qatar, are that neither country has hosted a World Cup. And Blatter has been enthusiastic about rotating the world's biggest sporting event from one part of the globe to another. The first trip to Africa last summer was widely considered a success.
Australia received high marks for hosting the 2000 Summer Olympics. And it is a sporting-mad country. But the time zone would be inconvenient for European broadcasts.
Qatar would take the World Cup to the Middle East for the first time. Its plan to build its stadiums in a compact area could also prove alluring. But some question whether the tiny nation of 1.7 million would have the necessary infrastructure and hotel rooms to accommodate hundreds of thousands of visitors. Most problematic may be health concerns for players and spectators in summer temperatures that can reach 120 degrees, though officials plan to equip the stadiums with cooling systems.
Japan and South Korea co-hosted the 2002 World Cup; like the United States, these nations have completed stadiums and expertise at running such a sprawling event. Blatter has spoken of wanting to use soccer as a means of helping unite the Korean peninsula, though North Korea ignored an offer to host some matches in 2002. And its recent shelling of a South Korean village underscored the tense relations between the countries.
But what may ultimately undercut the Japanese, South Korean and Australian bids is that China has expressed some interest in hosting the 2026 World Cup. FIFA would undoubtedly be eager to take the tournament to the world's largest market.
Thus, the United States' hopes remain high for 2022. To lose the vote ''would be an enormous missed opportunity,'' Garber said.
''That would certainly slow down the process,'' he added, ''and everyone associated with the sport, whether here in the United States or at FIFA, would have to wait even longer to unleash the power of 320 million consumers who are intrigued by and excited about this sport.''

HEADLINE: Houston, Oil Capital, Takes Steps Toward Green

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
At the recently opened farmers market outside Houston's City Hall, Laura Spanjian, the city's peppy new sustainability director, was in her element.
With a reusable cloth bag tucked under her arm, she bounded around the colorful cluster of stands, shaking hands and pointing out vendors -- raw foods! local ingredients! grass-fed Texas beef! -- as a Latin band played.
If this does not sound like Houston's style, well, get used to it. The nation's fourth-largest city, the sprawling capital of the oil industry, has recently embarked on a variety of green initiatives in an effort to keep up with the times and, it hopes, save money.
The local food craze is the most visible of these efforts, with the opening of the weekly farmers market in October and the planting of nearby Michelle Obama-style vegetable gardens tended by city hall staff members. But Houston is also transforming itself into an electric-car hub, a national leader in wind-power investment and an advocate for energy efficiency. 
''It's a city rethinking what it needs to be successful,'' said Stephen Klineberg, co-director of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at Rice University.
In recent decades, Mr. Klineberg said, as Houston's economy has diversified beyond oil, the city has realized that it needs to pay attention to quality-of-life issues if it wants to attract talented people.
''Our problem,'' he said, ''is that people who don't live in Houston say, 'Yuck, why would you want to live in Houston?' ''
One recent arrival who ignored the yuck factor is Ms. Spanjian, who this spring brought her Smart Car from San Francisco and assumed the new position of sustainability director. She had previously worked on greening San Francisco's transportation and utility sectors. Once in Houston, she promptly organized the farmers market and the vegetable gardens as well as programs to encourage office buildings to save energy.
Asked about the differences between Houston and San Francisco, Ms. Spanjian replied that in the Bay Area, ''it's more about greening, less about saving money.'' In Houston, she said, ''it's really about both.''
City officials acknowledge that they must go green in a way that is consistent with Houston's wariness of regulation. This is, after all, the largest city in the country with no zoning. So the city government is trying to lead by example.
''We're really trying to show you can do this in your own backyard,'' said Ms. Spanjian, pointing out that the vegetable gardens and the farmers market required minimal expenditures (some of the garden materials came through donations from the H.E.B. grocery chain and other groups).
Another Houston initiative, the ''green office challenge,'' started in September. It encourages businesses to compete with one another to reduce water and energy consumption, with recognition by the mayor and the news media as the proffered incentive. Some 220 businesses are participating.
Separately, the city also plans to use $3 million in federal stimulus money to help offices become more energy efficient by shouldering 20 percent of the cost of improvements.
''It's the Houston way. We try to persuade, we try to incentivize, we try not to mandate,'' said Mayor Annise Parker, who took office early this year.
Ms. Parker's own choices seem emblematic of the new Houston. After spending 20 years in the oil and gas industry, she now drives a hybrid vehicle (though a Toyota Highlander, a sport-utility vehicle), and at home she has a compost bin and collects rainwater.
Some of Houston's green initiatives were begun under Ms. Parker's predecessor, Bill White. Mr. White placed special emphasis on air-quality initiatives. Pollution is a perennial problem for Houston, which remains one of three areas in Texas that does not comply with federal ozone standards. The city will fall even further behind federal requirements when the Environmental Protection Agency announces tighter nationwide ozone requirements, perhaps by year's end.
Mr. White, a former official with the federal Department of Energy, was keen on energy-efficiency, too. His administration approved a measure to change traffic light bulbs to energy-sipping LEDs (light-emitting diodes) from incandescent bulbs. The city will finish replacing bulbs at all intersections next year, with the initiative paying for itself in less than six years, after up-front costs of $15 million.
Mr. White also got Houston running on Texas wind power. Today, the city is the nation's largest municipal buyer of green power.
Mr. White encountered resistance, Ms. Parker said, when he aggressively prodded refineries that lay outside Houston's city limits (but affected Houston's air quality) to cut their emissions. Ms. Parker said she would stand up for Houston's interests, but try not to ruffle feathers unnecessarily.
''I pledged to the other mayors that I wasn't going to surprise them,'' she said.
But even for Ms. Parker, things have not always been smooth. A rare city mandaterequiring that Houstonians use compostable or biodegradable bags to process their yard waste resulted in phone calls and e-mails from upset residents, who had to pay extra for the bags. The initiative was formulated under Mr. White, but did not take effect until April. Owners of single-family homes now must put their yard waste out for composting in the bags or compost themselves; the city says the program saves $1.5 million a year, due to less lawn cuttings going into the landfill.
Recycling is another challenge. The city's recycling rate has lagged badly, although it is improving. Roughly 26 percent of the waste from single-family homes, small multifamily units and municipal buildings gets recycled, up 10-fold from two years ago, Ms. Spanjian said. Two major companies are opening single-stream waste processing facilities in the area.
Perhaps Houston's most publicized initiative involves electric cars. Starting early next year, the city -- which already has plenty of hybrids among its fleet -- will become among the first recipients of Nissan's all-electric Leaf. The city government is expecting to buy 30 of the cars next year with financial help from the federal government. Earlier this month, the electric company NRG Energy rolled out an initiative to put in 50 public charging stations around the city by mid-2011.
Of course, electric cars will do nothing to ease Houston's infamous traffic and sprawl.
''If you're going to be a car city, you might as well acknowledge that and help people get into cars that don't pollute as much,'' Ms. Parker said.
The city is also considering California-style incentives that would allow electric cars into the high-occupancy-vehicle lanes or reduce their tolls. The city also wants more light-rail lines.
For an oil-and-gas megalopolis that rose out of the swampy bayous, all of these sustainability initiatives amount to, at a minimum, a substantial change of emphasis. Indeed, Mr. Klineberg of Rice cites ''tons of resistance'' over the years from the likes of road builders and oil companies.
Ms. Parker, for her part, insists she is not trying to change Houston's identity as the oil and gas capital -- only to make the city ready for the innovators and entrepreneurs of the future.
''I'm not trying to run away from our past -- 'Oh, we used to be oil and gas, and now we're renewable,' '' she said. ''Houston has always been about finding a better way to do something.''

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Asking China to Act Like the U.S.

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A fundamental tenet of foreign policy says that nations will seldom voluntarily act against what they have determined, for whatever reason, to be their own national interest.
Somebody needs to tell that to the United States when it comes to China, many foreign policy experts say.
A key part of America's relationship with China now turns on a question that is, at its heart, an impossible conundrum: How to get Beijing to make moves that its leaders don't think are good for their country?
From economics to climate change to currency to Iran and finally culminating with North Korea last week, America has sought to push, prod and cajole China, to little or no avail.
Beijing has resisted letting its currency rise because it depends on the cheap yuan to drive its export-heavy economy. China has balked at stiff sanctions to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions because it needs access to Iran's oil and gas fields to fuel its own growth. Beijing doesn't want to curb carbon emissions because its ability to lift hundreds of millions of people into the middle class over the coming years is directly linked to its increased use of energy. 
And, finally, Beijing has recoiled at reining in its unruly neighbor to the east, as the Obama administration implored it to do last week, because it doesn't want to destabilize North Korea's secretive, hermit regime to an extent that could lead to the government's collapse and the North's eventual reunification with South Korea.
''China isn't 100 percent on board with U.S. efforts,'' said Andrew L. Oros, an Asia expert at Washington College, in Chestertown, Md., because Beijing is ''concerned with the idea of a unified Korea with U.S. troops stationed there.''
That concern has left a succession of American governments attempting the impossible.
''Basically, the U.S. wants China to do what the U.S. wants it to do,'' said Rodger Baker, vice president for strategic intelligence at Stratfor, a geopolitical risk analysis company. ''We want to make sure that the world stays as the United States would like to see the world. Which means making China subservient to us in some cases. In the case of North Korea, the Chinese see it as the United States pushing its policy on China and not allowing the Chinese to make their own policy, while removing from China one of the tools that it has decided it needs for its own interests.''
In this case, that tool would be a divided Korea, with a North Korea that is beholden to and wholly dependent on China serving as a buffer against American encroachment in China's backyard.
But the conundrum extends far beyond last week's double Korean-peninsula whammy, which involved not only North Korea's deadly shelling of a South Korean military installation, but also the disclosure of a just-completed centrifuge plant that could one day enable North Korea to enrich uranium into nuclear fuel and add to its arsenal of 8 to 12 nuclear weapons. All of that led to the broad effort from the Obama administration to enlist China to rein in Pyongyang.
So far, China is not biting, and will not bite, on either North Korea or the host of other issues, some experts say, until the United States changes not only its tactics, but the entire way that American governments view Beijing.
''We're still struggling with a post-unilateralist hangover,'' said David Rothkopf, author of ''Running the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power.''
That hangover, he says, leads Americans to believe ''that we're the sole remaining superpower and the objective of our foreign policy is to get people to go along with that. To fall into step with our worldview. But the reality is, that's not what the future holds.''
Rather, Mr. Rothkopf argues, the United States is heading into a future in which countries like China, with independent sources of power, are not reliant on or easily influenced by the United States, and so are pursuing their own national interests.
Some Obama administration officials say that they are aware of this shift, and have begun to adapt their strategy toward China accordingly. Mr. Obama's recent trip to India, in which he endorsed India's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, should be viewed not only in the context of America and India, a senior administration official said, but America and China as well. ''It's part of a strategy in which China risks seeing the United States forming alliances in its neighborhood, which may not be to Beijing's liking,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Likewise, Mr. Obama's decision to accelerate the deployment of an American aircraft carrier group to the Yellow Sea for joint exercises with South Korea was meant in part to drive home a message to Beijing. Aware that China doesn't like any kind of display of American military might in its backyard, Obama administration officials are hoping to change Beijing's cost-benefit analysis until it decides that restraining North Korea is a lesser evil than seeing more American sailors playing war games outside its door.
''That's not a threat,'' the administration official said. ''It's a reality.''
But in the past three weeks, the United States has seen, in rapid-fire succession, China's own determination to push back against American demands. At the Group of 20 leaders summit meeting in Seoul on Nov. 11, Mr. Obama tried to get the world to come down hard on China for its devalued currency, and saw Beijing turn the tables. Instead of America leading the world in hectoring China, Beijing led the world in hectoring the United States for a recent ''quantitative easing'' move by the Federal Reserve that international critics said had artificially lowered the value of the American dollar.
Coming so soon after the G-20 debacle, the North Korea impasse demonstrates the limits of American attempts to bend Beijing to its will, and a new reality that is emerging: a Sino-American relationship that, foreign policy experts say, must be carefully calibrated to balance American demands against what Beijing can be realistically persuaded to do.
Some conservative critics of the Obama administration say that the United States can manage this new reality only if it is tougher in its demands of Beijing. ''I would turn up the pressure on China to reunite the Korean peninsula,'' said John Bolton, who was the United States ambassador to the United Nations in the Bush administration. ''This division is unnatural, and they need to get on the right side of history. And in the meantime, I would strangle North Korea economically, ramping up the P.S.I. activities,'' a reference to military maneuvers in the Yellow Sea.
''I'd cut off all food aid; that's turning up the pressure,'' Mr. Bolton said. ''What Obama's doing right now is just rhetoric.''
Mr. Rothkopf, for his part, counters that it will take more than pressure to get Beijing to yield. He says that the United States must first determine the areas where China won't bend, and work with Beijing to find compromises so that America is not in the impossible situation of trying to tell China to act against its own national interests. And the United States should work furiously to build up alliances with other countries in the region, he said.
''We have moved from the cold war era of bipolar reality through the brief bubble of sole superpower unilateral fantasy into a world of a new multipowered system which requires old-fashioned balance-of-power diplomacy,'' Mr. Rothkopf said. The result, he said, may be that ''all of a sudden, the old cobweb-infested State Department is more important than it's been in many, many years.''

HEADLINE: The Shoppers' Republic of China

BYLINE: By BROOK LARMER

 BODY:
Ms. Li could never shop at Louis Vuitton. Shaking her head, the 50-year-old woman watched customers in one of Beijing's fanciest malls glide past a velvet rope into the French fashion house's three-level store, where top-end handbags sell for more than twice China's per-capita annual income. Her problem, Li told me, wasn't that she was too poor, but too chic. ''Even common people have L.V. bags these days,'' said Li, who owns a hotel in China's northeast. Li chose what she considered a tasteful gift for the young man who accompanied her in the mall that afternoon: a $2,400 Prada bag. 
This was a mere tri e compared with the haul of Tian Mingqiao, a 38-year-old iron-ore importer I met later that day. Nodding toward his companion, who was laden with shopping bags, the plump businessman in a velvet blue blazer said that he had just dropped $8,000 on shoes and clothing. A special occasion? No, he said, ''I just had some free time.''The world is counting on the spending of consumers like Li and Tian. Even as other countries still reel from the global financial crisis, China's nouveaux riches -- and all riches here, even modest ones, are nouveaux -- are engaged in a frenzy of consumption. China is still a relatively poor country, with a per-capita annual G.D.P. (less than $7,000) that lags behind that of Peru or Thailand. The average Chinese family, especially in the country's vast hinterlands, spends little on consumer items beyond necessities, socking away much of its income for education and health care. But in the large cities along the eastern seaboard, the wealth from China's sustained economic boom is highly concentrated -- and increasingly conspicuous. ''This is a new era of spending in China,'' says Nick Debnam, head of Asian-Pacifc consumer markets for the accounting and advisory rm KPMG. ''Twenty years ago, these families didn't have washing machines. Now they're debating what brand of plasma TV to buy.''This year China leapfrogged the United States to become the world's No. 2 consumer of luxury goods, trailing only -- for the moment -- Japan. There are now more billionaires in China than in any country but the United States. Beijing alone has some 150,000 residents worth more than $1.5 million. The numbers don't hit home until you and yourself, as my wife and I recently did, trying to squeeze a Honda into a parking space next to not one, but two Ferraris. A real prize for foreign retailers, however, are the approximately 200 million members of China's rising middle class. ''Where else in the world have people doubled their wealth in the past seven years?'' asks Paul French, co-author of ''Fat China,'' a book about Chinese consumption. These consumers don't just sip green-tea lattes at Starbucks (around 400 mainland stores). They dress in Mango clothes (100 stores), apply Japanese Shiseido cosmetics (sold in 5,000 outlets) and buy hairy crabs -- to eat -- at Wal-Mart (190 stores).The ultimate purveyor of middle-class dreams is the Swedish home-furnishings giant Ikea. Every weekend, thousands of Chinese shoppers swarm through the 463,000-square-foot Ikea megastore on the outskirts of Beijing, one of eight outlets in China. These excursions are only partly about shopping for couches, which are often beyond the means of the typical visitor; they also over amusement and relaxation. On a recent Saturday afternoon, I found Liu Ping and her son occupying a model apartment on the third floor. As other customers cycled through, Liu reclined in an Ikea chair while her 18-month-old son, Hua Xianrui, slept on the Ikea bed, tucked under an Ikea duvet. ''My husband will join us here after he gets off work,'' said Liu, 30, who spends as much as six hours -- and $160 -- on her monthly visits to Ikea. ''We come early because it's fun for me to see the model rooms, and Hua Xianrui always has a nice place to nap.''Beijing's most fashionable outdoor mall, Sanlitun Village, is a maze of colorful glass buildings where the buzz is more Harajuku than Fifth Avenue. The mall's centerpiece is the two-story, glass-and-silver Apple store lled with hundreds of people trying out the latest iPads and iPhones. Outside, beyond a phalanx of black-suited security guards, I met Yang Hongquan, a 38-year-old oil-company employee. He joined the scrum at the store every day for three days, futilely trying to get the newly released iPhone 4 -- then spent three weeks trying to reserve one online. That day, Yang even staggered to the store at 2:30 a.m. in the mistaken belief that his iPhone 4 would be delivered then. When I met him, Yang was nally cradling the phone. At $750, it cost about a month's salary. ''I'm not rich,'' Yang said, ''but I just had to have this.''The status seeking among China's superwealthy has warped into another dimension. Not long ago, a pink limo rolled up to a fancy Western restaurant, spilling out a provincial coal-mining boss and four young women dressed ''like Barbie dolls,'' one of the restaurant's staff members recalled. The magnate ordered two bottles of Petrus wine -- at $22,000 a bottle -- and the nest food on the menu: caviar, oysters, lobster. Asked afterward what he thought, the man brusquely declared, ''That was the most disgusting food I have ever eaten.'' Even so, the boss pulled out a briefcase and paid the bill -- $51,000 -- in cash.

 BODY:
THE NEWS Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg reached a deal that will
allow Catherine P. Black, a media executive, to become the city's next schools chief.
BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Bloomberg agreed to appoint a career educator to serve as Ms. Black's second-in-command after New York State's education commissioner threatened to block her appointment. Ms. Black, the chairwoman of Hearst Magazines, has spent a lifetime in the media business but has had virtually no exposure to public schools. 
THE NEWS A man NATO and Afghan officials met with and paid money to over a period of months in the belief that he was a senior Taliban commander negotiating a peace settlement turned out to be an impostor.
BEHIND THE NEWS The discovery appeared to dash American hopes that the Taliban was willing to talk peace and moderate its demands. A (bona fide) former Taliban commander who sometimes acts as a go-between with the group said of the Taliban, ''They never accept peace and they want to keep on fighting -- they are not tired.''
THE NEWS American corporate profits in the third quarter were the highest on record in nominal terms. The Commerce Department put the figure at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.659 trillion.
BEHIND THE NEWS Good times for corporations, to be sure, though not quite a record when viewed in comparison with the size of the economy: at 11.2 percent of gross domestic product, profits still have a little way to go to top their 2006 heights (just over 12 percent) or the spike during the Korean War (about 13 percent).
THE NEWSTom DeLay, a powerful and divisive Republican leader on Capitol Hill who resigned from Congress in 2006, was convicted of money laundering and conspiracy by a jury in Texas.
BEHIND THE NEWS The case turned on $190,000 in corporate donations that Mr. DeLay's political action committee turned over to the Republican National Committee in 2002, which then paid out money to candidates of Mr. DeLay's choosing. Prosecutors called it a scheme to evade a state law barring corporate contributions; Mr. DeLay said it was just an innocent coincidence.
THE NEWS An effort to get travelers to protest new security measures at airports on one of the busiest days of the year, called National Opt-Out Day by its promoters, fizzled.
BEHIND THE NEWS Few travelers heeded calls to decline screening by new full-body scanners and request a hand search instead, so the checkpoint chaos that organizers hoped to produce never materialized. Even so, they claimed success, because they got people talking about whether scanners and pat-downs were needlessly invasive of privacy (most people say no).

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths SCHOETTLE, FERDINAND PAUL

 BODY:
SCHOETTLE--Ferdinand Paul, Jr. Ferdinand P. Schoettle (Andy) died November 24 in Vero Beach, Florida from cancer. He was the son of Louise White Schoettle of Villanova and Ferdinand P. Schoettle of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
Professionally, Andy was a nationally recognized scholar of federal and state tax law and policy. He received his A.B. degree from Princeton University. He received his LL.B. degree with high honors and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in economics from Harvard University. During law school, he was an Editor of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating from law school, Andy clerked for Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He then worked for the United States Treasury Department in the Office of Tax Legislation Counsel and for Senator Joseph Clark. From 1963 to 1966, he practiced law at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in Philadelphia. He joined the University of Minnesota Law School faculty in 1967. As a professor of law, he taught courses in state and local taxation, federal taxation, law and public policy (including tax policy), and economics for lawyers. He was a Guest Scholar at the Brookings Institute, Visiting Professor at Uppsala University in Sweden and a visiting scholar at Harvard Law School. He formally retired from teaching in 2008. Andy's passion in his life was sailing. Over his sailing career, Andy owned and raced a variety of boats including J boats, Scows, Lasers and Finns. He began sailing in Mantoloking, New Jersey on Barnegat Bay, and he raced on the East Coast, in the Mid West, and in Europe, winning or placing in top positions in many regattas. He skippered a 5.5M in the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia finishing fourth and was on the United States Olympic team in the 1960 Olympics in Naples, Italy. He was inducted into the Barnegat Bay Hall of Fame this past summer. Outside of sailing, Andy had a love for the outdoors. He spent a great deal of time in the mountains around Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He loved to hike, ride horseback and fly-fish on the Snake River. Andy is survived by his two sons, Michael and Derek Schoettle, a daughter, Katherine Long, six grandchildren, and four siblings Michael B. Schoettle, Joan Carville, Polly Miller, and Lucile Ford. There will be a Memorial Service in remembrance of Andy's life this June in Mantoloking, New Jersey. Donations are being accepted in his name to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.

HEADLINE: U.S. and South Korea Begin Joint Naval Exercises

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Ian Johnson contributed reporting from Beijing, and Su-Hyun Lee and Sharon LaFraniere from Seoul.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- The United States and South Korea began naval exercises on Sunday that were meant as a warning to North Korea for recent provocations, including last week's deadly artillery attack on a island populated by South Koreans in the Yellow Sea.
At the same time, China stepped up its diplomatic efforts to cool tempers in the region, with a senior envoy holding a meeting on Sunday morning with South Korea's president and Beijing announcing that it had invited a senior North Korean official for talks this week. China also called for an emergency meeting of the so-called six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program, news agencies reported. 
North Korean artillery was heard Sunday on the island, though no shells landed there and South Korea considered it just a drill, according to a spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The North Koreans also shot off artillery on Friday, after a visit by an American general to the island, called Yeonpyeong.
The announcement of the naval exercises last week raised already heightened tensions, angering both North Korea and its patron, China, and stirring intense speculation in the South Korean news media about whether the North would respond violently.
After the announcement, China warned against ''any military act'' in its exclusive economic zone without permission, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. But virtually all the waters to the west of the Korean Peninsula fall within that 200 nautical mile limit. It was not immediately clear if the American and South Korean flotilla, which included the United States aircraft carrier George Washington, had sailed into that area.
China's diplomatic efforts came after days of entreaties from Washington and its allies to exert a moderating influence on North Korea.
The Chinese envoy, state counselor in charge of foreign affairs, Dai Bingguo, met with South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, as part of a previously unannounced visit to Seoul, according to a senior South Korean official.
China's diplomatic initiative also included the planned talks with Choe Tae-bok, chairman of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, who will pay an official visit to China starting Tuesday.
The United States has hoped that China would use its leverage over North Korea to restrain it from any further attacks, but so far China has not rebuked the North's leaders, at least in public. And when China did finally make a strong public statement late last week on the attack -- the one warning against military actions in its economic zone -- it directed its pique at the United States for the naval exercises.
The show of force was designed both to deter further attacks by the North and to signal to China that unless it reins in its unruly ally, it may see an even larger American presence in the vicinity.
The flurry of diplomacy over the weekend followed days of recriminations by both Koreas. On Saturday, North Korea accused South Korea of using civilians as human shields around military bases on the island. The accusation, reported by the North's official news agency, is apparently an effort to redirect South Korean outrage over the barrage, which killed two civilian construction workers and two South Korean marines.
''If the U.S. brings its carrier to the West Sea of Korea at last, no one can predict the ensuing consequences,'' the report said, using the Korean name for the Yellow Sea.
Also on Saturday, at least two protests were staged in Seoul that criticized both North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, for the attack and South Korea's president for what many here see as the military's failure to make more than a token response.
The bombardment of the island was the first attack on a civilian area since the 1950-53 Korean War, and it enraged the South Koreans far more than previous provocations by the North, including its nuclear weapons tests and the sinking in March of a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors. Despite the findings of an international investigation, North Korea denies responsibility for the sinking.
The North has said that Tuesday's attack was carried out in response to South Korean artillery drills earlier that day on the island, which sits within sight of the North Korean mainland. On the morning of the attack, North Korea warned South Korea not to conduct the drills.
Citing those warnings, North Korea said it had made ''superhuman efforts to prevent the clash at the last moment.'' It also offered an uncharacteristic show of remorse, calling the civilian deaths ''very regrettable.''
The comments were apparently an attempt to present the North's view of events to the South Korean public, which has reacted to Tuesday's attack with uncharacteristic vehemence toward the North.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 9, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A map on Nov. 28 with an article about joint naval exercises by the United States and South Korea in the East China Sea erroneously included one area as part of China's self-proclaimed 200-mile exclusive economic zone, which China had warned the joint naval exercise participants to avoid. The zone does not include the area east of the Korean peninsula. A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message the day the map was published; this correction was delayed because editors failed to follow through on the complaint.

HEADLINE: As San Francisco's Mayor Departs, a Handful of Votes Will Usher In a New One

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- This is a city of some 815,000 people, about 49 square miles and exactly one World Series championship. And how many votes does it take to get elected mayor?
Six.
Already accustomed to some of the most combative -- and liberal -- politics in the land, San Franciscans have recently been rapt by a palace intrigue as to who will run the city, a debate set off by the recent election of the city's popular two-term mayor, Gavin Newsom, as California's lieutenant governor.
Mr. Newsom is due to step down in early January, leaving the job of naming his successor to the city's Board of Supervisors, a highly opinionated 11-member group whose political beliefs range from left-leaning to leftist. All are Democrats, but they come in various shades of blue, including a bloc of five progressives who view traditional Democratic positions as too conservative (a navy blue, perhaps); four moderates (who are solidly teal); and two political wild cards (sea foam, anyone?).
None of those add up to a majority, which does not bode well for a speedy transition of power, say veterans of the local political scene. 
''There seems to me to be millions of ways to get to six,'' said Peter Ragone, a Democratic political consultant and an adviser to Mr. Newsom. ''And none of them actually work.''
At stake is not only the spacious mayoral digs in San Francisco's ornate City Hall, but also the possibility of running the city for nearly a year until voters formally elect a new mayor for a four-year term next November. It is also a position that, because of the city's role as conservative punching bag, has often put its occupants in the national limelight, including Mr. Newsom, who found fame as an early supporter of same-sex marriage, and Dianne Feinstein, who has followed her time as mayor with a long career in the United States Senate.
The job is not necessarily going to be fun. The city is wrestling with an estimated $400 million budget deficit, a stagnant economy, potentially crippling public pension payments and one of the highest costs of living in the nation.
''You're not going to be welcomed into the job of interim mayor as a conquering hero,'' said Tony Winnicker, a mayoral spokesman. ''It's a job fraught with peril.''
Mr. Newsom, who has often tangled with the current board, even injected a bit of his own political maneuvering into the process when he recently suggested that he might delay his inauguration as lieutenant governor -- planned for Jan. 3 -- for several days to allow four new supervisors to be sworn in, thus creating, in his opinion, a more moderate board. (The board cannot formally name a new boss until the old one steps down, though discussions about the process are already under way at weekly board meetings.)
Mr. Newsom has since backed away from that possibility. Well, almost.
''He's 99 percent likely to be sworn in,'' Mr. Winnicker said.
Amid all that uncertainty, the list of potential candidates has continued to grow, and it includes some stolid, serious caretakers (Ed Harrington, the city's public utility chief, for instance) and overtly sentimental and stylish characters like former Mayor Willie L. Brown.
Then there are the members of the board, several of whom harbor mayoral ambitions, including Supervisor Bevan Dufty, a moderate from the gay-friendly Castro district, who has already declared his candidacy for the 2011 election.
One name recently floated was that of Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, a well-known progressive, outspoken gay-rights advocate, stand-up comedian and former member and president of the board who has run unsuccessfully for mayor twice before.
Mr. Ammiano, a San Francisco resident who was elected to the Assembly in 2008, declined to comment. But Mr. Ragone said that Mr. Ammiano could be elected with the support of the board's five-person progressive bloc -- plus a moderate -- to make it to six. But he added, ''it's a risk for him,'' as he could be appointed by the board and then lose in the fall.
That is also the calculation under way for the city's progressive bloc, which has slowly and steadily built political power in the city over the last decade, said Corey Cook, a politics professor at the University of San Francisco. In 2003, progressives nearly elected one of their own, Gonzalez, as mayor, but he lost to Mr. Newsom.
Now Mr. Newsom is leaving, Mr. Cook said, ''and the question is whether this is really the opportunity for the progressives on the board to finally find a way of electing a mayor.''
Also complicating the process is the very nature of the board, a cauldron of personalities that Mr. Cook likened to the Supreme Court. ''It's just hard to imagine there being any consensus,'' he said.
Indeed, it has already taken two meetings -- complete with long and sometimes oddball public comments -- to decide the rules for picking the succession procedures, which will allow each board member to nominate one person for the job -- any voting resident of the city -- but forbids them from nominating themselves. If they are nominated by another board member, sitting supervisors will be asked to leave the board's chambers and be sequestered without a laptop or cellphone, so as to prevent influence peddling or vote trading. (Or Web surfing, for that matter.)
The man overseeing that process, the board president's, David Chiu, said he was impressed so far by the board's professionalism in taking up the succession issue, noting that the votes on the procedures were all unanimous.
That streak, however, is likely to be broken when actual nominees are being voted on. A long stalemate could put Mr. Chiu in the job, at least temporarily; under the city charter, the board president is named acting mayor in the event an interim mayor is not selected.
But last week, Mr. Chiu would not comment on his own ambitions, saying he only wanted the best for the city.
''I think the most important thing is to ensure public safety for the city, readiness in case of any emergencies and to make sure the city government continues to function,'' Mr. Chiu said, sounding vaguely mayoral. ''And working with my colleagues to ensure that an orderly transition occurs.''

HEADLINE: Still the Best Congress Money Can Buy

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
SO America's latest crisis -- until it wasn't -- was airport screeners touching our junk. As this long year lurches toward its end, we all agree that something has gone wrong in America, and we're desperately casting about for a coherent explanation for our discontent, if not a scapegoat. Alas, the national consensus that the T.S.A. and full-body scans might be the source of all evil fizzled in less than a week. Most everyone got to Grandma's house for Thanksgiving without genital distress.
The previous transient scapegoat was the Democrats. They were punished in yet another ''wave'' election -- our third in a row -- where voters threw Washington's bums out. But most of the public remains bummed out nonetheless. In late October, the NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll found that only 31 percent of respondents believed that America was on the right track. When the survey asked the same question after the shellacking, the percent of optimists jumped to ... 32. Regardless of party or politics, there's a sense a broken country can't be fixed. Few have faith that even ''wave'' elections are game-changers anymore. 
The larger explanations for this dysfunction are well-worn by now, from the impotence of the filibuster-bound United States Senate to the intractable polarization of an electorate divided more or less 50-50 since Bush v. Gore. Such is the bipartisanship of the funk that Jon Stewart and Glenn Beck each succeeded in bringing off well attended rallies in Washington to commiserate over the country's political and governmental stagnation -- with each rally offering its competing diagnosis.
For Stewart, the hyperpartisanship of the modern news media remains the nation's curse. ''The country's 24-hour politico pundit panic conflict-onator did not cause our problems,'' he told the throngs at his rally to ''restore sanity,'' but it ''makes solving them that much harder.'' At Beck's rally to ''restore honor,'' the message seemed to be that America's principal failing is a refusal to recognize that God ''is our king.'' If Stewart's antidote was more civility, Beck's was more prayer.
Stewart's point is indisputable as far as it goes. Beck's, not so much: If prayer hasn't cured this highly prayerful nation by now, it may be because our body politic has long since developed an immunity to it. But both rallies, for all the commotion they generated, have already faded to the status of quirky historical footnotes. The reason is that neither addressed the elephant in the room -- or the donkey. That would be big money -- the big money that dominates our political system, regardless of who's in power. Two years after the economic meltdown, most Americans now recognize that that money has inexorably institutionalized a caste system where everyone remains (at best) mired in economic stasis except the very wealthiest sliver.
The Great Depression ended the last comparable Gilded Age, of the 1920s, and brought about major reforms in American government and business. Not so the Great Recession. Last week, as the Fed's new growth projections downsized hope for significant decline in the unemployment rate, the Commerce Department reported that corporate profits hit a record high. Those profits aren't trickling down into new jobs or into higher salaries for those not in the executive suites. And the prospect of serious regulation of those at the top of the top -- the financial sector -- is even more of a fantasy in the new Congress than it was in its predecessor.
Wall Street is already celebrating the approach of bonus season by partying like it's 2007. In The Times's account of this return to conspicuous consumption, we learned of a Morgan Stanley trader, since fired for unspecified reasons, who went to costly ends to try to hire a dwarf for a Miami bachelor party prank that would require the dwarf to be handcuffed to the bachelor. If this were a metaphor -- if only! -- Wall Street would be the bachelor, and America the dwarf, involuntarily chained to its master's hedonistic revels and fiscal recklessness with no prospect for escape.
As John Cassidy underscored in a definitive article titled ''Who Needs Wall Street?'' in The New Yorker last week, the financial sector has paid little for bringing the world to near-collapse or for receiving the taxpayers' bailout that was denied to most small-enough-to-fail Americans. The sector still rakes in more than a fourth of American business profits, up from a seventh 25 years ago. And what is its contribution to America in exchange for this quarter-century of ever-more over-the-top rewards? ''During a period in which American companies have created iPhones, Home Depot and Lipitor,'' Cassidy writes, the industry reaping the highest profits and compensation is one that ''doesn't design, build or sell a tangible thing.''
It's an industry that can buy politicians as easily as it does dwarfs, which is why government has tilted the playing field ever more in its direction for three decades. Now corporations of all kinds can buy more of Washington than before, thanks to the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision and to the rise of outside ''nonprofit groups'' that can legally front for those who prefer to donate anonymously. The money laundering at the base of Tom DeLay's conviction by a Texas jury last week -- his circumventing of the state's post-Gilded Age law forbidding corporate campaign contributions directly to candidates -- is now easily and legally doable at the national level.
There are plenty of Americans who don't endorse Stewart's indictment of cable news; there's even a reasonably large group that doesn't buy Beck's perceived shortfall in American religiosity. But seemingly everyone is aggrieved about the hijacking of the political system by anonymous special interests. The most recent Times-CBS News poll found that an extraordinary 92 percent of Americans want full disclosure of campaign contributors -- far many more than, say, believe in evolution. But they will not get their wish anytime soon. ''I don't think we can put the genie back in the bottle,'' said David Axelrod as the Democrats prepared to play catch-up to the G.O.P.'s 2010 mastery of outside groups and clandestine corporate corporations.
The story of recent corporate political donations -- which we may never learn in its entirety -- is just beginning to be told. Bloomberg News reported after Election Day that the United States Chamber of Commerce's anti-Democratic war chest included a mind-boggling $86 million contribution from the insurance lobby to fight the health care bill. The Times has identified other big chamber donors as Prudential Financial, Goldman Sachs and Chevron. These are hardly the small businesses that the chamber's G.O.P. allies claim to be championing.
Since the election, the Obama White House has sent signals that it will make nice to these interests. While the president returns to photo ops at factories, Timothy Geithner has already met with the chamber's board out of camera range. In a reportorial coup before Election Day, the investigative news organization ProPublica wrote of the similarly behind-closed-doors activities of the New Democrat Coalition -- ''a group of 69 lawmakers whose close relationship with several hundred Washington lobbyists'' makes them ''one of the most successful political money machines'' since DeLay's K Street Project collapsed in 2007. During the Congressional battle over financial-services reform last May, coalition members repaired to a retreat on Maryland's Eastern Shore to frolic with lobbyists dedicated to weakening the legislation.
Such is the ethos in his own party that Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, complained this month that he ''couldn't even get a vote'' for his proposal for a one-time windfall profits tax on Wall Street bonuses. Republicans ''obviously weren't going to vote for it,'' he told Real Clear Politics, but Democrats also demurred, ''saying that any vote like that was going to screw up fund-raising.''
Roughly two-thirds of the New Democrat Coalition's House contingent won re-election on Nov. 2. Now they'll have more Republican allies in both houses of Congress. Tea Party populists -- already being betrayed by one Senate leader, Jon Kyl, on the supposed pledge against earmarks -- may soon be as disillusioned as those Democrats who had hoped Barack Obama's economic team wouldn't look like Wall Street.
For all the McConnell-Boehner rhetorical pandering to Tea Partiers, the health care law will not be repealed by Congress -- and certainly not any provisions that benefit the G.O.P. establishment's friends in the health care industry. Over at FreedomWorks, Dick Armey's Tea-Party-organizing group, there's much belligerent talk of retribution against corporations seen as too friendly to Obama policies -- most notably General Electric. It's all hot air: G.E.'s political action committees gave a total of $1.6 million to politicians in both parties in 2010, and one of its former high-powered lobbyists, Dan Coats, is the newly elected Republican senator from Indiana and a probable member of the Senate Finance Committee.
America needs a rally -- or, better still, a leader or two or three -- to restore not just honor or sanity to its citizens but governance that's not auctioned off to the highest bidder. When it was reported just days before our election that Iran was protecting its political interests in Afghanistan's presidential palace by giving bags of money to Hamid Karzai's closest aide, Americans could hardly bring themselves to be outraged. At least with Karzai's government, unlike our own, we could know for certain whose cash was in the bag.

What a sensible article by David Frum! His observations are rooted in historical reality and eschew the ideological ranting of the Republican right wing. If such views were to prevail among the Republican leadership in Congress, I have no doubt that the next two years could see a constructive partnership between the president and Congress. Then, perhaps we might have a contest between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama in 2012, in which the main issue would be: who can best lead America out of the darkness and into the light? But I fear that the Republican leadership is more intent on settling scores than on following Frum's advice. 
MICHAEL G. ANDERSON Adjunct Professor of History Northern Virginia Community College Arlington, Va.
David Frum's essay offers a rare example of a conservative criticizing conservative blindness. However, Frum displays that blindness too. I lived in the United States for five years before the 2008 election and saw something quite different. Republicans didn't lose the presidency ''largely'' because of the economic collapse. They lost it because under President Bush, the United States invaded Iraq on false pretenses; ignored the laws of war; and responded slowly and pathetically to the suffering of its own citizens during Hurricane Katrina. All of these things eroded America's global standing and self-assurance, which Barack Obama ran in part on a promise to restore. Second, the collapse itself wasn't the Republicans' problem: it was that John McCain inspired no confidence in his ability to address it.

HEADLINE: Got To Get This Right

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
On Nov. 19, Rasmussen Reports published results from a national telephone poll that showed that 47 percent of America's likely voters said the nation's ''best days are in the past,'' 37 percent said they are in the future. Sixteen percent were undecided. Just before President Obama was inaugurated, 48 percent said our best days were still ahead and 35 percent said they had come and gone. This is a disturbing trend.
What's driving it? Let me say what's not driving it. It is not that millions of Americans suddenly started worrying about the national debt. Seriously, do you know anyone who says: ''I couldn't sleep last night. I was tossing and turning until dawn worrying that the national debt was now $14 trillion.'' Sorry, that only happens in contrived campaign ads. 
I think what is driving people's pessimism today are two intersecting concerns. The long-term concern is that people intuitively understand that what we need most now is nation-building in America. They understand it by just looking around at our crumbling infrastructure, our sputtering job-creation engines and the latest international education test results that show our peers out-educating us, which means they will eventually out-compete us. Many people understand that we are slipping as a country and what they saw in Barack Obama, or what they projected onto him, was that he had both the vision and capability to pull America together behind a plan for nation-building at home.
But I think they understand something else: that we are facing a really serious moment. We have to get this plan for nation-building right because we are driving without a spare tire or a bumper. The bailouts and stimulus that we have administered to ourselves have left us without much cushion. There may be room, and even necessity, for a little more stimulus. But we have to get this moment right. We don't get a do-over. If we fail to come together and invest, spend and cut really wisely, we're heading for a fall -- and if America becomes weak, your kids won't just grow up in a different country, they will grow up in a different world.
We have to manage America's foreign policy, and plan its rebuilding at home, at a time when our financial resources and our geopolitical power are more limited than ever while our commitments abroad and entitlement promises at home are more extensive than ever.
That is why I believe most Americans don't want a plan for deficit reduction. The Tea Party's vision is narrow and uninspired. Americans want a plan to make America great again, and at some level they know that such a plan will require a hybrid politics -- one that blends elements of both party's instincts. And they will follow a president -- they would even pay more taxes and give up more services -- if they think he really has a plan to make America great again, not just bring him victory in 2012 by 50.1 percent.
That hybrid politics will require hard choices: We need to raise gasoline and carbon taxes to discourage their use and drive the creation of a new clean energy industry, while we cut payroll and corporate taxes to encourage employment and domestic investment. We need to cut Medicare and Social Security entitlements at the same time as we make new investments in infrastructure, schools and government-financed research programs that will spawn the next Google and Intel. We need to finish our work in Iraq, which still has the potential to be a long-term game-changer in the Arab-Muslim world, but we need to get out of Afghanistan -- even if it entails risks -- because we can't afford to spend $190 million a day to bring its corrupt warlords from the 15th to the 19th century.
Yes, President Obama inherited a huge mess from the reckless Bush team. The Onion was not far off in its satirical headline at inauguration time: ''Black Man Given Nation's Worst Job.'' Obama deserves much more credit than he has received for stabilizing the economy and reviving the auto industry.
But the reason he hasn't gotten it is not just because those nasty Republicans say all those nasty things about him. After all, he owns the biggest bully pulpit in the world. It's because the 40 percent of Americans in the middle who have determined our last two elections don't see an integrated plan for nation-building at home that includes not only more spending but hard choices. The best thing the president could do right now is declare his support for the draft recommendations on how to reduce the country's budget deficit just laid out by the co-chairmen of the White House's fiscal commission, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson. In their plan, everybody takes a hit.
By doing that, Obama could seize control of the debate. The president could say that he doesn't agree with every cut they propose and wants to add his own investments in our future. But their hybrid approach, he could explain, is the only workable course for the country right now -- one he intends to use as the basis for his plan for nation-building in America so that never again will we see polls that indicate that half the country thinks our best days are behind us.

HEADLINE: Raising Performance in Our Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Teaching for America'' (column, Nov. 21):
As a former teacher and the parent of two teenagers in a top-rated public high school, I agree with Thomas L. Friedman: We need to reinvent teaching, learning and assessment in the 21st century so that our students can thrive in a knowledge economy.
But, as Mr. Friedman states, citing Tony Wagner, the Harvard-based education expert, thriving requires the ability to do critical thinking and problem-solving, to communicate effectively and to collaborate. 
Right now, unfortunately, we are ''teaching to the test'' (partly thanks to No Child Left Behind), requiring rote learning and formulaic responses. Children go through the motions, disengaging from the learning process.
For successful education reform, our challenge will be how to measure standards of achievement, on the part of students and teachers, without killing the love of learning, creative thinking and innovation that have always proved America's strong suit.
Susan P. Stone New Canaan, Conn., Nov. 21, 2010
To the Editor:
If students need to develop their abilities to think critically, communicate effectively and collaborate to thrive in the knowledge economy, then Secretary of Education Arne Duncan's Race to the Top is racing in the wrong direction.
Mr. Duncan's emphasis on teacher accountability is quickly being translated into teachers being held accountable for raising math or reading scores, not for raising a student's ability to think, solve problems or collaborate.
Students who are driven to value their own test scores over all else are motivated to act selfishly, not collaboratively. They are encouraged to look for the one right answer, not to take intellectual risks or to entertain alternative solutions.
The best and the brightest college students will not go into teaching and remain in the profession if they are treated as assembly-line managers, evaluated solely by their ability to produce identical, high-testing students.
If we want students to be able to think, then their teachers need to be able to think as well.

To the Editor:
I agree with Thomas L. Friedman that we need to elevate the status of teaching in our country in order to recruit quality teachers consistently.
All the talk about merit pay misses what motivates the best teachers. We -- including those of us who teach at the college level -- care about support for our work, some of which is pay, but also facilities, resources, equipment, reasonable class sizes and so on.
If Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, wants to recruit the best teachers, he needs to make schools better places to work. He needs to convince anti-education and antigovernment conservatives that school budgets and curriculums aren't appropriate places to fight the culture wars.
And he needs to stop antagonizing teachers' unions just to show that he is willing to.

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman notes that in countries like Denmark and Finland that outperform the United States in education, teachers graduate in the top one-third of their classes.
But there is another explanation for why the United States lags behind: poverty. The percentage of children living in poverty in Denmark and Finland is under 3 percent. In the United States the percentage is 21.
Poverty means poor nutrition, substandard health care, environmental toxins and little access to books, all of which have a strong negative effect on school success.
Middle-class American children attending well-financed schools outscore nearly all other countries. But our overall scores are unspectacular because we have such a high percentage of children living in poverty.
Increasing pressure on teachers and parents will not significantly improve achievement, but if we can protect children from the effects of poverty, American tests scores will be at the top of the world.

HEADLINE: A Pot of Gold Called TIF That's Nowhere Near a Rainbow

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative
Any rational soul would assume it's metaphysically certain that the Cubs will win a World Series or Bristol Palin will win ''Dancing with the Stars'' before an American election campaign deals with tax increment financing.
After all, our financial literacy is awful, and it's difficult to understand tax increment financing -- which provides a way to use the rise in tax revenues from property value growth within a designated area suffering from ''blight,'' a so-called TIF district, to finance development within that area. 
But now the acronym TIF symbolizes a new El Dorado, a mythical land of riches, as it collides with the Chicago mayoral campaign. That's due partly to Rahm Emanuel, whose early candidacy has been marked by a sharp ability to corral wealthy donors and a humbling inability to get a renter out of his North Side home.
Mr. Emanuel proposed last week that the city's police shortage be partly addressed by using TIF money to hire officers. It's a far more expedient notion than others he might mull -- like, say, turning some of our well-trained, under-worked firefighters into police officers -- but a serious proposal, nonetheless.
''His plan is creative and thoughtful and likely complies with the state TIF statute,'' said Richard Klawiter, a law partner at DLA Piper L.L.P., who specializes in public financing, including tax increment financing.
The evolving debate spotlights an important, little-understood gambit in municipal economic development. It's no surprise that David Orr, the Cook County clerk, opened an informative news conference on the topic Tuesday by drolly cracking, ''Anybody know what TIFs are?''
Most don't, with even Mr. Orr and top aides unsure exactly how much money is in Chicago's TIF coffers. But Mr. Orr knows the basic reality well. TIF districts are supposed to expire after a certain period, usually 23 years, with the full assessed value of property in the district returning to the tax rolls and creating current market-rate tax revenue for various bodies and services.
The districts are used throughout Illinois and in many other states, and Mayor Richard M. Daley has relied on them as a tool to help transform the lagging Rust Belt economy he inherited in 1989. There are now 158 TIF districts in Chicago, and they generated $519 million last year, Mr. Orr said. In all, there may be a shade over $1 billion in unspent TIF money.
While Mr. Orr contends it's a ''travesty'' that most Chicagoans are clueless about all that money, one can't dispute that TIFs are central to development, especially downtown. And it's hard to dispute how they allow municipalities to support development without raising property taxes.
But Chicago's success explains why critics point to the misuse of TIFs in areas that are clearly not ''blighted,'' as well as to a lack of transparency by city officials.
Theoretically, TIF revenue is not intended for ongoing operations. So it's O.K. to use the money to build a school, but not to pay teachers. While Mr. Emanuel notes that making an area secure via better law enforcement is a precursor to development, why not say the same about picking up garbage and fixing decaying sewers?
Representative Mike Quigley, a North Side Democrat, is a longtime student of TIFs who has criticized the lack of transparency and oversight of individual TIF performance. He doesn't mind ''using the pot for a few short-term things that need to get done,'' Mr. Quigley said, ''but they need to justify themselves a whole lot better than they have.''
The teachers union and others have come his way, asking about exploiting TIF money, driven by the city's shaky finances and concerns about their own self-preservation. And Mr. Daley used nearly $39 million of TIF money -- unilaterally declaring it part of a ''surplus'' -- to help fill a big budget hole this year, though Mr. Quigley cautions that relying on TIFs can't replace a long-term plan.
Elizabeth Holland, who runs Abbell Associates, a real estate investment and development firm, calls TIFs a powerful tool to help areas unable to compete with more advantaged ones. But she and Mr. Orr correctly cite misuse when TIF financing is extended long after the initial goals have been achieved.
A resolutely pragmatic Mr. Emanuel knows he will have to make virtue out of necessity if he wins. And as long as TIFs loom as El Dorado, mayoral candidates and financially-desperate officials will mount expeditions to find what Mr. Orr facetiously tagged our ''pot of gold.''

HEADLINE: Charting His Own Course Against Prevailing Winds

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mavericks are not in vogue these days on Capitol Hill, a place where hyper-partisanship and obduracy seem to be their own rewards.
But Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who played that role long before it had a brand name, is standing against his party on a number of significant issues at a politically dangerous time to do so.
A reliable conservative for decades on every issue, he nonetheless fought President Ronald Reagan -- and prevailed -- on apartheid penalties and over the Philippine presidential election. He went head to head with Senator Jesse Helms in the 1990s over the nomination of William F. Weld, former governor of Massachusetts, as ambassador to Mexico.
Now, in the heat of the post-primary lame-duck Congressional session, he is defying his party on an earmark ban, a bill that would create a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants, a military spending authorization bill and an arms control treaty with Russia. 
He even declined to sign a brief supporting state lawsuits against President Obama's health care law because he saw it as political posturing.
Now Mr. Lugar's willingness to buck his party is leading to talk that he will face a primary challenge from a Tea Party candidate when he runs for re-election in 2012. It is a possibility that Mr. Lugar, who said the current environment in Washington was ''disappointing'' and ''without a doubt'' the most polarized he had seen since joining the Senate in 1977, understands clearly even as he declines to modify his positions.
''I'm always optimistic,'' he said in an interview in his office on Wednesday, ''that good reasoning, good will and proper spirit is going to lead to constructive results even as I describe, as I have, intense polarization that I think is currently there.''
Even after the midterm rout that will remove many long-serving members from Congress, the idea that Mr. Lugar would be vulnerable to a primary challenge is a chilling notion to many Republicans, a symbol of symbolism gone too far.
''If Dick Lugar,'' said John C. Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, ''having served five terms in the U.S. Senate and being the most respected person in the Senate and the leading authority on foreign policy, is seriously challenged by anybody in the Republican Party, we have gone so far overboard that we are beyond redemption.''
Mr. Danforth, who was first elected the same year as Mr. Lugar, added, ''I'm glad Lugar's there and I'm not.''
Mr. Lugar has a long history of carefully chosen battles. He had a deep admiration for Reagan, with whom he worked closely on several military issues, yet at times opposed him.
In the 1980s, Mr. Lugar pressed legislation with tough sanctions against South Africa intended to help end apartheid and free Nelson Mandela, a bill vetoed by Reagan.
''I had the sad responsibility as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee then leading the debate to overthrow his veto,'' Mr. Lugar said. ''The net result of this in due course was the freedom for Nelson Mandela,'' he said, adding that he felt vindicated when Mr. Mandela visited the Capitol for lunch. ''At the time, not everyone in Indiana agreed with this.''
Further, as a United States representative to monitor the Philippine election between Corazon Aquino and Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, Mr. Lugar publicly disagreed with Reagan, who said at the time that voting irregularities had occurred on both sides, while Mr. Lugar saw fraud only on behalf of the Marcos campaign.
As such, disagreeing with his colleagues these days on legislation backed by Democrats seems like small change. ''There is nothing going on presently that seems to me that has the significance to the world or in terms of foreign policy as those two events,'' he said.
The exception, he added, is the New Start treaty, under which the United States and Russia would pare their nuclear arsenals and resume lapsed mutual inspections, a signature foreign policy goal of the Obama administration. Republican colleagues have opposed the treaty and would prefer to push the matter into the 112th Congress, which begins in January, potentially dooming it.
This has upset Mr. Lugar, who called on his colleagues to ''do your duty'' before they broke for Thanksgiving. Nuclear disarmament is an issue Mr. Lugar has pursued most of his career; in the 1990s he teamed with Sam Nunn, then a Democratic senator from Georgia, on their own program to secure and dismantle weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Obama became involved in the Nunn-Lugar efforts as a senator and traveled with Mr. Lugar to Russia in 2005.
Mr. Lugar's recent breaks with his party have stirred the attention of Indiana Tea Party groups, who have him in their sights. ''Senator Lugar has been an upstanding citizen representing us in D. C.,'' said Diane Hubbard, a spokeswoman for the Indianapolis Tea Party. ''But over the years, he has become more moderate in his voting.''
Removing him ''will be a difficult challenge,'' Ms. Hubbard conceded. ''But we do believe it's doable, and we think the climate is right for it and we believe it is a must.''
Mr. Lugar said he understood that despondence over the economic crisis, a sense that government is more intrusive and a fear that the country's position on the global stage is becoming more precarious ''are the underlying concerns'' of partisan troubles. But, he said, ''The people speaking to them are speaking to them in extremes.''
While Republicans enjoyed much success in the midterms in Indiana, most winning candidates had tenuous or no ties to the Tea Party movement. One thing going for Mr. Lugar about 2012, said Matt Bergbower, an assistant professor of political science at Indiana State University, ''is the Tea Party here has been sort of secondary in nature.''
Mr. Lugar will leave nothing to chance. He conducted an internal poll after the election that showed that his popularity was high, and wrote a three-page letter to a family he saw featured in a newspaper, identified as Tea Party supporters, explaining his background as a small-business man and an observant Methodist.
''I'm very conscious of it,'' Mr. Lugar said of a primary threat. ''I've been in public life a long time.''
But in the end, he said, ''I will continue to be Dick Lugar, and I will try to do the best job I can'' in explaining his positions to the people of Indiana. ''It's not my nature to simply seek controversy.''

Re ''A Forecast Obama Can Love'' (Strategies, Nov. 21), in which the Yale economist Robert C. Fair says economic data point toward the president's re-election in 2012: 
Professor Fair might want to add something to his model: the possibility that Mr. Obama will endorse the preliminary recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson deficit-reduction commission. The commission wants to cut tax rates in exchange for fewer tax deductions, and if the president endorses the plan, Republicans in Congress would have a quandary as they decided whether to accept or reject it. If the Republicans say no, the president could argue in his re-election campaign that the Republicans are against a plan for lower tax rates and deficit reduction.

HEADLINE: A G.O.P. CHAIRMAN SEEKS NEW POWER FOR WATCHDOGS

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Republican who will lead the chief investigative committee in the House is planning to vastly expand scrutiny of the Obama administration by seeking new subpoena powers for dozens of federal agency watchdogs in hopes of using their investigations and his own in an aggressive push to cut spending and shrink the government.
The Republican, Representative Darrell Issa of California, who will take over as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has said the government needs ''to go on a diet'' to help erase the annual budget deficit of $1.4 trillion. His goal as chairman, he said in a recent speech, is to ''focus on places where money can be saved, where we can literally close agencies or subagencies or programs.''
It is a far broader policy mandate than was embraced by predecessors in both parties, who viewed their role as chief Congressional inquisitor of the executive administration. ''What my committee has to do is, it has to stretch what it has done in the past,'' Mr. Issa said. 
His agenda may surprise some Congressional Democrats and White House officials who are bracing for Mr. Issa to paper Washington with investigative subpoenas in a broader crusade to bring down President Obama.
But it is in sync with the Republican leadership's desire to be seen as concentrating on problems of concern to voters rather than partisan combat. The soon-to-be House speaker, John A. Boehner, has told top Republicans on every committee that their efforts, including oversight of government operations, should focus on the economy and jobs and especially on ferreting out waste, fraud and abuse with an eye toward cutting spending.
Mr. Issa has already drawn up a list of big targets: $40 billion a year in fraud or waste in Medicare; tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to the government-controlled mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; $8.5 billion in losses by the Postal Service in the last fiscal year; tens of millions of dollars spent on redundant programs within federal agencies or squandered through corrupt contracting procedures.
Mr. Boehner and Mr. Issa are also counting on other Congressional committees to step up their oversight efforts. The Ways and Means Committee, for instance, along with the Energy and Commerce Committee, will pick apart aspects of the new health care law. The Financial Services Committee will scrutinize the administration's efforts to tighten regulation of Wall Street.
For Mr. Issa's committee, which can delve into any corner of the government, the more policy-driven crusade is purposely devised to steer clear of the reputation for hectoring and henpecking that Congressional Republicans earned during the Clinton administration when they issued more than 1,000 subpoenas and repeatedly tied White House lawyers into knots, ultimately impeaching the president.
To that end, Mr. Issa has sought to play down the unfettered power to compel testimony and force the production of documents through subpoenas that he will gain with his new post in January. Instead, he has put greater emphasis in recent weeks on pursuing legislation to grant subpoena power to the inspectors general in dozens of federal agencies, internal watchdogs who he believes are even better-positioned to hunt for waste.
The current oversight committee chairman, Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, and Mr. Issa jointly supported a bill authorizing subpoena powers for inspectors general, but Democratic leaders did not make it a priority.
The focus on spending may create less tension than more politically focused inquiries, like investigating what inducements White House officials might have offered Democratic primary challengers to step aside in favor of the Democratic Party's preferred candidates.
But there is still likely to be a blizzard of investigations compared with the last two years, during which Mr. Issa repeatedly accused Congressional Democrats of giving the Obama administration a free pass.
And Mr. Issa (pronounced EYE-suh) is already cultivating one of the highest profiles in the new Republican majority.
He is the richest man in the House, having made a fortune by making and selling car alarms, including the Viper, which features his own commanding voice declaring, ''Please step away from the car.'' And he is now clearly intent on making a name for himself sounding alarms of a different sort about the Obama administration.
On Rush Limbaugh's radio show before the midterms, he called Mr. Obama ''one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times,'' only to apologize later and say he did not mean to call Mr. Obama personally corrupt.
He has also threatened to investigate the so-called policy czars, including Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard law professor who was chosen to create the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Mr. Issa has declined interview requests in recent weeks. Aides said he was waiting for his formal appointment as chairman, which is expected this week. But Mr. Issa has made no secret of his plans, which he has described in public remarks before and after the election and in a 17-page blueprint for greater oversight that he issued in September.
He has said he wants his panel's seven subcommittees each to hold two hearings a week for 40 weeks beginning at the start of the new Congress in January.
In response, Earl E. Devaney, the chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which oversees government stimulus spending, quipped to fellow inspectors general: ''Guess where some of us are going to be hanging out this year?''
But even before he sets after the executive branch, Mr. Issa is fighting a more immediate battle, preventing cuts to his own committee by Republican leaders. ''That's a case I have to make,'' Mr. Issa said in a speech to investigators, auditors and prosecutors at a conference on fraud prevention in Philadelphia this month. ''I have already made it to Leader Boehner and Eric Cantor,'' he said, ''that oversight on my committee cannot be cut just to make some symbolic statement, that I am going to need the resources.''
Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor, who will be the Republican majority leader, have made it clear that that they intend to lead by example, potentially cutting back in the House itself.
The oversight committee now has about 80 staff members for the majority and 40 for the minority. Aides to Mr. Issa said it was not yet clear if those numbers would hold steady.
In recent months, in his role as the senior Republican on the oversight committee, Mr. Issa has courted the inspectors general, raising serious questions, for instance, about the administration's dismissals of the inspectors general for Amtrak and for the Corporation for National and Community Service.
In the speech in Philadelphia, Mr. Issa urged the inspectors general to work with him.
''It is important that we consider that we are as close to a team as we have ever been starting in January,'' he said.
The federal deficit cannot be closed simply by rooting out waste and fraud, and Mr. Issa readily acknowledges that many examples he cites will save what amounts to relative pennies in a $3.5 trillion budget.
But his fierce commitment to do his part is the sort of rallying cry for smaller government that lifted Republicans to victory.
For his committee to succeed, he said, ''We are going to need sources of waste that go beyond just corruption, sources of waste that go into the question of why do we have, even within one cabinet position, seven or eight different groups doing the same thing.''
In a brief conversation with reporters just off the House floor the other day, Mr. Issa expressed little interest in pursuing questions about the scientific basis for some Environmental Protection Agency rules, suggesting that there were not sufficient taxpayer savings to be found.
''I'll have limited resources and limited time,'' he said. ''I am looking for the largest dollars of waste.''

HEADLINE: Robust Sales For Holiday Weekend

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta, Ted Siefer from Boston, and Ian Lovett from Santa Monica, Calif.

 BODY:
More Americans went shopping over the Thanksgiving weekend than in recent memory, and online shopping accounted for the highest percentage of the weekend's sales yet.
The average amount spent per person from Thursday to Sunday was about $365, more than a 6 percent increase over last year, according to a survey of about 4,300 Americans by the National Retail Federation, a trade group that reported results on Sunday afternoon.
And an estimated 212 million people shopped, up from 195 million last year. That is the highest number of Thanksgiving weekend shoppers since the first survey in 2004.
Spending on discretionary items rather than bargain-basement discounts seemed to help push the weekend total to a high of $45 billion, up from about $41.2 billion recorded in the last two years. 
Spending over the holiday weekend usually accounts for about 8 to 9 percent of the season's sales, but Ellen Davis, a federation spokeswoman, cautioned it was not always a predictor of how busy the holiday season would be. In 2008, one of the worst holiday seasons in recent years, survey respondents said they had spent about $373 on average, a record high.
''It's important to keep the economy in mind here. Sometimes Black Friday is not an indicator of the holiday season, because people are so focused on deals that they'll get themselves up early,'' she said, while in better economic times, they will shop even on days without huge promotions.
A broader picture of early holiday performance will be available on Thursday, when several companies report November sales at stores open at least a year.
Online, results were strong.
Though companies traditionally began their online holiday sales push the Monday after Thanksgiving, this year, they emphasized promotions on Thanksgiving Day and the day after, often called Black Friday, and the efforts seemed to work. About 33.6 percent of weekend shoppers bought online, which, according to the federation's study, is the highest percentage ever.
Other data suggested similar increases in online spending. On Thanksgiving, online sales increased 33 percent over a year earlier, while on Friday, sales increased 15.9 percent, according to Coremetrics, an I.B.M. company, which gathers actual online sales results of more than 500 retailers, including Macy's, Williams-Sonoma and Petco.
MasterCard Worldwide said its Friday transaction data indicated that spending in the category that includes online shopping was accelerated even faster this year than it did the year before.
''People are doing more of their shopping online,'' said Michael Manchisi, chief technology officer for MasterCard. Growth in that category, which MasterCard calls ''consumer not present,'' so it also could include catalog or telephone sales, also outpaced growth in in-store purchases this year.
ComScore, an online research firm, said online retail spending increased 13 percent, to $11.64 billion, in the first 26 days of November versus the same period a year ago. Online spending on Thursday rose 28 percent, and online spending on Friday rose 9 percent, to $648 million, the biggest sales day yet in 2010.
Cheryl Schiller, a part-time auditor and high school track coach who lives in the Boston suburb of Arlington, is a tiny contributor to the increase in online sales. Though she was browsing at a crowded Best Buy in Boston, she had already bought a third of her holiday gifts from various sites.
''Online is the way to go,'' she said. ''We're getting better at planning the shopping.''
The strength in online shopping may explain why another report, issued Saturday, showed slow growth for Friday sales.
In-store sales increased only 0.3 percent on Friday, to $10.69 billion, ShopperTrak said, while traffic increased 2.2 percent.
ShopperTrak uses cameras to observe traffic at malls and retail outlets, then uses known conversion rates -- the percentage of shoppers that actually buy something at a specific store, economic indicators and other factors -- to estimate total sales.
The National Retail Federation said that the difference between its data and ShopperTrak's could be attributed to ShopperTrak's not measuring online sales, to looking only at Friday sales rather than the extended weekend and to measuring largely shopping at big malls, rather than big-box stores or boutiques.
The National Retail Federation data also indicated people were buying for themselves, rather than spending only on gifts, which was echoed by shoppers interviewed on Friday.
There was a shift in spending ''away from basics and necessities and more toward discretionary items,'' Ms. Davis of the federation said. ''We certainly saw that this weekend. Some of these items may have been gifts and some may have been self-gifting purchases.''
Weekend shoppers who said they bought jewelry, for instance, rose to 14.3 percent this year, from 11.7 percent last year.
I.B.M. data showed an increase in jewelry spending as well, with online jewelry retailers reporting a 17.6 percent increase in sales compared with the Friday a year ago.
A higher percentage of men than women said they were buying consumer electronics, according to the federation's survey, and a higher percentage of women said they were buying items like jewelry, home furnishings and beauty items.
That suggested people were snapping up items for their own use, Ms. Davis said.
''It certainly implies that some of these items were self-gift purchases,'' she said. While a man could be buying his wife a Blu-ray DVD player and a woman could be buying her boyfriend a watch, the overall impression, Ms. Davis said, was that ''people were out buying for themselves.''
That was the case in Santa Monica Place, an upscale Los Angeles area mall, on Friday. Rachel Farzam, 25, was shopping with her mother and her sister. Ms. Farzam's mother had already bought a handbag and a gold bracelet from Nordstrom. The women had also bought laptops, a GPS unit and a hard drive at Staples. By late morning, they were surveying jewelry at Tiffany.
''We're out looking for deals, but if we see something nice, we'll still get it,'' Ms. Farzam said. ''It's just fun.''
And in Atlanta, before the Apple Store opened on Friday morning, the first people in line were Jose Aguiar, 50; his son Tiago, 20; and two of Tiago's friends. They had driven 45 minutes from Kennesaw and were in line at 2 a.m.
The store opened at 5 a.m., and by 5:05, the group had bought their items -- an iPad and four iPods -- and were ready to leave. There were no special prices that day, which disappointed Jose Aguiar.
''I thought it would be much cheaper,'' he said, but it didn't stop him from buying.
Despite all the industry frenzy around the day, Laura Gurski, a partner and global head of the retail practice at the consulting firm A. T. Kearney, said she thought it was becoming less important over all.
''The earlier retail promotions begin to diminish the importance of Black Friday in terms of a year over year comparison of the specific day,'' she said in an e-mail. ''As the retailer's strategy has changed, so has the consumer's behavior, right along with it.''

HEADLINE: A Media False Alarm Over T.S.A.

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
If a squadron of mad scientists surrounded by supercomputers gathered in a laboratory to try to conjure a single news topic that would blow up large, they could not touch the T.S.A. pat-down story.
It began with a Drudge Report link to a video on Nov. 13 of an intrusive pat-down, and then leapt to social media and the rest of the Web. Twitter lighted up, flashing 4,000 posts an hour with cheeky hash tags, and in just the first two days of last week, there were 60 million Google queries for information on the change in the Transportation Security Administration protocol, according to Trendrr, a social media measurement company.
Soon enough, an online protest calling for a National Opt-Out Day popped up, with a call to refuse to submit to scans and to clog airports on Wednesday, one of the busiest travel days of the year.
Cue the media mushroom cloud: by Tuesday, there were print reports about the new scanning technology, heavy-breathing blog posts about the government using the technology to alter or gather DNA (yow), and every cable channel featured wall-to-wall speculation about what would happen when people got to the airport on Wednesday and how many would be carrying lanterns and pitchforks. 
''This story tapped right into the central nervous system of the collective consciousness,'' said Mark Ghuneim, chief executive of Trendrr. ''It was huge.''
But then, in the real world, nothing happened.
A few passengers opted out and, if anything, lines were shorter because airport security was staffed up and people arrived early just in case.
The occasional protester was surrounded not by angry crowds but eager reporters. Under all the buzz, 80 percent of Americans traveling were still encountering the same procedures that have been in place for years.
By midday Wednesday, a forlorn CNN correspondent was wandering around during a live shot with nothing to report, with a nearby keening baby the only indication of terminal rage. No word on whether the diaper was breached.
The pat-down story was the equivalent of vaporware -- it seemed as if something huge was about to happen, but it turned out that it was a story about a story, the noisy, fervent sound of a news system feeding on itself.
What made the T.S.A. story so sticky and irresistible, a nearly perfect Perfect Storm?
TIMING It arrived during a news season slowed by holidays (how many stories can you do speculating about which turkey will be pardoned by the president?) in the midst of the busiest travel weeks.
EXECUTION The government's below-the-radar rollout of the new protocol (Memo to the T.S.A.: never sneak up on the American public) gave it a conspiratorial sheen.
MYSTERY The screening technology seemed ominous, yet cool -- like the X-Ray specs advertisements on the backs of comic books that promised to allow you to see through clothing.
DISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT At a time of incredibly fractionalized politics, the pat-down was a single issue we could all rally around. For liberals, it was Big Brother grabbing liberties (with both hands) and conservatives once again felt the intrusive touch of Big Government in their pocket.
Just in case it didn't seem wasteful enough, YouTube came through with a video of a shirtless child being patted down by a burly security guard.
RELEVANCE Many people hate, yet need, to travel by air. And now, once we get through security, we can expect a host of new indignities on the plane (even longer delays, $5 pillows, flights packed like a Japanese subway). By the way, you know who travels a lot? Reporters.
NOTHING. AND EVERYTHING. These incremental changes in technology and intimacy of searches may be a step toward the Big Brotherification of American life, but it is just not that big of a deal outside the media bubble. But the issues at hand were momentous: liberty, security and the American way.
DISPLACEMENT Deep in their hearts, Americans know that the country has spent almost a decade on a two-front war that has made them feel no safer. Rather than dwelling on the blood and lucre that have been spilled, it's a little easier to hate on the guy in the blue uniform wearing a cheesy badge and making $15 an hour. Beats thinking the terrorists have won.
RACE AND CLASS Even though air travel is far from luxurious, it is a still a big expense during a time of significant economic upheaval, so the people affected tend to be a little better off and more entitled. While many nonwhite Americans have grown up in a country where they are sometimes searched while merely going about their business -- unwarranted stop-and-frisks have gone on for decades -- white people aren't used to having the hands of the state on them without cause. Unfamiliarity breeds outrage.
GOOD VISUALS The story has crowds, people in uniforms, conflict and a familiar backdrop, so TV loved it. And the story kicked out all sorts of juicy links to video, umbrage and polemic, so it was more viral than a sneezing passenger in 16E.
In a story like this, the crowd of reporters -- in this instance, anybody at an airport with a smartphone -- is already deployed. If they hit the sweet spot, like the kid who went through Salt Lake City security in a Speedo, millions will see it via YouTube.
GENDER The issue of personal searches and enhanced visibility on scans would seem to be a more acute one for women, given the objectification of women in general and greater history of assault. But discussion on Twitter included two times as many men as women, according to Trendrr. Something primal is at work here, that speaks to both machismo -- boys don't touch boys -- and certain male insecurities about being visible to strangers. You thought that dream of being in high school in your underwear was bad.
I could go on, but you get the idea. A mainstream media that has been run over in the past -- the rise of the Tea Party comes to mind -- has begun to understand that the Web is a great place to listen as well as publish.
''NewsHour'' on PBS was among the throngs, with an embeddable widget that let people post to Twitter their experiences in the security lines -- so the mainstream media are now on a hair trigger, reacting, and sometimes overreacting, to social media and Web-borne protests.
In a sense, the pat-down is a test of a new kind of emergency broadcast system, a hybrid contraption of old and new media, call and response, a place where protests are lodged, articulated and commenced. No one can argue that this episode made us any safer, but then I've yet to hear anything that suggests that the scanners and pat-downs do either.

HEADLINE: The Spanish Prisoner

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The best thing about the Irish right now is that there are so few of them. By itself, Ireland can't do all that much damage to Europe's prospects. The same can be said of Greece and of Portugal, which is widely regarded as the next potential domino.
But then there's Spain. The others are tapas; Spain is the main course. 
What's striking about Spain, from an American perspective, is how much its economic story resembles our own. Like America, Spain experienced a huge property bubble, accompanied by a huge rise in private-sector debt. Like America, Spain fell into recession when that bubble burst, and has experienced a surge in unemployment. And like America, Spain has seen its budget deficit balloon thanks to plunging revenues and recession-related costs.
But unlike America, Spain is on the edge of a debt crisis. The U.S. government is having no trouble financing its deficit, with interest rates on long-term federal debt under 3 percent. Spain, by contrast, has seen its borrowing cost shoot up in recent weeks, reflecting growing fears of a possible future default.
Why is Spain in so much trouble? In a word, it's the euro.
Spain was among the most enthusiastic adopters of the euro back in 1999, when the currency was introduced. And for a while things seemed to go swimmingly: European funds poured into Spain, powering private-sector spending, and the Spanish economy experienced rapid growth.
Through the good years, by the way, the Spanish government appeared to be a model of both fiscal and financial responsibility: unlike Greece, it ran budget surpluses, and unlike Ireland, it tried hard (though with only partial success) to regulate its banks. At the end of 2007 Spain's public debt, as a share of the economy, was only about half as high as Germany's, and even now its banks are in nowhere near as bad shape as Ireland's.
But problems were developing under the surface. During the boom, prices and wages rose more rapidly in Spain than in the rest of Europe, helping to feed a large trade deficit. And when the bubble burst, Spanish industry was left with costs that made it uncompetitive with other nations.
Now what? If Spain still had its own currency, like the United States -- or like Britain, which shares some of the same characteristics -- it could have let that currency fall, making its industry competitive again. But with Spain on the euro, that option isn't available. Instead, Spain must achieve ''internal devaluation'': it must cut wages and prices until its costs are back in line with its neighbors.
And internal devaluation is an ugly affair. For one thing, it's slow: it normally take years of high unemployment to push wages down. Beyond that, falling wages mean falling incomes, while debt stays the same. So internal devaluation worsens the private sector's debt problems.
What all this means for Spain is very poor economic prospects over the next few years. America's recovery has been disappointing, especially in terms of jobs -- but at least we've seen some growth, with real G.D.P. more or less back to its pre-crisis peak, and we can reasonably expect future growth to help bring our deficit under control. Spain, on the other hand, hasn't recovered at all. And the lack of recovery translates into fears about Spain's fiscal future.
Should Spain try to break out of this trap by leaving the euro, and re-establishing its own currency? Will it? The answer to both questions is, probably not. Spain would be better off now if it had never adopted the euro -- but trying to leave would create a huge banking crisis, as depositors raced to move their money elsewhere. Unless there's a catastrophic bank crisis anyway -- which seems plausible for Greece and increasingly possible in Ireland, but unlikely though not impossible for Spain -- it's hard to see any Spanish government taking the risk of ''de-euroizing.''
So Spain is in effect a prisoner of the euro, leaving it with no good options.
The good news about America is that we aren't in that kind of trap: we still have our own currency, with all the flexibility that implies. By the way, so does Britain, whose deficits and debt are comparable to Spain's, but which investors don't see as a default risk.
The bad news about America is that a powerful political faction is trying to shackle the Federal Reserve, in effect removing the one big advantage we have over the suffering Spaniards. Republican attacks on the Fed -- demands that it stop trying to promote economic recovery and focus instead on keeping the dollar strong and fighting the imaginary risks of inflation -- amount to a demand that we voluntarily put ourselves in the Spanish prison.
Let's hope that the Fed doesn't listen. Things in America are bad, but they could be much worse. And if the hard-money faction gets its way, they will be.

HEADLINE: Google Grows, So Some Talent Takes Its Leave

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
When a product manager at Google told his bosses this year that he was quitting to take a job at Facebook, they offered him a large raise. When he said it was not about the money, they told him he could have a promotion, work in a different area or even start his own company inside Google.
He turned down all the inducements and joined Google's newest rival.
''Google's gotten to be a lot bigger and slower-moving of a company,'' said the former manager, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity to protect business relationships. ''At Facebook, I could see how quickly I could get things done compared to Google.'' 
Google, which only 12 years ago was a scrappy start-up in a garage, now finds itself viewed in Silicon Valley as the big, lumbering incumbent. Inside the company some of its best engineers are chafing under the growing bureaucracy and are leaving to start or work at smaller, nimbler companies.
Recent departures include low-level engineers, product managers and prominent managers like Lars Rasmussen, who helped create Google Maps and Wave before he left for Facebook, and Omar Hamoui, the founder of AdMob who was vice president for mobile ads at Google and is now looking for his next project. At least 142 of Facebook's employees came from Google.
Corporate sclerosis is a problem for all companies as they grow. But a hardening of the bureaucracy and a slower pace of work is even more perceptible in Silicon Valley, where companies grow at Internet speed and pride themselves on constant innovation -- and where the most talented people are often those with the most entrepreneurial drive.
Much of Silicon Valley's innovation comes about as engineers leave companies to start their own. For Google, which in five years has grown to 23,000 employees from 5,000 and to $23.7 billion in revenue from $3.2 billion, the risk is that it will miss the best people and the next great idea.
''It's a short step from scale to sclerosis,'' said Daniel H. Pink, an author and analyst on the workplace. ''It becomes a more acute problem in Silicon Valley, where in a couple years, you could have some competitor in a garage ready to put you out entirely.''
Google's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, says that people who think Google faces brain drain are ''fundamentally wrong.'' The company's attrition rate for people it wished would stay has been constant for seven years, he said.
Nevertheless, Google's maturation worries him. ''There was a time when three people at Google could build a world-class product and deliver it, and it is gone,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''So I think it's absolutely harder to get things out the door. That's probably our biggest strategic issue.''
As a result, Google is taking aggressive steps to retain employees, particularly those with start-up ambitions. Google has given several engineers who said they were leaving to start new companies the chance to start them within Google. They work independently and can recruit other engineers and use Google's resources, like its code base and servers, according to half a dozen employees.
Google Wave, a way for people to work together online, was one example. The engineering team, based in Sydney, Australia, worked independently and got equity in the project, according to three people briefed on the agreement. But Google shut down Wave this year, and Mr. Rasmussen, who led the project, quit for Facebook soon after.
Google is considering opening a start-up incubator inside the company, according to two people briefed on the plans.
Other big companies have made similar attempts with varying success. Cisco Systems's program has given birth to new businesses like TelePresence, a videoconferencing service, but Yahoo's incubator was shut down in 2008, a year and a half after it started.
From the beginning, Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have tried to prevent atrophy. That is one reason Google gives everyone time -- called 20 percent time at the company -- to work on their own projects. The company tries to limit groups of engineers working on projects to 10.
But in reality, engineering groups quickly swell to 20 or even 40, several Google product managers said. And new products created during 20 percent time are less likely to get anywhere these days.
Popular Google products like Gmail grew out of 20 percent time, for instance. But engineers say they have been encouraged to build fewer new products and focus on building improvements to existing ones, like the terrain layer on Google Maps.
''There's a lot of these cool features that are very hidden, and a lot of people worked very hard on them and they were kind of sad that they spent a year of their life on something that gets 0.1 percent usage,'' said another product manager who is considering leaving for a start-up.
Part of Google's problem is that the best engineers are often the ones with the most entrepreneurial thirst. Google loaded up on that type in its early hiring.
Some of those go-getters now want to leave as they become frustrated with the processes and procedures. Josh McFarland, a former Google product manager who left last year and started TellApart, which helps retailers advertise online, said he knew it was time to leave as the number of people he had to copy on e-mail messages ballooned.
''I think that there is a class of person who is able to walk away from this relatively easy, consistent money because they are so dissatisfied with the processes of a big company,'' he said.
For others, it is about making more money elsewhere. Start-ups have a riskier and potentially more rewarding lure: shares in a company before an initial public offering.
Google, which has always been generous with salary, stock options and benefits like massages, dry cleaning and free food, is going a step further to keep employees happy. This month, Google gave every employee a raise of 10 percent or more. The motivation was, in part, the ''war for talent,'' Mr. Schmidt said. People who have other job offers have been persuaded to stay with seven-figure bonuses. Google says 80 percent of people who get a counteroffer stay put.
Of those who leave, employees going to Facebook get the most attention. According to resumes posted on LinkedIn, 142 of Facebook's 1,700 employees came from Google. Mr. Schmidt dismissed the idea that Facebook was poaching Google's best people, saying, ''We hire more people in a week than go to Facebook in its lifetime.''
Despite Google's growing pains, it remains remarkably innovative when it wants to be. Last month, for instance, it unveiled robotic cars that drive themselves. And like many big companies, Google has been acquiring new technologies, like Android, instead of inventing them.
While he worries about the consequences of becoming a big company, ''People are dying to come here and they're staying,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''So I guess they're putting up with the complexity.''

HEADLINE: From Arabs and Israelis, Sharp Distress Over a Nuclear Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, JAMES GLANZ and JO BECKER; William J. Broad and Andrew W. Lehren contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In late May 2009, Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, used a visit from a Congressional delegation to send a pointed message to the new American president.
In a secret cable sent back to Washington, the American ambassador to Israel, James B. Cunningham, reported that Mr. Barak had argued that the world had 6 to 18 months ''in which stopping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons might still be viable.'' After that, Mr. Barak said, ''any military solution would result in unacceptable collateral damage.''
There was little surprising in Mr. Barak's implicit threat that Israel might attack Iran's nuclear facilities. As a pressure tactic, Israeli officials have been setting such deadlines, and extending them, for years. But six months later it was an Arab leader, the king of Bahrain, who provides the base for the American Fifth Fleet, telling the Americans that the Iranian nuclear program ''must be stopped,'' according to another cable. ''The danger of letting it go on is greater than the danger of stopping it,'' he said.
His plea was shared by many of America's Arab allies, including the powerful King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who according to another cable repeatedly implored Washington to ''cut off the head of the snake'' while there was still time. 
These warnings are part of a trove of diplomatic cables reaching back to the genesis of the Iranian nuclear standoff in which leaders from around the world offer their unvarnished opinions about how to negotiate with, threaten and perhaps force Iran's leaders to renounce their atomic ambitions.
The cables also contain a fresh American intelligence assessment of Iran's missile program. They reveal for the first time that the United States believes that Iran has obtained advanced missiles from North Korea that could let it strike at Western European capitals and Moscow and help it develop more formidable long-range ballistic missiles.
In day-by-day detail, the cables, obtained by WikiLeaks and made available to a number of news organizations, tell the disparate diplomatic back stories of two administrations pressed from all sides to confront Tehran. They show how President George W. Bush, hamstrung by the complexities of Iraq and suspicions that he might attack Iran, struggled to put together even modest sanctions.
They also offer new insights into how President Obama, determined to merge his promise of ''engagement'' with his vow to raise the pressure on the Iranians, assembled a coalition that agreed to impose an array of sanctions considerably harsher than any before attempted.
When Mr. Obama took office, many allies feared that his offers of engagement would make him appear weak to the Iranians. But the cables show how Mr. Obama's aides quickly countered those worries by rolling out a plan to encircle Iran with economic sanctions and antimissile defenses. In essence, the administration expected its outreach to fail, but believed that it had to make a bona fide attempt in order to build support for tougher measures.
A Sense of Urgency
Feeding the administration's urgency was the intelligence about Iran's missile program. As it weighed the implications of those findings, the administration maneuvered to win Russian support for sanctions. It killed a Bush-era plan for a missile defense site in Poland -- which Moscow's leaders feared was directed at them, not Tehran -- and replaced it with one floating closer to Iran's coast. While the cables leave unclear whether there was an explicit quid pro quo, the move seems to have paid off.
There is also an American-inspired plan to get the Saudis to offer China a steady oil supply, to wean it from energy dependence on Iran. The Saudis agreed, and insisted on ironclad commitments from Beijing to join in sanctions against Tehran.
At the same time, the cables reveal how Iran's ascent has unified Israel and many longtime Arab adversaries -- notably the Saudis -- in a common cause. Publicly, these Arab states held their tongues, for fear of a domestic uproar and the retributions of a powerful neighbor. Privately, they clamored for strong action -- by someone else.
If they seemed obsessed with Iran, though, they also seemed deeply conflicted about how to deal with it -- with diplomacy, covert action or force. In one typical cable, a senior Omani military officer is described as unable to decide what is worse: ''a strike against Iran's nuclear capability and the resulting turmoil it would cause in the Gulf, or inaction and having to live with a nuclear-capable Iran.''
Still, running beneath the cables is a belief among many leaders that unless the current government in Tehran falls, Iran will have a bomb sooner or later. And the Obama administration appears doubtful that a military strike would change that.
One of the final cables, on Feb. 12 of this year, recounts a lunch meeting in Paris between Herve Morin, then the French defense minister, and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates. Mr. Morin raised the delicate topic of whether Israel could strike Iran without American support.
Mr. Gates responded ''that he didn't know if they would be successful, but that Israel could carry out the operation.''
Then he added a stark assessment: any strike ''would only delay Iranian plans by one to three years, while unifying the Iranian people to be forever embittered against the attacker.''
In 2005, Iran abruptly abandoned an agreement with the Europeans and announced that it would resume uranium enrichment activities. As its program grew, beginning with a handful of centrifuges, so, too, did many Arab states' fears of an Iranian bomb and exasperation over American inability to block Tehran's progress.
To some extent, this Arab obsession with Iran was rooted in the uneasy sectarian division of the Muslim world, between the Shiites who rule Iran, and the Sunnis, who dominate most of the region. Those strains had been drawn tauter with the invasion of Iraq, which effectively transferred control of the government there from Sunni to Shiite leaders, many close to Iran.
In December 2005, the Saudi king expressed his anger that the Bush administration had ignored his advice against going to war. According to a cable from the American Embassy in Riyadh, the king argued ''that whereas in the past the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Saddam Hussein had agreed on the need to contain Iran, U.S. policy had now given Iraq to Iran as a 'gift on a golden platter.' ''
Regional distrust had only deepened with the election that year of a hard-line Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
During a meeting on Dec. 27, 2005, with the commander of the United States Central Command, Gen. John P. Abizaid, military leaders from the United Arab Emirates ''all agreed with Abizaid that Iran's new President Ahmadinejad seemed unbalanced, crazy even,'' one cable reports. A few months later, the Emirates' defense chief, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi, told General Abizaid that the United States needed to take action against Iran ''this year or next.''
The question was what kind of action.
Previously, the crown prince had relayed the Emirates' fear that ''it was only a matter of time before Israel or the U.S. would strike Iranian nuclear facility targets.'' That could provoke an outcome that the Emirates' leadership considered ''catastrophic'': Iranian missile strikes on American military installations in nearby countries like the Emirates.
Now, with Iran boasting in the spring of 2006 that it had successfully accomplished low-level uranium enrichment, the crown prince began to argue less equivocally, cables show. He stressed ''that he wasn't suggesting that the first option was 'bombing' Iran,'' but also warned, ''They have to be dealt with before they do something tragic.''
The Saudis, too, increased the pressure. In an April 2008 meeting with Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the incoming Central Command chief, the Saudi ambassador to Washington recalled the king's ''frequent exhortations to the U.S. to attack Iran,'' and the foreign minister said that while he preferred economic pressure, the ''use of military pressure against Iran should not be ruled out.''
Yet if the Persian Gulf allies were frustrated by American inaction, American officials were equally frustrated by the Arabs' unwillingness to speak out against Iran. ''We need our friends to say that they stand with the Americans,'' General Abizaid told Emirates officials, according to one cable.
By the time Mr. Bush left office in January 2009, Iran had installed 8,000 centrifuges (though only half were running) and was enriching uranium at a rate that, with further processing, would let it produce a bomb's worth of fuel a year. With that progress came increased Israeli pressure.
After the Israeli defense minister issued his ultimatum in May 2009, the chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, followed up in November.
''There is still time for diplomacy, but we should not forget that Iran's centrifuges are working day and night,'' he told a delegation led by Representative Ike Skelton, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
That, in turn, led Arab leaders to press even more forcefully for the United States to act -- before Israel did. Crown Prince bin Zayed, predicting in July 2009 that an Israeli attack could come by year's end, suggested the danger of appeasing Iran. ''Ahmadinejad is Hitler,'' he declared.
Seemingly taken aback, a State Department official replied, ''We do not anticipate military confrontation with Iran before the end of 2009.''
So it was that the United States had put together a largely silent front of Arab states whose positions on sanctions and a potential attack looked much like Israel's.
Banks and Businesses
Despite an American trade embargo and several rounds of United Nations sanctions, the Bush administration had never forged the global coalition needed to impose truly painful international penalties on Iran. While France and Britain were supportive, countries like Germany, Russia and China that traded extensively with Iran were reluctant, at best.
In the breach, the United States embarked on a campaign to convince foreign banks and companies that it was in their interest to stop doing business with Iran, by demonstrating how Tehran used its banks, ships, planes and front companies to evade existing sanctions and feed its nuclear and missile programs.
The cables show some notable moments of success, particularly with the banks. But they also make it clear that stopping Iran from obtaining needed technology was a maddening endeavor, with spies and money-laundering experts chasing shipments and transactions in whack-a-mole fashion, often to be stymied by recalcitrant foreign diplomats.
One cable details how the United States asked the Italians to stop the planned export to Iran of 12 fast boats, which could attack American warships in the gulf. Italy did so only after months of ''foot-dragging, during which the initial eleven boats were shipped,'' the embassy in Rome reported.
Another cable recounts China's repeated refusal to act on detailed information about shipments of missile parts from North Korea to Beijing, where they were loaded aboard Iran Air flights to Tehran.
The election of Mr. Obama, at least initially, left some countries wondering whether the sanctions push was about to end. Shortly after taking office, in a videotaped message timed to the Persian New Year, he reiterated his campaign offer of a ''new beginning'' -- the first sustained talks in three decades with Tehran.
The United Arab Emirates called Mr. Obama's message ''confusing.'' The American Embassy in Saudi Arabia reported that the talk about engaging Iran had ''fueled Saudi fears that a new U.S. administration might strike a 'grand bargain' without prior consultations.''
In Europe, Germany and others discerned an effort to grab market share. ''According to the British, other EU Member states fear the U.S. is preparing to take commercial advantage of a new relationship with Iran and subsequently are slowing the EU sanctions process,'' the American Embassy in London reported.
The administration, though, had a different strategy in mind.
The man chosen to begin wiping out the confusion was Daniel Glaser, a little-known official with a title that took two breaths to enunciate in full: acting assistant secretary of the Treasury for terrorist financing and financial crimes.
The first big rollout of his message appears to have come in Brussels on March 2 and 3, 2009, during what the cables called ''an unprecedented classified briefing'' to more than 70 Middle East experts from European governments.
Mr. Glaser got right to the point. Yes, engagement was part of the administration's overall strategy. ''However, 'engagement' alone is unlikely to succeed,'' Mr. Glaser said. And to those concerned that the offer of reconciliation was open-ended, one cable said, he replied curtly that ''time was not on our side.''
The relief among countries supporting sanctions was palpable enough to pierce the cables' smooth diplomatese. ''Iran needs to fear the stick and feel a light 'tap' now,'' said Robert Cooper, a senior European Union official.
''Glaser agreed, noting the stick could escalate beyond financial measures under a worst case scenario,'' a cable said.
The Czechs were identified as surprisingly enthusiastic behind-the-scenes allies. Another section of the same cable was titled ''Single Out but Understand the E.U. Foot-Draggers'': Sweden, considered something of a ringleader, followed by Cyprus, Greece, Luxembourg, Spain, Austria, Portugal and Romania.
The decoding of Mr. Obama's plan was apparently all the Europeans needed, and by year's end, even Germany, with its suspicions and longstanding trading ties with Iran, appeared to be on board.
China's Concerns
Still, there could be little meaningful action without Russia and China. Both are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, where multilateral action would have to pass, and both possess a global reach that could effectively scuttle much of what the United States tried on its own.
The cables indicate that the administration undertook multilayered diplomatic moves to help ensure that neither would cast a Council veto to protect Iran.
As of early 2010, China imported nearly 12 percent of its oil from Iran and worried that supporting sanctions would imperil that supply. Obama administration officials have previously said that the year before, a senior adviser on Iran, Dennis B. Ross, traveled to Saudi Arabia to seek a guarantee that it would supply the lost oil if China were cut off.
The cables show that Mr. Ross had indeed been in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in April 2009. While there is no direct account of those meetings, a suggestion of dazzling success turns up later, in cables describing meetings between Saudi and Chinese officials.
The offer may have come during a Jan. 13 meeting in Riyadh between Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi of China and King Abdullah and other senior Saudi officials, one of whom told Mr. Yang, ''Saudi Arabia understood China was concerned about having access to energy supplies, which could be cut off by Iran,'' according to one cable.
The conversation, evidently shaped by Mr. Ross's request, developed from there, the cable indicated. A later cable noted simply, ''Saudi Arabia has told the Chinese that it is willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil supply in return for Chinese pressure on Iran not to develop nuclear weapons.''
That left Russia.
Dealing With Russia
Throughout 2009, the cables show, the Russians vehemently objected to American plans for a ballistic missile defense site in Poland and the Czech Republic. Conceived under President Bush and billed as a shield against long-range Iranian missiles that American intelligence said were under development, the site was an irritant to Russia, which contended that it was really designed to shoot down Russian missiles.
In talks with the United States, the Russians insisted that there would be no cooperation on other issues until the Eastern Europe site was scrapped. Those demands crested on July 29, when a senior Russian official repeatedly disrupted a meeting with Russia's objections, according to one cable.
Six weeks later, Mr. Obama gave the Russians what they wanted: he abruptly replaced the Eastern Europe site with a ship-borne system. That system, at least in its present form, is engineered to protect specific areas against short- and medium-range missiles, not pulverize long-range missiles soaring above the atmosphere. Mr. Obama explained the shift by saying that intelligence assessments had changed, and that the long-range missile threat appeared to be growing more slowly than previously thought.
The cables are silent on whether at some higher level, Russia hinted that Security Council action against Iran would be easier with the site gone. But another secret meeting with the Russians last December, recounted in the cables, may help explain why Mr. Obama was willing to shift focus to the short- and medium-range threat, at least in the near term.
In the meeting, American officials said nothing about a slowing of the long-range threat, as cited by Mr. Obama. In fact, they insisted that North Korea had sent Iran 19 advanced missiles, based on a Russian design, that could clear a path toward the development of long-range missiles. According to unclassified estimates of their range, though, they would also immediately allow Iran to strike Western Europe or easily reach Moscow -- essentially the threat the revamped system was designed for.
Russia is deeply skeptical that Iran has obtained the advanced missiles, or that their North Korean version, called the BM-25, even exists. ''For Russia, the BM-25 is a mysterious missile,'' a Russian official said. (That argument was dealt a blow last month, when North Korea rolled out what some experts identified as those very missiles in a military parade.)
Whatever the dynamic, Mr. Obama had removed the burr under the Russians' saddle, and in January 2010, one cable reported, a senior Russian official ''indicated Russia's willingness to move to the pressure track.''
The cables obtained by WikiLeaks end in February 2010, before the last-minute maneuvering that led to a fourth round of Security Council sanctions and even stiffer measures -- imposed by the United States, the Europeans, Australia and Japan -- that experts say are beginning to pinch Iran's economy. But while Mr. Ahmadinejad has recently offered to resume nuclear negotiations, the cables underscore the extent to which Iran's true intentions remain a mystery.
As Crown Prince bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi put it in one cable: ''Any culture that is patient and focused enough to spend years working on a single carpet is capable of waiting years and even decades to achieve even greater goals.'' His greatest worry, he said, ''is not how much we know about Iran, but how much we don't.''

HEADLINE: The Partisan Mind

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
Imagine, for a moment, that George W. Bush had been president when the Transportation Security Administration decided to let Thanksgiving travelers choose between exposing their nether regions to a body scanner or enduring a private security massage. Democrats would have been outraged at yet another Bush-era assault on civil liberties. Liberal pundits would have outdone one another comparing the T.S.A. to this or that police state. (''In an outrage worthy of Enver Hoxha's Albania ...'') And Republicans would have leaped to the Bush administration's defense, while accusing liberals of going soft on terrorism.
But Barack Obama is our president instead, so the body-scanner debate played out rather differently. True, some conservatives invoked 9/11 to defend the T.S.A., and some liberals denounced the measures as an affront to American liberties. Such ideological consistency, though, was the exception; mostly, the Bush-era script was read in reverse. It was the populist right that raged against body scans, and the Republican Party that moved briskly to exploit the furor. It was a Democratic administration that labored to justify the intrusive procedures, and the liberal commentariat that leaped to their defense. 
This role reversal is a case study in the awesome power of the partisan mindset. Up to a point, American politics reflects abiding philosophical divisions. But people who follow politics closely -- whether voters, activists or pundits -- are often partisans first and ideologues second. Instead of assessing every policy on the merits, we tend to reverse-engineer the arguments required to justify whatever our own side happens to be doing. Our ideological convictions may be real enough, but our deepest conviction is often that the other guys can't be trusted.
How potent is the psychology of partisanship? Potent enough to influence not only policy views, but our perception of broader realities as well. A majority of Democrats spent the late 1980s convinced that inflation had risen under Ronald Reagan, when it had really dropped precipitously. In 1996, a majority of Republicans claimed that the deficit had increased under Bill Clinton, when it had steadily shrunk instead. Late in the Bush presidency, Republicans were twice as likely as similarly situated Democrats to tell pollsters that the economy was performing well. In every case, the external facts mattered less than how the person being polled felt about the party in power.
This tendency is vividly illustrated by our national security debates. In the 1990s, many Democrats embraced Bill Clinton's wars of choice in the Balkans and accepted his encroachments on civil liberties following the Oklahoma City bombing, while many Republicans tilted noninterventionist and libertarian. If Al Gore had been president on 9/11, this pattern might have persisted, with conservatives resisting the Patriot Act the way they've rallied against the T.S.A.'s Rapiscan technology, and Vice President Joe Lieberman prodding his fellow Democrats in a more Cheney-esque direction on detainee policy.
But because a Republican was president instead, conservative partisans suppressed their libertarian impulses and accepted the logic of an open-ended war on terror, while Democratic partisans took turns accusing the Bush administration of shredding the Constitution.
Now that a Democrat is in the White House, the pendulum is swinging back. In 2006, Gallup asked the public whether the government posed an ''immediate threat'' to Americans. Only 21 percent of Republicans agreed, versus 57 percent of Democrats. In 2010, they asked again. This time, 21 percent of Democrats said yes, compared with 66 percent of Republicans.
In other words, millions of liberals can live with indefinite detention for accused terrorists and intimate body scans for everyone else, so long as a Democrat is overseeing them. And millions of conservatives find wartime security measures vastly more frightening when they're pushed by Janet ''Big Sis'' Napolitano (as the Drudge Report calls her) rather than a Republican like Tom Ridge.
Is there anything good to be said about the partisan mindset? On an individual level, no. It corrupts the intellect and poisons the wells of human sympathy. Honor belongs to the people who resist partisanship's pull, instead of rowing with it.
But for the country as a whole, partisanship does have one modest virtue. It guarantees that even when there's an elite consensus behind whatever the ruling party wants to do (whether it's invading Iraq or passing Obamacare), there will always be a reasonably passionate opposition as well. Given how much authority is concentrated in Washington, especially in the executive branch, even a hypocritical and inconsistent opposition is better than no opposition at all.
At the very least, the power of partisanship means that there will always be someone around, when Americans are standing spread-eagled and exposed in the glare of Rapiscan, to speak up and say ''enough!''

HEADLINE: Judge's Budget Will Seek Big Expansion of Legal Aid to the Poor in Civil Cases

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
As part of his annual budget, New York's chief judge will propose a $100 million increase in state financing for lawyers who represent the poor in civil cases that deal with ''the essentials of life'' like eviction and child support, according to people who have worked on the plan.
The proposal by the chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, is to be released on Wednesday. If approved by the Legislature, it would provide a major source of financing for lawyers for the poor and be a striking acknowledgment that the state's court system is being overwhelmed by some 2.3 million people a year who cannot afford representation. While criminal defendants are guaranteed a lawyer, people fighting civil cases are not. 
''This would be by several measures the most significant commitment to civil justice any state legislature has made in the country,'' said Don Saunders, a vice president of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, the largest national group of lawyers for the poor. ''There is nothing even close to that.''
The proposal would be phased in over four years, with an increase of $25 million beginning next year, permitting a far-reaching expansion of legal service programs across the state that have long been starved of resources. The $100 million proposal would be a small part of the state's nearly $3 billion judicial budget for 2011, which includes comparable savings in other areas, according to those who have worked on it.
The proposal would propel New York to the forefront of a national debate about whether to expand government support for lawyers who represent low-income people in a range of civil disputes, over topics like foreclosures, access to health care, and eligibility for disability and other subsistence benefits. These battles have grown more acute because of the recession.
Data shows that, statewide, 98 percent of tenants fighting evictions and 95 percent of parents fighting for child support go to court without lawyers. This can slow proceedings to a crawl and essentially force the courts to work to avoid unfair rulings that could devastate families or leave people homeless as a result of inadequate representation.
The move by Judge Lippman -- who has cast himself as a pragmatic liberal since he was nominated by Gov. David A. Paterson last year -- seemed likely to test his influence in Albany, gained over many years as a senior administrator in the sprawling court system.
The new financing would represent a 50 percent increase in the $200 million spent annually in the state for civil legal aid offices and other programs that provide legal representation to low-income people. The current financing for the network of independent programs comes from a patchwork of federal, local and private sources, including about $40 million in state money.
The Legislature passed a joint resolution in June that essentially invited Judge Lippman to make the financing proposal. The resolution said fairness required that everyone who must use the courts ''have access to adequate legal representation.''
Judge Lippman declined to discuss the details of the proposal. In a telephone interview, he said it became clear during hearings he held across the state in recent months on what he has called the crisis of the unrepresented that a broad initiative was necessary.
''This is mandatory if New York is to succeed in the future,'' Judge Lippman said. ''This is not just helping the most vulnerable among us -- which we should do -- but this is recognizing that we cannot succeed in the years ahead if we allow the indigent in our state to fall off the cliff.''
Civil lawyers for low-income people are often overwhelmed with cases and outnumbered by lawyers for government agencies, landlords, debt collectors and other groups that play an important role in the lives of the poor.
In recent years, legal groups and advocates for low-income people around the country have argued that to balance the scales in the legal system, courts should declare, that under the Constitution, indigent people have the right to representation in civil cases. A landmark Supreme Court decision in 1963, Gideon v. Wainwright, held that indigent defendants were entitled under the Constitution to have lawyers in criminal cases in which they face the possibility of jail.
Judge Lippman appointed a task force to focus on representation in civil cases, and people involved with it said the judge's proposal did not guarantee a lawyer for every low-income person with a civil legal problem. Such a broad proposal guaranteeing lawyers for civil cases would draw intense political opposition.
The task force has completed a report that will also be released this week, and it supports the judge's proposal in the judiciary budget. The report makes a detailed argument that providing more lawyers for people with low incomes would be cost-efficient for the state, for example by bringing more federal benefits to the state's poor, two people who have read it said.
They said it cited testimony at hearings held by the chief judge that asserted that providing lawyers for poor people would also improve efficiency in the courts. Cases would move more smoothly through the system while, for example, assuring fairer debt-collection proceedings, which are often dominated by lawyers for collection companies.
Nonetheless, the people who have worked on the proposal said, the plan would indicate a new approach in the state toward providing a reliable source of financing for civil lawyers for the poor.
Those who have worked on the proposal spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official announcement was scheduled for later in the week.
The total proposed judicial budget is $2.7 billion, and it will represent no substantial increase in financing, even with the new money for civil lawyers, those who have worked on the proposal said. Court officials, they said, have proposed consolidations and other efficiencies that will result in enough savings next year to cover the financing increase.
Judge Lippman, 65, has made it clear since the spring that he wants a hallmark of his tenure as chief judge to be improving the system of providing legal representation to the poor.
One of those who worked on the proposal said, ''While there may be some things that are as important to him, nothing is more important than this issue to him.''

HEADLINE: States Diverting Money From Climate Initiative

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
In New York, government officials found $90 million to pay for schools by dipping into money generated by a multistate greenhouse gas initiative.
In New Hampshire, the state took $3.1 million from a similar environmental fund. And in New Jersey, the government diverted its whole share: $65 million.
At least three financially troubled states have discovered in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade system, a convenient pool of money that can be drawn on to help balance state budgets. 
In just over two years, the initiative, known as RGGI, has generated more than $729 million for the 10 states that have participated. Each state is supposed to use its share of the money raised to invest in renewable energy and to promote energy efficiency and consumer benefits, like programs that help low-income electricity customers pay their utility bills.
But the money is proving too much of a temptation for states not to use in other ways.
Critics say that diverting money from the fund for general spending, instead of using it on emissions control and energy savings, makes the initiative little more than a hidden tax on electricity.
Already, RGGI opponents in New Jersey have sponsored a bill to end the state's participation.
''This is nothing but a new form of taxation, and environmentalists have been used,'' said Steve Lonegan, New Jersey state director for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group founded and largely financed by oil industry interests.
Under RGGI, which is pronounced Reggie, 10 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states agreed to cap carbon dioxide emissions from electric power plants and charge the plants for the emissions they produce. As an incentive for power plants to pollute less, the states allow the plants that cut their emissions below the cap to sell or trade their excess carbon allowances through online auctions four times a year.
The agreement binds the states to spend at least 25 percent of the money on direct consumer benefits or ''strategic'' energy purposes.
The participating states have agreed to devote virtually all their RGGI money to energy-use reduction. Administrators of the system say that, even with the diversion of money by state governments, about 80 percent of the proceeds for carbon credit auctions still goes to such programs.
Some environmentalists who support the multistate pact agree that without the investment in programs that cut energy use and create green jobs, the initiative's potential economic benefit becomes an expense.
''There's a direct consequence for taking this money,'' said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. ''Families are going to pay higher energy bills this winter if they didn't weatherize their homes.''
At the national level, efforts by Democratic leaders and the Obama administration to include a cap-and-trade scheme as part of a national energy policy were contested in Congress, with opponents branding it ''cap-and-tax'' and Tea Party followers singling it out as a symbol of what was wrong with Washington. But the controversy over cap-and-trade has percolated down to the states, where it became fodder for some candidates in the midterm elections and sparked anti-RGGI rallies in New York and New Jersey, organized by Americans for Prosperity.
''We don't need this when the federal government didn't go forward with a national plan,'' said Alison Littell McHose, a Republican assemblywoman in New Jersey who sponsored the bill to get that state out of the initiative.
Some opponents said they feared that the multistate system would encourage cap-and-trade to spread. ''The other states are watching this program to see if they can get away with it,'' Mr. Lonegan said.
Two agreements similar to RGGI -- the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, with six states and one Canadian province, and the Western Climate Initiative, with seven states and four Canadian provinces -- envision their own cap-and-trade systems. The regional groups have their own rules and features, but the 23 states in them have discussed linking efforts.
The regional carbon-trading market among the states has been free of speculation, administrators for the initiative say, and so far most carbon credits have been purchased by power suppliers. The main criticism from environmental groups is that the cap on emissions is too lax -- in fact, power suppliers have easily met their caps, and carbon credits are trading at bottom-level prices, because plants are taking advantage of cheap prices for natural gas, which pollutes less than fuel sources like coal.
But with the renewed opposition, ''now we're going to be fighting to save RGGI,'' Mr. Tittel of the Sierra Club said, rather than focusing on strengthening and expanding the program.
Gov. David A. Paterson of New York set the precedent last year when he took $90 million from the money generated by the initiative to deal with a projected state budget deficit of nearly $50 billion through March 2013. New York has so far collected $265 million from RGGI, the most of any of the participating states.
Peter Iwanowicz, the governor's environmental adviser and acting commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, called the action ''a one-time deal.''
''New York was facing historic deficits,'' he said. ''It wasn't a decision that was made lightly.''
In New York, much of the money in the fund has gone to investments in alternative energy technologies, training for green jobs, and energy efficiency programs like subsidized energy audits for homes and other buildings. The energy initiative has added 72 cents to the monthly electricity bill of New Yorkers, Mr. Iwanowicz said, but he noted that because of reductions in energy use and cheaper fuel prices in the last two years, customers might not have seen a rise.
In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie said that the state would use its $65.2 million in RGGI money to help offset a $10.7 billion budget deficit for fiscal year 2011. Mr. Christie has yet to add his voice to calls among fellow Republicans to withdraw from the cap-and-trade regional group. Still, some experts note that the availability of RGGI money to help states deal with their economic woes may be the very thing that saves the initiative and similar accords.
''The states are so broke that it's going to be unbelievably difficult for them to stop this program,'' said Leigh Raymond, the associate director of the Climate Change Research Center at Purdue University. ''They're desperate for money.''

HEADLINE: Belt-Tightening Across Europe

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS DUNBAR and JOHN FOLEY

 BODY:
It is not just America's retirement system that will struggle to make ends meet in the future. Europe faces similar potential trouble. Economists are trying to evaluate pension promises and tax revenues and compare them with today's more visible debt burdens in the region. The current woes pale in comparison.
Those who are currently European paragons of fiscal virtue are only a couple of decades away from becoming indistinguishable from basket cases like Greece, according to a recent Standard & Poor's study. For example, Austria, which currently has debt of just 72 percent of its gross domestic product, would see government borrowing balloon to 329 percent of G.D.P. by 2050 if it honors promises to its aging population. 
It is easy to dismiss this forecast. After all, S.& P. concedes that its gloomy projections apply only if no reforms take place.
Germany has already begun the belt-tightening: Academics at the University of Freiburg estimate that in 2001 the country's pension liabilities stood at 200 percent of G.D.P., even after subtracting the present value of future contributions. After six years of reforms, the figure had dropped to 90 percent. However, that still dwarfs Germany's ''official'' debt-to-G.D.P. ratio of 62 percent.
Such exercises highlight the pain still required to balance the books in the future. Another Freiburg study found that Germany would have to increase annual tax revenues by nearly 15 percent to pay for its pared-back promises. Britain needs to raise its annual tax take by almost 20 percent to make its finances sustainable.
Moreover, these figures were calculated using census and mortality data half a decade out of date. They also do not consider countries' increased debt burden resulting from the financial crisis.
Accounting across generations highlights how today's bailouts conflict with the ability to make good on unfinanced future welfare and pension promises. One day, pensioners and bondholders alike will have to share the pain. That fight will make today's debt squabbles seem minor.
South Korea's Allure
It is seven years since the private equity firm Lone Star Funds bought into Korea Exchange Bank, and four years since the distressed-asset fund started trying to get out. Lone Star has finally agreed to sell its majority stake in the lender to domestic rival Hana Bank. The sizable returns it has made explain why American buyout groups like Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts are interested in South Korea, although Lone Star itself may not be rushing back.
The firm bought its 51 percent stake in 2003 to help Korea Exchange Bank plug a capital hole. Lone Star, led by John P. Grayken, focused the bank on growing profits rather than the loan book and took out chunky dividends.
Yet Lone Star also tested Korea's low tolerance for foreigners who make a profit turning around troubled companies. State prosecutors declared the deal ''illegal'' in 2006. Tax inquiries and legal wrangles derailed two attempts to sell out -- first to Kookmin Bank, and then to HSBC.
Still, Korea Exchange Bank has paid out well. Lone Star put up 1.4 trillion won ($1.2 billion) for its stake in the bank in October 2003, and three years later invested a further $800 million. Over all, the investment has generated what seems to be a 25 percent annual internal rate of return.
Had the fund sold to HSBC at the initially posited price of $6.3 billion, the returns would have been closer to 40 percent, in half the time. Still, with memories of Lone Star's earlier treatment still raw, the buyout giants staking out South Korea may be glad their predecessor did not make provocatively excessive returns.

HEADLINE: Modest Climate Change Steps Are Goal of Meeting in Mexico

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
CANCUN, Mexico (Reuters) -- Nearly 200 nations were to meet in Mexico on Monday to try to agree on modest steps to slow climate change, a United Nations gathering overshadowed by global economic problems and strains between the top two emitters, the United States and China. 
The 12-day meeting, in a heavily guarded resort, will seek to revive negotiations stalled after last year's Copenhagen summit meeting fell short of a binding United Nations treaty to slow global warming.
Delegates began arriving Sunday for the talks that will seek agreement on lesser measures, like a ''green fund'' to channel aid to poor nations and new ways to share clean technologies and to protect tropical forests that absorb carbon as they grow.
The ultimate goal is to extend the present Kyoto Protocol, which controls the greenhouse gas emissions of all industrialized countries except the United States, which did not ratify the pact. The United States and major emerging economies now have to make emissions pledges if the protocol is to survive, the European Union said Sunday.
''Continuing the Kyoto Protocol only makes sense if major economies which are not part of it like the U.S., China and India also make further commitments,'' said Artur Runge-Metzger, a senior European Union negotiator.
Mr. Runge-Metzger said the European Union had withdrawn some demands in order to focus on priorities in Cancun, like clear rules on measuring emissions and finance, and he said others had to do the same.
This year is likely to be recorded as one of the warmest since record keeping began in the 19th century. The United Nations panel of climate scientists says rising temperatures will mean more floods, droughts and sandstorms, as well as rising sea levels.
For Cancun participants, the major challenge is to end a deadlock on sharing the burden of emissions cuts between China and the United States. Their relationship already is strained over China's trade surplus, North Korea and other issues.
The Cancun meeting also comes as the weak world economy, with euro zone bailouts of Greece and Ireland, has sapped attention from climate change.
Japan said last week that it would be ''meaningless and inappropriate'' for Kyoto Protocol supporters to extend the pact without more action by the top emitters. But supporters are fast running out of time to agree what to do after the Kyoto Protocol expires on Dec. 31, 2012.

HEADLINE: Haitian Candidates Want Election Invalidated, but Officials Disagree

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Vladimir Laguerre contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Two-thirds of Haiti's presidential candidates said Sunday's election was so tainted by fraud that it should be invalidated, but late in the evening, national election officials ordered the vote to stand, saying that problems at most polling sites had been minor.
''Only 3.5 percent of the voting centers had trouble, that's not enough to ruin the election,'' said the national election council president, Gaillot Dorsainvil.
He said that ballots had been damaged or destroyed at 56 centers and that people who had cast ballots there would be allowed to revote. 
It was a day of contrasts for voters in Haiti's first election since the January earthquake -- excitement and exasperation, accusations and denials of efforts to rig the results. In a country still reeling from the devastating quake, a day that began mainly with delays ended in conflict. At an afternoon news conference here, 12 of the 18 candidates still in the race had called on the election council to void the results because of ''massive fraud,'' which they described as an effort by the Unity Party of President Rene Preval to stuff ballot boxes and turn away voters who opposed Mr. Preval's chosen candidate, Jude Celestin.
The candidates, in an unusual display of unity before dozens of chanting supporters, urged their partisans to peacefully take to the streets, and many did.
''This is an earthquake of an election,'' said a candidate, Leslie Voltaire. ''This will divide the country, not unite it.''
A meeting among the protesting political parties was planned for Monday in the hope of finding a solution that would steer the country away from this latest political turmoil.
But such unity rarely emerges from conflict here, where elections have frequently been marred by chaos. While Sunday appeared less violent than past election days, the path forward seemed as murky as the garbage-filled canals here.
Preliminary results were not expected to be released until Dec. 7, leaving candidates time to trade attacks and claims of victory or unjust defeat. A round of expected demonstrations began immediately after the news conference, when supporters of at least two candidates, Charles Henri Baker and Michel Martelly, a popular singer known as Sweet Micky, marched to the national election council offices.
Meanwhile, the international community that had invested millions of dollars and sent hundreds of people to help the government plan and run the election, reacted with caution to the fraud accusations and the election council's response.
A spokesman for the United States Embassy, which spent $14 million in election preparation, said only that it was monitoring the situation. Representatives of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, which had sent a team of observers, canceled a news conference and later issued a statement saying it was gathering information for ''our assessment of polling day activities.'' The United Nations, which had given logistical and security help, said Sunday night that it had ''deep concerns over the numerous incidents that marred the election,'' and that any deterioration in security could have ''dramatic consequences'' on the response to the cholera epidemic Haiti has struggled with for a month.
Mr. Preval's office did not respond to requests for comment.
Several voting centers appeared organized and calm, with Haitians of all ages lining up patiently and placing folded paper ballots resembling colorful place mats with pictures of the candidates to aid illiterate voters in plastic bins.
But at many other polling places anger rose, as voters complained of being turned away.
In many cases, tension started with delays in opening voting sites at 6 a.m. In some places, election workers were still struggling with voter lists four hours later, and with mollifying so-called monitors hired by political parties to oversee the vote.
Some international observers expressed concern about poor planning and low turnout. ''Badly organized,'' was how one United Nations observer characterized a polling site near Cite Soleil where voting materials had not been delivered hours after polls opened.
Some problems were expected. Less than half of the more than 400,000 new and replacement national identification cards required for voting were thought to have been distributed by Sunday, leaving hundreds of thousands of people frustrated before the day began. But there were also cases that were harder to explain.
Outside a voting center in Petionville, a wealthier suburb now filled with makeshift camps, young men waved their national ID cards at the police as they complained to reporters of being denied a chance to vote.
Inside, among the various classrooms filled with election workers, the struggle of Sultane Lubin was common. Ms. Lubin appeared just after 10 a.m. on the second floor, wearing a cheerful peach suit that contrasted sharply with the anger she directed at anyone who looked official.
''I've been here since 6 a.m.; I have to vote,'' she shouted at one election worker, then another. Eventually, a young woman guided Ms. Lubin to a room with names taped up outside. It included several other Lubins, but Sultane Lubin's name could not be found.
She turned to a police officer for help. ''I'm just here for security,'' the officer said.
Ms. Lubin stood still, seemingly stuck in place as other voters scanned the list for their names. ''I'm in misery,'' she said. ''I can't survive, and all I want to do is choose a president who will help me.''
Even she, however, would not identify her selected candidate. Political intimidation has scarred many in Haiti, and with party observers outnumbering voters at many polling sites, the most forthcoming citizens would only speak in code: about voting for ''the young one'' (Mr. Martelly); or ''my wife'' (Mirlande Manigat, a constitutional scholar seeking to become the first woman elected to lead Haiti).
Jeantil Laguerre, 39, echoed many voters who said they were most concerned about corruption. Whoever wins the presidency will oversee billions of dollars in post-earthquake reconstruction. Mr. Laguerre said that explained his support for Ms. Manigat.
''Women have only two pockets'' for stolen money, he said, while ''the men have four pockets, two in front, two in back.''
Ultimately, Haiti's new leader will face challenges, and opportunities, on a historic scale, including the cholera epidemic, which has killed more than 1,600 people, a devastated economy and money and a mandate to create a building boom and remake government institutions,
The potential for transformation is enormous, but it will require a degree of institutional change that many Haitians fear may never come.
Candidates were not the only ones complaining about potential fraud. Voters and campaign workers also said they feared that Mr. Preval's Unity Party was trying to engineer a victory for Mr. Celestin, whose green posters had long outnumbered those of other candidates throughout the city -- suggesting financial support from the government.
Voters like Ms. Lubin, however, were not as ready to trade barbs, or to give up. Despite having waited more than four hours and making several trips up and down narrow stairs, she vowed not to go home until she had completed her task. ''Whatever happens,'' she said. ''I am going to vote.''

HEADLINE: Still Ahead: A Confrontation Over the Budget

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''There Will Be Blood,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Nov. 22):
It's not often that a president can mark the next crisis on his calendar and prepare for it, but that's what President Obama can do, with the national debt limit due to be reached in April. The president had better learn to fight between now and then.
This is going to be an epochal fight -- truly one that could determine whether we return to the difficult realities of governance and fiscal discipline, and thereby preserve the hope of remaining a great nation, or continue with partisanship and avoidance of vital issues, which will lead to economic breakdown. 
This is the test of the president's ability to lead. This is the moment when ''change'' either happens or fails to happen.
Ron Meyers New York, Nov. 22, 2010
To the Editor:
Neither the Bush nor the Obama administration has dealt with the gross income inequality in this country -- the worst in a century -- coupled with crippling unemployment.
The actions that would actually get us back to a more fair and equal society are not surprising:
Social Security and Medicare taxes should be levied on all income.
Hedge fund income should be treated and taxed as ordinary income, not capital gains.
Very high salaries should be taxed at a rate of 50 percent or more, which would discourage extravagant pay for chief executives.
Our troops should be pulled out of Iraq and Afghanistan.
And, of course, extending Medicare to everyone would save even more money.
These measures would balance the budget, extend the solvency of Social Security and return military spending to a more reasonable portion of the budget.
We would also put money into the pockets of working men and women, leading to greater consumer demand and fuller employment far more rapidly than cutting taxes on the wealthy.
These options are not part of Representative Paul Ryan's ''roadmap,'' nor Erskine B. Bowles and Alan K. Simpson's draft proposal as deficit commission co-chairmen, nor The Times's Nov. 14 online budget balancing exercise.
James J. Diamond Portland, Ore., Nov. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
We have a big problem in this country, and it looks as if the co-chairmen of President Obama's fiscal commission are ready to face it. For decades we have wasted the money we should have been spending on kids and the environment by buying overpriced weapons that don't work and staffing cold-war-era military bases around the world. Now it seems that those bad ideas are on the chopping block to the tune of $100 billion in defense cuts.
Groups as diverse as USAction, the Center for Defense Information, leaders of the Cato Institute as well as many Tea Party members all agree. These cuts don't need to be a partisan issue.
Many of the Republicans elected to the new Congress have pledged to put Pentagon spending under a microscope, and I know many Democrats would rather spend our tax dollars on essential things like education, health care and jobs.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle should welcome a real debate on Pentagon spending. Every weapon system, every proposal to increase the size of the force, every plan for deploying our military abroad or expanding current operations must be scrutinized.
Ben Cohen Williston, Vt., Nov. 16, 2010

HEADLINE: Liberal Groups to Propose Routes to Smaller Deficit

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As President Obama's fiscal commission faces a deadline this week for agreement on a plan to shrink the mounting national debt, liberal organizations will unveil debt-reduction proposals of their own in the next two days, seeking to sway the debate in favor of fewer reductions in domestic spending, more cuts in the military and higher taxes for the wealthy.
The proposals from two sets of liberal advocacy groups highlight the deep ideological divides surrounding efforts to deal with the nation's budgetary imbalances, even as Mr. Obama's bipartisan commission works to finalize its recommendations by Wednesday -- and struggles for a formula that would get the backing of at least 14 of its 18 members, the threshold for sending its proposal to Congress for a vote.
Inside the commission, expectations remain low that a supermajority can agree on a plan, given most Republicans' opposition to raising taxes and most Democrats' resistance to deep spending cuts and reducing future retirees' Social Security benefits. 
Yet the panel's proponents hope that agreement among even a bipartisan minority can be the basis for future action to arrest the unsustainable growth of government debt in coming years.
Over the holiday week, the commission's staff revised the draft plan from its chairmen -- Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader, and Erskine B. Bowles, president of the University of North Carolina system and a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton -- to reflect contributions made at meetings this month by the rest of the commission, six senior members of Congress from each party and four business and union leaders.
Even if the commission fizzles, its chairmen's plan and the alternatives -- about a half-dozen packages from centrists and conservatives, and now the two from the liberal groups -- have demonstrated a rough consensus for all their differences: action is needed once the economy recovers, and the fiscal problem cannot be resolved by spending cuts or tax increases alone. Both military and health care spending should be on the cutting table. So should ''tax expenditures,'' the scores of popular but costly tax breaks for individuals and corporations, including the mortgage-interest deduction. And Social Security's finances require a long-term fix.
Nothing of the sort is before the lame-duck session of Congress that resumes this week. Instead, the parties and Mr. Obama are in effect fighting over how much to add to the long-term debt: Democrats want to extend the expiring Bush-era tax cuts except for rates in the highest income brackets, at a projected 10-year cost of about $3 trillion, while Republicans want to make all the tax rates permanent, which would cost more than $4 trillion -- roughly the same amount the Bowles-Simpson plan would save in a decade.
And while Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans agree that lawmakers should not earmark spending for special projects, a ban would hardly dent the projected annual deficits.
On Monday, the progressive policy organizations Demos, the Economic Policy Institute and the Century Foundation will unveil a liberal blueprint. Their report says that unlike the centrist plans, this version ''stabilizes debt as a share of the economy without demanding draconian cuts to national investments or to vital safety net programs.'' It would, however, leave the debt at a higher level as a share of the economy than the centrist plans.
On Tuesday, a separate coalition of liberal groups, economists and labor leaders -- the Citizens' Commission on Jobs, Deficits and America's Economic Future -- will release a similar outline.
Both plans are comparable to one recently proposed by Representative Jan Schakowsky, a liberal Democrat from Illinois who is a member of the Bowles-Simpson commission. Ms. Schakowsky opposed the chairmen's draft as too hard on the middle class.
The liberal plans' differences with centrists and conservatives include the following:
Timing. While other debt-reduction plans would take effect as early as 2012, the progressives oppose any austerity measures until perhaps 2015, once unemployment is at or below 6 percent.
Stimulus spending. Most of the plans call for immediate additional stimulus measures, arguing that they will help create tax-paying jobs and reduce spending for relief to the jobless. But the liberals seek more spending in the short and long term: for now, financing for unemployment assistance, public works projects and aid to state and local governments to prevent continued layoffs of teachers and other employees, and for years beyond, ''pro-growth investments'' in areas like education, infrastructure, child care, rural broadband and scientific research.
Military spending. All the plans would reduce projected spending for the military, but the liberal plans would cut deeper.
Health care cost constraints. Congressional Republicans, including Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who has a comprehensive conservative plan, would repeal the new health care law. Mr. Ryan would also privatize Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in the future. In contrast, the liberal and centrist plans would expand on the new law's long-term savings policies.
The liberal plans, however, would rely more on limiting payments to doctors, hospitals and other care providers and less on increasing out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries, except for upper-income people. The liberals also call for a public option to compete with private insurers in new exchanges for consumers, and for the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower prescription-drug prices.
Social Security. While centrist plans would raise payroll taxes for the affluent and reduce benefits scheduled for many new retirees in future decades, the progressive plans would only raise taxes to make the program solvent until late in the century.
Liberals and centrists would raise the cap on taxable wages to cover 90 percent of all wage income; the level has slipped from that level in recent years. If it applied in 2012, for example, workers would pay Social Security taxes on income up to about $156,000 instead of $113,700.
Taxes. The progressive plans rely heavily on higher revenues from the rich and would reduce taxes for low-wage workers.
The centrist and liberal plans eventually would end the Bush tax rates, restore estate taxes, and limit or eliminate tax breaks for corporations and individuals -- so-called tax expenditures -- that cost more than $1 trillion in revenues annually. The liberals would use the revenues for deficit reduction and increased domestic spending; centrists would use them to pare the deficit and to significantly lower individual and corporate income tax rates.
The liberals also call for a surcharge on income above $1 million. They would limit other tax breaks that benefit the affluent and tax capital gains and dividends at higher ordinary income rates. The liberal plans would impose a carbon tax to encourage clean energy and to raise revenues, which would be split between deficit reduction and energy rebates for consumers. They would also raise the federal gasoline tax to replenish the federal highway trust fund.
Both liberal plans would impose a tax on financial transactions to raise revenues and discourage speculation.

President Obama's relationship with Republican Congressional leaders begins a less predictable phase this week that confronts each side with a new political calculus.
When the House speaker-to-be, John A. Boehner, and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, visit the White House on Tuesday, their political momentum will be leavened with increased governing responsibility. The thoroughgoing opposition that benefited them in the first half of Mr. Obama's term will carry an offsetting price in the second half.
The president has lost the option of working solely through fellow Democrats. He faces choices on how to seek accommodation with Republicans -- and where. 
Each area of cooperation Mr. Obama has identified, from trade to spending restraint, could just as easily become a focus of conflict. And with the 2012 campaign suddenly in view, how each side defines its larger objectives remains an open question.
''There's pressure on both of us,'' said the White House political strategist David Axelrod, who early next year plans to return to Illinois to begin organizing the president's re-election bid.
The initial tests come in the current lame-duck session of Congress. The top domestic priorities are stopgap government financing and the fate of the Bush-era tax cuts.
So far, however, the White House has given greater prominence to the effort to pass an arms control treaty with Russia. Fred I. Greenstein, a presidential scholar at Princeton University, sees an opportunity for Mr. Obama to follow the strategy President Harry Truman employed to win passage of the Marshall Plan after Republicans took over Congress in 1946.
Just as Mr. Truman worked with Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, a Michigan Republican, to overcome conservative opposition, Mr. Greenstein argued, Mr. Obama has a chance to turn Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, into the ally he needs to prevail. Winning that uphill fight -- Mr. Kyl continued to express skepticism on Sunday -- could in turn become a template for selective engagement with Republicans on domestic issues.
Since Mr. Obama's term began, domestic issues have produced unabated conflict with his Republican adversaries. On taxes, spending and the role of government in spurring economic growth, the gap between the parties remains wide and fundamental.
In theory, Republicans and the administration could find common ground on energy, from new energy efficiency steps to expanded use of nuclear power. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, has speculated that the White House could even find bipartisan support for a limited cap on carbon emissions -- a top Obama goal.
But Mr. Graham himself could face a Tea Party revolt for promoting such a deal. Similarly, Mr. Obama risks a backlash among liberals if he makes spending cuts a focus of cooperation with Republican leaders.
The administration ''can't cut enough without completely angering the base,'' observed the Republican consultant Kim Alfano, whose clients include Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, a potential 2012 presidential candidate. Ms. Alfano identified education -- for instance, the quest for more teachers and improved standards in troubled schools -- as a more promising issue on which the White House might be able to compel Republican acquiescence.
William A. Galston, who was domestic policy director under President Bill Clinton, countered, ''He's not going to get anywhere with second-tier issues.'' Instead, Mr. Galston suggested, the president should pivot from recent recommendations by the co-chairmen of a bipartisan deficit reduction panel to propose a mammoth deal with Republican leaders.
Its potential elements: fresh economic stimulus through a temporary payroll tax ''holiday,'' new infrastructure spending, a discretionary spending freeze, a plan to shore up Social Security's finances and a comprehensive tax overhaul. Republicans could spurn the offer and face charges of obstruction, or compromise and burnish Mr. Obama's reputation for leadership.
''He wins either way,'' Mr. Galston reasoned.
The recent history of partisan polarization casts doubt on prospects for such a grand bargain. A more limited deal, saving major changes in taxes and entitlement programs until after the next presidential election, has a stronger chance of materializing.
To a large degree, Mr. Obama's comeback hopes rest on accelerating economic growth, over which his control is limited. With Republicans in charge of the House, his capacity to drive the legislative process has been sharply circumscribed.
Yet greater distance from Congress may enhance the president's ability to communicate a broader economic vision. And like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Obama will try to regain traction by contrasting his emphasis on programs benefiting average Americans with that of Republican leaders bent on shrinking government.
On spending priorities, ''we'll be able to draw some lines around the things that are important, though we can't do everything,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''We have a better opportunity to clearly define how we intend to win the future.''

HEADLINE: The Partisan Mind

BYLINE: By Ross Douthat

 BODY:
Imagine, for a moment, that George W. Bush had been president when the Transportation Security Administration decided to let Thanksgiving travelers choose between exposing their nether regions to a body scanner or enduring a private security massage. Democrats would have been outraged at yet another Bush-era assault on civil liberties. Liberal pundits would have outdone one another comparing the T.S.A. to this or that police state. (''In an outrage worthy of Enver Hoxha's Albania ...'') And Republicans would have leaped to the Bush administration's defense, while accusing liberals of going soft on terrorism.
But Barack Obama is our president instead, so the body-scanner debate played out rather differently. True, some conservatives invoked 9/11 to defend the T.S.A., and some liberals denounced the measures as an affront to American liberties. Such ideological consistency, though, was the exception; mostly, the Bush-era script was read in reverse. It was the populist right that raged against body scans, and the Republican Party that moved briskly to exploit the furor. It was a Democratic administration that labored to justify the intrusive procedures, and the liberal commentariat that leaped to their defense. 
This role reversal is a case study in the awesome power of the partisan mindset. Up to a point, American politics reflects abiding philosophical divisions. But people who follow politics closely -- whether voters, activists or pundits -- are often partisans first and ideologues second. Instead of assessing every policy on the merits, we tend to reverse-engineer the arguments required to justify whatever our own side happens to be doing. Our ideological convictions may be real enough, but our deepest conviction is often that the other guys can't be trusted.
How potent is the psychology of partisanship? Potent enough to influence not only policy views, but our perception of broader realities as well. A majority of Democrats spent the late 1980s convinced that inflation had risen under Ronald Reagan, when it had really dropped precipitously. In 1996, a majority of Republicans claimed that the deficit had increased under Bill Clinton, when it had steadily shrunk instead. Late in the Bush presidency, Republicans were twice as likely as similarly situated Democrats to tell pollsters that the economy was performing well. In every case, the external facts mattered less than how the person being polled felt about the party in power.
This tendency is vividly illustrated by our national security debates. In the 1990s, many Democrats embraced Bill Clinton's wars of choice in the Balkans and accepted his encroachments on civil liberties following the Oklahoma City bombing, while many Republicans tilted noninterventionist and libertarian. If Al Gore had been president on 9/11, this pattern might have persisted, with conservatives resisting the Patriot Act the way they've rallied against the T.S.A.'s Rapiscan technology, and Vice President Joe Lieberman prodding his fellow Democrats in a more Cheney-esque direction on detainee policy.
But because a Republican was president instead, conservative partisans suppressed their libertarian impulses and accepted the logic of an open-ended war on terror, while Democratic partisans took turns accusing the Bush administration of shredding the Constitution.
Now that a Democrat is in the White House, the pendulum is swinging back. In 2006, Gallup asked the public whether the government posed an ''immediate threat'' to Americans. Only 21 percent of Republicans agreed, versus 57 percent of Democrats. In 2010, they asked again. This time, 21 percent of Democrats said yes, compared with 66 percent of Republicans.
In other words, millions of liberals can live with indefinite detention for accused terrorists and intimate body scans for everyone else, so long as a Democrat is overseeing them. And millions of conservatives find wartime security measures vastly more frightening when they're pushed by Janet ''Big Sis'' Napolitano (as the Drudge Report calls her) rather than a Republican like Tom Ridge.
Is there anything good to be said about the partisan mindset? On an individual level, no. It corrupts the intellect and poisons the wells of human sympathy. Honor belongs to the people who resist partisanship's pull, instead of rowing with it.
But for the country as a whole, partisanship does have one modest virtue. It guarantees that even when there's an elite consensus behind whatever the ruling party wants to do (whether it's invading Iraq or passing Obamacare), there will always be a reasonably passionate opposition as well. Given how much authority is concentrated in Washington, especially in the executive branch, even a hypocritical and inconsistent opposition is better than no opposition at all.
At the very least, the power of partisanship means that there will always be someone around, when Americans are standing spread-eagled and exposed in the glare of Rapiscan, to speak up and say ''enough!''

HEADLINE: BEIJING PROPOSES EMERGENCY TALKS ON KOREAN CRISIS

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON and HELENE COOPER; Ian Johnson reported from Beijing and Helene Cooper from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Sharon LaFraniere, Martin Fackler and Su-Hyun Lee from Seoul, South Korea; and Thom Shanker from Washington. Zhang Jing contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China moved over the weekend to defuse the latest crisis on the Korean Peninsula, publicly calling on Sunday for ''emergency consultations'' while beginning what amounted to high-level shuttle diplomacy between North and South Korea.
Together, the moves by China were its first concerted diplomatic intervention to calm the emotions that have dangerously escalated since North Korea's lethal shelling last Tuesday of a South Korean island in the disputed border area between them.
Even so, the Chinese response, which appeared to be studiously neutral, was far from what either South Korea or the United States had publicly sought from China, which provides critical economic aid to the North and is believed to have the most leverage on North Korea's reclusive government.
American officials had wanted China to single out the North as an aggressor in this case, as well as criticize the North over its recent unveiling of a new plant for uranium enrichment. South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, said in a televised speech on Monday in Seoul that if the North acted provocatively again, ''We will make sure it pays a dear price without fail.'' President Lee made no mention of China's diplomacy. 
Chinese analysts said Beijing's solutions were not perfect but were the best it could do. ''North Korea is not the kind of country that if its neighbor severs economic assistance it will bow down and listen to it,'' said Liu Ming of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. ''China knows this, so it cannot do much more.''
The Chinese effort came as the United States, South Korea's most powerful ally, began naval war games with South Korean forces in the Yellow Sea in response to the shelling, a move that both China and North Korea have criticized as provocative.
In a hastily called news conference in Beijing, the Chinese government asked for South Korea, North Korea, the United States, Japan and Russia to convene what it described as emergency consultations in Beijing next month as a way to avoid a further deterioration of the situation. The countries have been participants in the so-called six-party talks that have been held intermittently -- and unsuccessfully -- for years over ways to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
China also sent a top foreign policy official, State Councilor Dai Bingguo, to South Korea over the weekend and announced that a North Korean official would travel to Beijing on Tuesday, in what appeared to be an attempt at mediation, something unusual for China in its complex relationship with the Koreas.
It was unclear whether China's efforts were a response to the repeated calls by both the Obama administration and South Korea's government for the Chinese to exert influence on North Korea.
Publicly at least, American officials were unimpressed with China's response. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton talked with Mr. Dai by telephone on Sunday, telling him that China's call for emergency consultations could not substitute for action by North Korea, said the State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley.
He said Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Dai that North Korea's behavior was ''destabilizing,'' adding that ''clear steps by North Korea are needed to demonstrate a change of behavior.''
South Korea, for its part, appeared equally unimpressed. Many South Koreans made pointed references to President Lee's statement in which he ''urged Beijing to play a role befitting its newfound international prestige.''
Especially annoying to many South Koreans is that China failed to criticize North Korea for the artillery barrage, which was the first attack on civilian areas since the armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean War. Instead, China's state-run media gave equal prominence to North Korea's claim that the United States masterminded the crisis.
''This is disappointing,'' said Yoon Duk-min, a regional security specialist at the Institute for Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. ''The six-party talks are a dialogue to solve the nuclear issue, not the current crisis on the peninsula.''
Kim Yong-hyun, professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, said South Korea was unlikely to accept China's offer because it would seem to come as a result of North Korean violence. ''Maybe after time passes, but not now,'' he said.
But in Washington, some Asia experts said that the reality was that the United States and South Korea would eventually have little choice but to go along with China's call for talks, if for no other reason than to defuse the tension and prevent North Korea from taking even more aggressive or drastic actions against its neighbor to the south.
''Ultimately, you have to talk with them,'' said George Perkovich, an arms control expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''You have to bargain, because if you don't, this is what they do. They make things worse. They create a crisis.''
He pointed to other times when North Korea has called attention to itself while American leaders were preoccupied or refusing to hold direct talks with the North. In several of those cases, North Korea made aggressive moves toward South Korea.
But President Obama is under political pressure at home to appear tough, especially on China. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican from South Carolina and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told ''Fox News Sunday'' that the United States ''should push China hard'' to get North Korea to refrain from aggressive actions.
Senator John McCain, speaking on ''State of the Union'' on CNN, also criticized the Chinese.
''We have to understand that China is not behaving in a responsible fashion as a world power,'' Mr. McCain said.
China has balked at pushing North Korea too hard because it does not want the North Korean government to fall, which could lead to reunification of North and South Korea. Many Asia experts say that reunification would result in a country that is far more an ally of the United States than of China, and could lead to American troops right on the Chinese border -- an outcome that Beijing is loath to see happen.
But China also does not want a war, which could destabilize the entire region and do severe damage to China's own economic growth and aspirations for greater influence in the world. Hence China's unusually high-profile efforts to defuse the crisis.
''I think it is a dramatic change of Chinese policy to address its growing concern,'' said Zhu Feng, deputy director of the Center for International and Strategic Studies at Peking University. ''This initiative shows that Beijing is more proactive.''
Some say that China had no choice because the crisis was complicating its goal of controlling the Yellow Sea, a body of water China wishes to dominate in the way that the United States controls the Gulf of Mexico. Now, because of North Korea's shelling, a United States aircraft carrier is participating in war games there, upsetting the Chinese.
''It's what they didn't need,'' said Andrew Gilholm, Northeast Asia analyst in Shanghai for the Control Risks Group, a London-based consulting firm. ''They're trying to squeeze out U.S. influence in the region.''
Michael J. Green, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that while China was genuinely worried -- both about North Korea's volatility and the growing United States presence in Asia -- the six-party talks were no longer a credible approach.
''This is the Chinese default position every time,'' he said. ''The question is, will the Obama administration fall for it?''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about China's proposal for emergency consultations to defuse the crisis on the Korean peninsula erroneously attributed a distinction to the catalyst for the crisis, North Korea's deadly Nov. 23 artillery shelling of an island occupied by South Korea. That shelling was the first attack on civilian areas since the armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean War; it was not the first time that South Korean civilians have been killed by North Korean weaponry since then.

HEADLINE: New Princes of Print

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
For the magazine business, 2011 will be a year to watch -- and not just because it could hold answers to lingering questions about the financial health of the industry.
Next year will be the first in a decade and a half that the four largest American magazine companies will all have new leaders, making it possible to judge whether the recent troubles in publishing can be addressed by changes in the executive suite. Or, if not, whether the problems run deeper than they now appear.
Over the summer, the magazine world's own Velvet Revolution played out -- a quick change of hands with relatively little discord: Ann Moore was out at Time Inc. after eight years as chief executive, replaced by Jack Griffin, who was poached from his job leading Meredith's magazine division. Meredith, the publishing giant responsible for Better Homes and Gardens and Family Circle, promoted one of Mr. Griffin's deputies, Tom Harty. 
At Conde Nast, Charles H. Townsend, who had held the dual role of chief executive and president since 2004, agreed to hand over the job of president to a protege, Robert A. Sauerberg. And David Carey, a longtime Conde Nast executive, departed to lead Hearst Magazines, displacing Cathleen P. Black, a publishing industry fixture for three decades and now the embattled choice of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to be the New York City schools chancellor.
Not since the mid-1990s have those jobs turned over in quick succession, and that time, the changes happened over two years. Strikingly, the economic picture then was similar to what is occurring today. The business had just begun to spring back from the devastating effects of a recession that drove away advertisers and forced publishers to close magazines.
The new cadre of executives at the time -- Steven T. Florio at Conde Nast, Christopher M. Little at Meredith, Don Logan at Time Inc. and Ms. Black at Hearst -- would steer their companies through periods of expansion and prosperity through the rest of the decade and beyond, an era when successful publications like O: The Oprah Magazine, Teen Vogue and Real Simple were born.
Whether the rebound from the economic collapse of 2008 and 2009 will prove as robust is an unsettled -- and, to many, an unsettling -- question. But there is little doubt that the next generation of magazine company executives is confronting a media landscape in which the margin for error is far smaller, and uncertainty about whether readers and advertisers will remain loyal is more palpable than ever.
''This is the changing of the guard from an older school to a newer school,'' said Justin B. Smith, president of the Atlantic Media Company. The changes, he added, were part of an inevitable evolution in publishing that was perhaps long overdue. ''It is quite remarkable that it took until 2010, 15 years after the arrival of the Internet, for a new generation of leaders to emerge.''
Indeed, the new generation is certainly more youthful, by corporate standards at least. Mr. Harty, 47, is the youngest. Mr. Carey and Mr. Sauerberg are both 49, and Mr. Griffin is 50.
They have either followed unconventional paths to the top or come from outside the companies they now help lead. Mr. Griffin was wooed from his job leading Meredith's national media group to come to Time Inc.
Mr. Carey left Conde Nast to head Hearst Magazines, a crosstown rival. Mr. Sauerberg rose through the ranks at Conde Nast not through the more traditional publisher's path but through the consumer marketing division.
Mr. Harty came to Meredith, which publishes female-oriented publications, from the Golf Digest Companies.
''You have to bring in someone who understands the magazine business, but you don't want to bring in a virgin,'' said Jack Kliger, the former chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Media, publisher of magazines like Elle and Car and Driver (and which named a new chief executive itself in September). ''I think the overwhelming message here is that these companies are looking for change agents.''
But Conde Nast, Hearst, Meredith and Time Inc. differ considerably in their approach to change -- and the degree to which they feel that change is necessary. The one certainty they all seem to embrace is a once-bitten-twice-shy caution about advertising revenue.
''Through the '90s when magazine advertising was growing at respectable rates year over year, the industry focused disproportionately on advertising,'' Mr. Griffin, a hockey player and marathon runner who is known for an economical, to-the-point speaking style, said in a recent interview. ''The laser focus on the consumer took a subsidiary seat for some period of time. What I'm doing at Time Inc. is making it pre-eminent again.''
At Time, the world's largest magazine publisher, Mr. Griffin said he wanted to reintroduce the concept of ''charging a fair price, and charging consumers who are interested in the product.''
In other words, consumers can expect to pay more. ''We spent a tremendous amount of money creating original content, original journalism, fact-checking, sending reporters overseas to cover wars,'' he said. ''You name it. What we've got to do as a business is get fair value for that.''
Supplementing that approach, Mr. Griffin said, will be new partnerships within Time Warner, Time Inc.'s parent company, that allow magazines to take advantage of the vast film and visual resources at their disposal. One such partnership in the planning stages, he said, is a deal between a major cosmetics company and InStyle to broadcast from the red carpets of big Hollywood events like the Academy Awards and the Screen Actors Guild Awards.
These kinds of partnerships are central to Mr. Griffin's vision, but some are not without impact on Time Inc.'s staff. The company recently eliminated a small number of positions in its business operations after consolidating resources with Time Warner.
Conde Nast, long the king of the $1-an-issue subscription, has also come to embrace a fair-value philosophy under Mr. Sauerberg. In an interview, Mr. Sauerberg said he and his staff had been working on creating what he called ''12-course content meals'' -- package deals that would include access to multiple Conde Nast magazines delivered in multiple ways, like print, tablet, mobile and Internet, as well as invitations to magazine-sponsored events.
''Think about our magazines as, let's say, a good content meal,'' said Mr. Sauerberg, a man with a laconic demeanor who speaks in a soft, gravely tone. ''What would a great meal be? What would a 12-course unbelievable meal be? Would it be a magazine? What's the mobile experience? What kind of event does this person want to come to? What personal advice do I need to hear about something that's really important to me?''
Higher prices seem to be an inevitable part of that package. ''We have a group of people who are so committed to our brands that I could easily see them wanting to commit to a bigger monthly commitment for lots of things they get because they're such junkies,'' Mr. Sauerberg added.
At Hearst and Meredith, which were already fairly lean companies and were less affected than Time Inc. and Conde Nast when the advertising market collapsed, changes have been considered with less urgency.
One notable change Mr. Carey made quietly at Hearst this fall was to dissolve the longstanding divide that kept online sales operations separate from the magazines themselves. (Conde Nast made a similar move late last month.)
''It felt largely siloed between print and digital,'' said Mr. Carey, who has a gentle, pensive affect and an eye for fashionable suits. ''I think we felt the need to give publishers permission and give them the sense that they could bring ever-more complex print and digital packages to their clients.'' He has now added the title ''chief revenue officer'' to the nameplate of every publisher.
''The way people perceive them, the way they are introduced to clients, the way they are written about in the press,'' he added, should convey ''a broad mandate to generate revenue.''
As for new business initiatives, Mr. Carey said Hearst was planning more joint ventures along the lines of its existing deals with Harpo, Oprah Winfrey's production company, which publishes O with Hearst, and Food Network, which teamed up with Hearst to publish the Food Network Magazine.
''Stay tuned for more announcements on the partnership front,'' he said, declining to elaborate.
Meredith, which of the four publishers is arguably the most diversified with its successful television and book publishing businesses and was the least affected by the recession, sees no need for wholesale change. ''We don't have to do these dramatic reorganizations or take drastic measures to get people in line,'' Mr. Harty said. ''We don't have to tear down silos.''
But one thing Mr. Harty said the company was examining: expanding its licensed products. The company sells products with a Better Homes and Gardens license at Wal-Mart stores, resulting in $1 billion in total sales of the products. It is now planning to sell plants and bulbs with the magazine's imprimatur directly to consumers.
''We have relationships with all these consumers,'' Mr. Harty said. ''How can we figure out how to sell them goods and services? We believe that's a key.''
Mr. Harty, burly in build and quick with a self-deprecating joke, laughed when asked about any overarching strategy and remarked, ''What I've attempted to do is not screw up what's been going very well.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 1, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about extensive leadership changes in the largest American magazine companies referred incorrectly to the revenue that the publisher Meredith derives from products marketed at Wal-Mart stores under the name of Better Homes and Gardens magazine. While the total sale of such products is indeed about $1 billion, Meredith itself does not receive that amount. (Meredith does not release figures on how much licensing revenue those sales generate.)

HEADLINE: STATE'S SECRETS; Leaked Cables Offer a Raw Look Inside U.S. Diplomacy

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE and ANDREW W. LEHREN; Scott Shane reported from Washington, and Andrew W. Lehren from New York. Reporting was contributed by Jo Becker, C. J. Chivers and James Glanz from New York; Eric Lichtblau, Michael R. Gordon, David E. Sanger, Charlie Savage, Eric Schmitt and Ginger Thompson from Washington; and Jane Perlez from Islamabad, Pakistan.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A cache of a quarter-million confidential American diplomatic cables, most of them from the past three years, provides an unprecedented look at back-room bargaining by embassies around the world, brutally candid views of foreign leaders and frank assessments of nuclear and terrorist threats.
Some of the cables, made available to The New York Times and several other news organizations, were written as recently as late February, revealing the Obama administration's exchanges over crises and conflicts. The material was originally obtained by WikiLeaks, an organization devoted to revealing secret documents. WikiLeaks posted 220 cables, some redacted to protect diplomatic sources, in the first installment of the archive on its Web site on Sunday.
The disclosure of the cables is sending shudders through the diplomatic establishment, and could strain relations with some countries, influencing international affairs in ways that are impossible to predict. 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and American ambassadors around the world have been contacting foreign officials in recent days to alert them to the expected disclosures. A statement from the White House on Sunday said: ''We condemn in the strongest terms the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents and sensitive national security information.''
The White House said the release of what it called ''stolen cables'' to several publications was a ''reckless and dangerous action'' and warned that some cables, if released in full, could disrupt American operations abroad and put the work and even lives of confidential sources of American diplomats at risk. The statement noted that reports often include ''candid and often incomplete information'' whose disclosure could ''deeply impact not only U.S. foreign policy interests, but those of our allies and friends around the world.''
The cables, a huge sampling of the daily traffic between the State Department and some 270 embassies and consulates, amount to a secret chronicle of the United States' relations with the world in an age of war and terrorism. Among their revelations, to be detailed in The Times in coming days:
A dangerous standoff with Pakistan over nuclear fuel: Since 2007, the United States has mounted a highly secret effort, so far unsuccessful, to remove from a Pakistani research reactor highly enriched uranium that American officials fear could be diverted for use in an illicit nuclear device. In May 2009, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson reported that Pakistan was refusing to schedule a visit by American technical experts because, as a Pakistani official said, ''if the local media got word of the fuel removal, 'they certainly would portray it as the United States taking Pakistan's nuclear weapons,' he argued.''
Thinking about an eventual collapse of North Korea: American and South Korean officials have discussed the prospects for a unified Korea, should the North's economic troubles and political transition lead the state to implode. The South Koreans even considered commercial inducements to China, according to the American ambassador to Seoul. She told Washington in February that South Korean officials believe that the right business deals would ''help salve'' China's ''concerns about living with a reunified Korea'' that is in a ''benign alliance'' with the United States.
Bargaining to empty the Guantanamo Bay prison: When American diplomats pressed other countries to resettle detainees, they became reluctant players in a State Department version of ''Let's Make a Deal.'' Slovenia was told to take a prisoner if it wanted to meet with President Obama, while the island nation of Kiribati was offered incentives worth millions of dollars to take in Chinese Muslim detainees, cables from diplomats recounted. The Americans, meanwhile, suggested that accepting more prisoners would be ''a low-cost way for Belgium to attain prominence in Europe.''
Suspicions of corruption in the Afghan government: When one of Afghanistan's two vice presidents visited the United Arab Emirates last year, local authorities working with the Drug Enforcement Administration discovered that he was carrying $52 million in cash. With wry understatement, a cable from the American Embassy in Kabul called the money ''a significant amount'' that the official, Ahmed Zia Massoud, ''was ultimately allowed to keep without revealing the money's origin or destination.'' (Mr. Massoud denies taking any money out of Afghanistan.)
A global computer hacking effort: China's Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems in that country, a Chinese contact told the American Embassy in Beijing in January, one cable reported. The Google hacking was part of a coordinated campaign of computer sabotage carried out by government operatives, private security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government. They have broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002, cables said.
Mixed records against terrorism: Saudi donors remain the chief financiers of Sunni militant groups like Al Qaeda, and the tiny Persian Gulf state of Qatar, a generous host to the American military for years, was the ''worst in the region'' in counterterrorism efforts, according to a State Department cable last December. Qatar's security service was ''hesitant to act against known terrorists out of concern for appearing to be aligned with the U.S. and provoking reprisals,'' the cable said.
An intriguing alliance: American diplomats in Rome reported in 2009 on what their Italian contacts described as an extraordinarily close relationship between Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister, and Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and business magnate, including ''lavish gifts,'' lucrative energy contracts and a ''shadowy'' Russian-speaking Italian go-between. They wrote that Mr. Berlusconi ''appears increasingly to be the mouthpiece of Putin'' in Europe. The diplomats also noted that while Mr. Putin enjoyed supremacy over all other public figures in Russia, he was undermined by an unmanageable bureaucracy that often ignored his edicts.
Arms deliveries to militants: Cables describe the United States' failing struggle to prevent Syria from supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has amassed a huge stockpile since its 2006 war with Israel. One week after President Bashar al-Assad promised a top State Department official that he would not send ''new'' arms to Hezbollah, the United States complained that it had information that Syria was providing increasingly sophisticated weapons to the group.
Clashes with Europe over human rights: American officials sharply warned Germany in 2007 not to enforce arrest warrants for Central Intelligence Agency officers involved in a bungled operation in which an innocent German citizen with the same name as a suspected militant was mistakenly kidnapped and held for months in Afghanistan. A senior American diplomat told a German official ''that our intention was not to threaten Germany, but rather to urge that the German government weigh carefully at every step of the way the implications for relations with the U.S.''
The 251,287 cables, first acquired by WikiLeaks, were provided to The Times by an intermediary on the condition of anonymity. Many are unclassified, and none are marked ''top secret,'' the government's most secure communications status. But some 11,000 are classified ''secret,'' 9,000 are labeled ''noforn,'' shorthand for material considered too delicate to be shared with any foreign government, and 4,000 are designated both secret and noforn.
Many more cables name diplomats' confidential sources, from foreign legislators and military officers to human rights activists and journalists, often with a warning to Washington: ''Please protect'' or ''Strictly protect.''
The Times, after consultations with the State Department, has withheld from articles and removed from documents it is posting online the names of some people who spoke privately to diplomats and might be at risk if they were publicly identified. The Times is also withholding some passages or entire cables whose disclosure could compromise American intelligence efforts. While the White House said it anticipated WikiLeaks would make public ''several hundred thousand'' cables Sunday night, the organization posted only 220 released and redacted by The Times and several European publications.
The cables show that nearly a decade after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the United States' relations with the world. They depict the Obama administration struggling to sort out which Pakistanis are trustworthy partners against Al Qaeda, adding Australians who have disappeared in the Middle East to terrorist watch lists, and assessing whether a lurking rickshaw driver in Lahore, Pakistan, was awaiting fares or conducting surveillance of the road to the American Consulate.
They show officials managing relations with a China on the rise and a Russia retreating from democracy. They document years of effort to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon -- and of worry about a possible Israeli strike on Iran with the same goal.
Even when they recount events that are already known, the cables offer remarkable details.
For instance, it has been previously reported that the Yemeni government has sought to cover up the American role in missile strikes against the local branch of Al Qaeda. But a cable's fly-on-the-wall account of a January meeting between the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the American commander in the Middle East, is breathtaking.
''We'll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours,'' Mr. Saleh said, according to the cable sent by the American ambassador, prompting one of Yemen's deputy prime ministers to ''joke that he had just 'lied' by telling Parliament'' that Yemen had carried out the strikes.
Mr. Saleh, who at other times resisted American counterterrorism requests, was in a lighthearted mood. The authoritarian ruler of a conservative Muslim country, Mr. Saleh complains of smuggling from nearby Djibouti, but tells General Petraeus that his concerns are drugs and weapons, not whiskey, ''provided it's good whiskey.''
Likewise, press reports detailed the unhappiness of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, when he was not permitted to set up his tent in Manhattan or to visit ground zero during a United Nations session last year.
But the cables add a touch of scandal and alarm to the tale. They describe the volatile Libyan leader as rarely without the companionship of ''his senior Ukrainian nurse,'' described as ''a voluptuous blonde.'' They reveal that Colonel Qaddafi was so upset by his reception in New York that he balked at carrying out a promise to return dangerous enriched uranium to Russia. The American ambassador to Libya told Colonel Qaddafi's son ''that the Libyan government had chosen a very dangerous venue to express its pique,'' a cable reported to Washington.
The cables also disclose frank comments behind closed doors. Dispatches from early this year, for instance, quote the aging monarch of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah, as speaking scathingly about the leaders of Iraq and Pakistan.
Speaking to another Iraqi official about Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, King Abdullah said, ''You and Iraq are in my heart, but that man is not.'' The king called President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan the greatest obstacle to that country's progress. ''When the head is rotten,'' he said, ''it affects the whole body.''
The American ambassador to Eritrea reported last year that ''Eritrean officials are ignorant or lying'' in denying that they were supporting the Shabab, a militant Islamist group in Somalia. The cable then mused about which seemed more likely.
As he left Zimbabwe in 2007 after three years as ambassador, Christopher W. Dell wrote a sardonic account of Robert Mugabe, that country's aging and erratic leader. The cable called him ''a brilliant tactician'' but mocked ''his deep ignorance on economic issues (coupled with the belief that his 18 doctorates give him the authority to suspend the laws of economics).''
The possibility that a large number of diplomatic cables might become public has been discussed in government and media circles since May. That was when, in an online chat, an Army intelligence analyst, Pfc. Bradley Manning, described having downloaded from a military computer system many classified documents, including ''260,000 State Department cables from embassies and consulates all over the world.'' In an online discussion with Adrian Lamo, a computer hacker, Private Manning said he had delivered the cables and other documents to WikiLeaks.
Mr. Lamo reported Private Manning's disclosures to federal authorities, and Private Manning was arrested. He has been charged with illegally leaking classified information and faces a possible court-martial and, if convicted, a lengthy prison term.
In July and October, The Times, the British newspaper The Guardian and the German magazine Der Spiegel published articles based on documents about Afghanistan and Iraq. Those collections were placed online by WikiLeaks, with selective redactions of the Afghan documents and much heavier redactions of the Iraq reports.
Fodder for Historians
Traditionally, most diplomatic cables remain secret for decades, providing fodder for historians only when the participants are long retired or dead. The State Department's unclassified history series, titled ''Foreign Relations of the United States,'' has reached only 1976.
While an overwhelming majority of the quarter-million cables provided to The Times are from the post-9/11 era, several hundred date from 1966 to the 1990s. Some show diplomats struggling to make sense of major events whose future course they could not guess.
In a 1979 cable to Washington, Bruce Laingen, an American diplomat in Tehran, mused with a knowing tone about the Iranian revolution that had just occurred: ''Perhaps the single dominant aspect of the Persian psyche is an overriding egoism,'' Mr. Laingen wrote, offering tips on exploiting this psyche in negotiations with the new government. Less than three months later, Mr. Laingen and his colleagues would be taken hostage by radical Iranian students, hurling the Carter administration into crisis and, perhaps, demonstrating the hazards of diplomatic hubris.
In 1989, an American diplomat in Panama City mulled over the options open to Gen. Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian leader, who was facing narcotics charges in the United States and intense domestic and international political pressure to step down. The cable called General Noriega ''a master of survival''; its author appeared to have no inkling that one week later, the United States would invade Panama to unseat General Noriega and arrest him.
In 1990, an American diplomat sent an excited dispatch from Cape Town: he had just learned from a lawyer for Nelson Mandela that Mr. Mandela's 27-year imprisonment was to end. The cable conveys the momentous changes about to begin for South Africa, even as it discusses preparations for an impending visit from the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson.
The voluminous traffic of more recent years -- well over half of the quarter-million cables date from 2007 or later -- show American officials struggling with events whose outcomes are far from sure. To read through them is to become a global voyeur, immersed in the jawboning, inducements and penalties the United States wields in trying to have its way with a recalcitrant world.
In an era of satellites and fiber-optic links, the cable retains the archaic name of an earlier technological era. It has long been the tool for the secretary of state to send orders to the field and for ambassadors and political officers to send their analyses to Washington.
The cables have their own lexicon: ''codel,'' for a Congressional delegation; ''visas viper,'' for a report on a person considered dangerous; ''demarche,'' an official message to a foreign government, often a protest or warning.
But the drama in the cables often comes from diplomats' narratives of meetings with foreign figures, games of diplomatic poker in which each side is sizing up the other and neither is showing all its cards.
Among the most fascinating examples recount American officials' meetings in September 2009 and February 2010 with Ahmed Wali Karzai, the half brother of the Afghan president and a power broker in the Taliban's home turf of Kandahar.
They describe Mr. Karzai, ''dressed in a crisp white shalwar kameez,'' the traditional dress of loose tunic and trousers, appearing ''nervous, though eager to express his views on the international presence in Kandahar,'' and trying to win over the Americans with nostalgic tales about his years running a Chicago restaurant near Wrigley Field.
But in midnarrative there is a stark alert for anyone reading the cable in Washington: ''Note: While we must deal with AWK as the head of the Provincial Council, he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker.'' (Mr. Karzai has denied such charges.) And the cables note statements by Mr. Karzai that the Americans, informed by a steady flow of eavesdropping and agents' reports, believe to be false.
A cable written after the February meeting coolly took note of the deceit on both sides.
Mr. Karzai ''demonstrated that he will dissemble when it suits his needs,'' the cable said. ''He appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities. We will need to monitor his activity closely, and deliver a recurring, transparent message to him'' about the limits of American tolerance.
Not All Business
Even in places far from war zones and international crises, where the stakes for the United States are not as high, curious diplomats can turn out to be accomplished reporters, sending vivid dispatches to deepen the government's understanding of exotic places.
In a 2006 account, a wide-eyed American diplomat describes the lavish wedding of a well-connected couple in Dagestan, in Russia's Caucasus, where one guest is the strongman who runs the war-ravaged Russian republic of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
The diplomat tells of drunken guests throwing $100 bills at child dancers, and nighttime water-scooter jaunts on the Caspian Sea.
''The dancers probably picked upwards of USD 5000 off the cobblestones,'' the diplomat wrote. The host later tells him that Ramzan Kadyrov ''had brought the happy couple 'a five-kilo lump of gold' as his wedding present.''
''After the dancing and a quick tour of the premises, Ramzan and his army drove off back to Chechnya,'' the diplomat reported to Washington. ''We asked why Ramzan did not spend the night in Makhachkala, and were told, 'Ramzan never spends the night anywhere.' ''
State's Secrets: Articles in this series will examine American diplomatic cables as a window on relations with the rest of the world in an age of war and terrorism.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 3, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about classified State Department cables obtained by WikiLeaks, an organization devoted to revealing secret documents, misstated the most recent year covered by the department's unclassified history series, titled ''Foreign Relations of the United States.'' It is 1976, not 1972.
The article also referred incorrectly to Ahmed Zia Massoud, an Afghan official who, a secret cable reported, visited the United Arab Emirates last year carrying $52 million in cash, described as a ''significant amount.'' Mr. Massoud, who has denied the report, was one of Afghanistan's two vice presidents; he was not the lone vice president. And the article also referred incorrectly to an unidentified Yemeni official who, according to another secret cable, had joked about lying to Yemen's parliament by saying that Yemeni forces, not American forces, had carried out missile strikes in Yemen against Al Qaeda targets. The unidentified official was one of Yemen's two deputy prime ministers, not the only one.

HEADLINE: Bombings Hit Atomic Experts In Iran Streets

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YONG and ROBERT F. WORTH; William Yong reported from Tehran, and Robert F. Worth from Cairo. William J. Broad contributed reporting from New York, and Alan Cowell from Paris.

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Unidentified assailants riding motorcycles carried out separate bomb attacks here on Monday against two of the country's top nuclear scientists, killing one and prompting accusations that the United States and Israel were again trying to disrupt Iran's nuclear program.
The slain scientist, Majid Shahriari, managed a ''major project'' for the country's Atomic Energy Organization, Iran's nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, told the semiofficial IRNA news agency. His wounded colleague, Fereydoon Abbasi, is believed to be even more important; he is on the United Nations Security Council's sanctions list for ties to the Iranian nuclear effort. 
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that ''undoubtedly the hand of the Zionist regime and Western governments is involved'' in the attacks. He also publicly acknowledged, apparently for the first time, that the country's nuclear program had been disrupted recently by malicious computer software that attacked its centrifuges.
The two scientists are among the most prominent in the Iranian nuclear world, and the brazen daylight attacks on them seemed certain to worsen tensions over the country's controversial uranium enrichment efforts.
Israel and the United States have often signaled that they will not tolerate a nuclear Iran. Neither has acknowledged pursuing sabotage or assassinations there, but both are widely believed to be pursuing ways to undermine the country's nuclear program short of bombing reactor sites, including damaging the centrifuges to slow down the production of enriched uranium.
''They're bad people, and the work they do is exactly what you need to design a bomb,'' said a federal official who assesses scientific intelligence and spoke on condition of anonymity. ''They're both top scientists.''
Philip J. Crowley, the State Department spokesman, did not address the Iranian accusations in detail. ''All I can say is we decry acts of terrorism wherever they occur and beyond that, we do not have any information on what happened,'' he said.
Diplomatic efforts to stop the Iranian nuclear program appear to have failed, and this year, the United Nations and Western powers imposed a new, tougher round of sanctions. On Oct. 29, Iran said it was willing to resume talks with the European Union over its nuclear program, a step that American officials view as a sign that the sanctions were having an effect on Iran's troubled economy. Iran has delayed a major economic reform package, apparently concerned about possible unrest if prices for basic goods rise further.
Dr. Shahriari published dozens of esoteric conference reports and peer-reviewed articles on nuclear research, at least five of which list Mr. Salehi, the Iranian nuclear agency chief, as a co-author. He was an expert on neutron transport, a field that lies at the heart of nuclear chain reactions in bombs and reactors. Some Iranian media reports said he taught at the Supreme National Defense University, which is run by the Iranian Army.
The United Nations describes Dr. Abbasi as a senior scientist in the Ministry of Defense ''working closely'' with Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, an officer in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps whom Western intelligence considers a leader in Tehran's effort to acquire a nuclear warhead. The federal analyst said that Dr. Abbasi was more deeply entwined with secretive aspects of the Iranian effort than was his slain colleague.
''Abbasi is the big one,'' the analyst said. ''He goes way, way back.''
Mr. Salehi issued an angry warning to the Western powers and their allies on Monday, saying ''the patience of the Iranian people has its limits.''
''If our patience runs out,'' he said, ''you will suffer the consequences.''
Mr. Ahmadinejad, speaking at a news conference, vowed that the nuclear program would continue, but acknowledged damage from the computer worm. ''They succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts,'' he said.
Iranian officials had previously acknowledged unspecified problems with centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium that can be used for peaceful energy generation or atomic weapons. But the Iranians had always denied that the problems were caused by malicious computer code.
A worm known as Stuxnet is believed to have struck Iran over the summer. Experts said that the program, which is precisely calibrated to send nuclear centrifuges wildly out of control, was probably developed by technicians working for a government.
Mr. Ahmadinejad did not specify the type of malicious software or those behind it, but said that ''fortunately our experts discovered that, and today they are not able anymore'' to damage Iran's centrifuges.
The motorcycle attackers attached the bombs to the professors' cars, then drove off, detonating them from a distance, according to Iranian news media reports. Dr. Abbasi's wife was also hurt, the reports said.
Last January, a remote-controlled bomb killed a physics professor, Massoud Ali Mohammadi, outside his home. The Iranian authorities also blamed that attack on the United States and Israel, a charge the State Department dismissed as absurd.
In 2007, state television said that another nuclear scientist, Ardeshir Hosseinpour, had died of gas poisoning.
Both Dr. Mohammadi and Dr. Shahriari were associated with a nonnuclear scientific research unit, based in Jordan and operating under United Nations auspices, known as Sesame, for Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East. Unusually, its nine-member council includes representatives from Israel, along with Iran and other Muslim countries. It was not clear whether the bomb attacks on the two Iranian scientists were linked to their association with the organization.
The latest bombings came a day after leaked State Department documents quoted several Arab leaders as urging the United States to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only, but many in the West and in Israel maintain that Tehran's aim is to build a nuclear bomb.

HEADLINE: Obama Declares two-year freeze on federal pay

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and JACKIE CALMES; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Monday announced a two-year pay freeze for civilian federal workers as he sought to address concerns over high annual deficits and appealed to Republicans to find a common approach to restoring the nation's economic and fiscal health.
''The hard truth is that getting this deficit under control is going to require some broad sacrifice, and that sacrifice must be shared by employees of the federal government,'' Mr. Obama told reporters. He called federal workers ''patriots who love their country'' but added, ''I'm asking civil servants to do what they've always done'' for the nation.
The pay freeze amounted to an opening bid as the president and Republican Congressional leaders begin jousting in earnest over tax and spending policy. It also illustrated how Mr. Obama can use his office on occasion to get ahead of newly elected Republicans; they had been talking about making such a move when they assume control of the House and additional Senate seats in January. 
But while the move represents a gesture toward public anger over the anemic economic recovery and rising national debt, the $5 billion to be saved over two years will barely dent a deficit that has exceeded $1 trillion for the past two years. And even those savings would be swamped by the multitrillion-dollar costs of the bigger issue dividing Mr. Obama and the Republicans -- what parts of the Bush-era tax cuts to extend beyond their Dec. 31 expiration, and for how long.
That issue and others will be on the agenda on Tuesday when Mr. Obama will host the House and Senate leaders of each party at the White House for the first time since the midterm elections.
Tuesday will also be the last day for emergency federal assistance for about two million Americans who have been unemployed for long periods, and on Friday a temporary measure providing money for government operations will run out. The two parties are at odds over both matters, with many Republicans opposed to additional unemployment aid and demanding more cuts from domestic spending for the fiscal year that began in October.
Mr. Obama nonetheless expressed optimism that the meeting would be a productive fresh beginning.
''We can't afford to fall back onto the same old ideologies or the same stale sound bites,'' he said.
As Mr. Obama made his comments at the announcement of the pay freeze, the bipartisan commission he established in February to propose ways to reduce the growth of the national debt entered a final two days of negotiations over combinations of spending cuts and revenue increases. In a sign of the struggle to find a compromise that could attract Democratic and Republicans votes, the commission chairmen -- Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader, and Erskine B. Bowles, a chief of staff to President Bill Clinton -- decided to meet privately with members one at a time on Monday and Tuesday instead of convening all 18 members.
The Republicans on the panel are generally opposed to raising taxes and the Democrats to big changes in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson revised their draft debt-reduction package over the Thanksgiving holiday break to reflect members' criticisms. Their goal is to reduce projected deficits by nearly $4 trillion over the coming decade. That is roughly the same amount that would be added to the national debt by extending the Bush-era tax rates -- a juxtaposition that underscores the contradictory impulses of elected officials as constituents demand smaller deficits and low taxes.
In advance of Tuesday's bipartisan White House meeting, Mr. Obama and Democratic Senate leaders conferred by phone to try to coordinate strategy.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi planned to have the House vote on the approach that she, Mr. Obama and the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, prefer, which would extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for income up to $250,000 a year for couples and $200,000 for individuals. But faced with defections from Democrats in swing districts and states, they are considering fallback plans, including one that would keep the Bush-era rates in place for income up to $1 million.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democratic Senate leader from New York, is the main proponent of that plan, which he is labeling the ''millionaires' tax.'' He has picked up adherents among Democrats facing re-election challenges in 2012, including Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri.
The lame-duck session of Congress could end up passing a temporary extension that kicks the matter, like other issues, into the next Congress, which convenes in January. On Monday, the House approved a Senate measure that blocks until Jan. 1 a scheduled 23 percent cut in doctors' reimbursements from Medicare -- once again buying time to resolve the costly issue.
The pay freeze Mr. Obama announced wiped out plans for a 1.4 percent across-the-board raise in 2011 for 2.1 million federal civilian employees, including those working at the Defense Department, and it would mean no raise in 2012. The freeze would not affect the nation's uniformed military personnel, and civilian workers who are promoted would still receive the higher pay that comes with the higher grade or position.
The move would save $2 billion in the 2011 fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 and $5 billion by the end of two fiscal years. Over 10 years, it would save $60 billion, according to Jeffrey Zients, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget and the government's chief performance officer.
While Congress has final word on federal pay, the president's freeze seemed certain, given the political environment; if anything, lawmakers may go further by cutting pay. Republicans noted that some of them had called for a pay freeze for months. ''We are pleased that President Obama appears ready to join our efforts,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the incoming Republican majority leader.
With Republicans vowing to make deep budget cuts, Mr. Obama must decide how far he is willing to go and where he will draw a line. He pointed out that he has already called for a three-year freeze on domestic discretionary spending, found $20 billion in savings from eliminating or scaling back unnecessary programs, identified $150 billion in improper payments.
The federal work force is an obvious first target, if one fraught with political risk for a president who relies on union support. Opponents of big government have been trying to build a political case that federal employees are being overpaid. In a report in June, Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute, a libertarian research organization in Washington, found that federal civilian workers had an average annual wage of $81,258 in 2009, compared with $50,464 for the nation's private-sector workers. Average federal salaries rose 58 percent from 2000 to 2009, compared with 30 percent in the private sector.
Union leaders, though, cited other data showing that federal workers were paid 24 percent less than their private sector counterparts, and they accused Mr. Obama of playing politics. ''Sticking it to a V.A. nurse and a Social Security worker is not the way to go,'' John Gage, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in an interview.

HEADLINE: North Korea Keeps World Guessing

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Andrew W. Lehren contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With North Korea reeling from economic and succession crises, American and South Korean officials early this year secretly began gaming out what would happen if the North, led by one of the world's most brutal family dynasties, collapsed.
Over an official lunch in late February, a top South Korean diplomat confidently told the American ambassador, Kathleen Stephens, that the fall would come ''two to three years'' after the death of Kim Jong-il, the country's ailing leader, Ms. Stephens later cabled Washington. A new, younger generation of Chinese leaders ''would be comfortable with a reunited Korea controlled by Seoul and anchored to the United States in a benign alliance,'' the diplomat, Chun Yung-woo, predicted.
But if Seoul was destined to control the entire Korean Peninsula for the first time since the end of World War II, China -- the powerful ally that keeps the North alive with food and fuel -- would have to be placated. So South Korea was already planning to assure Chinese companies that they would have ample commercial opportunities in the mineral-rich northern part of the peninsula. 
As for the United States, the cable said, ''China would clearly 'not welcome' any U.S. military presence north of the DMZ,'' the heavily mined demarcation line that now divides the two Koreas.
This trove of cables ends in February, just before North Korea began a series of military actions that has thrown some of Asia's most prosperous countries into crisis. A month after the lunch, the North is believed to have launched a torpedo attack on the Cheonan, a South Korean warship, that killed 46 sailors.
Three weeks ago it revealed the existence of a uranium enrichment plant, potentially giving it a new pathway to make nuclear bomb material. And last week it shelled a South Korean island, killing two civilians and two marines and injuring many more.
None of that was predicted in the dozens of State Department cables about North Korea obtained by WikiLeaks, and in fact even China, the North's closest ally, has often been startlingly wrong, the cables show. But the documents help explain why some South Korean and American officials suspect that the military outbursts may be the last snarls of a dying dictatorship.
They also show that talk of the North's collapse may be rooted more in hope than in any real strategy: similar predictions were made in 1994 when the country's founder, Kim Il-sung, suddenly died, leaving his son to run the most isolated country in Asia. And a Chinese expert warned, according to an American diplomat, that Washington was deceiving itself once again if it believed that ''North Korea would implode after Kim Jong-il's death.''
The cables about North Korea -- some emanating from Seoul, some from Beijing, many based on interviews with government officials, and others with scholars, defectors and other experts -- are long on educated guesses and short on facts, illustrating why their subject is known as the Black Hole of Asia. Because they are State Department documents, not intelligence reports, they do not include the most secret American assessments, or the American military's plans in case North Korea disintegrates or lashes out.
They contain loose talk and confident predictions of the end of the dynasty that has ruled North Korea for 65 years. Those discussions were fueled by a rash of previously undisclosed defections of ranking North Korean diplomats, who secretly sought refuge in the South.
But they were also influenced by a remarkable period of turmoil inside North Korea, including an economic crisis set off by the government's failed effort to revalue the currency and sketchy intelligence suggesting that the North's military might not abide the rise of Mr. Kim's son Kim Jong-un, who was recently made a four-star general despite having no military experience.
The cables reveal that in private, the Chinese, long seen as North Korea's last protectors against the West, occasionally provide the Obama administration with colorful assessments of the state of play in North Korea. Chinese officials themselves sometimes even laugh about the frustrations of dealing with North Korean paranoia.
When James B. Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state, sat down in September 2009 with one of China's most powerful officials, Dai Bingguo, state councilor for foreign affairs, Mr. Dai joked that in a recent visit to North Korea he ''did not dare'' to be too candid with the ailing and mercurial North Korean leader. But the Chinese official reported that although Kim Jong-il had apparently suffered a stroke and had obviously lost weight, he still had a ''sharp mind'' and retained his reputation among Chinese officials as ''quite a good drinker.'' (Mr. Kim apparently assured Mr. Dai during a two-hour conversation in Pyongyang, the capital, that his infirmities had not forced him to give up alcohol.)
But reliable intelligence about Mr. Kim's drinking habits, it turns out, does not extend to his nuclear program, about which even the Chinese seem to be in the dark.
On May 13, 2009, as American satellites showed unusual activity at North Korea's nuclear test site, officials in Beijing said they were ''unsure'' that North Korean ''threats of another nuclear test were serious.'' As it turns out, the North Koreans detonated a test bomb just days later.
Soon after, Chinese officials predicted that negotiations intended to pressure the North to disarm would be ''shelved for a few months.'' They have never resumed.
The cables also show that almost as soon as the Obama administration came to office, it started raising alarms that the North was buying up components to enrich uranium, opening a second route for it to build nuclear weapons. (Until now, the North's arsenal has been based on its production of plutonium, but its production capacity has been halted.)
In June 2009, at a lunch in Beijing shortly after the North Korean nuclear test, two senior Chinese Foreign Ministry officials reported that China's experts believed ''the enrichment was only in its initial phases.'' In fact, based on what the North Koreans revealed this month, an industrial-scale enrichment plant was already under construction. It was apparently missed by both American and Chinese intelligence services.
The cables make it clear that the South Koreans believe that internal tensions in the North have reached a boiling point. In January of this year, South Korea's foreign minister, who later resigned, reported to a visiting American official that the South Koreans saw an ''increasingly chaotic'' situation in the North.
In confidence, he told the American official, Robert R. King, the administration's special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, that a number of ''high-ranking North Korean officials working overseas'' had recently defected to the South. Those defections were being kept secret, presumably to give American and South Korean intelligence agencies time to harvest the defectors' knowledge.
But the cables also reveal that the South Koreans see their strategic interests in direct conflict with China's, creating potentially huge diplomatic tensions over the future of the Korean Peninsula.
The South Koreans complain bitterly that China is content with the status quo of a nuclear North Korea, because they fear that a collapse would unleash a flood of North Korean refugees over the Chinese border and lead to the loss of a ''buffer zone'' between China and the American forces in South Korea.
At one point, Ambassador Stephens reported to Washington, a senior South Korean official told her that ''unless China pushed North Korea to the 'brink of collapse,' '' the North would refuse to take meaningful steps to give up its nuclear program.
Mr. Chun, now the South Korean national security adviser, complained to Ambassador Stephens during their lunch that China had little commitment to the multination talks intended to force North Korea to dismantle its nuclear arsenal. The Chinese, he said, had chosen Wu Dawei to represent Beijing at the talks. According to the cable, Mr. Chun called Mr. Wu the country's '' 'most incompetent official,' an arrogant, Marx-spouting former Red Guard who 'knows nothing about North Korea, nothing about non-proliferation.' ''
But the cables show that when it comes to the critical issue of succession, even the Chinese know little of the man who would be North Korea's next ruler: Kim Jong-un.
As recently as February 2009, the American Consulate in Shanghai -- a significant collection point for intelligence about North Korea -- sent cables reporting that the Chinese who knew North Korea best disbelieved the rumors that Kim Jong-un was being groomed to run the country. Several Chinese scholars with good contacts in the North said they thought it was likely that ''a group of high-level military officials'' would take over, and that ''at least for the moment none of KJI's three sons is likely to be tapped to succeed him.'' The oldest son was dismissed as ''too much of a playboy,'' the middle son as ''more interested in video games'' than governing. Kim Jong-un, they said, was too young and inexperienced.
But within months, a senior Chinese diplomat, Wu Jianghao, was telling his American counterparts that Kim Jong-il was using nuclear tests and missile launchings as part of an effort to put his third son in place to succeed him, despite his youth.
''Wu opined that the rapid pace of provocative actions in North Korea was due to Kim Jong-il's declining health and might be part of a gambit under which Kim Jong-il would escalate tensions with the United States so that his successor, presumably Kim Jong-un, could then step in and ease those tensions,'' the embassy reported back to Washington in June 2009.
But carrying out plans for an easy ascension may be more difficult than expected, some are quoted as saying. In February of this year the American Consulate in Shenyang reported rumors that Kim Jong-un ''had a hand'' in the decision to revalue the North's currency, which wiped out the scarce savings of most North Koreans and created such an outcry that one official was executed for his role in the sudden financial shift. The cables also describe secondhand reports of palace intrigue in the North, with other members of the Kim family preparing to serve as regents to Kim Jong-un -- or to unseat him after Kim Jong-il's death.

HEADLINE: Breaking Away From Coal

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Progress Energy Carolinas, one of the South's larger utilities, faced a dilemma last winter.
Several of its coal-fired power plants were aging and needed scrubbers to reduce emissions and meet North Carolina pollution laws. Executives figured that even tougher regulations were coming from Washington, and overhauling 11 generators at four plants would have cost nearly $2 billion, which would have been passed on to the company's 1.5 million electric customers.
Plunging natural gas prices, however, offered Progress Energy an alternative that would save money and help it achieve pollution goals at the same time: scrapping the coal plants and replacing them with two gas plants over the next four years, at a cost of $1.5 billion.
''It's a turning point,'' said Bill Johnson, chairman and chief executive of Progress Energy, the parent company. ''We've been a coal-based generator for decades, and until a few years ago, we thought we would remain largely coal-based and nuclear until people started talking about carbon regulation. We decided we had to do something about it.'' 
A lot of utilities are coming to a similar conclusion. Over the last year and a half, at least 10 power companies have announced plans to close more than three dozen of their oldest, least efficient coal-burning generators by 2019. A few are being replaced by new, more efficient coal plants, but many more are being replaced by gas-fired plants.
Coal still accounts for about half of the country's electrical power generation, compared with about a quarter for natural gas, but that ratio has been shifting gradually toward gas over the last decade or so.
Gas burns cleaner than coal, helping utilities meet state and corporate goals for reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. Older coal plants, on the other hand, require expensive upgrades, including scrubbers and other controls, to meet coming compliance rules to reduce mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions. Energy specialists estimate that compliance with new federal regulations alone could require $70 billion of investments over the next decade for replacing or retrofitting the coal power fleet.
Just as significant, gas prices have remained at depressed levels over the last two years after a two-thirds collapse from the 2008 economic tumult, while coal prices have increased by more than a third this year because of higher production costs linked to tougher regulations and increased demand from China. Many people in the industry believe that gas prices will stay relatively low because of the proliferation of gas drilling in shale fields across the country over the last five years.
''Coal is losing its advantage incrementally to gas,'' said Michael Zenker, a gas analyst at Barclays Capital, ''and as long as gas prices stay as low as they have been, it's going to continue indefinitely.'' New gas generation capacity will outstrip new coal generation capacity by more than 30 percent through 2020, according to projections from the Energy Department. And Credit Suisse predicts that the replacement of coal plants by gas plants over the next seven years could lower annual demand for steam coal, which is burned for electricity, by 15 to 31 percent and increase demand for gas by 8 to 16 percent.
''It has the potential to reshape energy consumption in the United States significantly and permanently,'' said Dan Eggers, a Credit Suisse energy analyst.
Although coal is also being replaced by nuclear and renewable energy sources in some places, energy specialists say that gas will be the main benefactor because of availability and cost.
Since burning gas emits a fraction of the greenhouse gas of coal, environmentalists tend to favor the switch, although some worry that more gas drilling could pollute groundwater because of the chemicals used in breaking up shale rock.
Pollution laws generally make gas more appealing than coal. Even as many states like Colorado and Michigan enacted stricter pollution laws, the Environmental Protection Agency last summer imposed new limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions in 31 Eastern states and Washington by 2014.
Under court order, the E.P.A. is due to set a national standard for mercury emissions next year that will be phased in over the next three years or so. The E.P.A. is also pressing for efficiency improvements at existing coal plants to lower carbon emissions linked to climate change.
''The biggest challenge we face in this industry is this tsunami of regulatory requirements,'' said Frank Prager, vice president for environmental policy at Xcel Energy, a Minneapolis-based utility that has proposed to close four or five coal-fired generators in Colorado and replace them with two gas-fired plants to comply with a new state air pollution law.
''It will be more cost-effective to get off coal and turn toward natural gas than it is to retrofit a lot of these facilities,'' Mr. Prager said.
Seventy percent of the nation's coal plant fleet is more than 30 years old and a third is over 40 years old. Credit Suisse estimates that more than 30 percent of the American coal generating fleet have no emission controls at all, while another third lack either a scrubber for removal of sulfur dioxide or other controls for nitrogen oxides. Those plants, which are largely inefficient, will need expensive overhauls under the new rules.
Sonny Garg, president of Exelon Power, said he expected that the plants with no emission controls would probably be closed by their owners, who he says will be wary of investing billions of dollars on old equipment. ''It's a significant transformation,'' Mr. Garg said.
Exelon Power has already announced the closing of three Eisenhower-era, coal-fired generators in Pennsylvania by May 2012 because low gas prices have made retail electricity rates so low the plants are no longer economical to run.
Of course, not everyone thinks gas makes more economic sense. For example, a coalition of investors is building a $4 billion coal-fired generation plant in Illinois, betting that coal prices will remain low enough and regulations light to outperform gas.
Indeed, retrofitting a coal plant can be somewhat cheaper than constructing a new combined cycle gas turbine, industry officials say.
''A very wide range of utilities are wrestling with this issue of identifying what plants they would close because they are anticipating these regulations and there is a lot of planning going on right now,'' said Revis James, director of energy technology assessment center at the Electric Power Research Institute.
Utility executives have long been cautious about using gas because its price has historically bounced around unpredictably while coal prices have typically been low and stable. But that appears to be changing. Over the last decade, new drilling techniques have brought a century's supply of reserves within reach.
For Progress, the decision to scrap coal-fired plants and replace them with gas-fired plants was a drastic change in its business plan. It meant reducing the utility's coal-fired production capacity by 30 percent while increasing gas power from less than 4 percent of its production capacity to a projected 25 percent after the gas plants are built.
''You had to believe that gas was available long term'' at reasonable prices, Mr. Johnson, Progress's chief executive, said of the decision. ''Around the country, people are having to have the same discussion, and what I think you are going to see is a significant move from older coal plants to newer gas plants.''

HEADLINE: Global Climate-Change Talks Begin in Cancun With More Modest Expectations

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Elisabeth Rosenthal contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Global talks on climate change opened in Cancun, Mexico, on Monday with the toughest issues unresolved and little expectation of a breakthrough on shaping an international treaty to curb emissions of the heat-trapping gases linked to global warming.
But some who attended the meetings, sponsored by the United Nations, expressed muted hope that small steps could be made on a decades-long journey to reduce the planetary threat of rising global temperatures. 
The United States entered the talks in a weak position because of a lack of action on domestic climate and energy legislation and continuing disputes with China and other major developing nations over verification of emissions reductions. The United Nations negotiating process itself is on the line, with many saying that the 190-nation talks cannot survive another debacle like that at Copenhagen last December.
This year's talks come at a low point for global climate diplomacy. Last year, more than 100 heads of state gathered with hopes of fashioning a binding treaty to address global warming. A year later, midlevel envoys are trickling into a Mexican resort with hopes, at best, of averting disaster.
Last year, President Obama had large majorities in Congress and hopes of passing a comprehensive climate and energy bill. Next year, he faces a new Congress much more dubious about the reality of climate change and considerably more hostile to international efforts to deal with it.
Still, leaders expressed belief that the United Nations remained the best, if not the only, place to address a problem that will require a global solution.
''We're not going to solve the whole problem this year, but we can lock in bigger and better agreements every year,'' said Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who took over this year as executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the body that convenes the talks. ''Multilateral negotiations such as this one involve not just solving an environmental problem but actually involve the transformation of economic patterns and the economic structure we have lived with for decades.''
The annual climate change conference combines the technical complexity of arms control negotiations with the leaden pace of global trade talks. It attracts thousands of journalists, environmental campaigners and corporate executives, each looking for a story or selling a product.
The actual negotiations tend to take place behind closed doors, where progress is measured in verb tenses and punctuation changes. And nothing of significance seems to happen until the 11th hour of the final day.
This year's conference opened with the same set of issues that the participants left on the table when the meeting in Copenhagen broke up a year ago and the same flawed document -- the Copenhagen Accord -- before them.
At the end of the chaotic talks in Copenhagen, participants failed to adopt the accord, a nonbinding statement of good intentions, but only ''took note'' of the three-page document. About half the participating countries have since agreed to ''associate'' themselves with the accord.
But even if all the promised emissions reductions in the accord were achieved, the world would still fall short of the action needed to meet the goal of keeping global average temperatures within two degrees Celsius of preindustrial times.
Despite a year of preliminary meetings, delegates remain far apart on the two biggest questions: how much and how quickly nations will reduce their emissions of climate-altering gases and what sort of international monitoring can be established to ensure that countries are meeting their targets. No one expects that the gaps on those issues will be significantly closed over the next two weeks in Cancun.
There has, however, been some progress on the other four major points of discussion at the talks. Those involve slowing the destruction of forests, sharing technology to produce energy in less-destructive ways, helping poorer countries adapt to the inevitable changes to the climate and building a multibillion-dollar fund to further these goals.
The goal at Cancun, according to negotiators and observers, would be a ''balanced package'' of progress on each of those issues and an agreement by the wealthier countries to make good on their promise to come up with $30 billion in short-term financing to help developing nations adjust to global climate disruption.
Jonathan Pershing, the deputy United States climate envoy, said Monday in Cancun that while preliminary talks this year had been hung up by disputes over substance and procedure, ''We are optimistic we can work through many, if not all of these.''
He also said that the United States and China had made progress on some issues dividing them and that the United States was prepared to contribute $1.7 billion to the short-term adaptation fund, most of it new money appropriated by Congress.
What remains really difficult, and what most likely will not be resolved at Cancun, is the fate of the 13-year-old Kyoto Protocol, the global warming agreement largely set to expire at the end of 2012. The protocol -- never accepted by the United States -- sets different requirements for developed and developing countries. It has been used as a cudgel by large developing countries like China, India and Brazil to demand more emissions reductions by the United States and other advanced economies as a price for their own participation in any global climate regime.
China has passed the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse pollutants and has voluntarily taken large strides toward slowing the growth of its emissions. But it refuses to be bound to an international agreement that does not require larger, verifiable reductions from the United States and other wealthy countries.
The United States is demanding that the protocol's distinctions among countries be scrapped and that all nations move forward together to attack the problem of global climate change. Until that fundamental dispute is resolved, the prospects for progress are slim.
''Success here will mean finally discarding Kyoto and beginning the process of requiring major developing countries to cut emissions along with developed countries,'' said Paul W. Bledsoe of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, who is in Cancun and has followed climate deliberations for years. ''Both substantive and political progress demand that the Kyoto stalking horse be let loose.''

HEADLINE: Back to the Costly Skies

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
As American companies negotiate airline and hotel rates for 2011, they are encountering a market much different from a year ago, when the economy, and business travel with it, were still feeble.
This time around, in a sign of how much has changed, top corporate travel agencies and travel consultants say they now expect negotiated airfares and hotel rates in the United States to climb next year, with double-digit increases in hotel rates in cities like New York.
''Throughout 2010, companies have lifted travel restrictions brought on by red bottom line fears, and this is expected to continue into 2011,'' said Christa Degnan Manning, director of research at American Express Business Travel. ''Pricing power will swing back to air and hotel suppliers for the first time in two years in 2011.'' 
Similarly, Craig Banikowski, president and chief executive of the National Business Travel Association, a trade group of corporate travel managers, said he expected that as the economy continued to improve and international travel costs rose, ''we will see airlines and hotels wield more negotiating power.''
Many travel buyers ''are already experiencing stricter contract terms and requirements, and we expect this to result in smaller corporate discounts going forward,'' he said.
Mark L. Walton, a principal in Buffalo Grove, Ill., of Consulting Strategies, a travel management consulting company, said corporate airfare negotiations would be difficult because ''the airlines have done a really good job of reining in capacity.'' As a result, he said, ''supply and demand are probably as efficient today as they ever have been.''
With airlines holding down capacity and filling their planes, Ms. Manning said she expected negotiated domestic coach fares to increase 2 to 6 percent next year and business-class fares on long-haul international flights to rise 3 to 7 percent. Carlson Wagonlit Travel also forecast increases of 3 to 5 percent on domestic coach tickets and 4 to 6 percent on international first-class tickets.
Ms. Manning said one way corporations can contain air travel costs is to require employees to buy advance purchase fares sold to the public. Egencia, the corporate travel arm of Expedia, estimated that these fares could save travelers 22 to 50 percent on flights to many popular business travel destinations.
Hogg Robinson Group, a business travel adviser, is telling its North American clients to use negotiated corporate rates for international travel, but to maintain their corporate deals on domestic flights and to buy advance purchase tickets, if possible.
''Our advice to clients is to use their domestic corporate rate as a default position, but to be open to the lower fare on the day of booking as well,'' said Stewart Harvey, client management director at Hogg Robinson Group.
Recent consolidation in the industry -- particularly the mergers of Continental and United along with Delta and Northwest, which have led to the strengthening of their Star and Sky Team global alliances -- have given airlines even more leverage than before in corporate negotiations.
''If corporations want good discounts on their 2011 fares, they will have to concentrate their business with fewer carriers,'' Ms. Manning said.
Mr. Walton said he expected airline alliances -- which also include OneWorld -- would ''negotiate as a combined entity.'' In the past, he said, ''corporations negotiated individually with United, Lufthansa, American, British Airways. Today, they're negotiating with two alliances.''
As for hotel prices, Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, said many travel managers believe they overpaid for hotel accommodations in 2009, when the average corporate negotiated rate rose 1.5 percent and the national average daily rate fell 8.6 percent. ''The average corporate negotiated rate also increased more than the national average daily rate in 2008 and 2010, but not by as much,'' he said, adding that travel managers want a minimal increase in negotiated rates next year.
But he said he did not expect they would get what they want. Rather, he predicted that the average corporate hotel rate would rise about 4 percent in 2011, with increases varying greatly. In New York, where demand has remained strong, he said he expected increases as high as 20 percent. Negotiated rates could also climb significantly more than 4 percent in other popular business travel destinations, like Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston and Philadelphia, he said.
Smith Travel Research forecasts revenue per available room in these cities, as well as in New York, will jump 5 to 10 percent next year.
To hold down hotel spending in more expensive markets, nearly half of the companies in the United States will probably require some employees to downgrade from full-service to select-service hotels, Mr. Hanson said.
Hotel Internet fees have ''become a pinata everyone is swinging at'' in negotiations, said Andrew Menkes, chief executive of Partnership Travel Consulting in Princeton, N.J. ''The elephant in the room in hotel negotiations,'' Mr. Menkes added, is that major corporations are ''barely getting 50 percent to 60 percent of their employees to book through their agency. They're more likely to get a better rate in negotiations if they have effective control over their hotel program.''

HEADLINE: As Penny-Pinchers Hover, Business Trips Rebound

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE annual Zagat survey of customer attitudes toward airline service came out on Monday and, as usual, some reviews are not good.
''The only thing missing is a cigarette and a blindfold,'' said one of the more than 8,000 frequent travelers quoted in the ''outtakes'' section of the survey. ''Like a cattle car, except the cows are mercifully slaughtered at trip's end,'' another chimed in.
On the other hand, groans aside, air travel has been increasing this year. As one indication, those who responded to the Zagat survey have averaged 17.4 flights so far this year, compared with 16.3 for the period last year. 
Some airlines, after a long period of cutting capacity, are now cautiously adding seats to accommodate the growth in demand. Delta, for example, said in October that its fourth-quarter capacity would be up 3 to 5 percent domestically and 10 to 12 percent internationally.
Wall Street loves hearing that airlines are holding the line on capacity because it means that supply and demand are balanced in favor of the supplier. But since January, according to a recent report by the International Air Transport Association, worldwide airline capacity ''has entered the market at a faster rate than demand.'' Airlines have been rushing to assure stock market analysts that they still have the demand-supply equation under control.
Meanwhile, companies are alarmed by indications that travel costs are rising, even as improved economic conditions argue for sending more employees out on the road. Next year, according to the American Express Global Business Travel Forecast released last month, ''pricing power will swing back to air and hotel suppliers for the first time in two years.''
For business travelers, of course, this all means more lectures from corporate travel managers about saving money. As the American Express report put it, companies need to re-examine cost control tactics to guard against the expected ''significant rate increases'' next year.
According to the annual Business Traveler Survey just released by the consulting company Deloitte, 24 percent of respondents plan to take more business trips next year and an additional 56 percent expect to take at least as many as in 2010. They're on a tighter rein, too. Half said they were now required to obtain preapproval for business trips. Nearly a quarter said they were now staying at cheaper hotels.
Companies are especially tightening up on pretrip approval, said Adam F. Weissenberg, a Deloitte vice chairman who heads its travel and leisure division. Before the recession, he said, ''people were traveling kind of at will, while business was great.'' Now, many companies are saying, ''wait a second, we need to go back and take a hard look at how our people travel,'' Mr. Weissenberg said.
Increasingly, he said, the approval process means ''having the person make a business case'' for the trip. Also, he added, many companies have become stricter on auditing expense accounts, while insisting on better adherence to travel policies, including deals that corporations make with preferred airlines, hotels and other suppliers.
Now, those of us who have been around this rodeo for a while have seen this particular event many times. Corporate travel managers wail that costs are soaring, and they demand compliance with new or old, but always strict, travel policies -- or else.
But as business conditions improve and the need to travel becomes compelling, many business travelers push back and say, in effect, ''Whaddya mean I have to save money by connecting on that crummy airline through Chicago and Houston to get to my destination in Los Angeles, where you expect me to stay at some cheap hotel that's an hour's drive from my meeting?''
It is no secret whose side I am generally on in these inexorable tugs of war between those who must be on the road and those who pay the bills. As I have often said, a smart company knows that a valuable employee who travels with a basic measure of comfort is a more productive employee -- even if that means paying for a business-class seat to ensure that the employee can work and rest on the plane and then arrive ready to go after that long flight to Shanghai.
So we'll listen to the lectures and travel with our usual fiscal prudence. But we can take heart in a statistic released by the International Air Transport Association. Penny-pinching aside, international premium travel in first- and business-class was up 12.1 percent in September.
As they say at the rodeo, Yippee!

HEADLINE: Inefficiency Hurts U.S. In Ranking Of Health

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS BAKALAR

 BODY:
By any measure, the United States spends more on health care than any other nation. Yet according to the World Fact Book (published by the Central Intelligence Agency), it ranks 49th in life expectancy.
Why?
Researchers writing in the November issue of the journal Health Affairs say they know the answer. After citing statistical evidence showing that American patterns of obesity, smoking, traffic accidents and homicide are not the cause of lower life expectancy, they conclude that the problem is the health care system. 
Peter A. Muennig and Sherry A. Glied, researchers at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, compared the performance of the United States and 12 other industrialized nations: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. In addition to health care expenditures in each country, they focused on two other important statistics: 15-year survival for people at 45 years and for those at 65 years.
The researchers say those numbers present an accurate picture of public health because they measure a country's success in preventing and treating the most common causes of death -- cardiovascular disease, stroke and diabetes -- which are more likely to occur at these ages. Their data come from the World Health Organization and cover 1975 to 2005.
Life expectancy increased over those years in all 13 countries, and so did health care costs. But the United States had the lowest increase in life expectancy and the highest increase in costs.
In 1975 the United States was close to the average in health care costs, and last in 15-year survival for 45-year-old men. By 2005 its costs had more than tripled, far surpassing increases elsewhere, but the survival number was still last -- a little over 90 percent, compared with more than 94 percent for Swedes, Swiss and Australians. For women, it was 94 percent in the United States, versus 97 percent in Switzerland, Australia and Japan.
The numbers for 65-year-olds in 2005 were similar: about 58 percent of American men could be expected to survive 15 years, compared with more than 65 percent of Australians, Japanese and Swiss. While more than 80 percent of 65-year-old women in France, Switzerland, and Japan would survive 15 years, only about 70 percent of American women could be expected to live that long.
In narrowing the blame to the American health care system, the researchers first eliminated several other factors. Obesity and smoking are the most important behavior-related causes of death, but obesity increased more slowly in the United States than in the other countries and smoking declined more rapidly, so neither can explain the differences in survival rates. Homicide and traffic fatality rates have remained steady over time, and social, economic and educational factors do not vary greatly among these countries.
But not all experts agree with this analysis. Samuel Preston, a demographer and a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, says the analysis is faulty.
''The basic message is correct -- that measures of U.S. health, including mortality and morbidity, are very poor in comparison with other countries,'' he said. But the Columbia researchers ''have no direct evidence about the health care system in this article,'' he continued. ''Their conclusion is extremely speculative.''
That they did not find smoking at fault, Dr. Preston said, ''is mysterious to me, particularly since they show high lung cancer mortality for the U.S.'' Dr. Preston has published widely on mortality trends and the effects of smoking.
Dr. Muennig conceded that the study examined only life expectancy and health care spending in the 13 countries, and not the structure or economics of health care. ''We did a pretty good job of showing that smoking isn't the culprit,'' he said.
''Smoking and obesity are still major risk factors for an individual's health,'' he said. ''But they are sapping life expectancy in all countries. Whereas in the U.S. we have a highly inefficient health system that's taking away financial resources from other lifesaving programs.''

HEADLINE: Some Renters Need a Guarantor, or Maybe a Genie

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
In New York City real estate, there are few titles more thankless than guarantor. But they are needed by many.
People who do not make enough to afford their paycheck-devouring rents must find a wealthy relative, a benevolent family friend or perhaps a kidnapped and hypnotized multimillionaire to supply personal financial information and assume responsibility for their leases.
Rachel Wagner, Emily Coit and Taylor Jewell, recent college graduates and childhood friends from Portland, Ore., discovered that finding such a guardian angel was almost as hard as finding an apartment. 
They had lined up a $3,400-a-month apartment on the Upper East Side, but could not meet the standard Manhattan landlord requirement that their combined salaries equal 40 times the monthly rent, or $136,000. So they would need a guarantor making 70 times the rent, $238,000.
Many landlords prefer guarantors who live nearby, because it is much harder to pursue judgments from afar, said Jamie Heiberger, a lawyer who represents landlords.
But in August, the landlord for the apartment the young women were trying to rent changed the building's policy requiring the guarantor to live in the region. The women made awkward calls to relatives and friends. Ms. Coit was going to ask an uncle from Buffalo who is in his 70s. But she ultimately did not, because his income would not qualify. She asked a family friend from Connecticut, who declined because he felt uncomfortable providing his tax returns, bank statements and Social Security number. Ms. Jewell's uncle, who has real estate investments here, also did not qualify under the income requirements.
Blair Brandt, whose referral company, the Next Step Realty, helped these friends find their broker and guided them through the process, said many graduates arriving in Manhattan had been facing this problem.
Ms. Heiberger said landlords were being extra careful because the recession had made the problem of unpaid rent so widespread.
''There can be the hedge fund guy that's out of a job, or it could be the college student that can't find a job,'' she said.
The friends' parents reached an agreement with the landlord by putting several months' rent in escrow; the friends recently moved in.
But they still find the requirement strange. Ms. Jewell's father, Steve Jewell, who is a landlord in Portland, does not require his renters to have guarantors.
''It's far beyond certainly anything that would be done in Portland,'' Mr. Jewell said. ''But we understand it's a different market.''
'Transitional' Nesting
While it sometimes seems as if there is an endless stream of New Yorkers spending their Wall Street bonuses and inheritances on Classic Six co-ops and glassy condominiums, there are, of course, plenty of New Yorkers who want more than anything to buy, but simply cannot. As they wait for their fortunes to turn, some of them spruce up the homes in which they are, at least for now, stuck.
After Linda La Porte and Anthony Torres married in August 2009, they settled into an apartment they rented from a friend in Astoria, Queens, while they saved for a down payment.
But in June, their friend had to move back into his apartment. Then Mr. Torres received orders from the Air Force Reserve to head to flight school, leaving Ms. La Porte to move their belongings into a smaller, $1,900-a-month apartment nearby.
To distract herself from missing her husband, Ms. La Porte attended a workshop held by the decorator Jill Vegas to pick up some ideas. She replaced the red curtains she had hastily put up, chose a photograph of a geisha to place over the couch and bought turquoise and cream throw pillows. She kept her husband updated with photographs.
''It kind of helps me focus on something else,'' Ms. La Porte said. ''We didn't expect him to be gone so long. That's been very, very hard to deal with.''
Ms. Vegas said she had seen uncertainty among many of the 150 students who attended her decorating classes this fall, with many ''wanting to snuggle in to what they have.''
One of her students, Virginia Foxton, wants to buy in the suburbs with her husband, Mark, and their 11-month-old daughter, Avery. But they had to wait, because they could not sell the condo they own in San Francisco, where they used to live; it had been tied up in a lawsuit, with the developer going bankrupt.
In October, they moved to a new rental in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, from the Upper West Side and tried to make the small space feel new by removing some clutter. They stored furniture and a barbecue and donated baby toys and a car seat to an expectant friend. Since the lawsuit has just settled, they hope to buy within a year.
''It's definitely a transitional place, but it feels new,'' Ms. Foxton said of the new apartment. ''The focus is eventually on living in a space that we own.''

HEADLINE: Report Finds Signs of Progress In Tackling School Dropout Rates

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
The nation's high school graduation rate, which declined in the latter part of the 20th century, may have hit bottom and begun to rise, according to a report to be issued Tuesday by a nonprofit group founded by former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. 
''The United States is turning a corner in meeting the high school dropout epidemic,'' General Powell and his wife, Alma J. Powell, wrote in a letter introducing the report.
The report cites two statistics. The national graduation rate increased to 75 percent in 2008, from 72 percent in 2001. And the number of high schools that researchers call dropout factories -- based on a formula that compares a school's 12th-grade enrollment with its 9th-grade enrollment three years earlier -- declined to about 1,750 in 2008, from about 2,000 such schools in 2002.
But the report notes that progress in some states and school districts had not been matched in others. Tennessee and New York made ''breakthrough gains,'' sharply raising their graduation rates from 2002 to 2008, the report says. In Arizona, Utah and Nevada, graduation rates dropped significantly.
The 88-page report, ''Building a Grad Nation,'' was published by America's Promise Alliance, along with two other groups. ''I like this report because it shows that progress is possible against all odds,'' said Marguerite W. Kondracke, the alliance's president.
Daniel Losen, a former Harvard lecturer who researches graduation issues, said the report ''might be a bit on the rosy side.'' He added, ''We might be beginning to turn a corner, but we're not coming out of it yet.''
The report cites school districts that have made progress, as well as some where the crisis has worsened.
In 2005, researchers at Johns Hopkins University identified Richmond High School in Indiana as a dropout factory. But from 2006 to 2009, teachers, community leaders and professors joined in an effort to help students stay in school, raising the graduation rate to 80 percent from 53 percent, the report says.
In Las Vegas, however, dropouts soared during the building boom of the last decade because many young people quit high school for jobs in construction and landscaping. Today, many dropouts there are unemployed.

HEADLINE: Head Out for a Daily Dose of Green Space

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
First, the bad news: Americans are suffering from an acute case of ''outdoor deprivation disorder,'' and the effects on physical and mental health are rising fast. Children aged 8 to 18 today spend more time than ever using electronic media indoors -- seven and a half hours a day, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation -- and less time in outdoor unstructured activity. In response to the No Child Left Behind law, 30 percent of kindergarten classrooms have eliminated recess to make more room for academics.
The resulting lack of physical activity and a growing disconnect with the natural environment have been linked in a host of studies to obesity and obesity-related diseases in children and adults, including Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, as well as vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, stress, depression, attention deficit disorder and myopia. Dr. Daphne Miller, a family physician affiliated with the University of California, San Francisco, calls them ''diseases of indoor living.'' 
Now, the good news: There's a simple remedy -- get outside and start moving around in green spaces near and far, most of which are free. A consortium of physicians, health insurers, naturalists and government agencies have banded together to help more people of all ages and economic strata engage in health-enhancing physical activity in parks and other natural environments.
This grass-roots movement has already reached the White House. This year President Obama started the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, proclaiming June ''Great Outdoors Month.'' The initiative aims not just to counter sedentary lifestyles but also to reacquaint Americans with the farms, ranches, rivers, forests, national and local parks, fishing holes and beaches that provide opportunities for people ''to stay active and healthy.''
The goals dovetail with Michelle Obama's battle against childhood obesity and her initiative Let's Move Outside, a program that's part of her Let's Move campaign. Dr. Miller said that the aim was to ''turn our public lands into public health resources. Doctors around the country are beginning to realize that getting patients out of doors has benefits even beyond getting people to exercise.
''It's a lot cheaper to go outside and move than it is to build gyms and a lot of hospitals,'' she said.
Doctor's Orders: Be Active
Accordingly, Dr. Miller and a growing number of like-minded doctors have begun writing specific prescriptions for outdoor activity, providing patients with maps, guidelines and programs of gradually increased activity based on their abilities. She said that such prescriptions are necessary because many people ''are unfamiliar with the outdoors -- they're scared to walk through a park, and they don't know what to do when they get there.''
Among possible sources of help: volunteer health guides in parks who can tell people where to go and what to do and park rangers who are trained to advise people who may have health issues. ''Our parks provide a huge opportunity,'' Dr. Miller said. ''Currently, fewer than 40 percent of visitors use them for any form of exercise.''
Some health insurers have come on board as well. SeeChange Health in California and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Foundation in North Carolina are supporting outdoor programs in their areas, like the Kids in Parks Initiative of the Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation. SeeChange Health this year announced a pilot project to reimburse members for visits to California state parks.
Other movers and shakers include the National Wildlife Federation, which established the ''Be Out There'' public-education campaign to foster a daily ''green hour'' during which every child could enjoy 60 minutes of unstructured play and interaction with the natural world. On its Web site, www.nwf.org, the federation has posted the rationale and specific suggestions for schools and families to counter the physical, emotional and educational drain of an ''indoor childhood.''
The campaign's mission ''is to return to the nation's children what they don't even know they've lost: their connection to the natural world,'' with activities suitable for all children, whether rural, suburban or urban.
As for its health and educational benefits, the federation cites scientific findings that outdoor play enhances fitness, raises blood levels of vitamin D (which in turn protects against bone loss, heart disease, diabetes and other health problems), improves distance vision, lowers the risk of nearsightedness, reduces symptoms of stress and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, raises scores on standardized tests and improves students' critical-thinking skills.
The National Environmental Education Foundation is now training pediatric health care providers to serve as nature champions in their communities.
One study of children living in poor urban environments found that those who relocated to greener (though not more affluent) home surroundings ''tended to have the highest levels of cognitive functioning following the move.'' The author of the study, Nancy M. Wells, also found in research among rural children that nearby nature can act as a buffer against stressful life events and improve children's psychological well-being.
Lest you remain unconvinced, I urge you to read the best-selling book ''The Last Child in the Woods,'' by Richard Louv, who coined the phrase ''nature-deficit disorder.'' Mr. Louv describes dozens of studies demonstrating the benefits that wilderness outings can have on mental and physical health.
'Park Prescriptions'
The National Park Service, too, has joined the ''park prescriptions'' campaign, offering free wellness services that are accessible to all, regardless of health status. (I was shocked to learn on a recent visit to Grand Canyon National Park that, despite many well-maintained trails, only 5 percent of visitors ever venture below the rim of the canyon; about half the people I encountered on the trails were from other countries.)
The park service helped Dr. Eleanor Kennedy, a cardiologist in Little Rock, Ark., create a downtown ''Medical Mile,'' a section of the Arkansas River Trail, and now hopes to support access to similar open spaces in communities nationwide. Dr. Kennedy reports that once she gets her patients outdoors ''they are more likely to be consistent about exercise.'' The Medical Mile project, which had an initial goal of $350,000, managed to raise $2.1 million in two years.
Dr. Robert Lambert, a cardiologist at the Heart Clinic of Arkansas, said: ''We see too many patients who need our assistance because of their lifestyle, not because of factors beyond their control. That is why my colleagues and I decided to become involved.''
Other programs include Prescription Trails, established in Santa Fe, N.M., with the help of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to counter runaway rates of diabetes in the community. Local physicians get trail guides to distribute to their patients. The Web site www.prescriptiontrailsnm.org is a guide to some of the state's best park and trail walking and wheelchair rolling paths.
This is the second of two columns on health-promoting physical activity.

HEADLINE: Lingering Anxiety Over European Debt Rules the Day

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS and DAVID JOLLY; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Shares on Wall Street regained some ground from losses earlier Monday, but still closed lower as anxiety over the European financial crisis overshadowed reports of robust retail sales over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
In addition, the euro fell and borrowing costs for indebted governments in Europe continued their climb, despite the approval on Sunday of a financial rescue package for Ireland.
The euro was at $1.3116 on Monday, from $1.3237 late Friday in New York. 
''The news over the last couple of days has been mixed,'' said Douglas S. Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research Institute. ''Every time we have good news, it offsets with bad news. We're alternating between euphoria and despair.''
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 39.51 points, or 0.36 percent, closing at 11,052.49. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.64 points, or 0.14 percent and closed at 1,187.76. The Dow was down 162 points in morning trading. The technology heavy Nasdaq ended off 9.34 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,525.22.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 12/32, to 98 10/32, pushing the yield down to 2.82 percent, from 2.87 percent late Friday.
Traders on Wall Street are taking in a variety of economic indicators this week, including reports on housing prices, auto sales, consumer confidence and assessments of manufacturing and services industries. On Friday, the Labor Department will release the closely watched report on the November jobs market.
On Sunday the National Retail Federation said that the average amount spent by each shopper from Thursday to Sunday was about $365, over 6 percent more than last year, according to a survey of about 4,300 Americans..
''The market is ignoring the good start to the Christmas season and focusing instead on what's going on overseas,'' said Philip J. Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors.
Brian A. Bethune, the chief United States financial economist at IHS Global Insight, said the economic downturn was still driving sentiment.
''We're still seeing aftershocks from that, particularly in Europe, where all of these peripheral countries -- Spain, Portugal, Ireland -- that were primary drivers were hit very hard with the recession,'' Mr. Bethune said.
''That situation is still a major problem and a risk for the overall network,'' he said.
Investors are hopeful that momentum on the domestic front, like strong retail sales, will offset the worrisome trend in the European markets later in December, said Jake Dollarhide, the chief executive of Longbow Asset Management.
Shares of retailers, however, were down sharply on Monday. TJX, the parent of T. J. Maxx and HomeGoods, Macy's and Best Buy each closed down more than 2.2 percent. Home Depot dropped 1 percent, and Target and Costco finished lower for the day.
Markets in Europe closed down more than 2 percent even though officials from the European Union and International Monetary Fund on Sunday agreed to backstop Ireland with 85 billion euros ($113 billion) in loans to help the government meet its financial obligations and clean up the battered banks.
''The more malign scenario seems to be playing out,'' said Peter Westaway, the chief European economist in London for Nomura.
''Now Ireland's out of the way, people seem to be saying, 'So let's move on to Portugal before we turn to Spain.' There's not necessarily any economic logic to it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Analysts Expect 6-Month Delay in Dreamliner Delivery

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
Market analysts on Monday projected a six-month delay in the first delivery of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and cut estimates of how quickly the company would increase production of the plane. 
The latest forecasts came in response to Boeing's announcement last week that it expected to come up with a new delivery schedule over the next few weeks for the much-delayed plane.
Boeing said it was working on design changes for power distribution panels after a recent fire forced a test plane to land in Texas. The fire, which lasted less than 30 seconds, was probably caused by debris left in a panel, the company said.
The company, based in Chicago, said it would update the software that managed power distribution so the planes would not have to switch to backup power if a similar incident occurred.
Boeing has been counting heavily on the Dreamliner, the first jetliner made primarily with lightweight carbon composites to slash fuel costs. It has attracted more advance orders -- nearly 850 -- than any plane in history. And as air travel rebounds from the recession, it should enable Boeing to overtake Airbus as the top jet maker.
But Boeing has had to rebuild crucial parts from foreign suppliers. And analysts said that the problems, along with the changes prompted by the fire, were likely to add to the delays in the plane's first delivery, which had been scheduled for February.
''The status of the 787 is still in limbo, but a six-month delay seems like a reasonable first stab at how far the schedule might slide,'' Joseph B. Nadol III, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a note to clients.
Robert Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, also expected a six-month delay.
Mr. Nadol reduced his estimate of the number of Dreamliners that Boeing would deliver in 2011 to 20, from 45. Mr. Stallard cut his to 10 planes, from 22.
Mr. Stallard said the delays could have a cascading effect over the next several years, making it difficult for Boeing to reach its planned production rate of 10 Dreamliners a month by the end of 2013.
Boeing executives have acknowledged that they outsourced too much of the design work, and production of the first 20 to 30 planes has been slowed by the need to rework many parts.
David E. Strauss, an analyst at UBS, wrote Monday that November was the seventh consecutive month in which deliveries of structural components to Boeing's 787 plant were below previous levels.
The delays prompted Mr. Nadol and Mr. Stallard to make modest cuts in their estimates of Boeing's earnings in 2011.
Given all the problems, Boeing has projected that the Dreamliner could produce profit margins in the low single digits for perhaps the first 1,000 planes it sells, Mr. Nadol wrote. He said the jet was still likely to be profitable over that period, though the added costs were eating into that buffer.
Other analysts said that if the Dreamliner lived up to its promise, Boeing could eventually sell several thousand planes.

HEADLINE: Sri Lankan Accountants Lure Global Outsourcers

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- Southern China has its assembly plants. India has customer support centers, research laboratories and low-cost lawyers.
And Sri Lanka's contribution to global outsourcing? Accountants -- thousands of them, standing ready to crunch the world's numbers.
As this tiny island nation staggers back from a bloody, decades-long civil war, one of its brightest business prospects was born from a surprising side effect of that conflict. Many Sri Lankans, for various reasons, studied accounting in such numbers during the war that this nation of about 20 million people now has an estimated 10,000 certified accountants.
An additional 30,000 students are currently enrolled in accounting programs, according to the Sri Lankan Institute of Chartered Accountants. While that ratio is lower than in developed economies like the United States, it is much greater than in Sri Lanka's neighboring outsourcing giant, India.
Offices in Sri Lanka are doing financial work for some of the world's biggest companies, including the international bank HSBC and the insurer Aviva. And it is not simply payroll and bookkeeping. The outsourced work includes derivatives pricing and risk management for money managers and hedge funds, stock research for investment banks and underwriting for insurance companies. 
Many developing countries have ''one particular competency that they do better than anyone else,'' said Duminda Ariyasinghe, an executive director at Sri Lanka's Board of Investment. ''Financial accounting is that door opener for us.''
With widespread use of English and a literacy rate of over 90 percent, along with rock-bottom wages, Sri Lanka hopes to transform its postwar economy from a sleepy tea and textiles island into a tiny, high-end outsourcing powerhouse.
Already there are thousands of other Sri Lankans working in more common outsourcing fields, like information technology and software development. About 50,000 people in Sri Lanka are now employed in one form of outsourcing or another, according to Slasscom, an outsourcing trade group, and that figure is growing by 20 percent a year.
But accounting is Sri Lanka's specialty.
During the war, Sri Lankan certified accountants would often use their skills as a springboard out of the country. That is why there are now Sri Lankans sprinkled among executive suites around the world, including the vice president of global business services at American Express and a financial controller at Standard Chartered Bank in the United Arab Emirates.
Now, though, the government and business community hope the country's young financial whizzes will have reason to stay home instead.
Sri Lanka's government, headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, expects revenue from so-called knowledge-based outsourcing -- which includes accounting -- to triple to $1 billion in revenue by 2015.
The stark wage differences between Sri Lanka and America, or even Sri Lanka and India, are a big part of the country's drawing card.
In the United States, the median annual wage for accountants and auditors in May 2008 was $59,430, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sri Lankan workers in the accounting profession receive an average annual pay package of $5,900, according to a 2010 survey by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
Wages in Sri Lanka for financial outsourcing are about one-third less than in neighboring India, and hiring educated employees is easier in Sri Lanka, according to executives who do business in both countries.
''Skilled talent is accessible,'' said Dushan Soza, managing director of the Sri Lanka office of WNS Global Services, an outsourcing company with about 350 people in the country. Because Sri Lanka's accountants are still a relatively untapped asset on the global market, Mr. Soza said, hiring is easy and turnover is minimal.
In the Indian city Mumbai, companies like his would have to go far out of the city to hire because of the level of competition, he said, but here in Colombo ''two miles from my office is my hiring range.''
Many international executives also quietly admit that Colombo's colonial architecture, excellent seafood restaurants and proximity to miles of sandy beaches make it a more alluring business travel destination than India's outsourcing centers.
Sri Lanka's accounting specialty is rooted in the country's history of colonialism and conflict.
State-financed universities here have traditionally not had enough places for qualified students, and they were often closed intermittently during the war. So students who could afford to attended private schools instead -- in many cases accounting schools with British origins that date to Sri Lanka's independence from Britain in 1948.
Over time, becoming a qualified accountant has become something well-educated, business-minded people in Sri Lanka do in addition to getting a degree in, say, physics or business management.
Now, though, many students choose accounting over another degree. When Nilushika Gunasekera, secured a coveted spot at a public university, she turned it down to go to a privately run accounting school. University students do not get any exposure to a real business environment, she said, and they have several years to ''take things easy.''
''I didn't think going to the university would add value,'' she said.
After accounting school, Ms. Gunasekera joined an outsourcing company doing work in cash management and banking. She now works for the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants in Colombo, a trade group.
If the rest of the world discovers Sri Lanka's pool of low-cost accountants, as the government hopes, the country could lose some of its competitive edge because wages will go up and there may not be enough workers to meet the demand.
But the government is offering various other incentives -- including tax breaks, subsidized telecommunications and streamlined procedures for setting up new businesses -- meant to encourage international companies to come here instead of India, Eastern Europe or the Philippines.
As foreign companies ramp up their presence here, local developers are building to accommodate them. In a neighborhood thick with tea warehouses and crossed by rail tracks, Jeevan Gnanam is turning the textile mills his grandfather built into a high-tech outsourcing center.
Orion City, as the development is called, is miles from Colombo's slick World Trade Center skyscrapers, near a canal fringed with rundown buildings and palm trees. But it has already drawn big-name clients, including a division of the publishing giant Pearson and MphasiS, a technology company partly owned by Hewlett-Packard, which has said it will hire 2,000 people here in the next three years.
''Sri Lanka offers us a rich talent base that will allow us to serve our global clients,'' said Dinesh Venugopal, chief corporate development officer for MphasiS.
Ultimately, Orion City will have three million square feet of office and retail space, including a 19-story building, said Mr. Gnanam, 28, who is the chief executive of the consortium that manages the development. It was difficult to convince his father and uncle that technology, not textiles, were Sri Lanka's future, he said, but they have come around recently. Building the industry and attracting foreign investment is crucial, he believes.
''Economic development has to take place,'' he said, ''for people to put the war in the past.''

HEADLINE: 'Queen of the Net' Trades Stock Picks for Tech Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
When Mary Meeker landed her first job as an analyst at Salomon Brothers in 1986, she didn't plan to stick around.
''I wanted to work as a sell-side analyst for two years and then go manage money,'' she said in an interview on Monday. ''The stock analyst phase just lasted a bit longer than I thought it would.''
She now has her wish. She is leaving Morgan Stanley to join the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers - famous for its early-stage investments in companies like Amazon.com, Google and Sun Microsystems - as a partner. 
From that perch, the woman once called Queen of the Net for her bullish stock calls during the Internet bubble, says she will focus on advising and finding Internet-related investment opportunities for her new employer.
''There is only one Mary Meeker,'' a Kleiner Perkins partner, Ted Schlein, said. ''Who else has been at the forefront of predicting and understanding most of the major technology trends we have seen over the past couple of decades? The business we are in is offering great service to entrepreneurs, and Mary will be able to do it spades as companies mature.''
Ms. Meeker is no stranger to Kleiner Perkins. In 1993, while at Morgan Stanley, she worked with Kleiner Perkins and one of its partners, John Doerr, on the initial public offering of Intuit.
Still, it is a big change for Ms. Meeker, who has worked at Morgan Stanley for 20 years and is one of the few Wall Street analysts who is known to a crowd much wider than the executives and investors in a particular industry.
In fact, as the last big name among technology analysts still working at a big bank, her departure represents the end of an era on Wall Street. It was an era for Wall Street stock research that never recovered after the Internet stock boom turned to bust in 2000, angering investors.
Before then, Ms. Meeker had grabbed headlines for her positive calls on highflying technology stocks for companies like America Online and HomeGrocer.com. But unlike analysts like Henry Blodget at Merrill Lynch, she was never accused of violating securities laws.
Looking back at the bursting of the bubble, she told a conference in 2004 that ''the enthusiasm was well placed; it just got ahead of itself in many respects.''
But Ms. Meeker played a bigger role at Morgan Stanley than covering the Internet market in the United States. She also helped the firm's coverage of China and its growing Internet market.
Ms. Meeker, who once had her phone set to ring to Earth, Wind and Fire's 1975 hit ''Shining Star,'' has long been a force inside Morgan Stanley, which has been a leading underwriter of technology stocks. She is even the godmother to the three children of Ruth Porat, the firm's chief financial officer.
Ms. Meeker, 51, is based in New York but has a home in Woodside, Calif. It is expected she will spend more time on the West Coast once she starts work at Kleiner Perkins, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif.
Kleiner Perkins plans to take advantage of Ms. Meeker's Internet expertise. Ms. Meeker says she is particularly interested in working with companies developing technology and services for social networking and mobile applications. This is hardly new territory, with heavyweights like Apple and Facebook controlling a significant amount of the market. Still, Ms. Meeker sees opportunity.
''I think it is still the first or second inning,'' Ms. Meeker said. ''It is not spring training but with mobile devices and increased connectivity, these businesses will be more transformative than the initial businesses built off the Internet in 1995.'' These companies include Amazon, eBay and Yahoo.
In 1995, Ms. Meeker helped publish the first Morgan Stanley ''State of the Internet'' report. It quickly became a tech investing bible.
Ms. Meeker and her team published another often-cited report in 2009, titled ''The Mobile Internet Report.''
Over the years, Kleiner Perkins tried unsuccessfully to woo Ms. Meeker to join the firm. Then, at Kleiner Perkins's chief executive meeting in September at the Links at Spanish Bay in Pebble Beach, Calif., where Ms. Meeker was a featured speaker, the firm's luck changed.
''We have danced together numerous times over the years, but none of them were right,'' Mr. Schlein said. ''But this time we are at a unique time around social networking, ecommerce and mobile devices, and it just clicked.''
Ms. Meeker said Mr. Doerr, Mr. Schlein and others approached her about becoming a partner, and this time it made sense.
''We are in a unique moment where the degree of innovation is especially high,'' she said.
Mr. Schlein added that Kleiner Perkins was ''giddy'' over the growth opportunities in mobile devices and social networking.
Ms. Meeker said she felt Morgan Stanley's tech team had a solid bench, allowing it to run well without her.
After Ms. Meeker's departure, Scott Devitt will cover the United States Internet sector. Mr. Devitt has worked with Ms. Meeker since joining Morgan Stanley in 2009 from Stifel Nicolaus.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fell Off My Bike, and Vowed Never to Get Back On

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
I crashed on my bike on Oct. 3 and broke my collarbone, an experience so horrific that my first impulse was to say I would never ride on the road again.
Turns out I am not alone.
''Well, you've joined the proud majority of serious cyclists who've busted a collarbone,'' said Rob Coppolillo, a competitive cyclist in Boulder, Colo., who also leads rock- and ice-climbing expeditions and is a part-time ski guide.
I've since heard from other cyclists who broke bones or were badly bruised and shaken up in crashes. Many say they, too, vowed, at least initially, never to ride outside again. It's not a universal response, but it is so common that cyclists nod their heads when they hear my reaction to my injury. 
Yet almost no one swears off running after an injury, even though -- and I speak from experience -- a running injury can keep you away from your sport at least as long. And that made me wonder: is a cycling injury qualitatively different from a running injury? Is it the drama of a crash, or is it that a crash makes you realize you could actually be killed on a bike? Is it the type of injury? Or the fact that you can feel, as I did, that the accident was unfair and out of your control?
Risk-assessment experts say that it is all of the above, and that the way we respond to various sports injuries reveals a lot about how we assess risks.
My crash came 8.9 miles into a 100-mile ride (of course I knew the distance, because of course I was watching my bicycle computer). My friend Jen Davis was taking a turn leading; my husband, Bill, was drafting -- riding close behind her. I was drafting Bill when a slower rider meandered into his path. Bill swerved and I hit his wheel. Down I went.
The first thing I did when I hit the ground was turn off my stopwatch -- I did not want accident time to count toward our riding time. Then I sat on a curb, dazed. My head had hit the road, but my helmet saved me. My left thigh was so bruised it was hard to walk. Worst of all was a searing pain in my left shoulder. I could hardly move my arm. But since it hurt whether I rode or not, I decided, like an idiot, to finish the ride.
The next day I went to a doctor and learned, to my shock, that my collarbone was broken. Running is my sport, I thought, and no ride is worth this.
I remembered what Michael Berry, an exercise physiologist at Wake Forest University, once told me. With cycling, he said, it's not if you crash, it's when. He should know. He's a competitive cyclist whose first serious injury -- a broken hip -- happened when he crashed taking a sharp turn riding down a mountain road.
Then, last June, he was warming up for a race when he hit a squirrel, crashed into a telephone pole and broke his arm so badly he needed surgery.
His reaction to each crash was a variant of mine. He'd taken up cycling about five years ago because he'd injured his hamstring running. ''With each wreck I thought, 'Maybe I should try running again,' '' he said.
My running friend Claire Brown, a triathlete, crashed a few years ago when she was riding fast on wet roads, getting in one last training ride before a race. Her bike slid on a metal plate in a bridge and she went down, hitting her head and her left hip. She was badly bruised, and even though she broke no bones, she did not feel comfortable riding for the next two years. Even now, she told me, ''there are bridges around here I won't ride on, and I definitely won't go downhill fast.''
And yet, and yet. Despite how much it hurt, my collarbone fracture was nowhere near as bad as some running injuries. When I got a stress fracture -- a hairline break -- in a small bone in my foot, I was on crutches for eight weeks. When I finally could run again, my foot hurt because the muscles had atrophied. Running was slow and difficult. I'd lost the rhythm and the stride that make running fun.
With the collarbone fracture, I wore a sling for three weeks but could take it off and ride my bike on my trainer -- a device that turns a road bike into a stationary one -- and use an elliptical cross-trainer. After four weeks I could run, and running felt good.
George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, says there are several factors that separate running injuries from cycling ones.
Running injuries are often hidden -- like a torn hamstring -- and tend to heal gradually on their own. Bicycling injuries, he told me, ''tend to be more acute and dramatic -- often there is blood or even bones sticking out,'' and ''if it's a gory image, it tends to deter us.''
Then there's the issue of control. ''Control makes a big difference in whether we take risks,'' Dr. Loewenstein said. ''With biking, you feel in control until you have an accident. Then all of a sudden you realize you are not in control. That can have a dramatic effect -- you can shift abruptly from excessive daring to exaggerated caution.''
With running, even though I realize that I and others who got injured could not have prevented our injuries, somehow I blamed myself. It was ''overuse,'' even though overuse is apparent only in retrospect, as you cast about for a reason why you got injured.
But running is considered to carry less risk than cycling. And, notes Barry Glassner, president of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore., and an expert on fear and risk perception, ''anything that is widely perceived as lower risk, we blame ourselves when something goes wrong.''
''It's known as the world hypothesis,'' he said, ''this notion that the world should be fair.''
Dr. Glassner said ''we get especially outraged'' when the world is not fair, as with a cycling crash. Or, he noted, ''we blame ourselves'' for the injustice of it all, as with a running injury.
The hypothesis does let some people continue a risky sport -- by deciding that a serious accident was not really random.
''You see it with rock climbers,'' says Rob Coppolillo. ''There will be a fatality or someone will really get hurt. There are those psychological backflips you can make yourself do. 'It won't happen to me.' ''
And if you have an accident and you can blame yourself for it, then you can also convince yourself that it won't happen again.
That's how Dr. Loewenstein reasoned when he crashed his bike last winter after riding over a patch of ice. He ended up with a shoulder injury. He decided the whole thing was his fault and could have been avoided.
''I did not experience a loss of control,'' he said. ''I just thought I had been stupid. Whereas if a car had hit me, it would have been different.''
If that had happened, he said, he might have vowed never to ride again.

HEADLINE: G.M. Sells Parts Maker To a Chinese Company

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors said on Monday that it had completed a deal to sell a subsidiary that makes power-steering components to an affiliate of the Beijing municipal government.
The sale of the unit, Nexteer Automotive, to Pacific Century Motors represents China's biggest single investment in the global auto parts-making industry, the companies said. It also will turn Beijing into the largest private employer in Saginaw, Mich., where Nexteer's headquarters and centers for research and engineering have nearly 3,000 workers.
Terms of the transaction, which was announced in July and will take effect on Tuesday, were not disclosed, but estimates value it at about $450 million. 
''We believe Nexteer is capable of becoming the most powerful and influential supplier in the world,'' Zhao Guangyi, the chairman of Pacific Century, said on a conference call with reporters.
At a ceremony to mark Nexteer's handover, chairs were lined with Chinese flags and guests were served egg rolls, The Saginaw News reported.
The sale ensures a stable future for Nexteer's employees and will help a company that had been ''troubled and unprofitable'' in recent years grow globally, Nexteer's chief executive, Robert J. Remenar, said. It also allows the Chinese automotive market -- which surged ahead of the United States last year to become the largest in the world -- access to valuable technology, including a power-steering system that can improve a vehicle's fuel economy by up to 4 percent.
''The true value of this, and why China's investing, is China's such a rapidly growing automotive market that China wants to make sure they're positioned to support that automotive market going forward with advanced technologies,'' Mr. Remenar said.
Pacific Century said it would honor a five-year labor contract that Nexteer's hourly employees in Saginaw, members of the United Automobile Workers union, ratified in June. Nexteer's management team will remain in place.
Mr. Remenar said Pacific Century was committed to keeping operations in Saginaw, which is 100 miles northwest of Detroit. Nexteer has invested $40 million in the city in the past year and has investments totaling $100 million planned in the next two years, he said.
''With that investment, we will be here for a while,'' Mr. Remenar said.
Nexteer, founded in 1906, operated for 90 years as the Saginaw Steering division of G.M. The automaker took ownership of Nexteer from the Delphi Corporation in 2009, when Delphi, a former parts division of G.M., emerged from a lengthy bankruptcy reorganization. G.M. had been seeking a buyer since then because Nexteer has several customers in addition to G.M., including Ford, Toyota, Chrysler, Fiat and automakers in India and China.
''This sale was an important move for us to strengthen a diverse, global customer base and build on our current growth trajectory,'' Mr. Remenar said in a statement. ''While we will continue to build in high-growth regions around the world, our owner's relationships will open new channels to the dynamic and rapidly growing Chinese automotive market.''
G.M. had warned that it might shut down Nexteer if it could not find a buyer, after the U.A.W. members in Saginaw rejected a contract to cut the division's labor costs. The union later approved a deal that cut wages but maintained family health insurance coverage and provided for a $2,500 performance bonus.
Michigan officials last year approved a tax credit worth $70 million over 10 years to keep Nexteer from moving jobs to Europe or China from Saginaw.

HEADLINE: Justices To Hear Microsoft Patent Case

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The United States Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear Microsoft's appeal of a record-setting $290 million jury verdict for infringing a patent held by a small Canadian software firm. 
The result of the Supreme Court's review of the three-year-old case, which is expected by the middle of next year, could alter the way patents are enforced in the United States by making it easier to challenge their validity.
The dispute, which started in 2007, was seemingly resolved in 2009 when a federal jury awarded $290 million to a Toronto company, i4i Inc., after finding that Microsoft had infringed the company's patent relating to text manipulation software in the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word, Microsoft's word processing application.
Microsoft subsequently appealed the verdict but was rebuffed by a federal appeals court that specializes in patent and trademark cases, making the jury award the largest patent infringement verdict ever affirmed on appeal. The Patent and Trademark Office upheld the validity of the i4i patent in April.
Microsoft continued to dispute those decisions, but did remove the contested features from its current software.
In its appeal, Microsoft argued that the appeals court had erred in holding that Microsoft's defense -- that the patent was invalid -- must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.
Microsoft said a lower standard should have been used, arguing that the issue was important to the effective functioning of the patent system, as it may lean too far in favor of those who establish questionable patents.
Google, Yahoo and trade groups like the Computer and Communications Industry Association and 36 law as well as business and economics professors all supported Microsoft's appeal.
I4i said Microsoft's arguments lacked merit and that Microsoft sought to bring about a significant change in patent law.
The Canadian company said Congress over the last 27 years confirmed the correctness of the appeals court's interpretation of the law. Any change should come from Congress, which is considering patent law changes, i4i said. The Congressional efforts could be disrupted if the court granted Microsoft's appeal, which would signal that it might change the standard.
Microsoft welcomed the Supreme Court's decision to hear the case. I4i said it was confident it would win the legal argument.
''There are vital issues in question, not just for i4i, but for the entire universe of inventors, technology pioneers and entrepreneurial companies,'' the chairman of i4i, Loudon Owen, said.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who owns Microsoft stock, recused himself.

HEADLINE: U.S. and South Korea Balk at Talks With North

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and SHARON LaFRANIERE; Helene Cooper reported from Washington, and Sharon LaFraniere from Seoul, South Korea. Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States, South Korea and Japan are all balking at China's request for emergency talks with North Korea over the crisis on the Korean Peninsula, as high-profile military exercises between South Korea and the United States in the Yellow Sea continued on Monday in a show of force.
Obama administration officials said that a return to the table with North Korea, as China sought this weekend, would be rewarding the North for provocative behavior over the past week, including its deadly artillery attack on a South Korean island and its disclosure of a uranium enrichment plant. Beijing called for emergency talks with North Korea, the United States, Japan, South Korea and Russia, participants in the six-party nuclear talks, which have been suspended indefinitely. 
''The United States and a host of others, I don't think, are not interested in stabilizing the region through a series of P.R. activities,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman.
He said that the talks ''without an understanding and agreement from the North Koreans to both end their behavior as they exhibited last week, but also to come to the table with a seriousness of purpose on the denuclearization issue -- without that seriousness of purpose, they're just a P.R. activity.''
Rejecting the emergency talks amounts to a pointed rebuke to China. The United States wanted China to signal clearly that North Korea's aggressive behavior would not be tolerated. Instead, Beijing remained neutral about who was responsible for the recent flare-up, and offered only to provide a venue for all sides to air their differences.
Yet turning down China's offer may also reveal the limited options available to the Obama administration and the South Korean leadership. Aside from a show of military solidarity, the two countries have based their response largely on hopes that China, as the North's main economic and diplomatic supporter, might punish the reclusive government for its series of provocations.
Mr. Gibbs and other administration officials said that the United States also wanted to see North Korea take steps to denuclearize, which most Asia analysts said might be a tall order for the North at a time when its government is undergoing a leadership crisis.
South Korea and Japan are also clearly skeptical of whether the consultations, as suggested by the Chinese, are worth a try. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea and Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan on Monday both denounced what they called North Korea's brutality.
President Lee pointedly said nothing about the Chinese proposal; analysts in Seoul described it as disappointingly familiar. A spokesman for the Japanese prime minister said that while Japan is cautiously reviewing China's offer, talks hinge on whether North Korea changes it behavior.
It remains unclear just what the United States would actually accept from North Korea to return to talks. One Obama administration official said that the United States wanted a clear sign that the North ''will stop provocative behavior.''
''We're trying to get out of this cycle where they act up and we talk,'' the official said. He spoke on grounds of anonymity under diplomatic rules.
Separately, South Korea's military appeared to step back from one confrontational stance, canceling live-fire artillery drills on the island in the Yellow Sea attacked by the North a week ago.
While the military exercises continued, the prospect of the South Korean live-fire drills -- scheduled for Tuesday but canceled within four hours of the announcement -- had been sharpening tensions on a peninsula on tenterhooks after the North's artillery attack last week on a garrison island that is also home to about 1,350 civilians, mainly fishermen. The attack killed two South Korean marines and two civilians, and wounded 18 people.
North Korea blamed the South for provoking the attack by firing at it from the island, Yeonpyeong, which lies in waters disputed by the two sides. The South, which returned fire, insisted it had been firing only test shots and that none were in territory it recognized as the North's.
The United States announced the date of the joint exercises as an immediate response. China -- which the United States, South Korea and other countries hoped would act to calm the North -- responded by warning the United States not to operate in waters it claims as a sovereign zone.
In Washington, the Pentagon cited security concerns and declined to say precisely where in the Yellow Sea the exercises were taking place. But a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity acknowledged that some of the exercises might be within 200 nautical miles of the Chinese coast. China defines that zone as within its exclusive sovereignty, but the United States and many other nations do not recognize its claim. ''We have a large operating area and some of it may be, and some of it may not be'' within 200 miles of China's eastern border, the official said.
South Korea naval authorities on Yeonpyeong warned residents by loudspeaker on Monday afternoon that they should move to bomb shelters by 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning because live-fire drills would take place at 10 a.m.
But Monday night, they announced that no firing would take place. A South Korean military official declined to explain the shift, saying only that the exercise ''will be conducted at an appropriate time.''
At the United Nations, the Obama administration called for tighter enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. The Security Council met on Monday to discuss the crisis, but did not emerge with any new plans for what to do next, further reflecting the mounting frustration in the international community over how to rein in North Korea.
Diplomats said that at the moment, the most they could do was to try to make sure countries enforce existing sanctions against North Korea, including an arms embargo and a travel ban against people linked to the country's nuclear weapons program.
Susan E. Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters that the United States looked ''to China to play a responsible leadership role in working to maintain peace and security in that region.''
White House officials said last week that Mr. Obama planned to call President Hu Jintao of China to discuss the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Gibbs said Monday afternoon that the call had not happened yet.
Online Correction: November 29, 2010, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the South Korean test firing was from a second island in disputed waters.

HEADLINE: How U.S. Can Help Iraq at the U.N.: An Envoy's View

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was heartened to read ''What We Must Do for Iraq Now,'' by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. (Op-Ed, Nov. 21), demonstrating this administration's commitment to develop relations with Iraq into a ''dynamic partnership'' with a ''pivotal'' ally. 
Mr. Biden highlighted ways the United States can help Iraq advance, including by ''bringing to a close its post-Gulf war obligations to the United Nations.'' This suggestion can be acted on immediately.
During its presidency of the Security Council in December, the United States can do three important things for Iraq:
First, move to extend the immunities of the Development Fund for Iraq set to expire on Dec. 31. Iraq has $39 billion of debt to negotiate with 14 countries, and hundreds of millions in commercial debt that could cripple the economy.
Second, the Oil for Food contracts should be closed and settled.
Finally, crucially, the sanctions imposed for the crimes of Saddam Hussein must be lifted. Although Iraq has fulfilled all requirements, it still suffers with limited imports and financial burdens.
Iraq, as Mr. Biden said, is a success story, despite continuing challenges. With the United States' support, Iraq will strengthen into a thriving democracy. Thus, I call on the United States to take the needed actions at the United Nations in December.

HEADLINE: In Special Session in Albany, Governor's Package of Spending Cuts Meets Resistance

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Lawmakers who gathered here for a special session appeared almost certain on Monday night to set aside a package of spending cuts proposed by Gov. David A. Paterson, leaving this year's state budget hundreds of millions of dollars out of balance as the governor-elect, Andrew M. Cuomo, prepares to take office on Jan. 1.
The package, including $55 million in reductions to Medicaid services and $260 million in across-the-board cuts in state aid to local governments, was intended to cover shortfalls in tax revenue during this fiscal year that have emerged since the budget was passed. But Senate Democrats clashed with Mr. Paterson, who announced the special session two weeks ago, over whether the governor had given lawmakers enough time to examine the plan and review the cuts. 
While Republicans, who hold 30 votes in the Senate, said they would be open to approving the cuts, the legislation did not come to the Senate floor on Monday. And there was little appetite in the Democratic-controlled Assembly to vote for cuts with no prospect that the Senate would follow suit and share the political pain.
''Special sessions are not for one-house bills,'' the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, told reporters on Monday.
The Senate adjourned without holding a vote on the legislation. The Assembly remained in session late Monday but appeared unlikely to take up the bill.
Failed negotiations would effectively pile another $315 million onto the already enormous deficit in next year's budget -- projected at more than $9 billion -- which Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature must grapple with over the next five months before passing the next budget, unless lawmakers return again before year's end. A Cuomo spokesman declined to comment on Monday.
Paterson administration officials said that they had negotiated with legislative leaders and staff members for the better part of two weeks, outlining the broad scope and nature of the cuts they were seeking.
''The Legislature was provided drafts of each bill last week, the governor met face-to-face with legislative leaders today and both the Senate and the Assembly accepted the final drafts of the bills prior to the start of session,'' said Jessica Bassett, a Paterson spokeswoman. ''It appears that, once again, the Legislature is making excuses to push this year's responsibility further into the future by adding to the deficit that will greet Governor-elect Cuomo when he arrives in Albany.''
But Senate officials said that the total size of the cuts had shifted significantly from day to day, with the language of the final bill and specific cuts -- like those proposed for different hospitals and nursing homes -- only emerging on Monday.
In a statement, Austin Shafran, a spokesman for Senate Democrats, said, ''The governor failed to submit legislation in time for thoughtful consideration and review.''
''Budget cuts to health care, education, and social and senior services require thorough deliberation, not a rushed process that hurts the state's most vulnerable citizens,'' Mr. Shafran added.
But privately, some Senate Democrats conceded that another factor might be at play: with Republicans likely to take control of the Senate next year after winning a handful of seats in the November elections, there was little reason for them to shoulder the burden of cuts. (Recounts are under way in at least three of the races.)
One Senate Democrat did not show up in Albany for the session: Pedro Espada Jr. of the Bronx, who cited a family emergency. Mr. Espada, who lost a Democratic primary in September, is under state and federal investigation in connection with a nonprofit health clinic he founded.
Speaking to reporters earlier on Monday after meeting with legislative leaders, Mr. Paterson, who did not seek election this year but has made cost-cutting a hallmark of his tenure as governor, remarked that he had called the special session ''as much to clear my conscience as anything else.'' He also suggested that he had wanted to give lawmakers a last chance on his watch to confront the budget gap.
''I just think that it is a sad commentary,'' Mr. Paterson said, adding, ''How much more foresighted would it have been if legislators from both parties put aside the politics, because once you get into recession or deep deficit, there is no politics? You have to cut it or your state becomes insolvent.''

HEADLINE: Fewer Millions For Jeter? Say It Ain't So!

 BODY:
Here's this well-known, well-paid public figure, a proven leader, someone who is hugely admired by the mayor, a person who can boast of impressive accomplishments but who is ready for new challenges. Yet none of that has stifled a loud chorus of critics who insist that this solid record of achievement does not herald future success.
We're talking about Derek Jeter. 
What? You thought we meant Cathleen P. Black?
Actually, the hullabaloo over Ms. Black's designation as the city's next schools chancellor might be useful for resolving an unpleasant contract dispute between the estimable Mr. Jeter and his longtime employer, the New York Yankees.
Because Ms. Black's main experience with public schools derives from her having on occasion walked past a couple of them, she has had a professional educator forced on her as a backstop. The Yankees could try a similar contrivance for Mr. Jeter, their shortstop.
He has just had the worst season of his splendid career. Maybe he simply had an off year. But it may be that, going on 37, he is in the early stages of an irreversible decline. Perhaps the team could designate someone to bail him out when he flags, the way that the education pro, Shael Polakow-Suransky, is supposed to make Ms. Black look good. In fact, the Yankees already have a possible shadow for Mr. Jeter in mind, a fellow named Eduardo Nunez.
(Conversely, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg could have turned to baseball in choosing a chancellor. The mayor says the schools need a superb manager at the top, not a career educator. In that case, he would have done well to go with William N. Showalter 3rd, a veteran baseball manager better known as Buck. Mr. Showalter is brilliant at making winners of mediocre teams. Plus, his father was a high school principal. Think of how he might have turned the New York system around.)
Normally, unhappiness between a ballplayer and his club would be left to the sports pages. But Mr. Jeter is held in such high regard, even by dyed-in-the-wool Yankees haters, that he transcends athletics. He has almost venerated status in this city. Who knows? Someday, he may even have a New York road named for him, in the tradition of Jackie Robinson, Joe DiMaggio and Gil Hodges. It is not beyond plausibility.
But if this contract fight gets much nastier, his may have to be a lesser road.
Even if the two sides come to terms, as most everyone expects, Mr. Jeter is in danger of ending up a diminished figure. That the Yankees management can be hateful is a given, even for those of us who have rooted for the team since we were yay high. But if online comments are an indication, many fans now see Mr. Jeter as no less grasping and unlovable than his bosses.
He was paid $189 million over the past 10 years, not including extra millions made from product endorsements. The Yankees are offering him $45 million over the next three years. He wants more, reportedly on the order of $22 million for each of the next five years. One way or another, he will remain an exceptionally wealthy man.
Tugs of war like this are hardly new. The great DiMaggio, as Hemingway wrote of him, had epic contract disputes of his own with the Yankees. But the difference in scale is enormous.
AT its high point, six decades ago, DiMaggio's salary came to $100,000. That was a lot of money in 1950, equivalent to about $900,000 today. DiMaggio earned about 30 times the median family income back then.
Mr. Jeter, however, earns roughly 300 times as much as today's median family income -- assuming that the family has any income at all. With unemployment stubbornly stuck at 9 percent-plus, many people are watching this battle of the millionaires with very cold noses pressed against the window.
Baseball is an important business in New York. It's not the biggest, by any means, but it is a source of incalculable civic pride. Most New Yorkers would probably want Mr. Jeter to feel that his level of compensation shows him the respect that he is due.
If he has to settle for less than he would like, some will no doubt see him as a victim. They may be some of the same people who regard Conan O'Brien as a victim, having walked away from NBC with a reported $45 million in severance pay for being a spectacular ratings flop as a talk-show host.
It's a strange class of victims that we're breeding.
