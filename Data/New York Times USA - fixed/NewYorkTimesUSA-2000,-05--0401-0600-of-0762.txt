HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE FOREIGN POLICY TEAMS;
Gore's National Security Advisers Assemble as Part of a Government-in-Waiting

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore has assembled a large team of foreign policy advisers whose members could form the national security nucleus of a Gore administration.
The current role of the advisory group is somewhat nebulous, however, since Mr. Gore has never relied on outsiders for advice on foreign policy, and the new panel has not yet contributed much of substance to his campaign. 
 The vice president has great faith in his own national security experience and instincts. He has a close, 20-year relationship with his national security alter ego, Leon Fuerth, through whom all foreign policy information flows. The vice president has participated in every major national security debate over the past decade and has access to intelligence and foreign policy expertise throughout the government.
But Mr. Gore believes he needs to hear fresh voices on foreign policy, several Gore aides say, and he has begun to assemble a group of advisers who can address foreign policy questions during the campaign and assist in the transition should Mr. Gore win in November.
The vice president's advisory group now includes 25 people, many of whom are veterans of the early years of the Clinton administration, and the list of experts is expected to swell to include as many as 100 names over the next several weeks.
The advisory board will someday provide material for speeches and position papers, but for now the group appears to exist chiefly as the foreign policy arm of a government-in-waiting.
The panel includes a number of respected academics, former ambassadors and former subcabinet officers, but its members are less well known than Gov. George W. Bush's team of foreign policy advisers, who call themselves the Vulcans after the Greek god of fire and the forge.
The Bush group includes Paul D. Wolfowitz, Richard L. Armitage, Richard Perle, Robert B. Zoellick and Stephen J. Hadley, all of whom served in senior national security posts in the Reagan and Bush administrations. Mr. Bush also consults with Richard B. Cheney, the former secretary of defense, and George P. Shultz, the former secretary of state. Condoleezza Rice, a former top Russia specialist at the National Security Council, coordinates the Bush foreign policy advisory team.
"Bush needs them," said Marc C. Ginsberg, a longtime friend of President Clinton who served as envoy to Morocco from 1994 to 1998 and who is now one of two coordinators of the Gore foreign policy group. "He needs the best possible A-list of foreign policy advisers to compensate for his lack of experience and knowledge. Al Gore doesn't suffer from the same deficiencies."
Mr. Gore's group includes former Senator James Sasser, who was ambassador to China from 1996 to 1999; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the former head of the National Economic Council; Joan E. Spero, former under secretary of state for economic affairs, and Ashton B. Carter and Graham T. Allison, Harvard professors who served at the Pentagon in President Clinton's first term. Mel Levine, a former Democratic congressman from Los Angeles, Robert E. Hunter, a former ambassador to NATO, and Richard N. Gardner, whose government experience dates to the Kennedy administration, are also on the list.
Their role remains indistinct and there is little evidence that Mr. Gore will turn to them for foreign policy guidance any time soon. Unlike the Bush group, they are not holding regular briefings for the vice president, who is as broadly knowledgeable about foreign policy as anyone in the Democratic Party. They have not been canvassed for policy advice or speech drafts. Nor are they authorized to speak to the press on behalf of the Gore campaign. The list of their names was produced only after repeated requests from a reporter.
Nonetheless, competition for spots on the list is fierce because the group is seen as the farm team for senior jobs in a Gore administration, should the vice president win in November. Serving on the ad hoc Gore committee is also a prestigious resume addition for the part-time advisers, many of whom also advise private clients at the same time they give foreign policy counsel to the Gore campaign.
Part of the work of Mr. Ginsberg and his co-director, Bruce W. Jentleson, director of the Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy at Duke University, is to screen potential members of the advisory group for conflicts of interest. They said that nobody who had pending business before the government or who was a registered lobbyist for a foreign country would be invited to join the group.
Since returning from Morocco in 1998, Mr. Ginsberg, a lawyer, has gone into business raising capital for small firms and advising companies on doing business in North Africa and the Middle East. He said he did not represent any foreign governments, nor does his name show up on the Justice Department's list of registered foreign agents.
Mr. Ginsberg said he had tried to help Gerber Products build a baby formula factory in Gaza with Israeli and Palestinian participation, but the project never got off the ground. This week Mr. Ginsberg was in Morocco to speak at a conference on electronic commerce sponsored by Havas MediMedia, the health care information division of a French advertising company.
The policy of keeping lobbyists off the advisory panel may be hard to enforce, since some of those on the list, including Mr. Levine, work at large law firms that do some lobbying.
Mr. Jentleson, who served in the State Department's office of policy planning early in the Clinton administration, said Mr. Gore was reaching beyond the Beltway for fresh ideas. He said Mr. Gore depended on Mr. Fuerth and Samuel R. Berger, the White House national security adviser, for day-to-day foreign policy guidance. Mr. Gore also consults regularly with Richard C. Holbrooke, the United Nations ambassador, whom many consider the leading candidate for secretary of state in a Gore administration.
Mr. Gore wants to hear a range of voices as he begins to formulate an approach to global affairs that may at times differ from that of Mr. Clinton, Mr. Jentleson said. But the members of the group are well within the mainstream of the Democratic Party, generally supporting global engagement, protection of the environment and free trade, he added.
The panel is being assembled with an eye toward quickly staffing a Gore administration, Mr. Jentleson said. "By asking them to join this group we're not making any promises, he said. "But if Gore wins the election, it's a lot better to start on Wednesday with a group of people you know than to start looking at a pile of resumes."
Foreign policy veterans and even some advisers to Mr. Gore suggest that the group is largely window-dressing at this point, assembled in part to make it look as though Mr. Gore is not dependent wholly on his own foreign policy ideas and those of Mr. Fuerth. Membership on the panel also gives foreign policy thinkers in the Democratic Party a stake in a victory by the vice president in November.
"Every campaign I've ever heard of does this," said a foreign policy expert who has advised several campaigns and who insisted that his name not be printed. "But I can say that I've never heard of a single instance of a paper from that system making its way to the candidate."
He said that Mr. Fuerth tightly controlled what reached Mr. Gore and that the two of them made all important decisions with little outside advice. Mr. Gore did not draw on the advisory group in preparing his most recent address on foreign policy, delivered on May 1 in Boston, aides said. The vice president wrote much of the speech himself, with assistance from Mr. Fuerth and other members of the White House national security staff, they said. In the speech, Mr. Gore called for an activist foreign policy of "forward engagement" and criticized Mr. Bush for hewing to what he called an obsolete cold-war mentality.
The advisory group structure serves one useful purpose: bypassing the limitations placed on political activity by government employees. Most full-time government workers cannot engage in political activity, although certain senior advisers like Mr. Fuerth are exempt from the rule.
"I cannot use members of the vice president's national security staff or others on the federal payroll to provide political advice for the campaign," Mr. Fuerth said. "I need an external skeleton of people to provide advice for me so I can provide advice for the vice president."
Mr. Fuerth said the outside advisers would become more active as the campaign progressed, serving as surrogate speakers, drafting speeches and responding to press questions on national security matters. But they will never serve as the foreign policy "brain" of the Gore operation. That job is already taken, Mr. Fuerth said.
"Everyone needs bright minds," Mr. Fuerth said, "but I could drop dead tomorrow and the vice president could keep going for quite some time based simply on what he personally knows and understands."

HEADLINE: FED LIFTS KEY RATE BY 1/2 POINT, TO 6.5%; MORE RISES HINTED

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve adopted a more aggressive stance today in its fight against inflation, voting to push short-term interest rates up by half a percentage point to try to slow the headlong pace of economic growth.
Concerned that the economy continues to exceed what the Fed considers to be its speed limit, the central bank put aside its recent preference for small adjustments to monetary policy in favor of an attention-grabbing increase of half a percentage point. The move was intended to make clear that it will do what it takes to bring growth under control. 
 Dashing the hopes of investors that this move -- which follows a series of five quarter-point rate increases over the last 11 months -- might be the last for a while, the Fed also signaled that there may well be more to come.
"Today's move is clearly an escalation of the Fed's anti-inflation campaign," said David Orr, chief economist at First Union.
The Fed's action immediately led some banks to raise their prime lending rates for loans to small business customers to 9.5 percent from 9 percent. It is also likely to lead to higher rates on auto and home equity loans and credit cards. The effect on mortgages is more difficult to predict. Page C1.
It was the first time the central bank raised rates by at least half a percentage point in more than five years, and it lifted the Fed's benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks to 6.5 percent, its highest level since January 1991.
The central bank also raised its seldom-used discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system by half a point, to 6 percent.
By raising the official rates it controls, the Fed tries to put upward pressure on the rates paid by companies and by consumers, and in that way to put a damper on economic activity.
For all the Fed's concern about inflation over the last year, there is little evidence of any sustained surge in prices or wages, and the move drew criticism from some business groups and political leaders as unnecessary.
Just hours before the Fed's vote today, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices in April were stable. The consumer price index was unchanged for the month after sharp increases in February and March. And the "core" index -- excluding volatile food and energy prices -- rose just 0.2 percent.
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota, said the Fed's interest rate increases amounted to an unjustified tax increase on American families. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said gains in worker productivity, or output per hour, were more than offsetting inflation pressures, and he called the Fed's action "unnecessary shock treatment."
But the Fed, which has always said it is easier to prevent inflation than to eradicate it after it has infected the economy, justified its action as a necessary vaccination.
In a statement, the Fed's policy- setting Open Market Committee stressed that demand for goods and services from the vibrant business expansion outstripped the available supply, an equation that every basic economic textbook says will eventually lead to rising prices. Not even the gains from productivity can be counted on to keep inflation in check if the economy continues to run red hot, the statement said.
"The committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue," the statement said, "which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance."
In a signal to investors not to assume that this cycle of rate increases is over, the committee added that "the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."
The Fed's decision to raise rates by half a point had been widely anticipated by investors. Stock prices, which had been up before the Fed's announcement at 2:15 p.m., fell back after right afterward but then rebounded. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,934.57, up 126.79. The Nasdaq composite index rose 109.92 to close at 3,717.57. Bond prices also rose, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 6.42 percent from 6.45 percent.
There is considerable debate among economists about how fast the economy can grow without igniting inflation. But even though Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has been willing to give the economy far more running room than he probably would have just a few years ago, he has consistently said that the "new economy" -- in which technology and Internet stocks have made their impact felt -- is still subject to the basic laws of supply and demand.
Mr. Greenspan has focused in particular on the shrinking pool of workers available to employers, noting that eventually wage increases will accelerate to inflationary levels. The unemployment rate -- 3.9 percent in April -- is the lowest in more than 30 years.
Mr. Greenspan has also said that the economy has been able to meet the robust demand from consumers in part by importing more goods from abroad, a trend that the United States cannot afford to sustain forever. To the degree that additional demand cannot be met from abroad, it could lead to a surge in prices.
After months in which he singled out the stock market as the source of much of the excess demand in the economy, Mr. Greenspan has publicly shifted his emphasis in recent months to slowing the economy and halting the decline in unemployment.
But despite the five previous rate increases starting last June, the economy grew 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and 5.4 percent in the first quarter of this year. That was well above the roughly 4 percent that many economists now think is sustainable without generating higher inflation.
There are some signs that the earlier rate increases are having an effect. Consumer spending, the primary engine of demand in this business cycle, cooled off somewhat in April, with retail sales falling 0.2 percent. But other indicators, like the pace of housing starts and auto sales, suggest that the economy remains in overdrive.
Whether the Fed raises rates again at its next meeting in late June -- and by how much -- largely depends on what the economic data reveals over the next five weeks. Many economists now assume that the Fed will raise rates by at least another quarter point in June.
"They certainly leave the way open to further tightening, and almost certainly further tightening will occur," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "The question is how much."
The Fed's goal is not to stop the economy in its tracks, but to achieve a "soft landing," in which inflation pressures recede but the expansion continues at a more moderate pace, avoiding a recession.
The last time the Fed tried to engineer a soft landing, in 1994 and early 1995, it succeeded, but only after doubling its target rate to 6 percent from 3 percent in seven steps. In that cycle it raised rates by half a point three times and by three-quarters of a point once.
Based on his record in keeping the expansion going, Mr. Greenspan has enjoyed widespread bipartisan support even as he has raised interest rates. Both Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have expressed confidence in him, and so far the Fed has not been an issue in the presidential campaign.
The Fed has rarely been shy about tinkering with interest rates during presidential campaigns, but it has always avoided doing so in the month or so before the election. Some analysts suggested that today's action was intended to get as much monetary tightening as possible out of the way before the campaign gets into full gear.
"If the Fed's job is done by June 28, and we believe that it will be, there won't be a need to act closer to the election," said Richard Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research. "In that case, the Fed will have stayed ahead of the curve and taken the Federal Reserve and the tightening cycle out of the political process."

HEADLINE: Snapping Up Chinese Goods Despite Qualms on Trade Bill

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BROOKLYN PARK, Minn., May 14

 BODY:
The American flag flies over Wal-Mart in this Minneapolis suburb. The parking lot is packed with Ford S.U.V.'s and Chevy pickups. Even the stucco facade is a patriotic melange of red, white and blue.
Yet the appeal of America's most successful retail chain, with its "We Sell for Less" slogan emblazoned over the front door, stems in part from the enormous low-cost production capacity of a faraway nation that many people in this country view as a moral outcast and potential military rival: China. 
 From $16.95 Looney Tunes Tweeties to $5.94 Rawlings N.C.A.A. Final Four basketballs, Wal-Marts are two-square-acre valentines to the idea that America should trade with China -- or, as President Clinton put it when visiting a nearby farm last week, "reaching out a hand, not shaking a clenched fist."
But even as they fill their carts, shoppers have their doubts.
Dawn Hentges, a housewife, was browsing specials in the shoe section, where "China" is inscribed on seemingly every tongue or sole.
Ms. Hentges ruminated about a friend who had recently adopted a Chinese baby girl. The girl, she said, had to be treated for eczema and lice she acquired in a government-run orphanage. "They just throw their little girls out like the trash," she said. "That place really scares me."
She said she would prefer not to buy Chinese goods, but suggested that it was not easy to keep the faith when "every other thing" she looked at was made there.
Mike Hanaho helped his daughter lace up new made-in-China Nike sneakers as he discussed China's growing military might. A Navy veteran who was stationed in the Pacific in the late 1980's, Mr. Hanaho said China's Asian neighbors worried about its regional ambitions. "Taiwan sure sees them as the evil empire," he said.
Congress is to vote next week on whether to upgrade economic ties with Beijing, a step that would allow American companies to take full advantage of concessions China made to enter the World Trade Organization. The cliffhanger in the House, where supporters and opponents are locked in a battle to control the future of United States-China relations, echoes in the Midwest as dissonance. People play with Chinese-made toys, fish with Chinese-made rods and ride Chinese-made bicycles, all decent products at low prices, the staples of Wal-Mart. But they also worry about China's human rights abuses and its military buildup.
Most of the shoppers said they were aware that many consumer products come from China. Some say America's appetite for goods from China encourages capitalism and promotes change there.
Others say they worry that the tens of billions of dollars Americans spend on Chinese goods each year only entrenches the Beijing leadership, though they rarely use their wallets to support their convictions.
Shopping for spray paint, Fred Holloway said he did not see what the fuss was about. Mr. Holloway, a software engineer for Medtronic, a Minneapolis-based maker of medical products, argues that trade and politics don't mix. "We sell them some of our pacemakers," he said, referring to a Medtronic product. "So why shouldn't I buy their stuff? I mean, that's normal."
Mr. Holloway compared the China trade debate to the ongoing feud about whether Elian Gonzalez should go back to Cuba to live with his father. "That should be about family, and China should be about trade," he said. "I don't agree with those people who want to mix it up with whether they're Communists."
Still, when asked how he would vote on the issue before lawmakers -- whether to continue to review China's trade status each year or, as President Clinton has asked, grant so-called permanent normal trade relations -- he stepped back, scratched his beard and hedged. "We probably still need the power to review it every so often," he said. "Say if they attack Taiwan, then it can't just be business as usual."
If there is a big group of Americans who refuse to buy Chinese-made goods for political reasons, they probably are not Wal-Mart shoppers. Though the store drapes itself in Americana and uses bright shelf tags to advertise "Made in the U.S.A." products, the chain is an importing goliath.
From car stereos to steel-toed work boots, Wal-Mart is the single largest United States importer. About half of its imports come from China, according to a study of Customs Department documents conducted by the Citizens Trade Campaign, which is critical of the company. Wal-Mart declined to comment on what percentage of its merchandise was made in China.
Overall, the United States bought $82 billion worth of China-made goods last year, $69 billion more than the value of what it sold to China. The trade deficit, America's second largest, was slightly smaller than the one with Japan.
Japan in the 1980's inspired fears that its high-quality, high-tech products would put Americans out of business. The anti-China lobby complains more about an affront to American values. Some crusaders have targeted Wal-Mart itself, accusing the company of exploiting Chinese workers in sweatshops.
For unions and some lawmakers, Chinese labor and human rights practices are a central issue in the trade debate.
Wal-Mart says it neither operates nor does business with sweatshops. The company says it frequently inspects conditions at all of its own factories and those of many of its suppliers to ensure that they maintain Western standards.
Americans implicitly vote on the issue every day.
Joyce Smith, a worker in a Minneapolis factory that makes Harley Davidson motorcycle parts, said she wondered how Chinese laborers bear the strain of working 14-hour days for 3 cents an hour, if a recent television expose she saw is true.
"It's just really sad about those women," she said of the Chinese workers. She dangled a pair of girls' slippers and searched for the price tag. "These cost $7.95, but you can bet that those workers don't see more than a penny or two."
Asked if that meant she would shun such products, she raised her eyebrows and pushed her cart ahead.
China is an enigma. It is Communist and occasionally bellicose, but less powerful or menacing than the former Soviet Union. Its economy has grown quickly and it has become one of the world's largest exporters, but its industries have yet to challenge the United States directly the way Japan and Germany did in the 80's.
All that leaves some people preferring the middle course -- neither confrontation nor acquiescence.
"We should be in there picking their brains," said Don Gavic, a World War II veteran with a wizened face, well tanned from his days teaching golf in Minneapolis. He is not one to dismiss what he calls the "Asia threat." But he argues that China's opponents have it all wrong. He said he believes in engagement.
"If you want to know what they are thinking, you can't cut them off," he said, pausing to put a $10.88 Ozark Trail packable armchair, made in China, into his cart.
Like many others in Minnesota, Mr. Gavic has more than a passing interest in the question. His son-in-law has a 600-acre family soybean farm near here. Farmers have been among the strongest supporters of granting China permanent normal trade relations, because they see doing so as giving them more access to that country's huge but tightly regulated grain market.
"We sold wheat to the Soviets, didn't we?" Mr. Gavic said. "My son-in-law has bank loans riding on this."
Though Mr. Clinton said on Friday during his visit to this area that the China vote in Congress was vital to protecting America's economic and national security interests, "permanent normal trade relations" do not rattle people the way Sputnik and "mutually assured destruction" once did, at least not Minnesota residents on the first day of walleye fishing season.
Deborah Hackett, a white-haired sock shopper of 60, brushed off a question about United States relations with China with a one-sentence answer. The more money Americans spend on Chinese imports, the better to promote capitalism, she said.
Asked how she would choose among Wal-Mart's socks -- some made in the United States, others in Costa Rica and many others, of course, in China -- she said, "I want the ones that match my pants."

Lycos Agrees to Be Bought By Spanish Telephone Giant
Lycos, the big Internet portal, agreed to be bought by Terra Networks, the Internet unit of the Spanish telephone giant Telefonica, for $12.5 billion in stock.
The companies said the combination, which also includes a partnership with the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, would create the first truly global Internet company with operations in 37 countries. Page C4.

HEADLINE: Dominicans Stay Tuned To Voting At Home

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO 

 BODY:
In cafes, on street corners and in front of newsstands, many people in Washington Heights have been heatedly talking for weeks about the tactics of the presidential campaign and the merits of the candidates. But in their rapid-fire Spanish, they aren't speaking of Al Gore or George W. Bush. Instead, they intone the names Balaguer, Mejia and Medina, the three men seeking the presidency of the Dominican Republic.
And yesterday in the Heights, heart of the nation's largest enclave of immigrants from the Caribbean, the fervor for presidential politics reached a fever pitch as their relatives on the island went to the polls to choose a president. 
 That those who stayed in New York could not vote did not seem to matter: they passionately argued politics on street corners, tuned in to Spanish-language broadcasts and phoned relatives on the island.
"The Dominican, every Dominican immigrant, keeps feeling for his country," said Bienvenido Ovalles, 60, turning for a moment away from a heated political discussion on St. Nicholas Avenue. "The Dominican is very much involved in the election, even though he is absent. He may not be there, but his heart is always in his homeland."
Political parties on the island have long known that to get an edge in the fractious world of Dominican politics, it is smart to seek votes and money in New York's Dominican population, which, at around 600,000, is second in size only to the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo.
That has meant raffles and $500-a-plate fund-raisers in Manhattan hotels and Jimmy's Bronx Cafe. It has meant stump speeches, caravans of cars and rallies where Dominican immigrants have been urged to return home to vote, or even tell their relatives back home whom to vote for. It has meant that Tati Ayala, who works at EZ Vision Tours and Travel, has sold at least 150 airline tickets to Dominicans who, she said, flew home simply to vote.
"This is like a small slice of the Dominican Republic, like a city in the Republic," said Mario Caraballo, a local organizer for the Social Christian Reformist Party, whose leader is the former president, Joaquin Balaguer, 93. "The parties have organized here because the people here are an economic power."
Dr. Silvio Torres-Saillant, director of the Dominican Studies Institute at City College, said Dominican political parties have become highly adept at stirring nationalist sentiment among the rapidly growing Dominican population.
"The political parties have done an excellent job of keeping Dominicans from breaking their political umbilical cord, by turning New York City and all Dominican neighborhoods throughout the United States into arenas for island politics," said Dr. Torres-Saillant. "So they come, they establish chapters, they do fund-raising here. They promise positions to Dominicans here."
Indeed, Mr. Caraballo said, his party pushed hard for months to garner support in New York. The party's local branch conducted polls in New York to gauge support, raised $56,000 in two big-ticket fund-raisers and even helped pay for airfare so some Dominican supporters could go home to vote, he said. "Every party does this kind of thing," Mr. Caraballo explained. "No one sees anything wrong with it. They all do it."
Dominicans said yesterday that they felt compelled to have some say in politics in their country, whether through campaign contributions or by trying to sway their relatives back home. After all, they noted, Dominicans here maintain an important economic lifeline to the island, sending hundreds of millions of dollars to relatives.
In casual conversations, many said they supported Hipolito Mejia of the center-left Dominican Revolutionary Party, who was leading in the polls but was not expected to receive enough votes to avoid a June 30 runoff against Mr. Balaguer or Danilo Medina of the governing Dominican Liberation Party.
Not everyone sees the two-country political campaigns as a good thing. Fermin Luna, 63, producer of "Nueva York de Noche," a cable-access program about Dominican issues, said he has long worried that Dominican politicians have exploited immigrants in New York, promising patronage jobs or vast improvements in the standard of living on an island long mired in poverty.
"The Dominican lets himself be fooled by promises from politicians from there," said Mr. Luna, who came to the United States more than 30 years ago. "I think to myself, 'Why are we so involved in the Dominican politics when this is where our children are growing up?' "

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE STOCK MARKET PROPOSAL;
Social Security Debate Framed in Generalities

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has reignited the debate over the future of Social Security and whether it is a good idea to allow individuals to invest some of their payroll taxes in the stock market.
At the same time, Mr. Bush provided few specifics, saying they would be worked out in bipartisan negotiations. 
 So supporters and critics were left talking yesterday in the same generalities that have dominated the debate for years. And voters were still a long way from being able to figure out how they might be affected and whether a change would be beneficial.
Still, the announcement has signaled a change in the debate. Although Vice President Al Gore has attacked the idea as inherently risky, the concept of investing some money from payroll taxes in the stock market seemed to be more acceptable today than it was several years ago.
William Shipman, a principal at State Street Global Advisers who is co-chairman of the Cato Institute program on Social Security and a proponent of individual Social Security accounts, said, "I think that we are coming closer together; the idea that there should be some stock market investment was not in the cards six years ago."
Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who opposes the idea of individuals investing their payroll taxes in the stock market, agreed. "The idea of investing in the stock market is right," Mr. Aaron said. "It's a good idea to increase the return as much as possible."
But he wants the government to do the investing, not individuals, a position President Clinton once proposed. "The problem with the individual accounts is that they waste money on needless administrative costs," he said.
As Mr. Aaron's comment indicated, debate over who does the investing, and how, will continue. And that is where the lack of specifics undermines any analysis.
Mr. Shipman, for example, would not comment on how Mr. Bush's proposal dealt with the cost of administering the Social Security accounts of private investors because it did not provide enough detail.
But the issue is important: will the costs of running the private accounts by Wall Street firms or mutual fund companies be so high that they will significantly reduce the returns that the individual would get from those accounts?
"It is not a necessary condition that administrative costs eat up returns," Mr. Shipman said. "It depends on how you design the system."
He said he has designed a system with very low costs, ranging from two-tenths of 1 percent to three-tenths of 1 percent of the assets in the account.
John Mueller, a principal at Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc., a financial market forecasting company in Chevy Chase, Md., argued that the cost would be much higher.
Mr. Mueller, a onetime supporter of privatizing the entire Social Security System, noted that the administrative costs for stock mutual funds in 1998, according to the Investment Company Institute, were 1.35 percent of the assets in the funds.
He and others argued that both the administrative costs and the transition costs for shifting to a system with private accounts would consume much of the additional return for many investors. Mr. Mueller's studies contend that investors would be better off under the existing system than the numerous versions that have been proposed.
He also faulted Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush for not developing proposals that he said would actually deal with the solvency of Social Security. The system will start paying out more in benefits than it is collecting in payroll taxes in 2015.
"Neither Gore nor Bush have a plan for balancing the system," Mr. Mueller said.
Mr. Shipman dismissed the issue of the transition costs. He argued that if nothing is done to finance Social Security properly, "there is a transition cost and that is, reasonably, the unfunded liability of the system -- $3 trillion to $8 trillion."
So, he said, the cost of a transition to a new system -- which some suggest would top $1 trillion -- must be compared to the cost of doing nothing about the current system.
Among other issues that have not been addressed was how investors who build private Social Security accounts would be treated when they retire. Will they get both the return from their individual account and the benefits that accrued from the rest of their payroll deductions?
Mr. Aaron said that a proposal for individual Social Security accounts that had been studied by the House Ways and Means Committee would allow retirees to keep what gave them the largest return -- the benefits based on payroll deductions or the benefits based on individual accounts.
He said that an analysis of this proposal showed that only 5 percent of the money from the individual accounts actually went to beneficiaries. The rest went back into the Social Security system and would be used, he said, to help pay off the transition costs.
And what benefits would a retiree get -- and how would the Social Security system cover them -- if the retiree was allowed, as Mr. Bush proposed, to pass on the assets in the individual accounts to his or her heirs?
Mr. Bush will also face another nagging question: why does he put so much faith in the stock market if his chief economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, is so bearish?
Almost two years ago, Mr. Lindsey said that he had sold all of his equity holdings because stock prices were overvalued. At the time, the Dow Jones industrial average was around 8,500. Despite this year's almost 5 percent sell-off, the Dow closed yesterday at 10934.57.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. to Issue Tougher Rules On Diesel Fuel

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency plans on Wednesday to announce new pollution-control rules that would cut truck and bus emissions drastically, in part through a 97 percent reduction in the sulfur content of diesel fuel over the next 10 years.
The rules, the biggest change in regulation of trucks and buses in the agency's 30-year history, are intended to cut smog and remove from the air chemicals that have been linked to a variety of health problems, like cancer and asthma, E.P.A. officials said. 
 The oil industry strongly opposes the new rules, which it insists will sharply raise the price of diesel fuel and could result in shortages, in part because refiners would be hard-pressed to install the new equipment needed to meet the requirements.
The industry has said it is willing to accept sharp, but less severe, cuts in sulfur content.
The draft rules, which may be modified during the course of public hearings this year, have been in preparation for several years.
They are being announced now to give the Clinton administration time to hold the hearings and follow other procedures for public comment required by law before the rules can be made final. Under the Clean Air Act, the administration has the power to impose new rules without Congressional approval.
The changes would be phased in over 10 years. The new limits on emissions from diesel trucks would apply only to new models, but the cuts in sulfur content in diesel fuel would reduce emissions from existing trucks and buses.
The proposed rules call for a 95 percent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions, which should cut smog appreciably, and a 90 percent reduction in particulate emissions, or soot.
Sulfur particles are part of soot, so cutting the fuel's sulfur content would help reduce soot levels in the air.
Getting rid of the sulfur allows engineers to install pollution reduction equipment on the trucks and buses, just as a generation ago, removing the lead from gasoline allowed the introduction of catalytic converters on cars that have been so successful in controlling their pollution. Very few trucks and buses now carry such devices.
Environmentalists were ecstatic about the E.P.A.'s plans.
"It will be the end of the big smoking dirty obnoxious truck as we know it today," said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental group.
S. William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators -- a national association of state regulators -- called trucks and buses "one of the last remaining unregulated sources of air pollution."
"It will result in huge air quality benefits to the states," Mr. Becker said of the set of proposed rules. "It will prevent tens of thousands of cancers. It will provide benefits to every locality in the country."
The oil industry warned that the planned 97 percent cut in allowable levels of sulfur in diesel -- to 15 parts per million, from the current level of 500 parts per million -- would raise fuel prices by 10 cents a gallon or more, and cause supply shortages. The petroleum industry is calling for a 90 percent cut, or 50 parts per million, as more economically practical.
The cut proposed by the E.P.A., the American Petroleum Institute said, would make it difficult if not impossible for the industry to produce enough diesel. "We don't think we can consistently produce and supply it," said Edward H. Murphy of the institute, the industry's biggest trade association.
Mr. Murphy said that some refineries have equipment on hand that could meet a ceiling of 50 parts per million, but that tougher rules would require the installation of expensive new production equipment.
Mr. Murphy added that refiners say they are now struggling to meet new stringent limits on sulfur in gasoline and cannot handle new requirements of diesel as well.
Administration officials said that the E.P.A. planned to hold five public hearings around the country in the next few weeks and then open a 45-day public comment period, allowing the agency to put the rule into final form this year, before President Clinton leaves office.
The fuel rules would take effect in June 2006. The emissions cuts on the amount of nitrogen oxide produced by new trucks and buses would be phased in; a quarter of new vehicles would have to meet them in 2007, half by 2008, three-quarters by 2009 and all by 2010. The new rules on particulate emissions would take effect in 2007.
When they introduce the proposal, administration officials plan to argue that diesel exhaust may cause lung cancer, and clearly brings on asthma attacks and other respiratory problems.
The E.P.A. plans hearings in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver and Los Angeles, followed by the comment period for the public -- and affected industries -- to submit statements.
The agency plans to seek comments on "ways to incorporate additional flexibility for small oil refiners," an E.P.A. official said.
In the past, the government has tried to write its regulations to allow smaller refiners to survive.
Experts say that the public should not notice any change in the low-sulfur fuel other than its cost; it should smell the same and behave the same way in engines.
The fuel industry has been far more vociferous than engine manufacturers in opposing the rules.
The engine companies are apparently not eager for another battle with the E.P.A. Seven of the companies were caught by the agency installing "defeat devices" on their engines, devices that allowed the engines to pass certification tests but made them run much dirtier on the highways.
The companies agreed in 1998 to pay $83.4 million in penalties, and to spend $850 million to produce cleaner engines.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Democratic Candidates for Senate Clash on Gun Control and Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: LIVINGSTON, N.J., May 16

 BODY:
New Jersey's two Democratic candidates for the United States Senate clashed over gun control, national security and taxes tonight during their third debate, as each candidate tried to portray himself as the stronger champion of working families and the elderly.
Jon S. Corzine, who appeared defensive and tongue-tied during much of the first debate last Thursday, has been more confident and lucid in his subsequent outings, and tonight he continued his criticism of the $2.8 billion tax increase that his opponent, Jim Florio, enacted as governor. 
 Opening a new line of attack before a standing-room-only audience of 500 at the Temple Beth Shalom Synagogue here, Mr. Corzine also accused Mr. Florio of supporting cuts in defense spending and ending economic sanctions against Iraq.
Mr. Florio, who has tried to use the debates to compensate for his disadvantage in campaign financing, struck back by accusing Mr. Corzine of investing in several gun manufacturers when he was chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company.
"During the 90's, when Jon, at Goldman Sachs, was financing the gun industry, I was standing up to the gun lobby," Mr. Florio said.
Mr. Florio also rebutted Mr. Corzine's criticism of his tax increase by pointing out that Mr. Corzine was one of the most generous contributors to his re-election campaign, giving the maximum legal donation to both his primary and general election efforts.
"I'm startled to see this opportunistic political expediency come forward," Mr. Florio said, to cheers and laughs from the audience.
Although this was the third encounter between the candidates in a week -- with the final debate scheduled for Thursday -- Mr. Corzine has come under criticism in recent days because he has agreed to debates on small radio stations and cable television outlets but has refused to attend a May 26 debate sponsored by the League of Women voters, to be broadcast on network television.
Tonight's encounter was scheduled to be televised in excerpted form Wednesday night by the Regional News Network, a cable station that reaches a limited number of homes in northern New Jersey.
But Mr. Corzine, whose unfettered campaign spending has filled the airwaves with a barrage of television and radio ads, has little to gain strategically by participating in uncontrolled forums like debates. He points out that some of Mr. Florio's previous campaigns included fewer than four debates.
It is not clear, however, if the debates have changed the dynamic of this race. Mr. Corzine, a political unknown when he declared his interest in the Senate seat last February, has spent more than $15 million of his own money on a flood of television advertisements during the last eight weeks. There is little reliable polling available, because poll respondents are notoriously untrustworthy when asked if they will vote in a primary, but both campaigns believe that Mr. Corzine has narrowed Mr. Florio's once-formidable lead, and some suggest that Mr. Corzine is slightly ahead.
So with three weeks remaining before the June 6 primary, the contest has become increasingly heated. Mr. Florio, who has money for television advertisements only during the final two weeks of the campaign, has tried to halt Mr. Corzine's momentum by portraying him as out of tune with the concerns of working families and as politically naive.
When Mr. Corzine expressed his support tonight for President Clinton's nuclear missile shield "within the context of negotiations with Russia," Mr. Florio said he was being duped by Congressional Republicans.
Mr. Corzine has accompanied the week of debates with an acceleration in spending, which is likely to shatter all records for primary candidates. After the candidates' radio debate on Monday, Mr. Corzine unveiled three new television ads. And in recent weeks, his voice has been heard on a growing number of radio stations and his face has become a familiar sight on buses and billboards.
Mr. Corzine has said that his intense television campaign is the only way that a political newcomer can compete with "professional politicians" like Mr. Florio, whose name recognition in New Jersey is nearly universal.
Although Mr. Florio has branded Mr. Corzine's proposal to invest part of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market as a risky scheme that might send elderly Americans to "the poor house," Mr. Corzine did not back away from the plan.
Mr. Corzine asserted that he supported President Clinton's Social Security plan, which would use the nation's present prosperity to help ensure the economic well-being of elderly Americans in the decades to come.

HEADLINE: Battle on Federalism

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
At first glance, the Violence Against Women Act appeared an unlikely battleground for the Supreme Court's continuing federalism wars.
This 1994 federal law neither told the states to do anything nor prohibited them from taking any action. By permitting private damage suits by victims of "gender-motivated violence" against their attackers, the law did not expose the states themselves to any new legal liability. 
 This was no titanic struggle among co-equal sovereigns: when the legislation was pending in Congress, the attorneys general from 38 states urged its passage, and 36 states joined a brief supporting the law before the Supreme Court. Only one, Alabama, filed a brief asking the justices to strike the law down.
Despite all that, the court invalidated a central provision of the law on Monday by a 5-to-4 vote. Developments at the court over the last five years made the law a nearly perfect target for the narrow but determined majority of justices who, through half a dozen earlier rulings, brought the court to the point at which the invalidation of the Violence Against Women Act, as an unconstitutional exercise in Congressional overreaching, was close to inevitable.
There are distinct strands to the court's new federalism jurisprudence, and in a formal sense, the decision in United States v. Morrison, Monday's ruling, represents only one of them: holding Congress to its limited and enumerated powers. In this sense, the ruling flowed directly from a 1995 decision that struck down, as beyond Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce, a law that made it a federal crime to carry a gun near a school. That decision, United States v. Lopez, was the first time since the New Deal that the court found Congress to have exceeded its authority under the commerce clause. States' rights, as such, were not directly at issue either in the Lopez case or in the decision on Monday.
But in a broader sense, the latest decision represents something more: a convergence between the court's focus on a Congress of limited powers and its newly found solicitude for state sovereignty, the focus of other recent federalism decisions that have carved out new immunities for the states from federal court lawsuits or federal policy "commandeering." The convergence lay not so much in anything Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's majority opinion said explicitly, but in the background music of a decision that rejected a large volume of evidence that the law's sponsors had compiled to show why a national approach to violence against women was needed.
"The court applied its own meta-test" to the legislative record, said Prof. Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School: "We don't care what the findings are, if accepting them endangers our vision of state sovereignty, our view of the architecture of our system." That test applies, Professor Tribe said in an interview, "even when the states are basically willing bystanders."
Further, the decision moved the federalism counterrevolution closer than any of the other recent cases toward the core issues of civil rights for which the court for so long had given Congress wide scope. By ruling that the Violence Against Women Act was not an appropriate exercise of Congress's power to enforce the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment, the court emphasized that in the area of civil rights, no less than interstate commerce, Congressional assertions of power were now to be scrutinized under a judicial microscope.
"It's the intersection of the New Deal and civil rights, coming together in a case concerning women," Prof. Judith Resnik of Yale Law School said in an interview. She said the court's rejection of the argument that violence against women was an appropriate subject for national legislation was a reminder of earlier eras, when the Supreme Court viewed labor-management issues and, even earlier, slavery, as a matter of interpersonal relations, not properly subject to federal intervention.
In the years leading up to its final passage, the Violence Against Women Act was a frequent target of criticism from federal judges, including Chief Justice Rehnquist, who singled it out in a 1998 speech as one of "the more notable examples" of laws that unduly expanded the jurisdiction of the federal courts. "Our system will look more and more like the French government, where even the most minor details are ordained by the national government in Paris," the chief justice warned in a speech to the American Law Institute.
The familiar federal civil rights laws that bar discrimination in employment and in public accommodations are not in any danger from the decision, which cast no doubt on the court's assumption in prior cases that jobs, hotels, restaurants and the like are part of the national economy that Congress can properly regulate under its commerce power.
But when states themselves are defendants, there are strong signals that the court is looking through a different lens. Already, the court has declared states immune from suit by their employees for federal labor law violations and for age discrimination. In its next term, the justices will decide whether states can be sued under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
Beyond those particular implications, the broader fallout from the decision this week could lie outside the courtroom. Beginning with the Lopez decision, which invalidated a law few people had ever heard of, most of the court's federalism rulings have involved obscure statutes or obscure constitutional provisions like the 10th and 11th Amendments. As a result, a constitutional development of potentially enormous significance has been unfolding -- albeit in plain sight -- largely outside the realm of public discussion.
That could change, given the higher public profile of the Violence Against Women Act, the considerable attention the decision has received, and the closeness of the vote. Not too many years ago, it would hardly have seemed likely that questions about federalism might dominate a Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Now that prospect seems likely when the next vacancy occurs.
In another respect, the fallout from the decision could be surprising. Prof. Glenn H. Reynolds of the University of Tennessee Law School noted in an interview today that to regard the decision as a victory for conservatives could well be short-sighted. As recent Congressional debates on flag burning, school prayer, abortion methods and other such issues indicate, he said, much of what Congress does these days is symbolic, and much of the symbolism is conservative. But under the logic of this week's decision, Professor Reynolds added, any action in these areas would almost certainly exceed Congress's authority. "The beauty of our system is that everything bites back eventually," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Denounces Bush Social Security Plan as Too Risky

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO and ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Taking the offensive against Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to let workers invest some of their Social Security taxes, Vice President Al Gore asserted yesterday that the plan would hurt the very baby boomers it is intended to help by placing their retirement savings at the mercy of ruthless and whimsical markets.
In an event intended to sway younger voters who have grown accustomed to gravity-defying markets and are more likely to be receptive to the Bush plan, the vice president painted a bleak picture of unsophisticated taxpayers losing their savings in fraudulent, risky or just plain bad investments. 
 The result, he warned graduate students at Fordham Business School in Manhattan, would be a costly taxpayer-financed bailout of failed investors that would dwarf the multibillion-dollar rescue of bankrupt savings and loans in the 1980's. And yesterday, Mr. Bush suggested he might support allowing workers to invest a large portion of their payroll taxes, which Mr. Gore said would increase the chances of financial disaster.
"Tens of millions of investors who have not gone through the Fordham Business School, who have not had an opportunity to gain some basic knowledge to protect themselves against fraud," Mr. Gore said, "would be placed in a situation where a lot of financial shenanigans could take place, where they are losing their investments because they are not equipped in the way that sophisticated investors are. It happens all the time."
But Mr. Bush accused the vice president of flip-flopping on the issue, releasing a videotape from January 1999 showing Mr. Gore arguing that it might make sense for the federal government to invest some revenue in the stock market to take advantage of its historically strong returns.
Asked on the tape whether long-term stock investments would be safe, Mr. Gore replies: "Over any 10-year period in American history returns on equities are just significantly higher than these other returns. And in order to capture some part of that economic advantage, surely there is a way to solve these problems."
When asked about his remarks yesterday, the vice president said that he was talking about investing general tax revenues and not money from the Social Security trust fund -- an idea the Clinton administration was considering at the time. He also suggested that his views had changed after hearing debate over the proposal.
But Mr. Bush asserted that Mr. Gore had switched positions for political purposes. "I believe it's important to be consistent," he said in a news conference in Portland, Ore. "I believe it's important to have somebody willing to take a stand."
The day's swirling debate underscored Mr. Gore's desire to block Mr. Bush from seizing the advantage -- particularly among young voters -- on an issue that historically has played to the strengths of Democratic candidates.
For decades, Social Security has been a powerful Democratic weapon because it is so important to the most active group of voters in the electorate: the elderly. Older people have also tended to vote Democratic, so for years Democrats have successfully turned out their core voters by accusing Republicans of wanting to end or undermine the Social Security system.
But Mr. Bush's proposal could change that dynamic by making Social Security more relevant to younger voters who have grown skeptical about the system's viability but are also comfortable with the idea of investing in Wall Street. Polls show those younger voters supported President Clinton in 1996.
"I think Bush is slicing into part of the Democratic coalition with this," said Andrew Smith, director of polling for the University of New Hampshire. "But if older voters can be convinced that this plan is a threat to their Social Security, Bush will have problems."
Mr. Gore plans to make that argument to retirees in Florida on Wednesday.
In making Social Security a major campaign issue, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have offered sharply different proposals for extending the life of the system, which is projected to become insolvent by the year 2037.
Mr. Bush argues that allowing workers to invest a small portion of their payroll taxes would enable them to take advantage of the wealth created by Wall Street and reduce the cost to taxpayers of financing the system. But his plan would also leave those investors vulnerable to losses from market fluctuations.
Mr. Gore would not change the current system that guarantees a minimum benefit. To prolong the system's life, Mr. Gore proposes using the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt and then devoting the interest saved to the retirement system. The proposal would keep the system solvent until 2054, he contends.
Mr. Bush's event yesterday, like Mr. Gore's, was designed to take the issue beyond the elderly, as he tailored his message to the blue-collar work force at a Portland company that makes railroad freight cars and marine barges.
Mr. Gore's advisers contend that such working-class voters are more fiscally conservative, less comfortable with the idea of investing in Wall Street and likely to be opposed to Mr. Bush's plan.
Mr. Bush tried to show that was not the case yesterday. Leading a discussion with workers who spoke highly of their 401(k) plan, the governor suggested that opponents of his plan do not trust working Americans to manage their own money.
"You know I wonder out loud whether there may be some in Washington saying these workers are not smart enough to figure it out," Mr. Bush said. "I wonder whether or not that's what people may be really saying deep down. You can't trust individuals in America who maybe don't have Ph.D.'s in economics."
But even as he sought to sell his proposal, Mr. Bush -- who has not provided details for many aspects of the plan -- made several remarks that are likely to provide fodder for additional attacks from Mr. Gore.
First, Mr. Bush left open the possibility that his call for limited accounts was just the first step in a broader transformation of the federal retirement system. Answering a question about his plan, Mr. Bush said that the government could not go "from one regime to another overnight." He said: "It's going to take a while to transition to a system where personal savings accounts are the predominant part of the investment vehicle. And so, this is a step toward a completely different world and an important step."
Mr. Bush has refused to say what proportion of the 12.4 percent payroll tax people could put into private accounts under his plan.
Mr. Bush also refused to say how much benefits might be reduced for workers who created private investment accounts.
"That's all up for discussion," Mr. Bush said.
With many finance majors present at his Fordham event, Mr. Gore noted that he supported individuals investing in the stock market for retirement, provided no Social Security funds are involved. But to bolster his point that the markets can be risky, he brought along several experts, including Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street executive who was Treasury secretary until last year.
"I've been involved with markets virtually my entire working life," Mr. Rubin told the group. "There is no question, stocks have risks."
In many ways, Mr. Gore's arguments might have seemed a tough sell to a youthful audience that was both knowledgeable about financial markets and accustomed to hearing that the best retirement savings are in the stock market.
Indeed, many students' questions indicated a general support for the idea of private investment accounts. But several students said after the event that Mr. Gore had raised deep questions in their minds about the Bush plan.
"When he says there are certain to be losers, that's a compelling argument," said Scott Horton, a 27-year-old finance major.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Hillary Clinton's Remarks at Nominating Convention

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Hillary Rodham Clinton's remarks to the New York State Democratic Convention last night in Albany:
Tonight I'm deeply honored and humbled to accept the nomination of the New York Democratic Party for the United States Senate. . . . 
 And I pledge to you that I will work my heart out every day in this campaign to become your next senator. And I will work every day in the Senate to keep faith with you, with the values and the ideals of the Democratic Party of New York.
Because make no mistake about it: This election is not about me or about any Republican opponent. It's about the people of New York, and the mission that we are pledged to. What is that mission? I think it is to strengthen our families and to protect our children, to improve our schools and to extend health care to every New Yorker. To free our families and our communities from the terror of gun violence. Strengthen Social Security and modernize Medicare. Ensure America's continued leadership in the world.
It was, after all, New York Democrats who led the way in building the great American middle class. In giving rise to the labor union, to civil rights, to women's rights, to gay rights.
We can continue leading this by building on the progress of the last seven years. Twenty-one million new jobs, balanced budgets, lowered crime, stronger schools, better child care, a cleaner environment, a safer and more inclusive American community. And our thanks must go to Vice President Al Gore and President Bill Clinton.
New York has made tremendous strides in the last seven years. But there are still too many forgotten New Yorkers. Millions of children without the families, health care or education they need to prepare them for the future. Millions of mothers and fathers working full time but still stressed with too little money or too little time. An upstate economy that isn't generating enough jobs to keep our young people here.
We have some of the greatest institutions of higher learning in the nation. Yet too many of our students still can't afford a college education.
We have some of the best public schools around. Yet far too many of our students are crammed into overcrowded, dilapidated school buildings more suited to the 19th century than the 21st.
We have the finest hospitals in the world. Yet more than half a million children in New York do not have health insurance, and two million older New Yorkers cannot afford their prescription drugs.
We have the most beautiful scenery -- from the Finger Lakes to the Adirondacks to Long Island's beaches. Yet we face environmental challenges to our air, our water and our health.
I know we can do better and New York should not settle for less.
We owe it to ourselves and to our children.

For Job Hunters, Networking Beats the Net

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Millions of people search the Internet every month looking for jobs, but for actually landing one, nothing beats the old-fashioned personal touch, the latest studies show.
 While the top 10 Internet job search sites had almost twice as many users in March as they did one year earlier -- 17.4 million versus 8.9 million -- networking and referrals remained the main way people found work. A survey by Drake Beam Morin, a workplace consulting firm, of 7,400 executives who switched jobs last year, showed that just 4 percent found their positions on the Internet, while 64 percent got them by networking. 
 Another survey, by Forrester Research, indicated that the majority of people who used job-search sites were generally dissatisfied with the quality of the jobs advertised. Nevertheless, companies and recruiters said they planned to spend more on advertising jobs online than they do now because it is such an efficient way to reach job hunters.
 Todd Hoffman, national director of recruiting for tax and legal services at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that about 3 percent of the 900 people he has hired this fiscal year made initial contact via the Internet. In the next 12 to 15 months, he said he would like that percentage to be 10 to 12 percent. This is a high priority for us, he said. It is more cost effective. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

New Jersey Jobless Rate Up

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
New Jersey's jobless rate edged up slightly in April, rising to 3.8 percent from 3.7 percent, according to labor statistics released yesterday. 
The rate has remained below 4.5 percent for the past six months.
"It's still a tenth of a point below the national rate," said the state's labor commissioner, Mel Gelade.
About 11,600 jobs were added in April, but with more people looking for jobs, the unemployment rate rose, Mr. Gelade said.
The service sector had the biggest gains, with 4,800 new jobs. The retail sector added 4,000 jobs, with food stores posting 1,500 new jobs.
Construction added 400 jobs, pushing employment in that sector to its highest level since August 1990.
Manufacturing lost 700 jobs, and finance/insurance/real estate lost 200 jobs.

HEADLINE: Remember When $29 Shocked . . .

BYLINE: By RICK MARIN 

 BODY:
IN bringing his chain of meateries from Dallas to Midtown Manhattan, Terry White, the executive chef at Del Frisco's, introduced a special menu item just for New Yorkers.
The Double Eagle strip steak (bone-in, 26 ounces). 
 $49.95.
For one. With nothing else on the plate but a smooth coat of butter -- and a little parsley.
Is this the most expensive per-person steak in town? In recorded history?
"We are offering the best that money can buy, and we're not shy about charging for it," said Mr. White, whose restaurant opened on West 49th Street a couple of months ago. "We're in an age when people are trading cars in every two years, people are getting pedicures and manicures. They're taking care of themselves. They're living large. And we provide them with an atmosphere to live large."
He, and plenty more big-ticket restaurateurs in these big-ticket times. Has anyone looked at the column to the right of the entrees lately? Crazy numbers! A $32 cod at Picholine. Duck for $35 at Gotham Bar & Grill. A $38.25 rack of lamb at Limoncello. Limoncello!
Entrees used to hover politely under $30, with maybe a lobster or prime sirloin thrusting boldly beyond that old psychic and budget barrier, $29.95. Now you see menus with hardly anything under $30, and it's not necessarily buying four-star food, service or ambience. More modest neighborhood places are up there, too. Soft-shell crabs are $32 at Little Dove. Della Femina charges $44 for its veal rib chop. Decade, on First Avenue and 61st Street, wants $33 for a veal chop and is not even in Zagat.
The $30 barrier has been broken in New York restaurants, quietly, with enough money around to muffle any noise about it. These places are packed. On the horizon is what may be the most expensive of them all. Alain Ducasse, the French chef with six Michelin stars, comes to the Essex House this summer with the possibility that his per-person rate might climb north of $200.
A spokesman for Mr. Ducasse said his New York prices had not been determined yet. But a Ducasse dinner in Paris can run as high as $215 a person, not including wine.
Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant based in Manhattan, said prices began spiking over the last year or two. "Some people are just trying to see, 'Let's see how far I can go,' " he said. "Sometimes it's justified, and sometimes it's a rip-off." Mr. Wolf offered a few of the typical justifications for a $32 piece of fish. Food costs are up, as is rent. Competition for preternaturally picky New York diners has driven chefs to seek out the most rarefied ingredients, six-figure sommeliers, exotic architects.
To hear the owner of Bayard's tell it, $33 for his halibut dish is barely enough to break even.
"Garnishes aren't cheap," said Peter Poulakakos, who operates the restaurant, at 1 Hanover Square.
"You've got potato on there. A lot of people are touching that plate. There are a lot of hands on that plate, and all those hands cost money. Even the plate it's on costs me $30 to $40."
Terrance Brennan, the chef and owner of Picholine on West 64th Street, decided almost two years ago that he wanted to upgrade. "Then I had a couple of dishes breaking the $30 barrier," he said. "I was very sensitive to it." But he increased his staff to 88 employees and took on an assistant sommelier and two "cheese guys."
"To try and achieve this next level, you have to hire more experienced managers, which costs a lot more," he continued. "And there's no other way except to raise prices." The butter clams served with his $32 cod cost $20 a pound from his supplier in Maine, he added, explaining, "there's a lot behind the cod dish itself."
In the fall, Mr. Brennan will be serving a plate of white-truffle risotto for $100, a reasonable price, he argued, considering the high truffle content. "I shave heavy," he said.
Picholine solicits feedback on customer comment cards. Complaints about cost come in rarely, Mr. Brennan said. "I can't remember the last time I got a comment card that said prices are too high or anything like that," he said.
In 1975, when a pleasure dome called the Palace opened with the unheard-of prix fixe of $50 a person, a reviewer for The New York Times suggested that a mob might string up the perpetrators on the nearest lamppost. No stars were given "because of the impossibility of averaging quality and price in this instance," John Canaday wrote.
In today's economy, admitting to being unable to afford a $36 entree might be considered rube behavior, or at least embarrassing. A certain caste of New Yorkers is experiencing "bracket creep," said David Brooks, the author of the new "Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There" (Simon & Schuster, $25).
"As you rise to each new income and price bracket, you have total amnesia of what life was like at the previous bracket," Mr. Brooks said. The advent of fabulous cyberwealth has also had a trickle-down effect. "People are adapting to the behavior of people who are beyond rich," he said.
It is no secret that New York is an expensive place to eat. Del Frisco's pumped up its prices $1 or $2 when it opened here to cover what Mr. White, the executive chef, called "the ambience, the rent, the total experience" of his 16,400-square-foot cow palace. Rather than offer a huge steak for two, he went with the $49.95 steak for one, because his market research had revealed the startling fact that New Yorkers do not like to share.
Gotham Bar & Grill has never been cheap, but of 13 second courses listed on its current menu, only two of them weigh in at under $ 30: the Maine brook trout for $28.50 and organic free-range chicken for $28. In this context, a $28 chicken starts to look like a bargain.
Alfred Portale, chef at Gotham for 16 years, recalled when his entrees "started stacking up under $30" -- maybe five years ago. "I didn't want to go over $30, but I had to," he said. "Now I feel the same way about $35."
Four of Mr. Portale's entrees have reached or broken that barrier: the Maine lobster tails ($37), roast rack of veal ($36), Chinese spiced duck breast ($35) and rack of lamb ($36).
"I hate raising prices," he said. "You're forced to." He said that his rent on East 12th Street doubled last year but that "we don't try to capture that in the food costs." The reason, he said was "super-expensive ingredients." Earlier this year, he switched from 21-day aged top choice beef (at $4.10 a pound wholesale) to prime (more than $6 a pound). He always used sushi-grade tuna ($5.50 to $6 a pound), but now it has to be belly ($10 a pound). His old Monini extra virgin olive oil ($70 for six one-liter bottles) isn't good enough anymore. He imports single-vineyard, organic olive oils from his wine purveyors ($140 for six half-liter bottles).
Mr. Portale and Mr. Brennan run ambitious kitchens and dining rooms that can justify crossing the $30 border. But for a halibut dish at the brand-new Bayard's to be only $2 less than the $35 halibut at Restaurant Daniel, with no cheese cart or exclusive ingredients in the package, does not seem to be in the natural order of things.
There is a formula for menu pricing. At most restaurants, between 30 and 35 percent of an entree's price is the food cost. This is usually an average. Forty percent on a steak is mitigated by 20 percent on chicken. Many chefs and owners said they make less money on their highest-priced entrees. Mr. Portale says he pays $14 for the duck in his $35 Chinese spiced duck breast. Kevin Penner, the executive chef and a partner at Della Femina, on East 54th Street, is "not coming close to making money" on his $42 cowboy steak, he said, adding, "It should be $52 based on what it costs me."
Still, do customers ever blanch at breaking not only the $30 barrier, but $40?
"We do get people in who perhaps suffer from a bit of sticker shock at times, and we're willing to work with them and split things," Mr. Penner said. "Typically, they'll say something like, 'I'm not so hungry.' But they want to have the experience of saying they ate here and tell their friends."
At other restaurants, the price of admission almost seems like a membership fee, observed Mr. Wolf, the consultant.
At Harry Cipriani, where chicken marsala sets back its Brioni-blazered diners $34.95, the staggering bills are "as much about who's not welcome as who is," Mr. Wolf said.
The Four Seasons restaurant also cultivates a clubby atmosphere of powerful money -- money that does not have to worry about a $46 Dover sole.
Alex von Bidder, one of the restaurant's owners, said of eating there: "You're renting a piece of real estate. The fish is unfortunately only a small part of the cost. There is the exquisite setting and the location."
Asked if the arrival of Mr. Ducasse and his expected hefty prix fixe would drag other restaurants up with him, Mr. von Bidder said, "I really don't pay attention to what other people charge."
Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who owns five New York restaurants, estimated that Mr. Ducasse's prix fixe would probably be in the $150 to $200 range. "He's going to be in a class of his own," he said.
Mr. Vongerichten charges a $125 prix fixe for dinner at Jean Georges. But at Nougatine, his casual cafe attached to Jean Georges, lobster lemon risotto is $34. At a table with hardly enough room under it to cross your legs.
Mr. Vongerichten bemoaned the high cost of running a high-end establishment. "If you don't spend $3 million on the design and construction, you have nothing serious anymore," he said. A 10-year loan of $8 million to $10 million means at least $1 million a year in payments. Running the numbers in his mental calculator, he added, "Some places are paying $500,000 in rent, a chef costs $100,000 -- and they'll probably close after six months."
One New York restaurateur whose wings have been singed is Frank Valenza, the owner of Two Two Two on West 79th Street -- and 25 years ago, the Palace. Last week Mr. Valenza announced that he was lowering his prices. His $59 prix fixe is $39 a person. A la carte entrees that were $32 to $49 are now $24 to $42. Gone from the new menu is the 16-ounce Kobe sirloin for $180.
"We used to get stockbrokers pulling up in their limos, and that's kind of died down," Mr. Valenza said. "So what do you do?"
At the Palace, Mr. Valenza, who came to food from a theatrical background, gave customers ice sculptures of a fisherman with nets full of caviar. To attract clientele back to Two Two Two, he has once again mustered his flair for showmanship. On display in the entrance area of the restaurant is his wife's Barbie collection.
He's throwing that in free.

THE ISSUES
 
BATTLE OVER BATTLE FLAG -- If South Carolina lawmakers hoped that the N.A.A.C.P. would drop its economic boycott of the state now that they have agreed to move the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse dome, they had not counted on the group's tenacity. Kweisi Mfume, the national president of the group, said yesterday that the N.A.A.C.P. might even consider expanding the boycott beyond tourism, because the state plans to move the banner to a flagpole in front of the State Capitol, near a monument to Confederate soldiers. Although the group's original boycott resolution demanded that the flag be moved out of a position of sovereignty, Mr. Mfume argued that the flag was no less prominent in front of the building than it was on top. The State Senate and House are expected to iron out minor differences on a bill to move the flag in the next few weeks, and it is scheduled to be lowered on July 1. David Firestone (NYT) 

THE DEMOCRATS
 
DECISION IN KENNEDY CASE -- The Los Angeles city attorney declined yesterday to file misdemeanor battery charges against Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island over a confrontation with a security guard at Los Angeles International Airport in March. The prosecutor's office summoned Mr. Kennedy, 32, and the guard, Della Patton, 58, to a hearing last week to review a videotape of the incident. Mr. Kennedy had earlier acknowledged acting rudely and apologized, but he denied hurting Ms. Patton. "I am obviously happy that city officials agree that I did not do what I was accused of," Mr. Kennedy said in a statement. George L. Mallory Jr., a lawyer for Ms. Patton, who has complained of shoulder pain and has not worked since the incident, said he expected to approach Mr. Kennedy about a settlement and would sue if those talks failed.

THE STATES
 
GUBERNATORIAL EARLY BIRD -- It's a year early, but the 2001 governor's race in Virginia is already taking shape, with one self-made millionaire announcing this week that he is stepping aside for another in the Democratic competition. Former congressman L. F. Payne Jr., a Charlottesville developer who lost as the Democratic Party's candidate for lieutenant governor in 1997, took himself out of the running and endorsed Mark R. Warner, who heads a venture capital firm in Alexandria. Mr. Payne said Mr. Warner had "the right experience, the right ideas and the right values" to win the governorship. Mr. Payne's base is among rural conservative Democrats and he showed his popularity by finishing ahead of the rest of his ticket in the Democrats' bid to take the Statehouse in 1997. But he conceded that Mr. Warner, whose base is in the northern suburbs, already had a dominant edge in organization and fund-raising among high-tech corporate donors. As he stepped aside, Mr. Payne was accompanied by supporters insisting that he would still be a good candidate for governor in 2005. In the meantime, he may take on a role in Mr. Warner's campaign. The Republican nomination for governor next year is expected to be contested by Lt. Gov. John H. Hager, who defeated Mr. Payne in 1997, and Attorney General Mark L. Earley.

'LIVE TAX FREE OR DIE' -- Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire announced yesterday that she would seek a third two-year term. But she did not say whether she would renew her pledge to veto an income tax, which is seen by some state leaders, albeit reluctantly, as the best way for the state to respond to a court order to reform its school financing system. Year in and year out, taxes are the hottest political issue in New Hampshire, a state that, along with Alaska, has no personal income tax or general sales tax (its official motto is "Live Free Or Die") and whose residents take great pride in roughing up politicians who do not pledge to oppose new levies. Governor Shaheen, a Democrat, took "the pledge" in her 1996 and 1998 campaigns but she has thus far avoided discussing what she might do in the 2000 campaign -- though she did agree to a temporary tax, at one point, as the state initially tried to respond to the court school-financing order. In this year's Democratic primary, she will face State Senator Mark Fernald, who supports a state income tax to solve the school problem. On the Republican side, four candidates are competing for the nomination, with mixed views on the tax question. There is also an independent candidate. John Kifner (NYT)

GOLD DIGGER
The Outrageous Life and Times of Peggy Hopkins Joyce
By Constance Rosenblum
Illustrated. 293 pages. Metropolitan Books. $26.
Those who brood that hollow, distinction-free celebrities are an idiosyncrasy of our talk show-driven times might be relieved to learn that other periods had them as well. Peggy Hopkins Joyce was a Broadway showgirl who won fame during the rollicking 1920's for parlaying her knockout looks into a string of rich lovers and husbands. Her forays into stage acting and films were embarrassments, but her tally of generous males -- among them Charlie Chaplin and Walter Chrysler -- was thought to be record-breaking, at least by the day's tabloids. 
 She was a barber's daughter from Virginia who not long after arriving in New York in 1915 won deification by Florenz Ziegfeld. In the grand "Follies"-girl tradition, she was besieged by wealthy suitors and found that she liked men almost as much as they liked her. At a time when virility was measured by the cost of a suitor's gifts, Joyce soon learned that her favorite pastime could be highly remunerative.
The basic economic equation on which she operated was simplicity itself and was examined fully in the Jule Styne-Leo Robin song, "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend." (Anita Loos's Lorelei Lee, the character for whom this song was written, was inspired by Joyce.) After a few lines on the subject, however, we get the idea, but Constance Rosenblum, editor of the City section of The New York Times, has written a full-length biography, inspired, we learn, by the discovery of a carton of Joyce's papers and memorabilia.
Ms. Rosenblum deftly sets up Joyce's erotic magnetism and her flaunting of the rigid morals of the day, when even a twice-married woman was looked upon with disapproval if not scorn. Interestingly, she places Joyce in the context of the great courtesans of the French court (she got less respect, but then Walter Chrysler was no Louis XIV) and compares her to our own day's repeater brides. The reader is ready to become acquainted with a mores-defying free spirit, to tag along on romantic adventures, to encounter some of the day's more diverting luminaries -- in short, to enjoy a romp through the Jazz Age in the company of one of its liveliest figures. Unfortunately, very little of this happens.
In spite of acknowledgments that run four pages, the book has few interviews with people who knew Joyce, and most of those who are interviewed did not know her well. Even Joyce's last husband, whom Ms. Rosenblum thanks for being "helpful," has little to say: no hint of her personality or how they spent the six years before she died in 1957. Even the book-prompting carton of memorabilia is a disappointing mishmash of notes from friends, bills from florists, postcards from love-sick suitors and gossip-column clippings. While those odds and ends suggest the outlines of a life, they also establish that as a conserver of biographical documents, Peggy Joyce was no Boswell.
For its picture of Joyce, the book relies most heavily on mentions in tabloid columns or on other dubious sources like Photoplay magazine and the scandal primer "Hollywood Babylon." Ms. Rosenblum culls anecdotes from Joyce's own memoirs, more often than not adding that the stories are probably untrue.
For the most part, the public persona is all we get, but even here the book falls short. There are numerous references to Joyce's "outrageous" behavior and statements to the press, but when we are presented with illustrations, they land with a thud. An example of her outre behavior tells us that when answering her phone Joyce often disguised her voice as a French maid's. Another divulges that new boyfriends were told by Joyce that a half-knitted wool scarf that she kept around for years was undertaken for them. Readers primed for the gin-soaked debaucheries of the Roaring Twenties might have hoped for a bit more. Banal as these stories are, such glimpses of Joyce in action are scarce.
Her shockers to the press are equally low-voltage. A typical example was when she was asked by reporters about the assets of the family of a Swedish count she was about to marry. Joyce told them: "I do not think they have much besides the castle. However, a castle is something after all." And later, discussing her husband's nobility (a term Ms. Rosenblum worryingly uses interchangeably with "royalty") , Joyce says: "I could have done better than countess. I could have been a princess or something." While endearingly crass, these statements are less than outrageous.
In an effort to evoke the glamour of Joyce's world, Ms. Rosenblum makes frequent mention of well-known figures of the day like Eddie Cantor, W. C. Fields and Al Jolson, but in linking these names with her heroine falls back on phrases like "rubbed elbows with." If Joyce interacted with any of these notables, we are not to know. An egregious example of such teasing is an account of Joyce's friction with her "Follies"-girl colleagues that grew so acrimonious that Ziegfeld removed her to the dressing room of Fanny Brice. Hopes that we have at last hit pay dirt are dashed when the animosity is improbably explained as jealousy over Joyce's being given a line. Although Joyce became friends with Brice, we are offered only two quick glimpses of that legend.
It was well known that Joyce did more than brush up against Charlie Chaplin, but even the few pages devoted to this romantic interlude prove disappointing. Ms. Rosenblum tells of "a private frolic" that Joyce and Chaplin enjoyed on an isolated beach during which the couple was spied from a distance through the binoculars of some locals. The stillborn anecdote seems to encapsulate some of the problems with this book: the scene is viewed from a distance by anonymous peeping Toms unknown to Joyce, it is given only a few cursory lines and we are denied the revealing details, both biographical and prurient, that would seem essential to a book about a woman who possessed, finally, just one talent.
We are frequently reminded of how famous Joyce was, how the public's interest in her was insatiable and how she was a fixture, in furs and jewels, at the most exciting nightclubs and openings, even turning up in the lyrics of Irving Berlin and Cole Porter as the day's symbol of the naughty madcap. But the reiteration of her notoriety lends a defensive, flap-copy tone to the biography, suggesting that the author shares readers' misgivings about her subject's book-worthiness. A more up-close and revealing book about Peggy Hopkins Joyce might have been fun to read, but there is little in this one to make us think so.

HEADLINE: Life in the Slow Lane;
Rural Residents Are Frustrated by Sluggish Web Access and a Scarcity of Local Information Online

BYLINE: By CATHERINE GREENMAN 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH Debbie Wintz often surfs the Internet in the evenings, much of that time is actually spent folding clothes, feeding the cat or tidying up the kitchen.
Ms. Wintz, a real estate agent who lives in Pryor, Okla., about 40 miles northeast of Tulsa, uses a standard dial-up modem to connect through her local Internet service provider. The connection is never very fast -- 33 kilobits per second at most, although she has a 56K modem -- and at night it often slows to a crawl. So Ms. Wintz occupies herself with other tasks until a Web page with a few links and pop-up messages finally appears on her screen. 
 Like millions of other Americans, Ms. Wintz craves a faster Internet connection. But unlike millions of urban and suburban Americans, Ms. Wintz is stuck with dial-up service because there are no other choices in Pryor, population 8,300.
While high-speed options like cable modems and D.S.L. (digital subscriber line) service are becoming increasingly available in populous areas, Ms. Wintz and other residents of more isolated communities are stuck in low gear, limited by the capabilities of local providers, which in turn rely on local phone networks to transmit data. For her and other rural Americans, the much-touted promise of a high-speed Internet seems as far off as the East or West Coast.
"I understand that it's about profits," Ms. Wintz said, "but I feel like we're being discriminated against. How come we always have to be last?"
Broadband technologies like D.S.L. and cable modem service have been slow to reach rural America. According to a report issued last month by the Department of Commerce, the percentage of towns with fewer than 10,000 people that have access to D.S.L. service from their regional phone companies is closer to zero than 1. But that number is 86 percent for cities with more than 100,000 residents. About 1 percent of towns with fewer than 10,000 people had cable modem service, compared with 72 percent of cities with more than 250,000 residents.
Even though some people who have tried to get high-speed access, particularly D.S.L., have been frustrated by poor service and other problems, people in rural areas would at least like to have the choice.
The scarcity of high-speed connections is not the only complaint among rural Internet users. News and information about rural areas is often difficult to find online. It can be far easier to find the address of every coffee bar in Seattle, say, than the hours of the local library in a small town in rural eastern Washington. And rural residents who use national I.S.P.'s like America Online or EarthLink often find themselves paying toll charges to call access numbers.
"If you're looking for free local access, you're better off going with a small local I.S.P.," said Laura Kelso, co-founder of Ubundle.com, a company that lets consumers customize their Internet and telecommunications services. "Even America Online has a lot of areas where it's going to be a long distance call to dial up." Most big providers, she said, lack the necessary Internet connection points, known as points of presence, to cover rural areas.
But above all, slow Internet transmissions and crowded phone networks are the biggest frustrations for many people in rural areas.
David Haskin, a journalist in Barneveld, Wis., noticed how slow his dial-up connection became when he moved 35 miles out of Madison, Wisc., to Barneveld. The move also coincided with his getting a job as a Web content producer.
"You don't want to be a Webmaster with a slow modem connection," he said. "When I lived in Madison, I could get a 56K connection, but in the country, the calls have to go through central office switches so everything slows down."
Bob Holton, who lives in Fort Gibson, Okla., and works in nearby Muskogee, said he could not call his office between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. because the phone lines in his area were tied up by young people on the Internet. "The bottom line is that the infrastructure is old and noisy," he said, "and the issues to fix it are cost and amortization of the equipment. It leaves me and everyone else in the area just dying."
Mr. Holton, who uses Azalea.net, a local I.S.P., also has an AOL account for e-mail, but he has to dial a number in Tulsa -- a long-distance call -- to gain access.
The problems of Internet access in rural areas are attracting the attention of the Federal Communications Commission. Linda Kinney, assistant chief of the common carrier bureau, said the agency planned a survey this summer to determine whether rural areas were being properly served.
Many of the larger telephone companies say they are working to increase local dial-up access. "It's been a part of our strategy to continue reaching into smaller calling areas," said Rich Jeffers, a spokesman for Bell South, which covers nine southeastern states. Mr. Jeffers said Bell South's Internet service, BellSouth.net, was available to more than 80 percent of its customers through a local call. "Our goal is to get it to 100 percent," he said.
Trish Primrose, a spokeswoman for AOL, said the company offered consumers who could not dial in to the service with a local number an alternative plan in which they could sign up with local I.S.P.'s and connect to AOL through their I.S.P.'s at a reduced rate of $9.95 per month.
In the last few years, many rural communities have connected to the Internet through small local I.S.P.'s that sprang up to fill a need. The local I.S.P. is the only access available for a toll-free call in many areas because the larger I.S.P.'s have opted not to invest in the installation of network equipment in those areas.
John Nunn, for example, started Twin County Internet Access, an I.S.P., in 1996 because he and his neighbors in Galax, Va., in the southwest corner of the state, were paying long-distance charges for access to I.S.P.'s like AOL and Netcom.
Mr. Nunn was also frustrated because there was little local information online. Mr. Nunn's I.S.P. provided local users with links to Virginia newspapers and even had its own advice column, "Ask the Blonde," written by a local schoolteacher. (He has since sold the I.S.P. to NetAccess, a regional I.S.P.)
But as broadband D.S.L. and cable Internet access spreads to metropolitan areas and suburbs, rural I.S.P.'s that were started to provide basic dial-up service find that they cannot meet the demand for faster access. Instead, they are usually forced to wait until their local phone networks or cable companies decide that their markets are worth the investment.
The Mendocino Community Network, an I.S.P. in Mendocino, Calif., with about 5,000 customers, was built in part to foster economic growth in the community, which is about 125 miles north of San Francisco.
The Mendocino Community Network provides community residents with 150 hours of local dial-up access for $19.95 per month, and it donates I.S.P. services to local nonprofit organizations. The I.S.P. also functions as an active community service, featuring local news and events on its Web page and sending out electronic newsletters from movie theater and store owners. But without broadband Internet access, the community is at a disadvantage, said the network's manager, Rennie Innis.
"One of the biggest complaints is the slow speed of the phone lines," Mr. Innis said. "D.S.L. or cable access would be a real gift because how you operate your business depends on what the technology will allow. It's not just about faster speeds -- it's about people living where they want to live and still maintaining an urban quality job."
D.S.L. service is limited to customers who live within about three miles of a telephone company central office, which is more of a problem in rural areas than in cities or suburbs. But D.S.L. providers say new technology will help ease the distance limitations before the end of the year.
"We'll break through those limitations, which will justify a further reach into rural areas from an economic standpoint," said Hank Carabelli, president and chief operating officer of @Link Networks, based in Louisville, Colo., which sells broadband services to regional I.S.P.'s and businesses.
Some broadband providers, like New Edge Networks and DSL.net, specialize in providing D.S.L. service to smaller markets through line-sharing agreements with local telephone companies and reseller agreements with local, regional and national I.S.P.'s. Although they are still in the testing stages, wireless technologies like multichannel multipoint distribution services and satellites are seen by some in the industry as effective ways to offer high-speed Internet access to rural areas without incurring the high costs of installing networks.
Sprint Broadband Wireless Group is test-marketing Sprint Broadband Direct in Phoenix, a multichannel multipoint service the company says is 36 times as fast as a regular dial-up connection. It relies on radio transmission rather than phone or cable lines, and it works with a two-way digital transceiver installed on a rooftop that is pointed toward a radio tower to send and receive signals. Although the service is designed to reach people who do not have D.S.L. or cable access, it has a 35-mile limit, which does not help many rural residents.
Some people in rural areas are hopeful about satellite technology, which does not pose the same distance limitations as other broadband solutions. Hughes Network Systems, which has about 8.5 million subscribers on its DirectTV satellite service, said it expected to add two-way high-speed Internet access later this year. "We discovered we could hit a low cost for this two-way terminal and offer it to consumers for about the same cost as a dial-up account," said Paul Gaske, executive vice president of the Consumer Division at Hughes. Prices have not been announced.
The two-way transmission will work with an antenna that transmits and receives satellite data. Downloading will run at 400K; uploading, 128K to 256K.
Regardless of what speeds are involved, larger I.S.P.'s have generally been slower than local and regional I.S.P.'s in building their networks to provide rural residents with local Internet access. There are a few larger I.S.P.'s, however, that are focusing specifically on rural markets.
For the past two years, for example, OneMain.com, based in Reston, Va., has been acquiring small, local I.S.P.'s, in addition to building Internet connection points in rural areas, in an effort to become the leading national I.S.P. for rural communities. "In 65 percent of the rural markets, you can't access America Online with a local phone call," said Stephen E. Smith, chairman and chief executive of One Main. "We think there's a lot of growth potential because they've been largely ignored."
OneMain.com also designs its I.S.P. affiliates as local portals and tailors contentgeographically, through agreements with local newspapers and merchants. "People don't want to dial up from Bakersfield, Calif., and read information about Roanoke, Va.," Mr. Smith said. "We built our networks around geographical content, which is what the larger I.S.P.'s can't do because they've outsourced nationwide networks."
Mr. Smith said One Main had 800,000 customers and planned to provide Internet access to more than 65 markets by the end of this year. Many of OneMain affiliates will also offer D.S.L. access, Mr. Smith said.
Another I.S.P., OneWorldOnline.com, based in Provo, Utah, offers potential users cash incentives to persuade other people in the area to fill out forms saying they will sign up once a local connection is established. When a local I.S.P. affiliate is established, the original customer gets $25 for each subscriber the customer signed up for the service. "Our rural approach has been to go and identify the customers first, then go and put a point of presence in," said David Nemelka, chief executive of OneWorldOnline.com.
ISP Channel, a subsidiary of SoftNet Systems, a broadband Internet access company based in San Francisco, is entering into partnerships with smaller cable television operators to provide rural areas with broadband Internet service via cable networks. Customers who sign up with ISP Channel buy or lease cable modems, which are connected to their home cable service. Each customer's modem sends data to the cable operator, where ISP Channel provides a connection via high-speed telephone lines to the Internet. Downloading speeds average 500K, and uploading speeds average about 100K, according to ISP Channel's president, Jonathan Marx.
ISP Channel also provides Web-building services to cable operators who want to build local Web sites. "A lot of other I.S.P.'s have national content, but we provide local," said Larry Brilliant, chief executive of SoftNet Systems, ISP Channel's parent company. "We've found that people really like to do business locally and to know who they're working with."
Mr. Marx said ISP Channel had agreements to reach 2.4 million homes in 22 states. It is available in parts of California, Arizona, Mississippi and Florida. But the service will not benefit rural residents who do not already have cable service.
Even if problems of low-speed access are solved, however, people in smaller communities could still local information hard to find online. But several companies, including Streetmail.com and Koz.com, are working with smaller I.S.P.'s to fix that.
Streetmail.com, based in Waltham, Mass., for example, hires correspondents in small communities around the country and has a central editing group at its headquarters to produce local newsletters, which it then puts out with local I.S.P.'s. A recent newsletter for Cape Lookout, N.C., for example, included an opinion poll about what the local drawbridge's hours of operation should be.
"Many small I.S.P.'s have wanted this kind of thing but aren't organized enough to create editorial content," said Barbara Johnson, chief executive of StreetMail. "We've used the Internet to connect in all kinds of ways around the globe. We're only now turning to connect ourselves to where we live."

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
New Front in the Copyright Wars: Out-of-Print Computer Games

BYLINE: By GREG COSTIKYAN; Greg Costikyan designs games, consults on game industry business issues and writes science fiction and articles about games.

 BODY:
THE phrase "software pirate" conjures up images of foreign sweatshops mass-copying software or hackers swapping files. But the Interactive Digital Software Association is trying to shut down a different type of pirate: people who just want to play out-of-print games.
Publishers don't want to make old games available. The market wants games that push the limits of the processing and graphics capabilities of modern computers; a game designed for the Atari 800 or Apple II just won't sell at CompUSA. 
 But at more than 100 sites on the Internet, you can download old out-of-print games, along with emulators to let you run them -- the games include the original versions of Atari 2600 games like Missile Command and Space Invaders as well as landmark computer games like M.U.L.E. and Balance of Power. These sites call the games abandonware: software for which publishers no longer offer technical support.
Of course, the publishers don't view the games as abandoned. "Copyrights and trademarks of games are corporate assets," Nintendo says on its Web site. "If these vintage titles are available far and wide, it undermines the value of the intellectual property and adversely affects the right owners. Emulator and ROM piracy is competing head-on with Nintendo's current systems and software."(ROM piracy is the copying of game code from the old read-only memory chips into files that can be stored on a computer.) So Nintendo and other companies want abandonware sites to shut down -- they leave enforcement to the software association.
Their position is highly debatable. Gamers don't go out and download games for the original Nintendo Entertainment System instead of buying new games for Nintendo 64. Someone who wants to play an older game is looking for an experience that is different from what is available from a modern game. And by keeping older games alive, abandonware sites sometimes serve the ultimate interests of publishers: a new version of Frogger (first released in 1981) was one of the Top 10 best-selling computer games in 1999. Publishers became interested in re-releasing titles like Frogger precisely because they noticed that people were still playing it. Abandonware helped them identify a new market niche.
Moreover, publishers provide no legal way for gamers to get older games; the market is too small to justify the effort. So gamers feel justified in making vintage games available, despite the legal risks.
Older gamers' enthusiasm for games of their youth is only part of the story. In a speech at the Game Developers Conference in May in San Jose, Calif., Henry Jenkins, director of the comparative media studies program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called electronic gaming one of the "lively arts for the 21st century." He said that just as once-despised arts like jazz and film were now accepted as legitimate, so, too, would games be someday.
If Dr. Jenkins is right, if gaming is ever to be understood as an art form that is worthy of study and has valuable things to offer, critics and academics and gamers must come to appreciate the history and development of the form. That appreciation can be created and sustained only if they have access to the games of the past.
Access to vintage games is important for game designers, too. Just as novelists learn from novels and artists from art, game designers learn technique from the games they play.
Their design repertory is expanded through exposure to games, but far too many game designers are ignorant of games published more than five years ago. That is especially a problem now because the hit-driven, me-too nature of the current market means that there is far less variety in the industry than there was even a few years ago. There is no way a company would pay to produce a game like Balance of Power, a serious simulation of international political dynamics by Chris Crawford; M.U.L.E., a nonviolent economic game by Dani Bunten; or the original SimCity, by Will Wright (all best sellers in their day), because those games don't fit into accepted marketing categories.
"Preserving old computer games isn't about sentimentality or retro trendiness or collectibility," said Richard Carlson, a game developer at Rogue Entertainment, in an e-mail message. "It's about the history of art, storytelling, music, animation, programming, level design and all of the other disciplines involved in making classic game entertainment."
A book printed on acid-free paper will last for centuries. Film stock will last for decades, but even so, many early movies have been lost forever. Game preservation is in worse shape. Hardware and operating systems come and go. If you have a game designed for an Apple II, you will have a hard time figuring out how to run it.
Software is about as ephemeral as you can get, yet preserving it is essential. Illegal abandonware sites are providing a critical service to game designers and scholars and gaming enthusiasts. They do not, however, provide a lasting and satisfactory solution to the problem because they are illegal.
There may be another way. A group called the Electronic Conservancy has periodically mounted a museum exhibition called "Videotopia," which last appeared in 1999 at the Maryland Science Museum.
"Videotopia" consists of 75 old and new arcade game machines, along with historical and background material. The Electronic Conservancy is devoted to preserving and maintaining these machines, and its advisory board consists of some of the most prominent figures in the development of the arcade game industry.
Arcade gaming, however, is now about one-eighth the size of the combined console and computer gaming industries. It has stagnated for more than a decade.
No one is doing anything similar to preserve console and computer games. And doing so through a museum exhibition or physical collection would be pointless; the way to offer these games to the largest possible audience is the way the abandonware movement does it: via the Web, providing emulators to allow people with new computers and consoles to play the original code. Ideally, you would do it one better, however: you would do it legally, with a Web site and with information to help people install and play the games.
Call it Gamemuseum.org. Create it as a nonprofit organization offering software that enables people to play out-of-print games -- with the permission of the owners. Publishers could offer older products at no cost to themselves, and scholars, designers and fans of retro games could gain access.
Even if a publisher developed a new version of an older game, the older version could serve, in a sense, as a demo for the new one. Players of the old version would be very likely to search out and buy the updated, superior version.
Such a project would require financing, of course, but probably not much. The enthusiasm that leads to abandonware sites could be harnessed, providing volunteer labor to build and maintain the online museum.
It would take an energetic person from the nonprofit sector to raise the money and build the organization, of course. But surely the effort would be worthwhile.
Any takers?

HEADLINE: Helping Paterson Get Better Grades in Urban Renewal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
"TREES. I would like to add trees," reads the legend on a simple map of a street in Paterson, N.J., drawn in colored pencil by a freshman high school student, Leon White, who lives on it. Green trees have been swirled onto the black and white street like the rotations of a wand.
Urban solutions can be this simple -- so simple, in fact, that a child can create them. 
 Through an ambitious plan called the City of Learning, Paterson, a city of 170,000, is giving public high school students not only the tools to understand its urban problems, but also the chance to solve them.
Leon White is enrolled at the Metro Paterson Academy for Communications and Technology, or Mpact, a new public school established in September in an empty downtown mall, where open-classroom walls are papered with student projects: urban renewal studies and school construction proposals.
Mpact is a pilot in a program of innovative academies that offer specialized curricula and smaller classes. Started by Manhattan's Center for Innovative Education, they are being tested in other cities. In Paterson, the academies are also being proposed as tools for urban renewal in an economically distressed city with a school performance so poor that the district was taken over by the state in 1991.
Anticipating $500 million to $800 million in state money to build new school facilities, Dr. Edwin Duroy, the state-appointed superintendent of schools, realized that improving schools was meaningless if the struggling city was ignored. His budget represented Paterson's largest potential capital investment. Why not use it to rescue the schools and try rehabilitating the city at the same time? And put students at the center of the equation by teaching them city planning -- at school.
The opportunity demanded vision. Dr. Duroy invited urban designers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with experience in school districts from Berkeley, Calif., to Washington, D.C., to develop a master plan for Paterson's schools and its 25,000 students.
The New American School Design Project, a workshop of graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led by Roy Strickland, an architect, developed a concept called the City of Learning -- an expanding system of academies throughout Paterson that would spark investment in neighborhoods, especially a sorely vacant, turn-of-the-century downtown.
By September, seven academies will be in operation.
In an election year, when the nature of education and the fate of cities are being debated at a national level, Paterson is putting the American high school on Main Street. Mpact is at number 175. At the school, which opened last September with a freshman class of 25, students study college preparatory subjects like mathematics and history in the morning and technology, entrepreneurship and urban planning in the afternoon. It is an extended day, ending at 4 p.m. Visited recently, students were still working at 6.
Posted in the classroom where urban planning is taught is a list of "Existing Conditions" in Paterson, identified by students. They include "railroad tracks," "crackheads," "parking lots," "lost treasures" and "discarded clothing": a stream of consciousness from its younger citizens that runs like the Passaic River and its treacherous falls, through the heart of the city.
"We live here; nobody knows it better than us," Kemesha Pringle, 14, said.
Her classmate, Maurice Moore, 14, said, "Now, we've got a responsibility to give people what they want."
On June 14, the class will present its first proposal to the Board of Education: a plan to replace a faculty parking lot between two schools with an educational park for the community. Their proposals include a food court (the children complained about the cafeteria lunch), a swimming pool (the community asked for it), an arcade for games after school and a tent for reading during the summer -- improvements to school property that a school budget theoretically would pay for.
Javier Mendez, 15, said that his work improving Paterson with planning was important because "it's my home."
In "stepping outside the box," as Dr. Duroy called beyond-the-classroom steps like Mpact and the City of Learning, Paterson hopes to move toward smaller, more personal learning environments, which are now widely acknowledged as improving performance. Paterson hopes smaller classes will combat the dropout rate, which exceeded 15 percent in the 1998-99 school year. The state average was 2.9 percent.
"Many eighth graders choose not to go to the high schools, but to vocational schools," Dr. Duroy said. "Recognizing this, I felt we needed to become competitive. We needed to bring alternative choices to parents."
The academies are being created to compete. Applications to Mpact, which is choosing its second freshman class of 25 now, have doubled because of word-of-mouth between parents.
The anticipated budget is Paterson's share of a 1998 New Jersey Supreme Court decision requiring the state to dedicate billions of dollars to school construction in 28 low-income districts.
The New Jersey Senate will vote today on a proposal to put the Economic Development Agency in charge of school construction, a plan that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman supports, said Gregg Edwards, executive director of the Senate.
"The sponsors of the bill want towns to think creatively about what school money can be used to do, and that's just what Paterson is talking about," he said. "Paterson is looking at the money as part of an economic development strategy. The Economic Development Agency will be more sympathetic to the sort of things Paterson wants to do."
But James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, questioned the ability of schools to act as economic engines in a city.
"I'm trying to think of what they'll achieve beyond bailing out property owners," he said, explaining that putting schools in vacant, downtown buildings was not the invitation to commercial development that placing businesses would be. And, he added, "there's not that much buying power to support retail facilities."
Tom Lonreghan, executive director of the Special Improvement District in Paterson, a coalition of local businesses and property owners, said of the academies' new downtown: "We do feel the schools have had a positive impact -- the added presence of hundreds of students and teachers. But as for bringing in higher-end business like Starbucks, I haven't seen that impact."
Will Paterson take its student planners seriously?
Partnerships with institutions like M.I.T. and Lucent Technologies, which is working with Stephen Cohen, the school district's technology planner, to wire the City of Learning with Internet-access cable for every school in Paterson, has gotten the city's attention.
"That these are ideas being generated by kids doesn't undermine the fact that they are bright ideas that have merit," said William McKoy, president of the Board of Education, who was elected to the Paterson City Council last week on a platform promoting Paterson as the City of Learning.
"They're training and thinking with good institutions," he said. "The collaboration is meaningful to the city -- it's not Monopoly."
At Mpact, the students have already developed their own mass-transit system: rolling desk chairs that speed them from desk to desk, across the plaza of the classroom, to confer on projects. The plan for the laboratory is a Socratic circle; there are no rows or lecterns.
Jean Riesman, an instructor with an M.I.T. master's degree in city planning, is developing Mpact's first year of programs, which include working with the class on converting a municipal parking lot into a civic center and park, with schools, malls and a transportation hub for a proposed light-rail link to New York.
Like any planning session, the discussion, chaired by Ms. Riesman, a woman in black jeans and wide-heeled boots with a salt-and-pepper ponytail, came down to what Paterson had, what it didn't have and what it could have as a place to live.
"Everybody wanted stores," LaToya Matthews, 14, said. "Old Navy, Gap. But then we had to stop and think: That's going to take away business from the stores that are here. We don't want to put them out of business. So there had to be some sort of collaboration."
Marilyn Medina, 15, said that she thought people living downtown would encourage businesses to open.
"You see the building across the street?" she asked, turning to the classroom window behind her. Above an open store, the building was empty. "There's just a bunch of junk in there. We would like to turn the old buildings into apartments, because there are a lot of apartments needed in Paterson, with more living space."
Ruth Melecio, 15, qualified the idea. "Not change the outside, just the inside," she said. "We have some really nice buildings. We want to keep those in Paterson, so it's not like everywhere else."
As a group, the students agreed that there should be recreational facilities and entertainment at the city-center site, which are lacking now.
"Not only for us, but for younger kids growing up, too," Kemesha Pringle said. "We're trying to change things so that they could have a better life or experience different things that aren't here."
Ruth Melecio interviewed her family. "I asked my mom what she thinks would go nicely downtown," Ms. Melecio said. "She said, 'Oh, a movie theater, a bowling alley.' I brought that in, and everyone said, 'Oh yeah, I didn't think about that.' "
With no theater of its own, Paterson moviegoers travel to Passaic and Clifton.
More citizen than city official, Leon White, 14, proposed the obvious.
"All the movie theaters that aren't being used, that are just collecting dust," he said, speaking of several shuttered theaters downtown, "maybe they should try reopening them."
LaToya Matthews added: "When a movie comes out, everybody talks about going that Saturday night. Why can't they go in their own town?" She also advocated a skating rink. "When a D.J. from Paterson wants to throw a party, we have to go all the way to Wayne," she said.
Maurice Moore, 14, made an observation that could help him in an election, if he pursues his participation in the city. "If we had all this stuff that we want," he said, "it would be stuff that would attract tourism. People would come in, spend money and leave."
The adults led the class in appreciative laughter.

HEADLINE: Paul Bartel, Director and Star Of 'Eating Raoul,' Dies at 61

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Paul BartelPaul Bartel, a director, screenwriter and actor whose taste for farce, black humor and social satire was reflected in films like "Eating Raoul," "Death Race 2000" and "Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills," died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 61 and also had a home in Los Angeles.
The cause was not immediately determined, said his father, William, who added that Mr. Bartel had undergone eight hours of surgery two weeks ago for cancer of the liver ducts. 
 Mr. Bartel, whose love affair with movies began in his childhood, last appeared as Osric in the filmmaker Michael Almereyda's new corporate setting of "Hamlet," and at the time of his death was engaged in discussions with a British producing group about a new film and had also been asked to write episodes of a new television series.
"He was interested in theatrics from Day 1," his father said as he traced Mr. Bartel's life from childhood marionettes to theater and film studies and to a long career in directing, writing and acting, particularly in independent films.
Mr. Bartel, in later years a heavyset man with a white beard, achieved his greatest acclaim in 1982, when his "Eating Raoul" was chosen for the 20th New York Film Festival.
"One has to be careful not to overstate the case when praising 'Eating Raoul,' " Vincent Canby wrote in his review in The New York Times. "One mustn't blunt its pleasures by calling it a laff riot. It is full of smiles, punctuated here and there by marvelously unseemly guffaws, but most of the time it works its little wonders quietly. The comic style is purposely flat, plain and ordinary, like a piece of Pop art."
Mr. Bartel was not only the director and co-writer of "Eating Raoul." He was also its co-star, joining Mary Woronov in their portrayal of a married couple, Paul and Mary Bland, who like nice things, share a belief that sex is dirty and have the misfortune to live in a Los Angeles apartment house inhabited mostly by swingers. The Blands also share a dream. In time, the prissy Paul, who fancies himself a wine connoisseur, will quit his job in a liquor store, and the sexually charged Mary will leave her job as a hospital dietitian and they will open their own restaurant in the country.
One day when a drunk swinger, looking for an orgy in the building, invades their apartment and attempts to rape Mary, Paul hits him over the head with a cast iron skillet and kills him. The Blands, who have fallen on hard economic times, empty his wallet and dispose of his body.
They quickly realize they have found a path to fortune: advertise in the underground press, lure swingers to their apartment, dispatch them with the skillet, rob them and toss the bodies in the garbage compactor, all with a clear conscience.
As Paul sees it, the victims are "horrible, sex-crazed perverts that nobody will miss anyway." But life grows complicated when Raoul, a young Chicano locksmith with a passion for Mary, attempts to share in their scheme.
As Mr. Bartel recalled afterward, "I was sitting on the terrace of the Carlton Hotel in Cannes, sipping a $7 coffee," when Richard Roud, then the director of the New York Film Festival and chairman of its program committee, "came strolling down the Croisette, casually glanced in my direction and turned thumbs up."
Mr. Roud was signaling that Mr. Bartel's $500,000 black comedy had been chosen for the festival, where it was to charm the critics and win their praise. "I felt enormous elation and relief." Mr. Bartel said.
"Eating Raoul" was not his first film at the festival. "The Secret Cinema," a 30-minute film about a New York secretary for whom everybody's paranoid fantasy becomes a reality, was shown in 1967. Mr. Canby called it "a very funny, completely lunatic experience."
Among the films Mr. Bartel directed -- and sometimes acted in or co-wrote -- were "Cannonball" (1976), "Not for Publication" (1984) and "Lust in the Dust" (1985). As an actor he appeared in everything from "Eat My Dust" (1976) and "Rock 'n' Roll High School" (1979) to "White Dog" (1982), "Heart Like a Wheel" (1983), "National Lampoon's European Vacation" (1985), "Shelf Life" (1993), "The Usual Suspects" (1995) and "Basquiat" (1996).
Mr. Bartel, the eldest of the two sons and two daughters of William and Jesse Bartel, who died five weeks ago, was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Manhattan and Montclair, N.J. William Bartel said Paul was 4 or 5 when "he started out with a marionette show, strung them and built himself a little stage. He really didn't worry too much about learning to articulate the marionettes, but he was great on the dialogue."
By the time he was a student at Montclair High School, he had persuaded his father to buy him a 16-millimeter German-made motion picture camera and, in the words of his father, "proceeded to con" a teacher into allowing him to devote a semester to making an animated cartoon, doing the main drawings himself and using the class to do the "in-betweens," which required 3,000 cels, the transparent sheets on which the original drawings are traced or transferred.
Mr. Bartel, who was fluent in French and Italian, studied theater and film at U.C.L.A. and won a Fulbright scholarship that took him to Rome and the Cinecitta studio. He fulfilled his military service by talking his way into the Army Signal Corps Pictorial Center in Long Island City and later made films for the United States Information Agency. By the early 1970's, he was making films in Hollywood.
Besides his father, of Delray Beach, Fla., and Bay Head, N.J., he is survived by two sisters, Lucy Kizirian of Tallahassee, Fla., and Wendy Bartel of Bay Head, N.J., and a brother, Peter of Floyd, Va.,

HEADLINE: Harry J. Volk, 94, a Bank Executive Known for Innovations

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Harry J. Volk, a finance executive whose impact was felt as much in the world of philanthropy as in business, died at his Los Angeles home on Friday, according to his son Robert. He was 94.
During a financial career that spanned more than three decades, he showed little patience for the idea that the status quo was right just because it was the status quo. 
 As a vice president of the Prudential Insurance Company of America in the mid-1940's, for example, he helped mastermind the company's huge decentralization program. The revamping took him to Los Angeles in 1947, where he opened Prudential's first regional home office. While he was there, he also introduced the concept of family life insurance plans.
Later, as chairman of the Union Bank of California -- a job he was recruited from Prudential to fill in 1957 -- he helped bring about new offerings like daily compounding of interest and banking by mail, which were radical for the time. It was Mr. Volk who spotted the loophole in federal laws that made it possible for banks to form holding companies, and in 1967 he established the country's first one-bank holding company, Union Bancorp Inc.
While other banks were trying to broaden their customer base, Mr. Volk successfully steered Union through the recession of the 1970's by keeping it focused on lending to small and medium-size businesses. And, at a time when bankers generally considered marketing beneath them, Mr. Volk marketed Union aggressively to those target customers.
It was a lesson that many of his employees spread to other banks. "Most bankers had the idea, you sit there and customers come in and you sort of judge them," Carl E. Reichardt, a former Union Bank executive who was chairman of Wells Fargo from 1983 through 1994, said in 1989. "Harry said that was all wrong -- that you had to go out and drag them in."
Not all of Mr. Volk's innovations served Union well. He took Union into insurance and mortgage banking, only to have California regulators insist that it pull out of those enterprises in 1975. The bank never quite regained its vibrant growth. Many of its higher-level executives departed, and many of the bank's business customers followed them to their new employers. Union Bank was taken over by Standard Chartered Bank Ltd. of London in 1979. Mr. Volk retired a year later.
Mr. Volk never confined his taste for innovation and activism to the financial world. If it had anything to do with California, it interested him. He was an active board member of several California companies, including Western Air Lines, Southern California Gas and Times Mirror. He was also a trustee of the California Institute of Technology, a board member of the Los Angeles branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and president of the Los Angeles Clearing House Association.
He also plunged into the Los Angeles philanthropic world. He headed a committee that looked into disputes between the United Way and some of its recipient charities. Soon after, he created a system that allowed employers to funnel payroll deductions to charities designated by individual employees. The system is now widely used, and, by giving donors more of a say in where their contributions went, was a linchpin of the United Way's revamped methods for collecting and distributing money.
Mr. Volk was a prime mover in rebuilding Los Angeles's historic Bunker Hill. And he helped found many cultural institutions, including the Music Center (now the Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County) and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. While still at Union Bank, he was a board member of the Southern California Symphony Association and the Boys Club Foundation.
After he retired from the bank in 1980 he became head of the Weingart Foundation, a California charitable organization with $155 million in assets. By the time Mr. Volk retired from the foundation in 1993, its assets had plumped up to more than $500 million.
In 1987, when Union Bank became one of the first banks in the country to offer child care as an employee benefit, it named its day care center the Volk Center.
Mr. Volk's love of all things Californian notwithstanding, he hailed from the opposite coast. He was born in Trenton, and earned degrees in business and law from Rutgers University.
Mr. Volk's first wife, Marion, whom he married in 1931, died in 1972. He is survived by his second wife, the actress Marjorie Lord; two sons from his first marriage, Robert, of Los Angeles, and Richard, of San Francisco; 2 stepchildren; 9 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.

MIDDLE EAST
 
PALESTINIANS: CLASHES CONTINUE -- Sporadic clashes between young Palestinians and Israeli troops continued in the West Bank and near Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who threw stones and firebombs; they also reported that Israeli posts had been fired upon and that they responded with live fire. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
ISRAEL: TYING UP BARAK -- Two opposition bills that could tie Prime Minister Ehud Barak's hands in negotiations with the Palestinians passed preliminary votes, although both require three more readings to become law. They would require absolute majority approval of the Parliament to change the municipal boundaries of Jerualem and to allow the right of return of Palestinian refugees to Israel. Deborah Sontag (NYT) 

ISRAEL: UNCERTAIN WELCOME -- A Palestinian legislator said eggs were thrown at President Costas Stephanopoulos of Greece as he toured the walled Old City, to protest his position on Jerusalem. Greek and Israeli officials, however, adamantly denied the claim. "Not a single egg was thrown at the Greek president," said an indignant spokesman for the Israeli police. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
IRAN: JAILED FOR ATTACK -- A revolutionary court handed down a 15-year jail sentence to Said Asghar, a chemistry student accused of shooting a leading Iranian reformer, Said Hajarian, the official news agency reported. Four other defendants were sentenced to between 3 and 10 years for their role in the attack on Mr. Hajarian, who was in a coma for several days after the shooting. Three others were acquitted. (Agence France-Presse)
 
EUROPE
 
AUSTRIA: FORCED-LABOR ACCORD -- After a two-day conference attended by delegates from the United States, Austria and six eastern European countries, Austria agreed in principle to a $390 million compensation fund for Nazi-era forced laborers. The fund is to be distributed among 150,000 survivors, most in eastern Europe. A meeting on the "legal closure" of the accord will be held in Washington on May 30. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
YUGOSLAVIA: CLEARING THE DANUBE -- A plan to clear bomb wreckage that has blocked the Danube for more than a year has finally been agreed upon. The president of the Danube Commission in Budapest told Reuters that work on a $21 million plan is scheduled to begin in about five months. Three bridges in Novi Sad, Serbia, were bombed by NATO as part of the campaign to end the expulsion of Albanians from Kosovo. The wreckage of one bridge, the Varazdin, has blocked barge traffic ever since. Donald G. McNeil Jr. (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: NUCLEAR PACT APPROVED -- The upper house of Parliament voted after a secret debate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban treaty, which the lower house ratified last month. While Russia has not conducted a nuclear test since 1990, it will officially forswear the tests only after the United States and a handful of other nuclear powers, including China, Pakistan and India, also approve it. The United States Senate rejected the treaty last year. Michael Wines (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: ALBERTA WARNED -- Health Minister Alan Rock has threatened to withhold health funding from Alberta after it approved a law to allow overnight stays in private clinics, which Canadians fear might undercut the national health service monopoly. Mr. Rock also said he would double the budget for inspectors to check for violations of the Canada Health Act, which created the state monopoly for much health care. James Brooke (NYT)
 
COLOMBIA: DOUBTS ON BOMB -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia may be innocent of the "necklace bomb" killing that prompted the government to cancel a key meeting with them, and overall peace talks have not been interrupted, a top government official said. Attorney General Alfonso Gomez said another group may have been responsible for strapping a bomb to the neck of a woman after raiding her country estate, contradicting President Andres Pastrana's certainty in blaming the rebels. (Agence France-Presse)
 
ASIA
 
SRI LANKA: BLAST KILLS 23 -- At least 23 people were killed by a bomb blast near a Buddhist temple in the eastern town of Batticola. The government blamed the Tamil Tigers for the attack, which occurred as the birth of the Buddha was being celebrated. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
JAPAN: PREMIER'S APOLOGY -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori made a "heartfelt apology" for calling Japan a "divine country with an emperor at its core." Mr. Mori's comments, to a Shinto religious group, drew widespread criticism for violating the spirit of the postwar Constitution guaranteeing a secular state. Shinto was the official religion of wartime Japan, and the emperor was regarded as a deity. Howard W. French (NYT)
 
INDONESIA: NEW CLASHES -- At least 23 people were killed in new violence between Muslims and Christians in Ambon, in the Maluku islands, residents said. Twenty-one died when security forces opened fire to try to separate the warring mobs, they said. (Agence France-Presse)
 
AFRICA
 
ZAMBIA: KAUNDA BOWS OUT -- Kenneth D. Kaunda, left, the country's founding president, has handed over the leadership of the United National Independence Party, the main opposition party, to the former governor of the central bank, Francis Nkhoma, ending a political career that spanned more than four decades. Mr. Nkhoma, a 63-year old economist, beat eight other candidates. (Reuters)
 
ZIMBABWE: OPPOSITION ACTS -- The Movement for Democratic Change said it would seek a court order to shift the deadline for nominating candidates for the June 24-25 election, which could delay the vote. The party said the government broke the law by setting nomination and poll dates before district boundaries were drawn. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: THE CHINA TRADE WRANGLE: THE SILICON LOBBY;
High-Tech Companies Making Their First Big Push in Congress on a Trade Bill

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Next week's Congressional vote on whether to expand trade and economic ties with China has high stakes for Beijing and the Clinton administration, but it is also a test of the political clout of the technology industry.
For the first time, technology companies are playing a leading role in Washington lobbying over a geopolitical issue. For several months, executives from Silicon Valley and other technology centers have been roaming the halls of Congress, lobbying for what they say will be billions of dollars of expanded exports to China as well as new jobs for Americans. 
 Whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations is going to be "the most important vote of this decade," said David McCurdy, a former Democratic member of Congress who is the president of Electronic Industries Alliance, a trade association. "The industry will support people who support high tech."
Nearly a dozen chief executives made the rounds again today. And a few companies have gone a step further, running radio and television advertisements and conducting grass-roots campaigns to nudge thousands of their employees to write letters and send electronic messages to lawmakers.
Although they are relative novices in the political arena, technology concerns are using big business and organized labor as models for how to press undecided members of Congress on the China bill. Their involvement is in contrast to the detachment they showed three years ago, when Congress decided not to give President Clinton authority to negotiate trade deals that Congress can accept or reject, but not amend.
Previously, high-tech companies lobbied most visibly on narrower issues, including Internet privacy, data scrambling and immigration. Microsoft has become a player in Washington's arena of money and politics, in part to protect its interests in the antitrust battle.
In the past, few high-tech companies had large lobbying presences in Washington. This time around, the industry has unleashed scores of lobbyists and has banded together in powerful coalitions.
At the same time, their trade associations are using the kind of hardball tactics, including advertising, that have served other industries well in other lobbying wars, working with the United States Chamber of Commerce, the agriculture sector and companies like Boeing, all experienced in past fights involving trade with China.
Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the help from high-tech companies. "They've thrown themselves into this battle in a strong and aggressive way, and I think they are picking up the game very quickly," he said.
Robert A. Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, an umbrella group of 300 diverse companies, said the China issue had led to "a massive energizing of the technology field." Their effort, he said, has been especially helpful in the campaign to sway Democrats, whose party has close ties to organized labor.
These new lobbyists have been effective, lawmakers and others say. By emphasizing the power of the Internet, lobbyists have been selling a message that goes beyond their bottom line, stressing that the products they would export would spread democracy in China.
And unlike organized labor and big corporations, technology companies have no firm loyalties and are considered up for grabs by both parties. Their popularity has translated into easy access in Congress.
Still, the lobbying of high-tech executives pales next to organized labor's whirlwind approach and its grass-roots army. And the companies lag behind their more experienced big business allies.
"They are catching up," said Representative David Dreier, a California Republican and a technology booster. "But anyone juxtaposed to the organization that labor has put together, it's tough."
Intel Corporation has sent its chairman, Andy Grove, and Craig R. Barrett, chief executive, to the lobbying in Congress. The company has also run radio and newspaper ads and set up a grass-roots campaign through the company Web site. Within 48 hours, 5,000 of its employees sent letters to their lawmakers.
Motorola has also plunged money into the battle, running television advertisements.
Representative Rush D.Holt, a Democrat, has a host of high-tech companies in his district in central New Jersey, and has been courted by the industry, in part because he is a scientist. He spent one evening taking a technology tour of a New Jersey plant, where he met with executives from Sony, Intel and Hewlett-Packard.
Mr. Holt, who is facing a tough re-election battle, remains unconvinced that more trade with China is the cure-all that proponents make it out to be. "It's as if trade is the most important thing," he said. "And I don't think Americans necessarily think so."

The Biggest Vote

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The most far-reaching vote any representative will cast this year will take place next week. It will be on the bill to permanently guarantee that Congress will have no economic leverage to restrain China's internal repression of dissidents or external aggression against Taiwan.
Bill Clinton, architect of the discredited "strategic partnership" with Beijing, is lobbying for H.R. 4444 as part of his legacy thing. His strange bedfellow is the G.O.P. leadership, fairly slavering at the prospect of heavy contributions from U.S. companies that want to profit from building up China's industrial and electronic strength. 
 Clinton has been purchasing Democratic votes one by one. The latest convert to pulling the U.S. teeth is Charles Rangel of New York, who was seduced by last week's legislation to benefit African workers at the expense of Chinese laborers in sweatshops at slave wages. He is the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means, which yesterday voted to send the any-behavior-goes bill to the House floor.
The president's tactics include frightening Americans with "dangerous confrontation and constant insecurity" from angry China if his appeasement is not passed.
He also divides American farmers from workers with his mantra, "exports mean jobs." Of course they do; in the past decade, our trade deficit with China has ballooned from $7 billion to $70 billion. That means China's exports to the U.S. have created hundreds of thousands of jobs -- in China. Clinton's trade deficit is certainly not creating net jobs for Americans.
His trade negotiator, Charlene Barshefsky, has become increasingly shrill, turning truth on its head this week by telling Lally Weymouth of The Washington Post that "organized labor, human rights advocates and some environmentalists have aligned themselves with the Chinese army and hard-liners in Beijing who do not want accession for China."
Not to be outdone in twisting the truth and kowtowing to Communists, Republican investors and the Asia establishment assure us that only by abandoning yearly review of China's rights abuses and diplomatic conduct can we encourage democracy there.
I confess to writing speeches for Richard Nixon assuring conservatives that trade with China would lead to the evolution of democratic principles in Beijing. But we've been trading for 30 years now, financing its military-industrial base, enabling it to buy M-11 missiles from the Russians and advanced computer technology from us.
Has our strengthening of their regime brought political freedom? Ask the Falun Gong, jailed by the thousands for daring to organize; ask the Tibetans, their ancient culture destroyed and nation colonized; ask the Taiwanese, who face an escalation of the military threat against them after the U.S. Congress spikes its cannon of economic retaliation.
Before Nixon died, I asked him -- on the record -- if perhaps we had gone a bit overboard on selling the American public on the political benefits of increased trade. That old realist, who had played the China card to exploit the split in the Communist world, replied with some sadness that he was not as hopeful as he had once been: "We may have created a Frankenstein."
(I was on the verge of correcting him that Dr. Frankenstein was the creator, and that he meant "Frankenstein's monster," but I bit my tongue.)
To provide a face-saver for Democrats uncomfortable with forever removing Scoop Jackson's economic pressure, Clinton's bipartisan allies have cooked up a toothless substitute: a committee to cluck-cluck loudly when China cracks down and acts up. We already have a State Department annual report that does that, to no effect on a China whose transgressions have always been waived.
Human rights advocates know the smart money in Washington is betting on the appeasers. Our only hope is that the undecideds in Congress consider that unemployment in their districts will not always be under 4 percent, and that when recession or aggression bites, voters will not forget who threw away economic restraints on China.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A campaign aims to show that Buffalo isn't just a snowy city.

BYLINE: By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
WITH its shrinking population, declining industrial base and notoriously cold, snowy winters, Buffalo has had its share of image problems for years. But local officials and civic boosters insist that the city and its environs do not deserve their unfortunate reputation. And today, they are announcing a major promotional campaign aimed at proving that the climate upstate is just fine, for people and for businesses, too.
The campaign is sponsored by the Buffalo Niagara Enterprise, a not-for-profit economic development marketing consortium founded last year to encourage businesses to invest in an area comprising the eight westernmost counties of New York as well as the Niagara peninsula of southern Ontario. Nearly 70 participants, including local municipalities and private businesses like Key Bank, HSBC Bank, the Buffalo Bills and Moog Inc., an upstate manufacturer of motion-control components, have joined, as has one Canadian participant, the Ontario-based Canadian Niagara Power Company Ltd. 
 As a result of their contributions, the money needed for the first year -- about $5 million -- is already in hand, according to Tom Kucharski, the president and chief executive of Buffalo Niagara. That is part of a total of $27 million committed by Buffalo Niagara's members, three-quarters of it from private companies, according to Ted M. Levine, chairman of Development Counsellors International, the public relations firm representing Buffalo Niagara.
That is a large amount to spend on marketing by a community development organization seeking to create jobs. "I cannot think of another community -- especially a moderately sized one -- that has even come close to raising that kind of sum," said Mark Waterhouse, an economic development consultant who was formerly chairman of the American Economic Development Council, an organization for economic development professionals. With a goal of 50,000 new jobs and $1 billion in new investment over the next five years, it is also one of the most ambitious development plans put forward in recent years, he said.
"The challenge is to put forward in a focused way all that we have to offer," said Mr. Kucharski, who came to Buffalo Niagara from the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation in eastern Pennsylvania, where his efforts as president helped attract 18,000 jobs over four years. But the job is bigger in Buffalo-Niagara, he said, not only because of the greater size of the region -- 2.2 million residents as opposed to Lehigh Valley's 600,000 -- but also because of the highly negative feelings about the area held by strangers and natives alike.
Indeed, not only do people in general have a "terrible image of the Buffalo-Niagara region," so do people living in and around the city, many of whom have "incredibly low self-esteem," said Doug Bean, a managing partner at Eric Mower & Associates, the six-office agency based in Syracuse whose Buffalo team is handling the Buffalo-Niagara account. In addition to aiming at businesses outside the region, he has made "internal" marketing a priority.
"If people who live here are down on the area, especially service and hospitality workers, that can have a big impact on visitors who interact with them," he said. "So we're going to use this campaign to re-educate our own constituency as well as anything else we do."
Regardless of the recipient, the message Buffalo Niagara will be delivering will be the same, a simple one that tracks the campaign's three-word slogan: "available. productive. people."
Print ads and broadcast spots will feature residents of the area extolling local advantages, like the high concentration of college students, affordable housing, low office rents, and the fact that the work force in the area is ranked ninth in the country in production output per wage dollar spent. Not to mention, "summers that are just beautiful" and winters that are "not nearly as snowy as people think," according to Mr. Kucharski ("More sun than Atlanta, less rain than Raleigh," say some of the ads).
The campaign will also be aimed at specific industries. Those include information technology, for which there is already considerable infrastructure, according to Mr. Kucharski; advanced medical technology, which is already strong in the region, and call centers and other support services for financial institutions or insurance companies.
Media buying is to begin later this month, Mr. Bean said, with the rollout of the campaign set for the fall. He anticipates devoting approximately 85 percent of the $5 million or so first-year budget to national advertising on cable television aimed at business viewers on outlets like CNN and CNBC, as well as print ads in The Wall Street Journal and sponsorship announcements on National Public Radio. The remaining 15 percent will go to local television and radio commercials and to billboard, newspaper and transit advertising in metropolitan Buffalo. There is also a Web site: www.buffaloniagara.org.
The mix sounds right to Mr. Waterhouse, the consultant. "With this plan, Buffalo has a chance to become another renaissance city," he said.

HEADLINE: THE CHINA TRADE WRANGLE: THE CLINTON SPEECH;
Seeing Threats Beyond Arms, President Urges Cooperation

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., May 17

 BODY:
Embracing a strikingly broad concept of national security, President Clinton told the graduating class of the United States Coast Guard Academy today that the world is becoming more dangerous with new threats from disease, terrorism and even global warming.
"The central reality of our time is that the advent of globalization and the revolution in information technology have magnified both the creative and destructive potential of every individual, tribe and nation on our planet," he told the audience of 5,000, which included 189 graduating cadets, a third of them women. 
 Mr. Clinton also sought to link his message about America's long-term security with the imminent political question of extending trade preferences to China, saying Congress should realize that the vote on the issue next week will have deep implications for America's security.
"One of the biggest question marks of the 21st century is the path China will take," he said. "Will China emerge as a partner or an adversary? Will it be a society that is opening to the world and liberating to its people or controlling of its people and lashing out at the world?"
If Congress votes to provide China with permanent normal trade relations, Mr. Clinton said, "it will not guarantee that China will take the right course." But, he added, "I believe a 'no' vote invites a future of dangerous confrontation and constant insecurity."
The kind of global cooperation required in the future, the president said, was in evidence when the authorities foiled a plan by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile living in Afghanistan, to smuggle explosive materials into the United States before the New Year. Links between Mr. bin Laden's associates and terrorist plots uncovered in Jordan and at the United States-Canadian border have been widely reported, but the president's comments today were his most extensive on the subject.
Presidents have used commencement speeches before the service academies to provide their visions of the future, and Mr. Clinton, in his final such address, offered a view that, while promising, sees menace on many fronts.
On a crisp New England day with the Thames River sparkling at his back, Mr. Clinton said that the larger issue for leaders is to maintain a balanced security strategy, one with diplomatic and economic elements as well as military ones.
"Globalization is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and peoples," he said. "The very openness of our borders and technology, however, also makes us vulnerable in new ways."
While the Internet and developments like the growth of democracy are heartening, "we must understand the other side of the coin as well," he said. "The same technological advances are making the tools of destruction deadlier, cheaper and more available, making us more vulnerable to problems that arise half a world away, to terror, to ethnic, racial and religious conflicts, to weapons of mass destruction, drug trafficking and other organized crime."
In cataloging some of the issues that he said should become part of any new discussions of national security, Mr. Clinton also touched on part of the presidential debate.
Democrats have sought to portray Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican candidate, as mired in a narrow military vision of national security no longer appropriate in a post-cold-war world. That was a theme of an address delivered last month by Vice President Gore, the presumed Democratic nominee.
Thus, Mr. Clinton's long remarks about global warming were a gesture of support for Mr. Gore, whose "new security agenda" includes global warming, and who has been criticized by Republicans who say that scientists disagree about how great a threat it is.
But Mr. Clinton said that unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut, "most scientists are convinced that storms and droughts will intensify as the globe continues to warm. Crop patterns will be disrupted, food supplies will be affected, and the seas will rise so high they will swallow islands and coastal areas."
He said that the revolution in miniaturization in commonplace items like telephones will eventually also mean that biological, chemical and even nuclear weapons will be able to be put in packages small enough to transport easily.
Mr. Clinton announced $300 million in new money to help law enforcement agencies deal with new threats. Mr. Clinton disparaged critics who objected to the White House's listing the global spread of AIDS as a national security threat. Diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, he said, "can ruin economies and threaten the very survival of nations and societies."
Africa now has 70 percent of the world's AIDS cases, and some employers, he said, now hire two people for each job vacancy, assuming one is going to die from the disease.
"With malaria," the president said, "people now discuss in common parlance, 'airport malaria,' something people can get in any international airport in any country in the world because we're all traveling around and bumping into people from other countries."

HEADLINE: Gore Attacks Bush Proposal As a Danger To Pensioners

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., May 17

 BODY:
Stepping up his criticism of Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to let taxpayers invest some of their Social Security taxes, Vice President Al Gore told a convention of older Americans today that the plan could jeopardize the retirement benefits even of current recipients.
Injecting a sense of urgency into his dire warnings about Mr. Bush's plan, Mr. Gore argued that the proposal could have an almost immediate and negative impact by destabilizing the Social Security system, weakening the economy and reducing government resources for other programs, including Medicare. 
 "You shouldn't be asked to play stock market roulette with your retirement savings in the Social Security program," Mr. Gore told several thousand people at a convention of AARP, an organization of people 50 and older. "You shouldn't be left without retirement security if you do. And you should not have to foot the bill for others who do play and happen to lose, because some people would lose. The Bush plan raises all of these possibilities."
Mr. Gore also seized on remarks by Mr. Bush on Tuesday, when the Republican governor of Texas suggested that his proposal might be just a first step toward allowing workers to invest most or all of their payroll taxes.
"What if people make poor choices?" asked Mr. Gore, the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee. "What if the stock market dips right before an individual retires? Are individuals stuck with nothing?"
Saying that Mr. Bush has not ruled out the possibility of future benefit cuts, Mr. Gore added, "I don't think your Social Security should be up for grabs, and under my plan, it won't be."
Though Mr. Bush has not filled in many details of his proposal, its broad outline calls for allowing workers to invest in the markets part of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that finances Social Security benefits.
The governor argues that allowing people to take advantage of Wall Street's historically strong returns could reduce the cost of retirement benefits and help extend the solvency of the system. Under current projections, Social Security will become insolvent by 2037, as more baby boomers retire.
Mr. Gore contends that the best way to strengthen the system is to use the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt, and then devote the interest savings to the system. The plan, he says, would not only prolong Social Security's solvency until 2054, but also keep interest rates down and sustain the economic boom.
Mr. Bush argues that the Gore proposal, by failing to address Social Security's underlying problems, would inevitably lead to tax increases or benefit cuts to close future shortfalls in the system.
Mr. Gore has sought to turn the Social Security debate into a broader issue of leadership style, asserting that Mr. Bush's "irresponsible" plan demonstrates that he would be an incompetent steward of the economy.
Mr. Bush has also tried to make the debate as much about character as about policy, arguing that Mr. Gore has shown himself to lack credibility, consistency and vision on this and other issues.
The Bush campaign hammered at that theme again today, releasing material from a White House Web site in which Mr. Gore is said to have supported a proposal last year by the Clinton administration to invest some Social Security money "to achieve higher returns."
"Al Gore proposed allowing the federal government to invest in the stock market to save Social Security and now he's denying it," said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign.
"Whether the issue is abortion, gun control, medical marijuana and now Social Security, Al Gore has a history of changing his position for political gain. That's why he has a problem with credibility."
Mr. Gore's aides contend that the administration's proposal involved less risk than Mr. Bush's. And Mr. Gore himself says he grew wary of the plan after hearing debate on it.
John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for AARP, said the organization, which represents 34 million people, had not taken a position on either candidate's plan. But he said AARP would almost certainly oppose any proposal that called for allowing workers to invest all of their payroll taxes.
"What privatization means to me is that the risk is shifted entirely on to the individual instead of being shared broadly," Mr. Rother said. "The whole point of Social Security is that it be something you can count on, where you are not at risk."

HEADLINE: In Bush's Words: 'Join Together in Making China a Normal Trading Partner'

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: EVERETT, Wash., May 17

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from prepared remarks by Governor George W. Bush of Texas today before Boeing workers, as provided by the Bush campaign.
From the start of this campaign, I have defined some sharp disagreements with the Clinton-Gore administration. But today I want to address an important area of agreement. A pressing question now confronts the Congress, and it will not wait until the next president takes office. 
 The issue is whether to extend normal trade relations to China on a permanent basis. This vote is one step in the process of drawing China into the world trading system. China is on the verge of joining the 136 members of the World Trade Organization. Congress must now decide whether the U.S. will gain the benefits of China's more open economy.
The stakes are high, on all sides. For businesses, workers and farmers across our country, it will mean much lower trade barriers and enormous opportunities for U.S. exports. For the people of East Asia, it will affect their relations with the region's major power. For the people of China, it holds out the hope of more open contact with the world of freedom. In short, this will be among the most serious decisions our government will make this year.
Last year, when I laid out my vision of a distinctly American internationalism, I said that we must see China clearly, not through the filters of posturing and partisanship. And today I am acting on that principle. I am here to urge all members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, to join together in making China a normal trading partner of the United States.
I differ with the president and vice president on many issues regarding China and trade. They place their confidence in the Chinese regime as a "strategic partner" of the United States. I know they are a competitor. They have been inconsistent on Taiwan; I will be clear. They failed to obtain "fast track" trade negotiating authority. I will fight for it. They mishandled the global trade negotiations right here in Seattle. I will make expanding trade a consistent priority of my administration.
Today, however, all of us who believe in a more open China -- in advancing the rule of law and trade -- must work together. This is not a Republican or Democratic concern. It is an American concern. This trade agreement is the work of 13 years and three administrations. We cannot let that work be undone.
Let me explain why. There are three compelling reasons to support this agreement -- freedom, security and economics.
First, trade with China will promote freedom. Freedom is not easily contained. Once a measure of economic freedom is permitted, a measure of political freedom will follow. China today is not a free society. At home, toward its own people, it can be ruthless. Abroad, toward its neighbors, it can be reckless.
When I am president, China will know that America's values are always part of America's agenda. Our advocacy of human freedom is not a formality of diplomacy. It is a fundamental commitment of our country. It is the source of our confidence that Communism, in every form, has seen its day.
I view free trade as an important ally in what Ronald Reagan called "a forward strategy for freedom." The case for trade is not just monetary, but moral, not just a matter of commerce, but a matter of conviction. Economic freedom creates habits of liberty. And habits of liberty create expectations of democracy. There are no guarantees, but there are good examples, from Chile to Taiwan. Trade freely with China, and time is on our side. . . .
Simply put: China is most free where it is most in contact with the world economy.
Second, trade with China serves our own national interest, as well as the security interests of China's neighbors. China is not our "strategic partner." But neither is it our enemy.
As I've said before, China is a competitor, to be faced without ill will and without illusions. When I am president, China will have no doubts about our power and purpose in the region, about our strong commitment to democratic allies throughout Asia. But this is accomplished by confident diplomacy, strong alliances and the military might to back them up. It is not accomplished by hindering free trade or seeking to isolate China. . . .
When both China and Taiwan are members of the W.T.O., both will need to apply global rules to their trade, including trade with one another, and the prospects for cross-straits relations should improve.
Third, trade with China serves the economic interests of America. . . .
The doors will open to providers of U.S. services -- the import-export trade, banking, insurance, telecommunications, accounting, computers, motion pictures and more. China will also adhere to W.T.O. rules on intellectual property rights and investments. And if Europe negotiates a better deal in these or any other areas, by the terms of the agreement we will get the same treatment. . . .
It is worth making one more point, a very practical one: Defeat of this bill won't even keep China out of the W.T.O., since President Clinton has already agreed to its entry. A "no" vote would only prevent the U.S. from enjoying the benefits of China's market opening -- even as foreign rivals to American firms do enjoy those benefits.
After last year's confusion in Seattle, a leader in the protectionist camp confidently declared that by excluding China from the W.T.O. the opponents hoped -- as he put it -- "to deliver the last blow" against our system of free trade. Neither the United States nor the world can afford such a setback. I believe that trade serves the deepest interests of our country and advances the hopes of the Chinese people for a freer society. Our greatest export is not food or movies or even airplanes. Our greatest export is freedom. The people of China stand ready to receive it. The demand has never been greater.

Prices of Treasuries Decline As Investors Assess Fed Move

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday as the full scope of the Federal Reserve's half-point interest rate increase and hawkish statement on inflation risks began to sink in for many investors.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32, to 100 31/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 6.18 percent from 6.10 percent on Tuesday. The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 15/32, to 100 4/32. Its yield rose to 6.48 percent from 6.42 percent the day before. 
 Earlier in the trading session, the expected announcement of a government buyback of up to $2 billion in old bonds today, failed to lift the prices of securities as investors fixated on a tighter credit environment and the prospect of higher rates to come. The Federal Open Market Committee's raising of short-term rates had been fully anticipated by the financial markets, despite the benign Consumer Price Index report for April.
"Indeed," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management, "torrid economic growth in the midst of an incredibly tight labor market provides the ideal breeding ground for a pickup in inflation, and with evidence of rising prices and wages beginning to mount, the Fed clearly felt that a stepped-up pre-emptive strike was necessary."
Noting that the risks are still weighted toward heightened inflation pressures in the near future, Mr. Fine said that the Fed stated in stronger-than-usual fashion that increases in demand had continued to be in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven gains in potential supply, thereby exerting continued pressure on resources. The concern is, he said, that this disparity will continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's performance.
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns, said that "Fed uncertainty over how soon consumer spending might slow might cause the Fed to return to smaller rate hikes at the remaining F.O.M.C. meetings this summer -- June 28 and Aug. 22."
"This will, of course, depend on incoming data," Ms. Cooper said, adding that the following meeting on Oct. 3 will be seen as too close to the election to interfere in the marketplace. The Fed will make an effort to get all of the rate increases out of the way before then, she said.
The Treasury announced yesterday that it was selling $10 billion of two-year notes next Wednesday to pay down $15.94 billion on the federal debt. In when-issued trading ahead of auction, the note was being offered at a price to yield 6.87 percent.

HEADLINE: Weak Demand Prompts Ford To Produce FewerExcursions

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 17

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that it would produce fewer Ford Excursion sport utility vehicles during the 2001 model year, but attributed the cutback to weak consumer demand for the vehicle rather than the company's concerns about its safety and environmental problems.
George Pipas, a Ford spokesman, said that the automaker would cut its production rate for the Excursion to 52,000 a year this summer, from 69,000 a year now. By building 17,000 fewer Excursions, Ford will be able to build 35,000 more Ford Super Duty pickup trucks, which are produced on the same assembly line in Louisville, Ky., he said. 
 Ford had only a 45-day supply of Super Duty pickups at the end of April, compared with a 100-day backlog of Excursions. Automakers like to have a 60-day supply of vehicles on dealership lots and in transit to dealerships at any given time, so that each dealer can offer a selection of vehicles in different colors and with different equipment.
"We're not a company that our No. 1 goal is to shove sport utilities down the throats of consumers" by offering deep discounts, Mr. Pipas said. Because the $40,000 Excursion and $30,000 Super Duty share the same engines and transmissions and have similar fuel economy, the shift in production will have little if any effect on the environment, he added.
Taller than Michael Jordan and weighing as much as three Honda Civics, the Excursion gets only 10 miles to the gallon in the city and 13 on the highway, making it the target of heavy criticism from environmentalists. In a "corporate citizenship report" released last Thursday in Atlanta at Ford's annual shareholders' meeting, the automaker acknowledged the criticism and quoted the Sierra Club's condemnation of the vehicle as, "a rolling monument to environmental destruction."
William C. Ford Jr., Ford Motor's chairman, said in an interview at the meeting that the company planned to continue making the vehicle because a halt in production would prompt the introduction of similar vehicles by rival automakers with less commitment to safety and the environment. Ford voluntarily builds the Excursion to emit less pollution than regulations allow for sport utilities. The Excursion is also equipped with impact-absorbing steel bars below the bumpers.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Despite Yen, Half-Year Income Is Up 25% at Toyota

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 18

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation reported surprisingly strong financial results for the second half of its fiscal year today, helped by robust sales in North America and Japan and cost-cutting that partly offset the effects of a strong yen on profits made overseas.
Toyota's earnings climbed 25 percent to 205.1 billion yen, or $1.9 billion at current exchange rates, in the last six months of the fiscal year that ended on March 31, compared with earnings of 163.5 billion yen in the corresponding period a year earlier. 
 The increase at Toyota, Japan's largest car manufacturer and the world's fourth largest, was something of a testament to the company's cost-cutting programs -- savings that contributed $1.4 billion in operating profit during the last fiscal year.
Toyota, maker of the best-selling Camry sedan and the Lexus line of luxury vehicles, also benefited from new models and the redesign of several old ones in its domestic Japanese market, like the new Estima minivan and its luxury model, the Crown. Two derivatives of a domestic small-car model, the Vitz, also sold briskly, and next week the company plans to introduce a new version of the Rav4 sport utility vehicle, which has also been popular here.
Profits at several subsidiaries helped, too. The Daihatsu Motor Company, 51.1 percent of which is owned by Toyota, said on Tuesday that its net income quadrupled in the last fiscal year and that profit at smaller affiliates also soared.
Koji Endo, an automotive analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo, said: "The outlook for Toyota is pretty positive. They have strong volume in the U.S. and in Japan, and with significantly more new products, both for Japan and outside, costs will continue to fall."
Despite this country's weak economy, Toyota forecast that domestic sales would rise 6.9 percent, to 1.83 million cars, this fiscal year. The Japanese auto market is enjoying a modest rebound; Goldman, Sachs estimates that domestic car registrations will rise at an annual rate of 6.4 percent over the next three years.
With its new models and strong brand here -- Toyota's share of the Japanese market exceeded 42 percent in fiscal 1999 -- the company is well positioned for increasing demand. Its sales abroad helped compensate for the strong yen, which reduced earnings from sales made in foreign currencies.
The yen's strength dealt a heavy blow to Toyota's competitor, the Honda Motor Company, which is heavily reliant on the United States market. Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, reported last Friday that earnings fell 14 percent in the recent fiscal year, a decline that had been expected. But on Tuesday, Honda startled investors with a forecast that overall profit this fiscal year would fall 27 percent, largely because of the strong yen's exchange-rate effect.
Toyota's shares ended 2.6 percent lower today at 4,930 yen, or about $45, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Shares Fall on Profit Taking and the Fed's Rate Warning

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stocks fell for the first time in five sessions yesterday as investors took some profits from the recent run-up in prices and re-examined the potential effect of the Federal Reserve's half-point increase in interest rates on Tuesday.
The sell-off was widespread, with each of the three main market gauges falling more than 1 percent. 
 But traders and analysts said the drop was understandable in light of the market's recent gains and a clear signal from the Fed that the rate increase -- the sixth since last June -- would probably not be the last. The central bank signaled its resolve in a tough statement that accompanied its move to raise the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by 50 basis points, to 6.5 percent.
"If you read that statement in a couple of years, you would have no clue that the Fed had already done five tightenings," said Thomas M. McManus, chief equity strategist at the Bank of America. "So far, there is little evidence that the tightening they have done to date has slowed the economy appreciably."
Market gauges opened lower and stayed that way for the entire session. An announcement by Intel that it again intends to split its stock and to raise its dividend at the end of July helped lift the indexes off their lows during the afternoon, but the relief was temporary.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 164.83 points, or 1.51 percent, to 10,769.74. Hewlett-Packard, which dropped more than 9 points; General Motors; and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing led the blue-chip index down. Only 4 of the 30 stocks in the Dow managed to move higher for the day. Market breadth was distinctly negative, with declining stocks outnumbering those advancing, 1,906 to 1,017.
Cisco Systems, which fell 2 9/16, to 58, led the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lower. It dropped 18.24 points, or 1.24 percent, to 1,447.80.
The Nasdaq composite index shed 72.61 points, or 1.95 percent, to 3,644.96, pulled down by stocks like Cisco, Microsoft, Qualcomm and Nextel. Over the previous four sessions, the Nasdaq had gained 9.8 percent. So far this year, it is down 10.43 percent.
Lycos, a big winner on Tuesday, was a big loser yesterday, perhaps reflecting reluctance by some United States investors to own foreign-controlled companies. Its stock fell 15 1/64 to 57 39/64 in very heavy trading, after having risen 18 percent on Tuesday, when the portal agreed to be bought in a stock swap by Terra Networks, the Internet unit of the Spanish phone giant Telefonica. Terra's American depository receipts fell 6 9/16, to 47.
Small stocks also took a beating. The Russell 2000 index dropped 6.32 points, or 1.25 percent, to 499.66.
With the Fed remaining on the offensive, "we will see a trendless market for a while," said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed stock trading at SG Cowen.
"People will continue to take some money out of stocks with high price-to-earnings multiples and put money into stocks with reasonable prices," he said. "That will create some stability in the market, which is what Alan Greenspan really wants."
While broad sections of the market moved lower, financial services stocks, widely seen as vulnerable to rising interest rates, were little changed.
J. P. Morgan, a Dow component, rose 11/16, to 132 5/8. Citigroup fell 5/8, to 61 1/16. Merrill Lynch was unchanged at 108. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter closed at 76, up 13/16.
Hewlett-Packard was the Dow's big loser, dropping 9 5/16, to 130 11/16. The stock had surged nearly 10 percent over the previous four trading days.
AT&T eased 13/16, to 38 1/16, after Jack Grubman, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, lowered his earnings forecast for 2001.
Cisco fell 2 9/16, to 58, its first decline in three sessions. Microsoft dipped 1 13/16, to 67 11/16, after a four-day rally. And Oracle fell 1, to 78 3/16.
Intel was one of a very few big technology stocks to rise. It closed at 123 3/16, up 15/16. The company announced a 2-for-1 stock split, and said it would raise its modest quarterly dividend by 33 percent, effective July 31.
Mr. McManus, the Bank of America strategist, said he remained positive about the stock market, but expected the Fed to increase interest rates again at its next meeting, on June 27-28.
"We told people this morning that it was pretty likely the Fed would bump rates another 50 basis points in June," he said. "But I am still encouraged that the market is broadening, and that the S.& P. is going up. I expect the market to remain in a trading range, for technology stocks to continue to correct, and for some of the other sectors that have underperformed sharply over the last year to continue to work their way higher."

HEADLINE: Study Shows a Racial Divide in Domestic Violence Cases

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Confirming a longstanding trend in crime and society, a new Justice Department study released yesterday shows a sharp drop in domestic murders, particularly the killings of black men by their black women partners, which fell 74 percent over the last two decades.
But the report also underscored how the face of domestic violence in America has changed. Even as the number of black victims has fallen, the number of white women killed by their husbands and boyfriends in fact rose slightly, to 876 in 1998 from 849 in 1976. 
 The report itself did not address the reasons for this discrepancy and many experts expressed puzzlement over it. But some criminologists and women's advocates said the explanation may be that black women traditionally were much more likely to be victims of domestic homicide than white women, so that the legal, social and economic changes of recent years have helped black women more than white women. Paradoxically, white women pushed most visibly for tougher laws against domestic violence and for shelters for abused women.
Despite the decline, black women in 1998 were still victims of domestic killings at a rate of 4.5 per 100,000, compared with 1.75 per 100,000 for white women, said James Alan Fox, the Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
In addition, said Elizabeth M. Schneider, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, because men often tend to kill their partners when their wife or girlfriend is leaving the relationship, "to the degree that white women have more acts of separation or independence, this may trigger more partner violence among white men."
But Professor Schneider said, "I am still surprised that the decrease in black women as victims of partner homicides is so big," since black women have been more reluctant than their white counterparts to use the new laws against domestic violence and have their partners arrested. Professor Schneider wrote a book on the subject, "Battered Women and Feminist Lawmaking," to be published this fall by Yale University Press.
Another factor, several criminologists said, is that black men have been disproportionately jailed and imprisoned, taking them out of their homes, therefore making it less likely that they will either kill their partners or be killed in domestic quarrels.
Over all, the new report found, the number of people killed by their intimate partners declined to 1,830 in 1998 from about 3,000 in 1976.
The biggest beneficiary of the decrease was black men, with the number of black men killed by intimate partners falling 74 percent in the last two decades. The number of black women killed by their partners dropped 45 percent in the same period and the number of white men killed by their partners declined 44 percent. The number of white women killed by their partners rose 3 percent.
The number of white women killed by their partners actually declined from 1993 to 1997, but rose again in 1998 to help account for the long term 3 percent increase, said Professor Fox. Whether the 1998 figure was an anomaly or the start of an upward trend is unclear, he said.
The increase in white women killed by their partners was largely among women living with boyfriends rather than husbands, Professor Fox said. Because more couples are living together rather than getting married, he said, this increase could continue.
Beyond killings, the report found, the number of women who were victims of nonlethal domestic violence dropped by 21 percent from 1993 to 1998, to 876,340 women victims from 1.1 million.
The report was published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical branch of the Justice Department.
Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, said there were several factors behind the decline in domestic homicide. One is changes in living arrangements, with fewer people getting and staying married, or even living together for long periods of time, which means less opportunity for killing.
A second factor, Professor Rosenfeld said, is the panoply of changes to help battered women, including new restraining laws, quicker arrests of batterers, shelters and support groups. Laura Dugan, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Georgia State University, said she had found in a large-scale study that as cities created more legal advocacy services against domestic violence, fewer men were being killed by their wives, though the same did not hold true for women.
"Basically, we think that legal advocacy gives women access to the criminal justice system, so women in abusive relationships have an out, and can get protection and don't need to kill to get out of a relationship," Professor Dugan said. But men, she said, tend to kill in a fit of rage or jealousy, so the new legal services for women are not as successful in preventing men from killing their partners.
Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon University, put it another way: "When men kill their partners, it is probably an unintended escalation of a quarrel. But when a woman kills her partner, it is more likely she sees it as a last resort to an unacceptable situation."
A third factor widely cited by experts has been the improved economic status of women, especially black women, who have more college education than black men and can find better jobs now, so they can be more independent and get out of dangerous relationships.
Still another factor, Professor Rosenfeld said, is the enormous incarceration rate of black men -- four times higher than it was in 1976.
The sum of these legal, social and economic changes have been so powerful that they have reversed the pre-1976 pattern in which black women actually killed their male partners more often than black men killed their wives or girlfriends, Professor Dugan said.
But Sue Osthoff, the director of the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women in Philadelphia, said she was concerned that the very progress society has made in giving women more resources to leave bad relationships "may have inadvertently put women at greater risk." This might explain why the rate of white women being killed by their partners has not dropped, she suggested.
"People don't understand what battering is really about," Ms. Osthoff said. "It is about controlling somebody. So when a woman leaves, that is a threat to the man, and some men say, 'If I can't have her, nobody will.' That makes leaving the most dangerous time."

HEADLINE: Indian Schools, Long Failing, Press for Money and Quality

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: MACY, Neb.

 BODY:
There was no Christmas vacation this year at the Omaha Nation Public School, and no spring break either. Instead, the superintendent, Todd Chessmore, decided to front load the school calendar so classes would end a few weeks early, the first week of May.
This was his effort to stem a chronically high truancy rate that gets worse in the spring, when warmer weather and the end of the high school basketball season dampen students' interest in school. 
 It was not entirely successful. In the math class taught by Mr. Chessmore, for example, only 5 of the 36 registered students were showing up by mid-April.
Even in a country used to stories about struggling public schools, many of those on Indian reservations stand out. Last year, the average student at the Omaha Nation Public School scored in the 15th percentile on national standardized tests, and almost half scored below the 10th percentile. Fewer than half the students in grades 3 through 12 came to take the test, Mr. Chessmore said. And while this year's graduating class of 9 is twice as big as those of a few years ago, it represents only a third of the 27 students enrolled in that class in ninth grade.
The obstacles the Omaha Nation school wrestles with are echoed in Indian schools around the country. On average, 36 percent to 51 percent of Indian students drop out of high school, according to the American Indian College Fund, the largest dropout rate of any ethnic group. Only about 17 percent of high school graduates go to college, and most do not finish.
"We got the worst of everything, the lowest test scores, lowest rate of reading books, the highest dropout rate, the lowest rate of entering college," said Dean Chavers, director of the Native American Scholarship Fund.
Frustrated by years of distressing results, schools and groups like the National Indian Education Association have begun pressing states and the federal government for more money for academics and crumbling buildings, programs to train Indian teachers, and support for parents whose poverty, substance abuse or unemployment leave them unmotivated or unable to help their children stay in school and achieve.
It reflects Indian country's increasing ability to assert itself, as Indian leaders have gained political and legal savvy and a degree of economic empowerment through reservation casinos. But it also reflects the critical state of Indian education.
"Whatever test you're looking at, Indian kids in high school typically score at the 15th or 20th percentile, Mr. Chavers said. "The reading of those kids is absolutely nonexistent. Our Indian kids are leaving high school now with Algebra 1 -- no geometry, no trig -- and people wonder why they're failing out of college."
Some reservation schools have done well, and others, including the Omaha Nation school, have improved from a few years ago. But many are dealing with a cycle of low expectations from non-Indian teachers, a generation of poorly educated parents, broken and overwhelmed families, a society historically suspicious of government-run schools and a culture that may not always see the relationship between being academically rigorous and being successful on the reservation. These difficulties only compound the isolation and poverty of reservation life.
"I worry about the future of the tribe," said Denine Parker, an Omaha tribe member who teaches art at the school in Macy, where 60 percent of the 3,400 tribe members are unemployed. "I see too many kids not getting an education. What happens to them? All you have to do is walk Main Street and then you know."
To some degree, state and federal officials are responding. President Clinton's budget request this year includes the largest increase ever for Indian education, economic and social programs -- $1.2 billion -- which would put it at $9.4 billion in 2001.
The Education Department just created an Indian Teacher Corps to train 1,000 Indian teachers. Currently, most teachers in reservation schools are non-Indian, the turnover rates are extremely high and many believe that the teachers do not understand Indian culture and learning styles.
And in August, a task force created by Mr. Clinton will present plans to improve education of the nation's 600,000 Indian students, 90 percent of whom are in public schools, many on reservations.
"What's important is that what the government is doing says it's O.K. to be an Indian," said David Cournoyer, director of external affairs for the American Indian College Fund. "Before, the philosophy was to take the Indian out of the Indian and basically educate him to be a white person. Now there's a recognition that the Indians' background and identity and self-esteem is important to them being good students."
Dr. David Beaulieu, the director of Indian education at the Education Department, called the effort unprecedented.
"We have schools that are literally falling down around the heads of Indian children," Mr. Beaulieu said. "In the 1990's we had the same high levels of dropout rates and low achievement levels as existed 20 years before."
In Nebraska, the efforts of Mr. Chessmore and others got the state to hold an Indian education summit and appoint a panel to improve state policy. The Legislature passed a bill this session changing the state aid formula so that tribes, which have very little taxable property, would no longer lose state financing because they could not raise the required amount from property taxes. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Mike Johanns, a Republican, and the Omaha Nation and Winnebago school districts plan to sue the state.
Chris Peterson, a spokesman for Mr. Johanns, said that while the governor objected to the cost and form of the bill, he also believed "it is time for the state and federal government to step up and do more, specifically in the area of funding."
And Nebraska's education commissioner, Doug Christensen, is hiring two staff members solely for Indian students: an education expert and a drug and alcohol counselor.
"We're really courting disaster, I think, on those reservation communities," Mr. Christensen said. "In two of our reservation schools there are 44 kindergartners but only 2 seniors, and in one case those 2 kids should not be graduating. They are two 18-year-old girls who couldn't pass the Algebra 1 test to save their soul. But what else can you do with them?"
Bob Geist, principal of the Winnebago reservation school, north of Macy, said: "Some parents see formal education as important; others see just being with the family as education. We have parents who will take kids out of school just to go shopping, or schedule a haircut in the middle of the day."
Ms. Parker, the Omaha Nation teacher, sent her daughter to sixth grade at a non-Indian school in Iowa. Recently, her daughter returned to the Omaha Nation school to find she was "way ahead of the sixth graders here," Ms. Parker said. "If I never would have sent her away, she never would have realized how hard she has to work."
Still, at Omaha Nation, Mr. Chessmore has made many improvements, from replacing 300 burned-out light bulbs when he started as superintendent three years ago to opening a day care center to help girls who have babies stay in school.
Mr. Chessmore started a training program for Indian teachers that will increase their numbers to 20 from 4, made the curriculum more culturally relevant by including tribal language, history and customs. He has also applied for money for a social services center with probation officers and a mental health counselor. He got a grant for a reading program for elementary students, which he says has produced "fourth graders who are reading better than half our high school." And he is lobbying the telephone company to give phones to the 30 percent of students' families without them.
To build trust, Mr. Chessmore, unlike most other superintendents and teachers in reservation schools, enrolled his 7 children at Omaha Nation, the only non-Indians among the 470 students. He and his wife also rear 4 Indian students from troubled families.
He hired three truant officers, and the truancy rate fell to about 15 percent from 31 percent.
One afternoon, Waylon Oldman, a truant officer and tribe member, scoured Macy for two kindergartners who had left school. In a Buick with its windshield cracked by rock-throwing truants, Mr. Oldman visited one truant's father and the trailer where the other truant lived with his grandmother. He scaled a chalky ridge called Million Dollar Hill, poked in an abandoned cellar shrouded by trees, scrambled down a deep ravine under a bridge, and combed an algae-choked creek strewn with old tires on the powwow grounds. The boys were nowhere to be found.
"The kids are smart -- they arrange tree branches so they can scoot underneath but we have to work to get through," Mr. Oldman said.
He said that tribal court had begun fining parents whose children were chronically truant and that the school sometimes tried to get their welfare benefits cut. "Some parents are really concerned," Mr Oldman said, "but some of the parents don't really understand why they need to send the kids to school."
One chronic truant was T. J. Baxter, 16, whose mother, Janice, would take him to school in the morning. But Mrs. Baxter said that "in the afternoon, I would see him walking around with friends." T. J. kept "coming home drunk, " she said, and she sent him to a treatment center.
Some students show promise but do not follow through. This year, it looked as though Jason Miller, a senior on the basketball team, would graduate, but he stopped doing schoolwork when basketball season ended.
"I didn't really want to come to school no more," said Jason, 18.
But there have been successes.
One senior, Liz Parker, had slacked off too badly to graduate. But a few weeks ago, Mr. Chessmore refused to let his daughter double date with her to the prom unless Liz did enough work to graduate. She did.
And Adrienne Miller, 19, who was left back in ninth grade and was drinking so much last year she dropped out for two weeks, turned things around under pressure from her mother, who told her she would have to help pay the bills if she was not in school. Now she will graduate and plans to attend college.
"I finally realized what I should be doing," Adrienne wrote in a class essay. "Getting my education."

Congress took its first steps toward approving a trade bill designed to change the United States' relationship with China, as a House and a Senate committee each resoundingly endorsed the measure in important test votes.
Half a dozen previously uncommitted House Republicans and Democrats said they would support the legislation granting China permanent normal trading privileges. Administration officials and congressional backers say they now think they are close to having collected the 218 votes needed for passage in the House, but they are still locked in a battle to put the measure over the top.

Do You Feel Lucky?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Talk about mixed signals.
George W. Bush's top economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, has been warning for some time that the stock market is dangerously overvalued, that it's a bubble that is bound to burst, and more likely sooner than later. 
 Mr. Lindsey, who strongly favors Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus, has warned his private clients of a potential stock market tailspin that could lead to a recession. He said he sold his own stocks about two years ago so he would be able "to sleep at night."
That's one signal.
The other signal came Monday when Mr. Bush told the nation that the key to saving Social Security retirement benefits was to allow working Americans to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in the very same stock market that Mr. Lindsey, at the moment, wants no part of.
Deciphering this can get confusing. It's as difficult in its way as picking winners in the market, or figuring the odds at the craps table in Atlantic City or Vegas. Do you feel lucky?
"What Bush is doing is taking a guaranteed system that is indexed to inflation and shifting a portion of those benefits to a non-guaranteed, non-indexed system that's based on the luck of the stock market," said Roger Hickey, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future, a progressive policy organization in Washington.
Even if Mr. Bush's bet is right -- that over the next several years the stock market will do better than most other investments -- there will still be many unfortunate wage earners finding themselves at retirement time on the wrong end of this big policy stick.
The stock market, by definition, has winners and losers, even in the best of times. "You could have pretty good returns in the market on average," said Mr. Hickey, "but with a large number of individuals doing very poorly.
"You could also have two people working side by side, making the same money in a job, and then one retires at a time the stock market is flush and the other retires a couple of years later when the stock market is crashing and people are losing their shirts."
There is, however, a group of guaranteed winners under Mr. Bush's plan -- the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have been funneling many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of Mr. Bush and other politicians, just begging them to steer some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security taxes their way.
Everyone who sells stocks or mutual funds stands to benefit from this welfare scheme for the not-so-idle rich.
Face it, the Republicans have had it in for Social Security since its inception. The historian William Manchester wrote about the G.O.P.'s desperate efforts in 1936 to block its creation: "On radio spots, actors hired by the Republican National Committee revealed in shocked tones that each man would be given a number -- as though there were any other way to keep track of Social Security accounts -- and perpetrated the hoax that people would be fingerprinted."
When the Republicans won control of Congress in 1946, party leaders called for the repeal of Social Security. And nearly four decades later, Governor Bush's fellow Texan, Senator Phil Gramm, could be quoted as follows on the question of eliminating minimum benefits for the elderly:
"They are 80-year-olds. Most people don't have the luxury of living to be 80 years old, so it's hard for me to feel sorry for them."
Governor Bush is trying to be a new kind of Republican, a new kind of conservative, a man who masks his party's traditionally harsh policies with a winning smile. Oh, he's a charmer.
But look closely at what he is saying: "First, we must not change Social Security for those now retired or nearing retirement. Let me put this plainly. For those on Social Security or close to receiving it, nothing will change. Government has made a commitment, and you have made your plans. These promises will be honored."
So those who are retired, or close to being retired, are safe. The rest of you, as far as I can tell, should look out.

HEADLINE: A Taste of the 80's: High Prices Are Back in an Auction of Contemporary Art

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
In the elevator at Sotheby's after last night's sale of contemporary art, two collectors were bemoaning all the things they didn't buy last year. While prices just six months ago may have seemed too expensive, compared to last night's prices they were a veritable bargain.
Bidding on contemporary art of all periods, tastes and styles was fast and furious, often exceeding the heady prices of the 1980's art boom. The sale totaled $46 million, above its high estimate of $41 million. Of the 70 works offered, only 3 failed to sell. 
 How long until the bubble bursts?
"We keep asking ourselves that," said Diane Upright, a former head of contemporary art at Christie's who is now a private dealer in Manhattan. "This sale showed both sides of the contemporary-art market: it's not just young blood going after young art, but what Alan Greenspan calls irrational exuberance."
The sale set records for 17 artists, including modern masters like Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Bruce Nauman.
By far the star of the evening, however, was Rothko's "Yellow Over Purple" (1956), one of the artist's abstract canvases. It was being sold from the Morton G. Neumann Family Collection, having been on exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1980 and 1981. Sotheby's had offered the Neumann family a guarantee, an undisclosed minimum price that an auction house promises the seller regardless of the sale's outcome. After three telephone bidders vied for it, the painting finally sold to an unidentified collector for $14.3 million, sailing above its high estimate of $9 million.
The sale featured eight Warhols. of which three were in the top 10 selling works last night. Two of the eight were being sold by S. I. Newhouse Jr., the publishing magnate.
Among the best was Mr. Newhouse's "Natalie Wood," a 1963 overlapping grid of images of the movie star. Three bidders tried for it, and the painting finally sold to unidentified German bidder standing in the very back of the salesroom for $2.7 million, nearly twice its high estimate of $1.5 million. A Warhol watercolor also being sold by Mr. Newhouse, "One Dollar" (1961), also nearly doubled its high estimate, selling to an unidentified telephone bidder for $489,750.
Far more expensive were "Mona Lisa-Four Times," a 1978 silkscreen that brought $830,750, just over its high estimate of $800,000, and one of the artist's classic "Flowers" silkscreens. This one, from 1964, was being sold by United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey. It went to an unidentified telephone bidder, also for $830,750, far above its high estimate of $600,000.
(Final prices include Sotheby's commission: 20 percent of the first $15,000, 15 percent of the next $85,000, and 10 percent of any amount over $100,000. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
Fashionable artists like the 1980's art star Jeff Koons were also represented last night. Mr. Koons's "Yorkshire Terriers," a 1991 wood sculpture of a pair of wide-eyed Yorkies, one with a pink bow, the other with a blue bow, was expected to sell for $120,000 to $180,000; an unidentified bidder bought it for $258,750. But the other work by Mr. Koons offered last night did not fare so well. "Wall Relief With Bird" (1991), a sculpture of candy-colored flowers from the artist's "Made in Heaven" series, was expected to fetch $500,000 to $700,000; Anthony d'Offay, the London dealer, bought it last night for $610,750. On Tuesday night at Christie's sale of contemporary art, some works by Mr. Koons scored big prices: "Woman in Tub," a 1988 sculpture of a woman grabbing her breasts, sold for $1.7 million.
Unlike Christie's, whose sale of contemporary art includes only works made in the last 30 years, Sotheby's dates contemporary art from 1945 to the present. As a result, last night's sale had many classic images like David Hockney's "Day Pool With Three Blues (Paper Pool 7)," from 1978, one of the artist's famous pool series. This one has bright blues with a yellow diving board. Estimated at $500,000 to $600,000, it finally brought $665,750, a record for a work on paper by Mr. Hockney, after three people fought for it..
The sale included a group of works described only as coming from a private European collection. Dating from 1965 to 1971, they ranged from Minimalist sculpture and painting to Conceptual photography and neon installations. The seller is Angelo Baldassarre, who, like many other Europeans who bought art in the mid-1960's and early '70's, had a taste for radical American art.
Among his prized works up for sale last night was was Brice Marden's "Rain Forest," a three-panel abstract work from 1971 with lush gray-green tones reminiscent of a tropical landscape, estimated at $1.5 million to $2 million. Robert Mnuchin, chairman of the Manhattan gallery, C&M Arts, bought it for $1.5 million. Also from the collection was Mr. Nauman's "Light Trap for Henry Moore, No. 1" (1967). a black-and-white photograph made by twirling a flashlight in a darkened room and recorded in the glowing spirals. Five people wanted the work, which was estimated at $250,000 to $350,000 and finally sold to an unidentified bidder for $533,750.
Abstract Expressionist works did well last night. Clyfford Still's 1947 "Untitled," a brown-and-red composition made a record price. A protracted three-way bidding war ensued. The painting finally sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.7 million, more than twice its high estimate of $700,000.
After the sale. everyone was amazed at the results but also tried to rationalize the high prices. Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide and the evening's auctioneer, described today's market as "that glorious combination: a scarcity of material and the great accumulation of wealth in the last two years."

CANADA RAISES RATES

BYLINE: By Timothy Pritchard 

 BODY:
Canada's central bank raised its overnight lending rate, known as the bank rate, by half a percentage point, to 6 percent, matching the half-point increase in the federal funds rate in the United States. Prime lending rates at Canadian chartered banks will also go up by half a point, to 7.5 percent. Although Canada's core inflation rate -- excluding energy and food -- is only 1.5 percent, the Bank of Canada warned that strong demand, especially from the United States, could put "excessive pressure on the economy's capacity limits, and thus on inflation."

HEADLINE: A Faux Pas? Get Over It!

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM 

 BODY:
Five years ago, at a stationery store on the Left Bank, I picked up a copy of Paris Match, fished in my pants pocket for some francs and walked toward the counter, a smile of fear frozen on my face. As my brain locked, I croaked out this sentence to the old woman at the counter:
"Je voudrais acheter ce magasin, s'il vous plait." 
 The common word for magazine is magazine (mah-gah-ZEEN), not magasin (mah-gah-ZAA). I had asked to buy the shop.
And so it went. For 10 days in Paris I was a helpless prisoner of my past: four years of undistinguished high school French and one semester at college. I could make my way through a French newspaper, but conversation was out of the question.
Until now. No longer the 98-pound-weakling of bilingualism, I have persuaded myself that it is possible to function confidently, perhaps even thrive, in another culture. I am a graduate of language immersion.
Alas, I have no immediate plans to do much more than order en francais at a midtown restaurant. But others are looking forward to a fresh round of business travel, or a summer visit to France or Italy or Japan, and yearn to be more self-sufficient, even fluent. For them, language courses like the one in which I enrolled, offered by the Language Immersion Institute, function as an introduction, a brush-up or a steppingstone to broader learning. A friendly caution, however: in the elementary levels, a weekend in another language can saute your brain, leaving you momentarily mute and at least a half-sentence behind the person you're straining to understand. At times it's like trying to do long division in your head.
My only previous encounter with immersion was a week at a tennis camp in Massachusetts years ago. Possessed of an average hacker's game at the time, I left the campus paralyzed by instruction. So focused had I become on where to step, how to swing and what my next shot should be that I couldn't hit the ball at all. Eventually the reflexes returned, including some bad habits. But it was demoralizing. Not so with French.
In 15 hours of weekend conversation, the equivalent of one-third of a semester, my classmates and I were continually coaxed to struggle aloud. Mercifully, this was not like high school, where teenagers wince from embarrassment. I felt no trace of the angst of my sophomore year, when my teacher -- a humorless woman who looked like Howdy Doody with a gray wig and spoke French with an Indiana twang -- aimed her intolerance up and down the rows like a machine gunner.
Instead, we were tutored by Denise Springer, a native speaker from the northeast seaside town of Berck-Plage in Flanders. A master teacher who retired in December as a language professor at the State University of New York at New Paltz, she happily transformed our gaucheries into new lines of instruction. We were applauded because we tried. It was O.K. to be ignorant. It was acceptable to be clumsy. We probably set a record for the number of sentences fractured per quarter-hour, but our persistence was always rewarded, with more instruction and more encouragement.
 
'Hate to Make Mistakes'
"It's a form of benign brainwashing," said Dr. Henry Urbanski, the director of the institute, which he founded on campus in 1981. The immersion technique isn't new, of course. In the 1960's, the Peace Corps placed its volunteers in similar programs. Among its most successful practitioners is the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif., which trains the military.
Dr. Urbanski, a walking advertisement for immersion, was born in Poland and speaks seven languages: English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Hebrew and Polish. He learned some of them, he says, by living in the country where the language is spoken.
"I am a believer in learning the language when you have an urgency to use it, when you need to, when you're totally immersed in it," he said. But the program he established initially served another purpose as well.
"I was chairman of the foreign language department at New Paltz in the late 70's, which coincided with the time that language requirements at colleges were being abolished," he said. "We were experiencing a drop in students and a consequent drop in faculty members. I felt that we had some talented language teachers, and they had no students to teach. That's when I decided there's people out in the world who are no longer in school who need language instruction."
So what is immersion?
"You exclude English for 15 hours in one weekend, and after a while students develop more confidence," he said. "They are not afraid to speak and make mistakes and to try to communicate in the language."
That's the key: making mistakes.
"Americans," he said, "hate to make mistakes."
He's right. So on a recent Friday evening, my classmates and I left our pride at the door of the Dumont Plaza Hotel on East 34th Street.
 
La Plume de Ma Tante? Non!
We students, about 70 of us, and 10 or 12 instructors -- a fairly typical gathering for Manhattan -- arrived at a hotel conference room at 7 p.m.
As individual classes go -- they range from 6 to 15 students -- mine was on the cozy side and fairly typical in its goals. Of the six of us, four wanted to learn more French for touring the country, one needed French for a doctoral program, and I was curious to see whether I was facile enough to move beyond irrelevant textbook phrases about le cahier, le stylo and mon oncle.
In Manhattan, classes are held at the Dumont Plaza. The institute also conducts weekend instruction at the State University campus at New Paltz, at the nearby Mohonk Lake Mountain House and at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry. Instruction begins with Elementary I and Elementary II (my level) and two intermediate levels. There are also advanced immersion courses of two weeks and four weeks, at New Paltz. Most students in the Manhattan program are commuters, but some stay overnight at their own expense. Tuition was $295 for the weekend, which included a welcome break for bagels and coffee on Sunday morning.
We began drifting into our meeting room in twos and threes, randomly filling seats and waiting to meet our teachers before following them to one-bedroom suites that would serve as classrooms.
Dr. Urbanski's welcome was low-key. He urged us to shed our inhibitions and expectations, recalling Heywood Hale Broun's observation of his own language studies. Broun felt he had been a good student, Dr. Urbanski said, but complained that "when he got to Paris he found that no one spoke intermediate French."
One by one, the instructors came forward to call the roll for their classes. They rattled off greetings and room numbers and a few phrases to lubricate us for what was to come.
Mild panic swept the room, and someone who was dead serious yelled out, "I think I'd better switch to Level I."
By 7:30 we were in our "classrooms." My group was interrupted several times in the first hour by late arrivals, until finally 10 of us crowded into the suite's sitting room. We received paperback texts, introduced ourselves and talked in French about our jobs, worked on vocabulary and conversation, and adjourned at 10 p.m. With the exception of a few necessary instructions for the next day, Mme. Springer spoke only in French.
 
One in Every Class
When we reconvened at 9 a.m. on Saturday, there were just the six of us, the others having bailed out. (Most Friday night dropouts tend to sign up for lower-level instruction either the same weekend or at a future date, Dr. Urbanski said.) Our group was set: Vicky Jeffers, a psychologist from Morristown, N.J.; her friend Ann Elkas, a registered nurse from Chatham, N.J.; Mitzi Pratt, a bookbinder from Martha's Vineyard, Mass.; Debra Schmidt Bach, from Brooklyn, a curator at the South Street Seaport Museum; and Cellen (pronounced SELL-in) Wolk, a landscape gardener from Rockland County. They all knew I would be writing about our experience.
We were pretty well matched, but the consensus was that Mitzi was the class genius. Her accent and pronunciation were quite good, and her command of sentence structure was superior to ours. She had spent some months working with a set of language tapes, and it had paid off.
"I hadn't been to Europe for a while," she said, "and then I went to France last fall for the grape harvest, the vendange. It was a great trip, and it inspired me to improve on the French that I had."
Her childhood French instruction, she said, had begun in a private, co-ed elementary school on the North Shore of Boston.
Of her weekend at the Dumont Plaza, Mitzi said later: "I was very nervous beforehand, but I had underestimated my ability. I had this vision of us sitting in this room being forced to speak French to each other."
 
Not Just a Bag
That did, indeed, happen. But most of the time we interacted with Madame Springer, or created conversations at her direction.
On Saturday morning, we paired off and interviewed our partners in French. Then we reported to the group. I learned that Ann was a nurse who also volunteered at a domestic-abuse phone line. She has three grown children, one of whom is married. She drives a Lexus and lives in a two-story house with four bedrooms.
Now try saying that in French. In full sentences.
More grist for Mme. Springer, who stood by a large easel and jotted down new words or phrases or verb forms with a marking pen. Nothing escaped her interest.
At one point, she gestured to an oversize handbag on the floor near Vicky's chair. She referred to it as le sac, but then went on to explain that its size qualified it for what Parisians call by a slyly suggestive name that will not be repeated here. It is a prostitute's bag, big enough for a change of clothes, makeup, etc. Suddenly we were immersed not only in language but also in culture.
Ann and Vicky were both relative newcomers to French. In school, Ann had studied Latin and taken a year of Spanish. Vicky said she had been a pretty fair student of German. "I could think in German," she said. "I could read poetry."
Both had been to France recently ("I fractured French there," Ann said) and wanted to become more comfortable with the language. So they enrolled together in a weekly hourlong course in New Jersey.
"I wasn't getting enough conversation," Ann said. "I'm great at visual learning, but my conversation is terrible. Just don't ask me to go, impromptu, into a big conversation with you."
We all survived the day. But when we left the hotel at 6 p.m. on Saturday, some of us displayed the telltale squint of fatigue.
"When I drove home, my husband said I sat there like a lump, I was so tired." Ann said. "I said, 'We're going out to eat, aren't we?' "
 
Say It Right, Mon Ami
Food had been our salvation on Saturday afternoon, too. Mme. Springer, it seems, relishes lunchtime on an immersion weekend, and her favorite restaurant is a Theater District fixture, Pierre au Tunnel, on West 47th Street.
Pierre Pujol opened the restaurant, on 48th Street, about 50 years ago, and it has remained in the family. Pujol's son-in-law, Jean-Claude Lincy, greeted us, and a member of the staff cheerfully put up with our attempts to order a tartine of this or a plat of that. We kept up some snappy table patter about de Gaulle, French socialism and Madame's wartime experiences in occupied France. But mercifully the food arrived, and it struck us all that it was the first time in hours that we had opened our mouths without having to think. (We split the bill, in English.)
The biggest event of the weekend, though, was the dreaded oral report on Sunday. Mme. Springer had directed each of us to prepare a five-minute presentation. We were permitted to write it out the night before, but not to read from it in class.
Vicky went first. Her report was on an American doughboy in Paris in 1918 and the penniless French countess he married. They eventually became her in-laws.
"I was amazed that I could make the presentation and elaborate spontaneously," she said later. "I felt comfortable."
Ann talked about her work as a volunteer with the domestic-abuse line. Cellen, the jardiniere, spoke lovingly about landscaping. It turned out that Cellen had been a competent Spanish speaker after having lived in Mexico years ago. But she had all but given up on French.
"I had four years of first-year French in high school," she said, adding that her mother, a French teacher, seemed to think her daughter had no aptitude for language. After doing poorly in her first French class, she repeated French I the next year. Then she moved to a new school, and another French I class, and so on.
But that was years ago, and with the prospect of a trip to Europe this summer, she chose to try immersion.
"I began dreaming in French," she said, after a day of class.
Mitzi told us about a trip to ancient ruins in Peru. I tried to describe a French cartoon character a friend had introduced me to. Named Becassine, she is a chauvinistic Bretonne in regional apron and cap whose exploits, chronicled in two dozen books, became popular between the world wars. (I had hoped for extra credit.)
Debra is working toward her Ph.D. at Columbia University in the history of decorative arts, for which she must pass a French comprehension exam in the fall. She described a visit to Paris about 13 years ago, when she was in her 20's. "On my way home one night," she said, "I gave my address to a taxi driver, but apparently I didn't pronounce it properly. When I showed the correct address, he started yelling at me."
That night, she said, she dreamed that people were shouting at her in French. She awoke to find that, in fact, they were: her hotel was next to a noisy restaurant kitchen.
 
The Secret, Revealed
Which provoked a stern caution from Madame and may explain at long last why the French become frustrated with Americans. It's not because we take pratfalls in pursuit of fluency; it's because we make the sounds wrong.
"Remember," she said, "if you don't pronounce it correctly, the French simply won't understand you." It must have been important: she said this in English!
By 1:30 on Sunday, exhausted but triumphant and with just 30 minutes remaining, we realized that making mistakes had not been so bad after all. We had stuttered and stumbled and persevered. And our teacher was still smiling.
Our valedictory was brief but pleasant. We read poems and sang songs in unison -- a younger person's classroom activity, perhaps, but a curiously comfortable one -- and recited tongue twisters: "Comment sont ces six saucissons-ci? Ces six saucissons-ci sont six sous."
There were hugs for the teacher, promises to enroll with her again and invitations to visit her in the Hudson Valley. And a valedictory of her own.
"I am moved by the fact that people come and spend a weekend, people who have other interesting things to do," Mme. Springer would tell me later. "If you are intelligent, you are self-criticizing, and it can work.
"We never know exactly the level of the people when they enroll. Some people think they are better than they are. But most people are better than they think they are."

HEADLINE: A Weekend's Lark For Studebaker Club

BYLINE: By CHARLES MCEWEN 

 BODY:
STUDEBAKER owners are a stubborn, iconoclastic group. John Cohoe, a founder of the Manhattan Studebaker Club, said: "One of the early mottoes was, 'We'd rather fix than switch.' And some cigarette smokers in the club would only smoke Lark. I guess they've grown up to Avanti cigars now."
Studebaker was one of the great independents in American automaking. The company started out as a wagon maker in 1852 and built its first car, an electric, in 1902. The last Studebaker rolled off the line in 1966. Notable Studebakers over the years include the big eight-cylinder Presidents of the 1920's and 1930's, the economical 1939 Champion, the 1950 "bullet nose" (named for its unusual round grille), the 1953 Starlight coupe and Starliner hardtop, the compact 1959 Lark and the wedge-shaped Avanti of 1963. 
 On Sunday, from about 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., the 35-member Manhattan Studebaker club will show off cars like these on the north side of Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport. The emphasis of the show, which is free, will be on Studebakers and other "orphan" makes whose manufacturers are no longer in business, but any car built in 1974 or earlier can enter for a fee of $15, Mr. Cohoe said. Thirty to 50 cars are expected, he added.
Old-car shows are a rarity in Manhattan, not the friendliest of places for any car, especially one that's 40 or 50 years old. "Owning an old car is the dream of childhood come true, and Manhattanites don't tend to be that type of person," said Gary Hallgren, another founder of the Manhattan Studebaker Club. "They dream of old cars, but the price of realizing that dream is too high. If they are native New Yorkers, it's not in their blood as much as us hick country people."
Mr. Hallgren's tongue was firmly in cheek. Although he now lives in Mastic Beach on Long Island, and grew up in Ferndale, Wash., he lived in Manhattan for nine years and kept a Studebaker in the city the whole time. In fact, he parked his 1949 pickup on the street and never even locked it. And nothing ever happened to it.
"A bum slept in it once," he said, "but I didn't care."

HEADLINE: DESIGN REVIEW;
When Americans Awoke to Modern Styles

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK 

 BODY:
The United States had to take a pass when offered a choice exhibition space at the great Paris show of modern design in 1925, the "Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes." Why? Herbert Hoover, at the time secretary of commerce, had consulted V.I.P.'s in the art, educational and business worlds, who advised that there was no modern design in America.
Sadly, with a few exceptions, it was true. European designers and manufacturers, particularly the French, were alive to the merchandising potential of design trends, like Art Deco. (Although it took its name from the Paris exposition, by 1925 Art Deco had already peaked in Europe.) 
 But Americans were still stuck in the worn groove of period furniture and decor. There was no serious contemporary movement in the decorative arts and, except for the tradition-busting skyscrapers going up in big cities, the public was hardly aware that such a thing as modern design could exist.
The Paris exhibition changed all that, awakening -- as did the Armory show of 1913 for modern art -- a new American interest in matters of design. The Metropolitan Museum bought seven important pieces from the Art Deco-oriented show, including a cabinet by Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, then the high priest of French decoration. What's more, the next year the Met played host to a traveling exhibition of works by craftsman-designer stars of the Paris extravaganza. The display caught on, articles appeared and trend-spotters in this country took notice. By the 1930's, manufacturers and designers were working together to stimulate the economy.
The Met, which happily seems to have stepped up its interest in design shows, has chosen that exposition year of 1925 as the kickoff for two new ones. "American Modern, 1925-1940: Design for a New Age" is bracketed between the Paris exposition and the New York World's Fair of 1939-40. A smaller show, "A Century of Design, Part II, 1925-1950," the second in a four-part series surveying the 20th century, concentrates on European work. (Part I, covering the first quarter of the century, ran from last December through March.)
"American Modern," a collaboration between the Met and the American Federation of Arts organized by J. Stewart Johnson, consultant for design and architecture in the Met's department of modern art, is the larger and more interesting, not just by virtue of its size.
Drawn from the Met's collection and from a collection promised to the museum by John C. Waddell, "American Modern" displays more than 150 objects: furniture, appliances, clocks, radios, cameras, textiles, tableware, book covers, posters, a vacuum cleaner, parts of a snappy blue-and-chrome dining room and even a shiny, skyscraperish step-on scale that told your weight and fortune for a penny. If much of it is familiar stuff, it wears well. The designers include such stellar names as Norman Bel Geddes, Donald Deskey, Henry Dreyfuss, Paul Frankl, Ilonka Karasz, Raymond Loewy, Isamu Noguchi, Eliel Saarinen, Charles Sheeler, Walter Dorwin Teague and Russel Wright.
At first, Art Deco -- a conservative but catchy fusion of earlier neo-classical styles like Louis XVI and Empire laced with Cubism, Futurism and late Art Nouveau -- was all the rage. Sumptuous materials were its hallmark, like the inlaid armoire of 1926 done for the New York furniture store W & J Sloane by an unknown designer. Made of mahogany, satinwood and ebony, with a kitschy little inlaid design on its veneer front, it epitomized the luxury appeal of Art Deco, not meant for a mass market.
But the French-fostered movement, with its curvilinear forms and cushy materials, was soon supplemented by the austere geometrics of the Bauhaus, the German design school initially led by Walter Gropius. Of real intellectual substance as against the derivative, backward-looking Art Deco, Bauhaus design was dedicated to producing functional, well-made, affordable items for a broad public through cooperation with manufacturers and the use of practical materials. When the school was closed by the Nazis in 1933, many of its teachers, including Gropius, came to America, where their ideas found a receptive audience.
In this country, Art Deco became the term for design influenced by the age of skyscrapers and machines. It was America's first popular modern style, although the terms Art Moderne or Streamlined Moderne are preferred by many in the decorative arts. And a new tastemaker, the industrial designer, emerged.
Among the more prolific of them were Teague, Bel Geddes and Dreyfuss. Teague (1883-1960), one of the first industrial designers, did the Ford Motor Company and the National Cash Register pavilions for the '39 World's Fair. He is represented in the show by no fewer than 18 items, among them the "Bluebird" radio (1934) for the Sparton Company. Of blue mirror glass, the radio face is horizontally trisected by chrome-plated bars that cross two central circles surrounding the dial.
Bel Geddes (1893-1958), originally a designer of productions for the theater, the opera and films, later did streamlined cars for Chrysler and Plymouth and the Futurama Pavilion for the '39 World's Fair. In 1940 he designed what has become the show's icon: the cheerful little "Patriot" radio for Emerson, a plastic portable whose grille is striped in red and white like the bars of an American flag. No less celebrated a design brain was Dreyfuss (1904-1972), a pioneer in the field of ergonomics, who redid the 20th-Century Limited train for the New York Central Railroad and produced such iconic mass-manufactured items as the thermos bottle (1937), which appears in the show.
The skyscraper, a native American product whose soaring height and bold architecture seemed to speak optimistically of the future, was a design inspiration, affecting everything from furniture to lamps to cocktail shakers. Among the show's most engaging objects are the "skyscraper" desk and bookcase, designed around 1927 by the Viennese-born Paul Frankl (1887-1958) in wood, Formica and Bakelite, an early plastic. Their geometric modules were staggered and set back, like the real thing.
Streamlining, with its rounded, rocket-shaped forms that symbolized speed, was yet another American contribution to the design field, although its roots could probably be traced to Italian Futurism of an earlier date. From trains, cars and planes, streamlining spread to ordinary household objects, like desk lamps, clocks, radios and tableware. Its effect can be seen on such disparate items in the show as the "Radio Nurse" (1937), done by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi for the Zenith Radio Corporation, a sleek, helmetlike contraption of black Bakelite meant for monitoring sounds in another room, and the "Airline" armchair (circa 1934) by the German-born Karl Emanuel Martin Weber (1889-1963), whose loungey seat and back of Naugahyde are counterpoint to an aerodynamic-looking wood frame.
It would be nice to see a Hupmobile designed by Loewy (1893-1986) instead of just the dinky little chrome-plated hood ornament he designed for the car, or Dreyfuss's 20th-Century Limited in the flesh, so to speak. But even at the Met, space limitations prevail, and besides neither object is in its collection.
Because it is a collection show, "American Modern" does not have the sharp point of view of "Packaging the New: Design and the American Consumer," mounted in 1994 by the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution. Covering 50 years of the 20th century, that show presented stylistic change as the driving force behind design, manufacturing and consumerism.
But why carp? The attractive, thematically arranged displays and lucid juxtapositions of the Met's show are a visual feast and enticingly evoke the spirit of the age.
"A Century of Design, Part II, 1925-1950," also organized by Mr. Johnson, by contrast with the first installment of this four-part series, seems a very mixed bag, stocked with the expected, unexciting and just plain ugly.
Focusing on Europe while covering virtually the same time frame as "American Modern," it presents 50 objects from the Met's collection by such talents as Alvar Aalto, Marcel Breuer, Jean Dunand, Charles Eames, Eileen Gray, Rene Jules Lalique, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Joan Miro, Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, Gerrit Rietveld and Eva Zeisel, along with lesser lights.
Among the Art Deco exhibits looms Ruhlmann's overfussy sideboard (circa 1922) of macassar ebony tricked out with ivory and silver bronze. Two quieter but also unappealing Art Deco objects are cutesy etched glass vessels by the Swedish designer Edward Hald (1883-1980), dated 1926 and 1927.
The show improves with the geometric Bauhaus influence, seen in a pair of square hanging lamps (circa 1935) whose sides are surfaced like graters by the British designer Eileen Gray (1879-1976). Not to be scanted either is the wonderfully architectural inkwell (1929-30) in bright orange earthenware by Eva Zeisel (born in Hungary in 1906) that looks like a skyscraper lying on its side. Other good things include a wonderful scale drawing for the Daimler-Benz sport convertible No. 3384 (circa 1933) by Wilhelm Reuter, a German.
Chairs are rife, most of them fairly familiar. They include Breuer's "Wassily" armchair (1925), of tubular steel and canvas upholstery; Mies van der Rohe's "MR" model (1927), with a cantilevered seat and back of black caning set in a chrome-plated steel frame; and Aalto's "39" chaise longue (1936-37), a long, body-loving chair whose webbed seat is also cantilvered, on a simple bentwood frame.
As mentioned, the show has its quota of nontreasures. The biggest such surprise is an earthenware vase (1942) by Joan Miro, whose conventional urn shape is inflected by a painted abstract motif or two. What it's doing here is hard to figure out.
 
 "American Modern, 1925-1940: Design for a New Age" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 7. "A Century of Design, Part II: 1925-1950" is at the museum through Oct. 29.

HEADLINE: Trade Deal Will Hurt China's Hard-Liners

BYLINE: By Samuel R. Berger and Gene Sperling; Samuel R. Berger is the national security adviser. Gene Sperling is President Clinton's national economic adviser.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As Congress takes up the bill that would establish permanent normal trade relations with China, the question before it is not whether China's human rights record is good or whether the deal by itself will cure it. The question is, in addition to the overwhelming economic benefits, will its passage increase the chance of positive change in China?
We believe it will, not out of faith that increased trade always brings freedom, but because the specific concessions China is making in order to enter the World Trade Organization will move China in the right direction. 
 The divisions within China are clear. Those advocating W.T.O. membership and closer ties with the United States are the same leaders pushing a more daring transition from a command-and-control to a market economy. They realize that if they open China to global competition, they risk unleashing forces beyond their control -- temporary unemployment, social unrest and demands for freedom. But they have concluded that without competition, China will not be able to build a modern, successful economy.
The opposition is the entrenched state-owned manufacturing sector and those Communist officials clinging desperately to one-party control over how people work and live. They know that if China slashes protective tariffs to get into the W.T.O., more of its state enterprises will go. The government's ability to control workers and their loyalty will diminish. There will be more internal pressure for political change.
Last year alone there were more than 120,000 labor disputes across China over demands for openness and accountability. In some places, the government has cracked down. In others, it has responded by giving people a greater say, holding local elections and letting workers take grievances to court. That is how real change can begin. How would we be encouraging it by handing a humiliating defeat to reformers seeking normalized trade and a huge victory to the stalwarts of a state-dominated economy?
If China enters the W.T.O. and we approve permanent normal trade relations, the resulting greater participation of American telecommunications companies will also make telephones and the Internet more accessible for Chinese citizens. Right now only 12 percent of Chinese have phones; fewer than 1 percent have Internet access. No matter how hard Chinese officials try to stuff the information genie back into the bottle, an explosion in information technology will lead to an explosion of idea sharing in China. But if we reject permanent trade ties, our information industries will be denied access. How would that help Chinese citizens seeking new ideas and tools for political activism?
Finally, as Martin Lee, the leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party has said, participation in the W.T.O. would bolster those in China who understand that the country must embrace the rule of law. Economic activity in China is mostly based on vague and unpublished rules that maximize the arbitrary power of party officials. To join the W.T.O., China must publish key rules, making it easier for citizens to advance on the strength of their ideas, not their connections.
Of course, W.T.O. membership does not guarantee China's leaders will choose political reform. But by accelerating economic change, it will force them to confront that choice sooner, and will make the imperative for the right choice stronger. If we reject the trade deal and undercut the reform-minded leaders who have risked their reputations for greater openness, we will increase the likelihood of the wrong choice.
Certainly, establishing permanent normal trade relations is not by itself a human rights policy toward China. Change will come through a combination of internal pressure and external validation of China's human rights struggle. We have to maintain our leadership in the latter, even as the W.T.O. contributes to the former. That's why we sanctioned China under the International Religious Freedom Act last year, and why last month we sponsored a U.N. Human Rights Commission resolution condemning China's human rights violations.
Those who oppose the trade deal have little vision of how a no vote would further reform in China other than maintaining our annual vote to threaten to close our market to Chinese goods (at considerable cost to millions of American families). Yet, after 20 years, this ritual has become just that, a ritual. Even when our relationship was at its lowest point, after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, this process has affirmed our trading relationship with China. A human rights commission like that proposed by Representatives Sander Levin and Douglas Bereuter could be much more effective.
We do not know what path China will take. All we can do is make the decisions most likely to push China in the direction of economic and political reform. It is hard to see how freezing the status quo, empowering hard-liners, slowing the economic transition, and keeping American companies out of China will increase respect for human rights or lead to a more open society.

HEADLINE: Fed's Notes Give Reasons for Show of Restraint in March

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers unanimously approved raising interest rates by a quarter percentage point at their March 21 meeting, preferring to stick with what they called a gradual approach to monetary policy absent evidence of surging prices, according to minutes released today.
Because a "significant acceleration in inflation did not appear to be imminent and because uncertainties continued to surround the economic outlook, a gradual approach to policy adjustments was warranted," according to the minutes. 
 The policy makers, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted unanimously at that meeting to raise the federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter-point, to 6 percent. At its next meeting, on Tuesday, it raised the rate by a half-point, to 6.5 percent, the highest level in nine years. In an accompanying statement, the committee also suggested that more increases were likely.
At the committee's March meeting, a similar move was contemplated but rejected.
"Although a more forceful policy move of 50 basis points might be needed at some point, measured and predictable policy tightening moves, such as the one contemplated today, still were desirable in current circumstances, which included somewhat unsettled financial markets," the minutes said.
Moreover, "there were few signs of any acceleration in labor costs," the minutes said. "Price inflation was still moderate, except for the upturn in energy prices in recent months."
The minutes suggest that in March, the Fed did not see the kind of inflationary forces that have since become evident in economic data, like robust growth and consumer spending and an unemployment rate that is at a 30-year low.
At the committee's February meeting, a few members had "expressed a preference" for a half-point increase but settled for the quarter-point favored by the majority, who saw "little risk in a gradual approach to policy tightening and considerable advantage to preserving the possibility of calibrating those actions to the emerging situation," the minutes of the Feb. 1-2 meeting said.
In March, the majority's support for a gradual series of rate increases prevailed again, though central bankers said further rate increases were likely.
The half-point increase in rates on Tuesday was the sixth rate increase since June. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and other F.O.M.C. members justified the rate rise by saying in a statement that "increases in demand have remained in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven gains in potential supply."

Europe Regulators Raid Coke Offices in Brussels and London

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Investigators from the European Commission raided Coca-Cola's office in Brussels early yesterday as well as the office of the company's largest bottler, in London, expanding an inquiry into Coke's marketing practices that began last summer.
At issue are many of the methods Coke uses to bolster sales of its soft drinks: contracts that prohibit competitors' products, sales incentive programs and discounts for certain customers. Last July, investigators seized documents from the offices of Coca-Cola Beverages in London; the offices of Coke's principal German bottler, Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke, and Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages in Denmark. 
 By bringing Coca-Cola Enterprises into the investigation, regulators seem intent on examining the entire European operation. Coca-Cola Enterprises, based in Atlanta, bottles Coke products in France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and controls about 70 percent of Coke's bottling in the United States.
In a statement, the European Commission said its inquiry "aims to assess whether C.C.E.'s distribution practices may constitute an abuse of a dominant position in violation of E.U. competition rules." It added that the investigation focused on the Belgian and British markets, and began after complaints were received by the commission. Pepsico and Virgin Cola have acknowledged that they complained to regulators about Coke, setting off the investigation in July.
Coca-Cola said it was cooperating with the authorities. "We are confident that our actions are in compliance with all national and European regulations," said the company's spokesman, Rob Baskin.
A spokesman for the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, confirmed that regulators had entered its offices in London and Brussels. "We are disappointed that the European Commission felt the need to execute a dawn raid," said the spokesman, John H. Downs Jr. "However, we are not surprised that the commission included our European operations since it has a continuing investigation into the Coca-Cola system."
The investigators remained at the Coke offices throughout the day, examining files and removing documents that pertained to the inquiry, which has no deadline. "The length of investigations depends largely on complexity of cases, and on whether the commission's suspicions turn out to be justified," the commission said in its statement.
On Tuesday, Coca-Cola Enterprises disclosed that its profits were falling, citing a flood of cheaper products into Britain, the bottler's second-biggest market. European Union law permits companies based in one country to import products from other member nations, so the bottler cannot prevent the flow of soft drinks from countries like Spain or Ireland.
Mr. Downs said there was "no connection" between the cheaper imports and the European Union's inquiry into Coca-Cola Enterprises.
Coca-Cola's new chairman and chief executive, Douglas N. Daft, has pledged to improve the company's battered image in Europe as well as its conduct there. Coke's efforts in recent years to buy Orangina and the Cadbury Schweppes brands ran into trouble from regulators on competitive grounds, with the plans ultimately scuttled or trimmed back. Last June, Coke recorded its biggest product recall in company history after people in Belgium said they felt ill after drinking Coke products; the recall cost Coke $200 million and cost Coca-Cola Enterprises $103 million.
In December, Italian authorities fined Coke $16 million over the practices of Coca-Cola Beverages, a bottler in which Coke holds a majority stake. The authorities objected to several of the bottler's practices, including discounts to retailers carrying Coca-Cola products exclusively and year-end bonuses to wholesalers carrying only Coca-Cola. The investigation began in 1997 after complaints from Pepsi and an Italian supermarket chain, Esselunga.
"Nineteen ninety-nine was a pretty tough year for Coca-Cola, particularly in Europe," Mr. Daft told the British and American Chamber of Commerce earlier this month. "We've said the series of setbacks we suffered last year served as a clear wake-up call for us."

HEADLINE: Tax Payments Lead to Big April Surplus

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Thanks to a flood of tax receipts, the Treasury posted a record budget surplus of $159.5 billion in April, a month that typically generates a lot of cash because of the April 15 income tax deadline, the Treasury Department announced today.
The government's surplus for last month was 40.5 percent higher than the surplus of $113.5 billion recorded in April 1999. 
 Last month's surplus was in line with the $158 billion surplus many analysts expected, but was slightly smaller than the $163 billion projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
Revenue for April reached a record monthly high of $295.1 billion, while spending came to $135.7 billion.
With help from the booming economy, the government collected $184.2 billion in individual income tax payments last month, compared with $164.8 billion for April 1999. It received $27.7 billion in corporate tax payments, up from $21.7 billion.
For the first seven months of fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1, the government is running a surplus of $123.9 billion -- just about matching the record $124.4 billion surplus recorded for all the 1999 fiscal year. Revenue during the first seven months of fiscal 2000 totaled $1.72 trillion, while spending came to $1.04 trillion.
If a surplus materializes as expected for the current fiscal year, it will be the first time for three consecutive years of surplus since 1947, 1948 and 1949.
The Clinton administration is predicting a $166.69 billion surplus for the current fiscal year, while the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the surplus will exceed $200 billion.

HEADLINE: Average Cost Of Apartments Hits $700,000

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
Continuing a seemingly inexorable climb, the average price for apartments in much of Manhattan jumped by nearly a third over the last year, breaking the $700,000 mark for the first time, according to one of the real estate industry's most comprehensive surveys.
The average price for an apartment south of West 116th Street and East 96th Street rose to $733,860 during the first quarter of 2000, a 31 percent rise from the $559,204 average recorded in the first quarter of 1999, according to the study, the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report. 
 "This is the first time ever that the average has exceeded $700,000," said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company that prepares the quarterly report. Mr. Miller said a major contributor to the jump in the overall average price was an increased proportion of larger apartments in the quarter's sales.
The $733,860 figure represents a 77 percent increase over the average price of $414,187 recorded in 1995 -- during the bottoming-out of the last real estate recession -- and 62 percent over the $453,909 average in 1990.
"Things are crazy, but it's still not the 80's in terms of percentage," Mr. Miller said, pointing out that between the fourth quarters of 1985 and 1986, the overall average price rose 49.1 percent, to $580,282 from $389,170. Adjusted for inflation, that 1986 average of $580,282 would be $906,458 today.
Dr. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, put the current increases in perspective. "We're in an era of setting economic records," Dr. Hughes said. "Each month, we break the record for the longest economic expansion in history. Manhattan has become one of the major locomotives of this record-setting, and it would be shocking if this were not reflected in surging housing prices in Manhattan.
"This now rivals the boom of the 1980's in terms of a single year," Dr. Hughes said. "The difference in the 80's was that the price surge was sustained over a seven-year period. This current boom has really only taken off the last two years. As long as the national economy keeps expanding, the price momentum in Manhattan will continue. And the national economy is still red hot, which is why we had the Federal Reserve interest rate hike on Tuesday."
Manhattan, to be sure, is not the only place in the country where price rises have been breathtaking. In Santa Clara County, Calif., which includes most of Silicon Valley, the local association of Realtors reported in April that the average price for a single-family home hit $702,165, a 37 percent increase from $513,085 in April 1999, and that the average price of condominiums and town houses had jumped 30 percent over the same period, to $341,167 from $262,139.
The Elliman first-quarter report was based on 2,313 closed deals for both co-op and condominium apartments, representing about 75 percent of the market's volume. It does not include sales of less than $75,000, Mr. Miller said, because there are so few transactions below that mark "that they are insignificant to the overall results."
Deborah Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, expressing concern that the Elliman numbers might scare off potential buyers, pointed out that the report did not cover northern Manhattan and that prices for smaller apartments throughout the borough, while increasing significantly, were more reasonable.
And placing the Manhattan numbers in geographical context, Kevin Thorpe, an economist with the National Association of Realtors, cited the median price for an existing single-family home in the Greater New York Region, which the association defines as the city and certain suburban areas. The median was $221,500 in the first quarter of 2000 -- a rise of 14.3 percent from the $193,800 median in the first quarter of 1999, and 6.5 percent above the median of $207,900 at the end of last year. The median price is the point at which half the sales were above that figure and half were below it.
The Elliman Manhattan survey found that the average price for condominiums had increased 40 percent in a year, from $682,094 in the first quarter of 1999 to $952,761 this quarter. "That's a staggering increase, since we have never seen the quarterly average for condos exceed $700,000," Mr. Miller said.
Breaking down the condominium category by apartment size, the average price for a studio in the first quarter of 2000 was $243,667, up 38 percent from $175,986 in the first quarter of 1999. For one-bedrooms, the average was $387,961, a 7 percent increase from $361,397 a year ago. The two-bedroom average this year was $958,202, up 8 percent from $888,093.
For three-bedrooms, the average price was $1,997,053, a 75 percent jump from $1,140,600 in the first quarter of '99. (Mr. Miller attributed that increase to great demand for the few available properties.) And for condos with four or more bedrooms, the average price in the first quarter of 2000 was $4,118,750, a 7 percent increase from $3,836,414 in the first quarter of '99.
"My theory for the change in the overall average is that there has been a shift to larger units; a significant increase in the number of two-bedroom sales relative to the rest of the market," Mr. Miller said. "The two-bedroom apartment is becoming a first-purchase preference." In the first quarter of '99, two-bedroom condominium sales represented 33 percent of the condominium market; this year, they represented 49 percent of the market.
Lawrence Sicular, director of appraisal and consulting at Brown Harris Stevens, a major Manhattan real estate brokerage firm, concurred: "The change in mix sounds like a very plausible explanation. The demand for one-bedrooms may be in relative decline because people may prefer to rent until they can buy a two-bedroom.
"In the 80's," Mr. Sicular explained, "people felt that every type of property went up, so anything they bought would provide leverage for their next purchase. Now they are viewing real estate less as a speculative investment than they did in the last real estate cycle. They're not going to trade up every one or two years, thinking they are going to make money."
In the co-op category, the Elliman survey reported the average price increased 24 percent over the year, to $576,596 from $464,692. "That's the highest average ever recorded for co-ops in our study," Mr. Miller said. "And like the condos, the co-ops also saw a gain in the two-bedroom market share, from 33 percent last year to 38 percent this year."
For co-ops, by apartment size, the average price for a studio was $142,060 in the first quarter of this year, up 19 percent from $119,444 in the first quarter of 1999. For one-bedrooms, the average was $291,675, a 28 percent increase over $227,229 in 1999. In the two-bedroom category, the average this year was $760,578, up 39 percent from $547,407. For three-bedrooms, it was $1,858,576, up 44 percent from $1,294,840. And for those with four or more bedrooms, the average price in the first quarter of 2000 was $3,565,625, a decrease of 24 percent from $4,690,833 last year. There are relatively few sales of apartments with four or more bedrooms, so prices in that category are particularly volatile.
Asked about further price increases, Mr. Miller said his company's appraisals showed a continued rapid increase in prices in the last six weeks, the first half of the second quarter. "I would expect it to continue at least through mid-June, when the kids are out of school and we usually see a lessening of activity."
Concerned about wary buyers, Ms. Beck of the real estate board noted that the board's report covered all of Manhattan, "so that our figures aren't quite as euphoric, although they are wonderful." The median price for co-ops in all of Manhattan during the first quarter of this year was $397,500, the real estate board reported, up 14 percent from $350,000 in the first quarter of 1999. Condominium prices were not available.
Ms. Beck pointed out that more than 80 percent of all apartments in Manhattan were studios, one-bedrooms or two-bedrooms. And the median price for those apartments, taken together, was $342,500 in the first quarter of this year, up 12 percent from $306,000 a year ago.
"Some consumers would look at the Elliman numbers and say, 'I can't afford that,' " Ms. Beck said. "But if they look at the median price, particularly on studios, one- and two-bedroom units, they will find encouragement."

HEADLINE: South Carolina Votes to Remove Confederate Flag From Dome

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 18

 BODY:
After 38 years of conducting their state's business under the Confederate battle flag, the two houses of the South Carolina General Assembly voted today to remove it from the Capitol dome and their chambers. At noon on July 1, South Carolina will become the last state to remove the old symbol of secession from its seat of government.
The Senate vote was 37 to 8; the House vote was closer, 66 to 43. 
 "Thank you, Jesus, thank you," Senator J. Verne Smith, a white Democrat from Greenville, said on the floor of the Senate, reflecting that body's relief after so many years of fatigue and bitterness over the issue.
But the bill, which Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, said he would sign as early as next week, will not put an end to the racial division that the flag has caused. To capture the support of the flag's backers, the bill calls for a smaller version of it to be flown atop a 30-foot pole in front of the Capitol, next to a slightly taller monument to slain Confederate soldiers.
That setting as well is too prominent for most of the 26 black members of the House, only 4 of whom voted for the measure. The N.A.A.C.P. has said it will not lift its tourism boycott of the state, and may even expand it to discourage filmmaking and organized-labor events in South Carolina.
Black officials are by no means unanimous in opposition, however. Six of the seven black senators voted for the bill, and several joined their white colleagues in calling the vote a historic moment for race relations.
"Now all of South Carolina can be a part of a great day, of a great coming together of our citizens," said Senator Robert Ford, a black Democrat from Charleston. "All of us should be proud, and I think the coming together of the members of the General Assembly should be the coming together of every citizen in South Carolina."
The flag has flown on the dome, beneath the American and South Carolina flags, since 1962, when it was raised by the legislature, then all-white, for a Civil War centennial and to send a clear message of defiance to the growing civil rights movement. Over the years, leading blacks, many elected officials and one former governor, David Beasley, have repeatedly called for its removal as an offensive reminder of the slavery era, while white lawmakers have kept it flying as an emblem of Southern heritage.
The issue reached a fever pitch in the last year, after the N.A.A.C.P. announced its boycott and the presidential candidates weighed in, with the Democratic contenders calling for the flag's removal and Republicans declining to take a position. The struggle, which has recently overshadowed almost every other policy issue in South Carolina, became so intense because it perfectly embodied a large political gulf between the races there that has persisted since Reconstruction. Blacks have long felt that they are barely tolerated as political equals, and have seen every reference to "Southern heritage" as scarcely veiled nostalgia for the days of white supremacy.
"That flag represents the Confederacy that enslaved, exploited, murdered, raped and killed our people for over 300 years," said Representative Joseph H. Neal, a black Baptist minister, in explaining today why he and others would not vote to move the flag to the Capitol grounds.
White legislators, on the other hand, maintained that the flag was a legitimate expression of reverence for ancestors who died fighting for the South, and said they resented being lumped together with Klansmen and other racists who have embraced the flag for their own purposes. But many made clear as well that they had chafed over the years at the growth of affirmative action and other policies sought by black residents, and considered the flag a last remnant of a vanishing nobility.
Many formerly hard-line flag supporters voted for the bill, partly because they believed the flag's presence was hurting the state economically, and because they considered the Confederate monument to be an acceptable alternative setting.
"It was equally hard for both sides to take this step," said Senator Glenn F. McConnell, a Charleston lawyer who owns a gallery that sells Confederate memorabilia. "Both sides had to bleed on this."
Last week, a few flag supporters in the House who opposed the plan tried to make the flag's new position even more prominent by raising the height of the flagpole to 30 feet, 10 feet higher than called for in the original compromise, forged in the Senate. This last act of defiance, which the Senate was forced to swallow today for the sake of passage, helped persuade the N.A.A.C.P. to continue its boycott. Kweisi Mfume, the organization's president, said on Tuesday that the move was a "slap in the face" to those who wanted to end racial division in the state.
But Governor Hodges, who had long pushed for any compromise that would move the flag off the dome, predicted today that the boycott would soon fizzle.
"There may be differences about the final resolution," he said in an interview, "but what people will remember at the end of the day is that the flag came down. Like other states, we're moving the flag to a historical monument, and we will no longer be the only state with the flag on our dome. And I think people will see that as a major step forward for South Carolina."
The brunt of national attention on the Confederate issue is now likely to turn to Georgia and Mississippi, both of which incorporate the Southern-cross design of the battle flag in their own state flags. Efforts have begun in both states to change those flags in legislative sessions next year.

HEADLINE: A State Votes to End Its Death Penalty

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., May 18

 BODY:
Reflecting a mounting national unease over the death penalty, New Hampshire's generally conservative Legislature today became the first in the country to approve a bill banning capital punishment since the Supreme Court allowed executions to resume nearly 24 years ago.
The Senate, evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, voted 14 to 10, after an emotional hourlong debate, to approve a bill repealing the state's death penalty. The House passed the same bill in March. 
 But Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who not only favors the death penalty but wishes to expand it, has vowed to veto the bill.
"There are some murders so heinous that the death penalty is an appropriate punishment and, accordingly, I will veto this legislation," Governor Shaheen, a Democrat, said in a statement issued after the vote.
Nevertheless, the vote here, in a state that has not executed anyone since 1939 and has no prisoners on death row, was greeted by opponents of the death penalty as a striking indication of changing public attitudes.
Over the years, polls have shown that somewhat more than half the population approves of capital punishment. And while even death penalty opponents say no other state is likely to abolish the death penalty, over the past few years more concerns have been raised about its fairness and application, even among death penalty supporters.
"I think this is a historic vote and may signal a trend by states away from the death penalty," said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a group in Washington that opposes capital punishment.
"There is clearly a growing concern about the accuracy and fairness of the death penalty in many other states," Mr. Dieter said.
Perhaps the most significant change came in January, when Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who was a longtime proponent of the death penalty, ordered a moratorium on executions after discovering that since 1987 the state had freed 13 prisoners from death row because they were found to be innocent.
That was more than the number of convicts executed in that time. Some who were ordered to be freed had been exonerated after investigations by student journalists in a workshop at Northwestern University.
Governor Shaheen's legal counsel, Judy Reardon, had tartly dismissed that example in the debate here.
"If Governor Shaheen were the governor of Illinois, she'd have imposed a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, too," Ms. Reardon said. "We don't have those problems in New Hampshire."
But Mr. Dieter, the death penalty opponent, said the possibility of wrongful convictions and executions, as well as publicized cases of death row convicts exonerated with newly available DNA evidence, was a major factor in the changing attitudes.
"I think that the issue of innocence is what has triggered much of this concern," he said.
Death penalty opponents in the New Hampshire Legislature appear unlikely to be able to muster the two-thirds vote in both houses necessary to override the governor's veto. Nevertheless, the votes this spring indicated a major shift. Two years ago, the House rejected a similar repeal bill by 40 votes.
This year, when the vote on repeal came up in the House in March, the speaker of the overwhelmingly Republican body, Donna Sytek, who is noted for controlling party line votes with an iron hand, decreed a "free vote" in which the representatives should vote their consciences.
The measure passed 191 to 163. While its main sponsor, James Splain, a Democrat from Portsmouth, is regarded as one of the most liberal legislators in the House, the measure was also backed by a number of conservatives.
The possibility of executions carried out in error weighed heavily in the debate. One Republican representative, a lawyer, argued that economics fundamentally skewed the system of justice, leaving high numbers of poor blacks and Hispanics awaiting execution.
"There are no millionaires on death row," the representative, Anthony DiFruscia, said. "Can you honestly say that you're going to get equal justice under the law when, if you've got the money, you're going to get away with it."
As the measure moved to the Senate, early political soundings suggested that the 24-member body was just about evenly split.
But in the weeks leading to the vote today, three senators -- including the Democratic chairwoman of the Judiciary Committee, Debora Pignatelli -- changed their minds and voted to repeal the death penalty, providing the margin of victory.
Senator Rick Trombley, a Democrat from Boscawen, had favored the death penalty. But Mr. Trombley became troubled by testimony before the House Judiciary Committee over the case of a man, Richard Buchanan, who was charged with the murder and rape of a 6-year-old girl but was later exonerated by DNA evidence. Even so, prosecutors still held Mr. Buchanan in jail for months after the new evidence was discovered.
"If scientific evidence today shows that we're making mistake after mistake after mistake, the Legislature ought not to allow for the possibility of that mistake being made," Mr. Trombley told The Concord Monitor in an article that detailed the anguished decisions of the three senators. "The only way to do that is to abolish the death penalty."
Mrs. Pignatelli had also favored the death penalty until the Legislature began holding hearings. In January, one witness, Paris Carriger, told lawmakers that he had spent 21 years on Arizona's death row, and once came within three hours of being executed, before being released.
"There's something unseemly about the state being in the position of executing people," Mrs. Pignatelli finally concluded.
Leo Fraser, a Republican from Pittsfield, the third senator who changed his mind, said that several factors figured in his decision, including doubts that capital punishment was a deterrent to crime, but that he was particularly struck by a letter from a woman in Guilford.
"She wrote to me that she considered me her agent," Mr. Fraser told The Monitor. " 'And as my agent,' she said, 'I'd be devastated if I thought you'd put someone to death.' "
New Hampshire's death penalty is limited to a short list of crimes, including murder of a law enforcement or corrections officer, murder for hire and murder during rape or attempted rape. Governor Shaheen has advocated expanding the list to include categories like killing witnesses or informers.
There are 3,600 people on death rows nationwide, and 87 death row inmates have been freed since 1973, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Boo.com, Online Fashion Retailer, Goes Out of Business

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 18

 BODY:
It was supposed to follow the dot-com fairy tale script. Two young entrepreneurs devise an idea for the next big e-commerce Web site, raise enormous sums of cash, spend lavishly on advertising, lose money on every sale, take the company public and make every employee a billionaire.
Today, Boo.com, a European fashion e-tailer backed by the French luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault, the Benetton family, Goldman, Sachs & Company and J. P. Morgan, among others, is insolvent and has been forced to call the liquidators, six months after its Internet debut. 
 The concept for Boo.com seemed plausible enough. Ernst Malmsten and Kajsa Leander, two 29-year-old Swedes, founded Boo.com here in 1998, planning to create an online fashion retailer that would provide global service in seven languages and multiple currencies. And, of course, the site would use the most advanced technology. Boo.com bragged of its ability to let users view products in three dimensions from 360 degrees, giving them a true sense of how a garment looked.
Investors were so taken with the idea and its two founders -- Ms. Leander had been an Elite model and both had started an online bookstore called Bokus.com -- that Boo.com was able raise $125 million almost immediately from an elite roster of the extremely wealthy. Before even starting Boo.com, the founders promoted the site in trade journals and glossy fashion magazines.
But it was also clear that the founders were excessively ambitious. The company established its headquarters on swanky Carnaby Street in London, with satellite offices in New York, Paris, Stockholm, Amsterdam and Munich. The staff expanded from 40 initially to more than 400. Employees routinely flew first class and stayed in five-star hotels, according to a former staff member. Many were given laptops and Palm Pilots for home use, according to this person, and the company used Federal Express to send regular mail.
"They had very little spending restraint, to put it mildly," said Noah Yasskin, an analyst at the London office of Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm.
The site itself was also plagued by technical problems and delays, and took twice as long as anticipated to develop.
Once up and running, it became clear that users without fast connections to the Internet could not use the site, a point Boo.com boasted about. That e-snobbery alienated customers with more modest modem speeds, which happened to be most of Europe and the United States, Boo.com's two most important markets.
"Ninety-nine percent of European and 98 percent of U.S. homes lack the bandwidth needed to easily access such animation," Therese Torris, an analyst at Forrester Research in Amsterdam, wrote in a report. And anyone with a Macintosh computer could not use the site.
While Boo.com later adjusted itself to allow users with slower connections and Macs to gain access, the changes came too late.
Sales for the first three months of the site's operation were $680,000, while the company was blowing through more than $1 million a month.
The end came as Boo.com's founders, with only $500,000 left, struggled in vain to find backers to plow more money into the site.
"We are deeply disappointed that it has been necessary to ask KPMG to become liquidators of the company," the co-founders and investors said in a joint statement. "The senior management of Boo.com has made strenuous efforts over the last few weeks to raise the additional funds which would have allowed the company to go forward with a clear plan."
Over the last several weeks, Mr. Malmsten and Ms. Leander, who together own about 40 percent of the company, had been pleading with investors to ante up more.
According to a spokesman for Mr. Arnault: "He didn't want to take the risk. He would have been willing to stay involved if he could have had more control." In fact, in an interview in Paris several weeks ago about his Internet holdings, Mr. Arnault refused to discuss Boo.com.
Whether Boo.com's failure presages further problems for clothing e-tailers is unclear. But some Internet analysts said Boo.com's rise and fall reflect a problem that goes beyond just selling clothes. .
"The market has woken up to the fact that the amount of business e-tailers like Boo.com generate is a lot lower than we anticipated," said Tony Shiret, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. "A key turning point was what happened in the U.S. over Christmas," he added, referring to many online retailers that reported missed sales projections. "It's been disappointing."
On Wednesday, PricewaterhouseCoopers released a report predicting that 25 percent of all Internet companies in Britain could exhaust their cash within six months.
Still, the problems at Boo.com problems were somewhat self-inflicted, Mr. Yasskin said. "They tried to do too much," he said. "Opening up in multiple countries simultaneously is impossible."
One major stumbling block for Boo.com may simply have been the type of merchandise it was trying to sell. "If you look at successful sites, they are driven by price," Mr. Shiret said. "It is very hard to sell clothing at a cost base that makes sense without the scale."
Indeed, Boo.com never competed on price like most other retailers; it hoped to woo customers with its interactive services and convenience.
Nonetheless, Boo.com might be worth something, even if it is only a fraction of the $400 million value its founders once ascribed to the company. KPMG, which is managing the liquidation process, said today that it had received more than 30 inquiries. In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph earlier this month, Mr. Malmsten admitted he might have made missteps. "We have made some mistakes and we were late with our launch, yes," he said. "But people are welcome to come 'round here into our offices and see what is going on now."

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Decline Again

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
New claims for unemployment benefits fell last week for the second consecutive week, leaving claims at a level suggesting that businesses are scrambling to find workers.
The Labor Department reported today that 276,000 Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits for the week that ended last Saturday, down by 21,000 from the previous week. That was the lowest level since April 15, when claims were at 258,000. 
 The decline was sharper than many analysts were expecting. They were forecasting that claims would fall to 295,000.
Two weeks ago, new applications for jobless benefits slipped by 7,000, to 297,000.
The more stable four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out week-to-week volatility, edged up slightly last week, however, to 289,750. That was the highest level since Jan. 15, when such claims were at 290,000.
The four-week moving average has been running below 300,000 since late October. Economists consider claims below 300,000 an indication of a tight labor market, meaning employers are having trouble finding qualified workers to fill job openings.

HEADLINE: Conflicting Views Hinder Dissidents on China Trade Vote

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
As political jockeying on a China trade bill entered an intensive final stretch, both the Clinton administration and its opponents claimed crucial backing today from persecuted democracy leaders in China and in exile.
The dueling claims are possible because the dissident community is sharply divided over whether China should have permanent trade ties with the United States, a decision many see as the most important test of American policy toward China since 1989, when Beijing ordered a bloody crackdown on democracy protesters. 
 While many of the bill's backers say that it appears headed for passage, both sides are continuing to fight for every vote in the House, where scores of lawmakers remain undecided.
In newspaper opinion pieces and lobbying calls on Capitol Hill, Chinese democracy leaders are expressing opposite views about whether permanent normal trade relations will increase or retard human rights and political freedoms.
The conflicting messages have largely neutralized the dissidents' impact on the vote, lawmakers said today, and appear to have driven a new wedge between opposition leaders who have long tended to fight among themselves instead of unifying against the Beijing government.
"The moment Congress says yes to permanent normal trade relations is the moment that China stops listening to what the United States says about human rights," said Wei Jingsheng, one of China's best-known dissidents, who spent 18 years in Chinese prison before becoming an exile in this country.
Mr. Wei, 50 years old, said he moved temporarily to Washington from New York so that he could lobby full-time to defeat permanent trade ties, one of the Clinton administration's top foreign policy priorities.
Congressional opponents of the trade bill staged a rally on Capitol Hill today in which they introduced several dozen Chinese workers, student leaders and veteran activists who urged Congress to vote down permanent trade ties.
But President Clinton is also pointing to support from well known opposition leaders in China and abroad.
He has cited on opinion piece written by Dai Qing, a Beijing-based human rights and environmental activist. He asked Martin Lee, a leading Hong Kong democrat who supports permanent trade ties, to help him lobby Congress. And the White House has distributed copies of a pro-trade message from what it called an underground democracy activist in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
Several Tiananmen Square student leaders, including Wang Dang and Chai Ling, have also said that they support granting China permanent trade status.
"I believe that permanent normal trade status, with its implication of openness and fairness, is among the most powerful means of promoting freedom in China," Ms. Dai wrote in an essay published in The Los Angeles Times. Ms. Dai is best known for seeking to stop China's giant Three Gorges Dam construction project and for investigating corruption within the ruling Communist Party.
The Clinton administration today sought to build momentum for the vote after two Congressional committees strongly endorsed the measure Wednesday.
The White House said President Clinton intends to make a short, prime-time television address on China Sunday night. But of the major national networks, only NBC has agreed to grant air time to the president, while CBS, Fox and ABC declined, network officials said.
In a highly unusual move, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan joined Mr. Clinton in the White House Rose Garden to lend his support. Though Mr. Greenspan has weighed in on legislation before, especially on fiscal and financial matters, the Fed chairman usually maintains impartiality on White House foreign-policy goals.
Mr. Greenspan, who was asked to speak out on China trade by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, said he supports the bill on economic grounds. He said the trade bill would have "profound implications for the free world's trading system and the long-term growth potential of the American economy."
On Capitol Hill, some Democratic and Republican lawmakers were still scrambling to secure Republican leadership support for a new Congressional-executive human rights commission to monitor China and advise Congress and the administration.
Legislation to create the commission is seen as essential to rounding up support for the trade bill among the large number of undecided lawmakers in both parties, many of whom say they are wary of sacrificing their annual review of China's trade status unless they create a new forum to monitor human rights.
Republican Congressional leaders have already agreed to support one part of the so-called Levin-Bereuter proposal, a provision that would help guard against sudden surges of imports from China.
But Republican leaders last night were still discussing whether to include language authorizing a human rights commission in the trade bill. Democrats are insisting that the trade and human right measures must be considered together in one package.
"Many of our colleagues are concerned that if the commission moves only in parallel legislation that it could falter and not become law," said Doug Bereuter, Nebraska Republican who co-sponsored the proposal.
Supporters scheduled a press conference for Friday morning to unveil details of the new legislative package, and Congressional aides said they expected several undecided lawmakers to announce their support for the trade bill at the same time.
The Capitol Hill rally was intended to refute White House claims that Chinese opposition leaders support elevated trade ties. Participants argued that by ending the annual trade review, Congress would sacrifice the only real leverage it has over China's behavior toward its own citizens.
"China will never change unless it's under pressure," said Wang Xizhe, a gray-haired veteran of the opposition movement who now lives in the United States. Mr. Wang wrote an influential essay criticizing the excesses of the Cultural Revolution in 1974 and had been in and out of prison for nearly 25 years before he fled China three years ago.
He said that without the annual review of China trade status, Beijing authorities might never have released him from jail.
"The debate in Congress each year was one of the few things to lift my spirits when I was in jail," he said.
But he acknowledged a deep split in the dissident community and he criticized exiled Tiananmen Square student leaders who support the trade bill as naive. "Some of us understand the Chinese people and some of us do not," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: RETIREMENT PLAN;
Benefits and Drawbacks to Bush and Gore Proposals for Overhauling Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Social Security is slowly going broke, says Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and the best way to avoid painful benefit cuts or tax increases is to establish private investment accounts through which workers could seek higher returns on their contributions to the retirement system.
Social Security is slowly going broke, says Vice President Al Gore, and the best way to avoid painful benefit cuts or tax increases is to channel money from the federal budget surplus into the retirement system. 
 The differences between the presidential candidates are clear enough. But behind their approaches are complicated policy and political considerations regarding the problem and the possible solutions.
 
How the System Works
Benefits to current retirees are paid out of payroll taxes levied on nearly all workers and their employers. Because the work force at the moment is large relative to the number of people who have retired, those taxes generate more revenue than is needed to pay benefits, a surplus of about $150 billion this year and $2.3 trillion over the next 10 years.
The excess revenue goes into a trust fund out of which future benefits can be paid. But the trust fund is not quite what its name implies. Rather than accumulating cash, it contains bonds issued by the federal government to the retirement system, a promise to pay back to Social Security the surplus funds when they are needed.
In the meantime, the Social Security surplus goes to other purposes. For years, the government simply spent it.
More recently, Congress and the Clinton administration have agreed to use the excess cash only to reduce the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public.
 
The Looming Problem
The current surplus in Social Security could turn to a deficit because of a demographic shift. Right now there are more than three workers paying taxes to support each Social Security recipient. By 2030, as the population ages and the baby boom generation retires, the ratio will shrink to 2 to 1.
Under projections by Social Security's trustees, payroll taxes would no longer cover benefits starting around 2015, forcing the system to begin relying in part on the interest payments from the trillions of dollars worth of bonds in the trust fund. By around 2025, the system would have begun redeeming the bonds out of general tax revenues to cover benefit payments, and by 2037 the trust fund would be exhausted.
At that point, if no changes were made, Social Security would be able to pay less than three-quarters of promised benefits.
The projections could change with the economy. Over the past few years, the date of insolvency has been pushed back to 2037 from 2029 because of economic growth that was stronger than expected.
Given that the economic assumptions underlying the projections are quite conservative, defenders of the current system say the odds are strong that Social Security will weather the next three or four decades without needing any major surgery. But the leaders of both parties say it is prudent to assume there will be a financial squeeze, and to deal with it as soon as possible.
 
Finding a Solution
President Clinton put an overhaul of Social Security on the table in 1998. But the two parties were unable or unwilling to reach a compromise.
There are only three basic options: Cut benefits. Increase the revenues coming into the system. Or increase the rate of return on the money coming into the system.
Some members of both parties have been willing to support benefit cuts as part of a package of changes. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, has proposed reducing cost-of-living adjustments. Representatives Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, and Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas, have proposed legislation that includes an increase in the normal retirement age, which is already rising to 67 from 65, to account for further increases in life expectancy.
There has been some talk of raising or eliminating the ceiling on earnings subject to payroll taxes (currently $76,200). But most politicians have steered clear of supporting higher taxes or lower benefits.
 
Private Accounts
In supporting private investment accounts, Mr. Bush's approach centers on increasing the return on the money coming into the system.
Mr. Bush has not provided a detailed plan. But most privatization proposals call for diverting two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax into accounts that would be owned and controlled by individuals. A worker earning $50,000 a year would have $1,000 a year going to a private account.
In return for the chance to invest the money themselves, workers would accept a lower guaranteed benefit from Social Security at retirement. The basic idea is that the guaranteed benefit could be reduced by more than the amount diverted into the personal accounts -- but that the returns generated for each worker by Wall Street would more than make up for the difference.
The Bush campaign notes that stocks earned an average annual return, after inflation, of 7.2 percent from 1926 to 1997. By contrast, workers born after 1963 can expect on average a return from their Social Security contributions of 1.9 percent, according to Social Security statistics cited by the Bush campaign.
Private accounts would provide a start on Social Security solvency over 75 years, the standard normally used in assessing the system's health, Mr. Bush has said. He has acknowledged that other steps, like benefit cuts, would be needed to finish closing the gap, but has not said what steps he would support.
 
Case Against the Accounts
However strong the performance of stocks in the past, there is no assurance that they will do well in the future. And even if they do match their historical performance, there will inevitably be ups and downs along the way.
People who retire and cash out their holdings in a bull market would do far better than people who have to sell while the market is depressed. And some people would no doubt make smarter investment decisions than others. Should large numbers of people lose money in the market, there would be tremendous political pressure to bail them out.
Some portion of any investment gain might be eaten up by the administrative costs of maintaining the accounts. And to the degree that payroll taxes are going into private accounts rather than to pay benefits to current retirees, the government would have to put additional money into the system, presumably by using the Social Security surplus. That in turn would reduce the amount of money available for debt reduction.
A diversion of two percentage points of payroll tax revenue would equal just under $1 trillion over the next decade. By not using that money for debt reduction, the government would add $300 billion to its interest bill in that period. So about $1.3 trillion of the $2.3 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years would be needed to finance a private accounts plan.
 
The Gore Approach
Mr. Gore starts with the premise that the current system should be left more or less intact. His plan is built on the idea that there should be a way to use the current budget surplus to help Social Security down the road. While the basic idea may be simple, the way the government handles its finances makes executing it quite complicated.
Since the Social Security system cannot keep big cash reserves of its own under the government system, the vice president wants to use all of the Social Security surplus and some of the general revenue surplus to eliminate, in 13 years, the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public.
Eliminating the debt would leave the government better able to borrow, if necessary, later on. By putting downward pressure on interest rates, debt reduction would also stimulate economic growth, creating jobs and producing more payroll tax revenue to help keep Social Security healthy.
Starting in 2011, Mr. Gore would funnel to Social Security an amount of money equal to the annual interest savings from debt reduction -- $100 billion a year at first, growing to more than $200 billion a year by 2015. Mr. Gore says the infusion would extend Social Security's solvency to 2054 from 2037 without having to cut benefits or otherwise alter the system.
 
Case Against the Gore Plan
While eliminating the debt would have substantial benefits, transferring the interest savings to Social Security would be little more than a paper shuffling exercise and would still leave taxpayers on the hook to pay for the shortfall in funds.
Since Social Security cannot hold cash, the transfers would be in the form of government bonds that would be redeemed at some point out of general tax revenue. In that sense, Mr. Gore's plan would in essence transform Social Security into a welfare program, Senator Moynihan said. Mr. Gore's plan would do nothing to address the underlying imbalance between how much the system takes in and how much it has promised to pay in benefits.

HEADLINE: Despite Overcrowding, Proposal for School Divides Queens Community

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
In many neighborhoods, it would be an easy question to decide: Should a long-vacant property, centrally located in one of the city's most overcrowded school districts, be used for a new 900-seat elementary school or for a Staples office supply store?
In Maspeth, Queens, just such a question has led to a wrenching debate, one that has spawned accusations that opponents of the school are hostile to minority immigrants and are putting up "not in my backyard" roadblocks, as well as angry declarations by those opponents that the government is planning to pirate private property. 
 Yesterday, the City Council Land Use Committee unanimously approved an application by the School Construction Authority to build the 900-seat school on the site, at Grand Avenue and 72nd Place. If the full Council approves the proposal, which is considered likely, the Board of Education will either have to get the property's owner to agree to sell the site -- which so far appears unlikely -- or take possession of it under eminent domain. The Council is expected to vote on the school next week.
The issues confronted yesterday are ones that the school board and communities throughout the city are likely to encounter with greater frequency in the coming years as the city faces a persistent crisis of overcrowded schools. With about one-third of the 32 community school districts operating above capacity, classrooms have been squeezed into converted bathrooms and utility closets, while trailers and other temporary buildings have taken over recreational space in many schoolyards.
At the same time, many vacant properties around the city -- and particularly in Queens, the borough with the most crowded school districts and a rapidly growing immigrant and minority population -- are former industrial properties that are chemically contaminated and undesirable, if not unusable, for schools.
Despite the overcrowding crisis, many residents of Maspeth say they prefer the building of a Staples store to a new school. They say a school will bring more traffic to two already clogged streets, slowing police and other emergency vehicles and endangering children and residents.
Robert F. Holden, a vice chairman of Community Board 5, said in an interview that the suggestion that Maspeth residents were anti-immigrant or racist was an insult.
"Instead of debating the issues, they smear us," Mr. Holden said. "As a civic association president, I have to look at all the issues.
"This is a case where there has been no civic planning," he said. "The community of Maspeth opposes this because we live there. I want to know how many members of civic groups support this."
On the other side of the debate are the Board of Education, the parents of many of the schoolchildren in Community School District 24 and several local politicians, who express incredulity that some people think the community is more in need of paper clips and cheap pens than a place to teach children how to read.
"I cannot understand how anyone would want a Staples rather than a school in this emergency situation," Claire Shulman, the Queens borough president, said Tuesday at a public hearing about the school application. "On this site, in a neighborhood where the schools are so overburdened, the needs of children must come first."
Few people disagree that new schools are needed in Queens, where all seven school districts operate at or above capacity. District 24, which includes Maspeth, is at the top of the list; its 37,000 elementary and middle school students exceed the district's planned capacity by 20 percent.
Since 1990, the Board of Education has added 12,500 seats in the district, said Patricia Zedalis, chief executive of the board's school facilities division. And while an additional 6,000 seats are scheduled to be added over the next four years, the board expects the student population to grow by 11,000 in that time.
In June 1999, the Board of Education began pursuing use of the site, which contains the shell of a former Edwards Supermarket that closed in December 1997. But the board was six months too late for the property's owner, Benenson Capital, which in December 1998 signed a 20-year lease with Staples.
Supporters and opponents of the school packed a public hearing at City Hall on Tuesday, and they disagreed on virtually every aspect of how the school would affect the neighborhood. Differing studies on traffic patterns and parking were offered, to applause and hoots from the audience members.
Opponents mentioned the frequent accidents on heavily traveled Grand Avenue and the existence of what they called a "hot sheets motel" nearby as reasons that a school was inappropriate. They said a Staples would provide a much-needed economic lift to the area's businesses.
There was an undercurrent of racial tension at the hearing, where those who opposed the school were largely white and elderly and most of those who supported the school were minorities. Maspeth, a blue-collar neighborhood whose ethnic mix is largely Italian, Irish, Polish and German, has recently become home to more Asian and Pacific immigrants and more apartments and multifamily dwellings are being built.
People on both sides said that at a December hearing at Community Board 5, which voted against the school, several Maspeth residents said they feared the school would bring children from heavily immigrant neighborhoods into Maspeth.
School officials say that children will not be bused to the school from faraway neighborhoods, but that the school will draw children from two nearby, overcrowded schools in neighborhoods with diverse student populations: P.S. 102 in Elmhurst, where 9 percent of the children are white, 31 percent are Hispanic and 57 percent are classified as "Asian and other"; and P.S. 229 in Woodside, where 33 percent of the students are white, 38 percent are Hispanic and 27 percent are Asian and other. In each school, less than 2 percent of the students are black.
But opponents of the school proposal also say that they have been unfairly criticized as being anti school, antichildren and anti-immigrant, particularly by people who favor the school but have never been to the site.

Winners, Don't Take All

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Gail Collins is on vacation.

 BODY:
At stake in next week's vote by Congress over whether to grant China permanent normalized trade relations -- which in plain English means a long-term, open trade relationship between America and China -- is not just the future of U.S.-China relations but also the future of the Democratic Party.
Let's be honest, we have a bizarre situation here that can't go on indefinitely for the Democrats: We have the leadership of the Democratic Party, including the president, at war with its rank-and-file labor union base. Labor is now spending millions of dollars on a nationwide jihad to kill what would be one of President Clinton's most important foreign policy achievements: bringing China's 1.3 billion people under the rules of the World Trade Organization and into a long-term open trading relationship with the U.S. 
 There is only one way to heal this breach in the Democratic Party, and that is, first, for labor to be thoroughly defeated on this China vote.
Because only once this deal is passed, only once one-fifth of humanity -- the Chinese people -- have been brought into the W.T.O. and into an open-ended trading arrangement with the U.S., will labor's leadership have to conclude that, at least for now, it is time to stop fighting over whether we globalize and to start focusing instead on how we globalize. Labor then might finally put forward a positive global agenda that addresses how to strengthen U.S. workers -- other than by pushing hidden and real trade barriers. Labor's failure to do that up to now has only been eroding its own power and has put it in a reactionary corner with Patrick Buchanan.
But while defeating labor on this issue is necessary, it's not sufficient. As dangerous as losing this China trade bill would be for the Democratic Party, and the country as a whole, equally dangerous would be if the winners treat victory on this bill as a final victory against all the forces in this country uncomfortable with globalization, and therefore a free pass to forget the concerns about free trade.
I disagree with labor's stand on China, but the zeal with which labor's rank and file have fought this war, and the passive support the unions clearly have around the country, underscore that there are real anxieties out there -- about globalization, about losing manufacturing jobs to lower-wage countries, about people feeling that they are not winning from this new economy the way they would like -- that would be reckless to ignore.
If at this time of rising prosperity in the country as a whole, with unemployment at record lows for all sectors of the population, a bill to extend permanent normal trade relations to China can win only by one vote, then, folks, we have a problem. Imagine what will happen when we have our next, inevitable, recession and unemployment really rises. There could be a ferocious backlash against all these free-trade initiatives and a real mass move to put back the walls.
That's why now is the time to be addressing the anxieties and myths about globalization. That is what a united, progressive Democratic Party agenda should be about. But while progressive politics requires a labor base that is ready to embrace the new economy, it also requires business and government leaders ready to finance the training programs, health care reforms, public education programs and labor laws that give workers the security to try to master change rather than stop it, and to open up, rather than hunker down.
Right after this vote, if labor loses, would be the ideal time for a labor-government-business conference in which government and business say to labor: Look, we know you have concerns; what can we do to address them without putting up walls?
I believe you dare not be a globalizer in this world (and this is business' mistake), an advocate of free trade and integration, without also being a social democrat, ready to spend what it takes to bring the have-nots, know-nots and left-behinds along -- otherwise they will eventually shut the doors on you. But you dare not be a social democrat today (and this is labor's mistake) without also being a globalizer, because without embracing globalization and free trade you will never have all the resources, markets, immigrants and knowledge needed to keep generating rising incomes to redistribute.
The trick is finding the right balance. Defeating labor on this China bill is necessary for that, but it will be sufficient only if the winners also draw the right conclusions.

HEADLINE: Time Warner and Disney Agree to End Dispute About Cable

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
Time Warner and the Walt Disney Company have reached an agreement in principle that will end their rancorous dispute over the cable transmission of television channels owned by Disney, the Time Warner chairman, Gerald M. Levin, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting yesterday.
Neither Time Warner nor Disney executives would discuss the specific details of the agreement yesterday, saying that it needs to be committed to contractual language first. But one executive close to the negotiations said that it was "completely an economic deal," meaning that it would not specifically address Disney's demands for assurances about the pending merger between America Online and Time Warner. 
 Disney had raised concerns that the new company would deny access on the Internet or cable television to competitive providers of entertainment and information.
In his remarks to the shareholders, Mr. Levin said that the deal was a result of direct negotiations between Robert A. Iger, the president of the Disney Company, and Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, and that they had reached what he called a handshake agreement. A Time Warner spokesman, Edward Adler, later labeled it a "telephonic handshake."
Executives at each of the companies said that the refusal by senior executives to discuss the details was a result of the bitterness that has surrounded the negotiations. The tensions led to Time Warner's decision to take Disney's ABC stations off its cable systems on May 1. Time Warner had declined a Disney offer of a one-month extension in the negotiations.
The move proved calamitous for Time Warner when the company was criticized by consumers, editorial writers and politicians in New York and Washington.
Time Warner restored the service one day later, agreeing to an extension until July 15. Mindful of that fallout, Mr. Levin said in his remarks at the annual meeting that Time Warner had apologized to consumers and regulators for terminating access to ABC stations. Then he added that the companies had reached an agreement in principle to resolve what he called their commercial dispute.
The executive close to the negotiations said that Mr. Levin's careful language was an indication that the resolution would deal solely with the financial details of Time Warner's agreement to continue carrying the ABC stations and would not specifically address Disney's concerns about the merger with AOL.
"Obviously this agreement is an enormously positive step," the executive said. "Whether it's the last step or not, time will tell."
Disney executives challenged some aspects of the merger in meetings with both Congressmen and representatives of the Federal Communications Commission last week. Though Disney did not ask the commission to block the merger itself, Disney did request that it issue certain directives that would ensure that competitors received the same full access to consumers that any AOL or Time Warner company received after the two companies merged.
Disney's worries about whether a combined AOL and Time Warner would wield too much control over access to both the Internet and cable distribution became a factor in what had been longstanding negotiations over how Disney would be compensated for the transmission on Time Warner cable systems of the ABC stations that Disney owns.
Disney had backed off a deal that was near completion when the AOL merger was announced. Time Warner contended that after the merger announcement, Disney greatly increased its financial demands, to a point where it would have cost Time Warner another $300 million over 10 years. Disney disputed that figure.
The money was to come to Disney in fees for carrying cable channels that Disney owns, including the Disney Channel, the Soap Channel and Toon Disney.
The rancor escalated into the showdown at the beginning of the month, when Time Warner pulled ABC off the air in a number of cities including New York, Los Angeles, and Houston. ABC reacted by placing advertisements in many papers urging consumers to purchase satellite dishes to circumvent Time Warner's cable service. ABC agreed to pay the cost of the dishes.
That move greatly angered Time Warner officials, who said Disney was directly threatening their business.
But there were indications early this week that the two sides were getting closer because the ads for ABC's satellite deal were pulled from newspapers starting Tuesday.
And earlier this week, Time Warner reached agreement with NBC for transmission of that network's stations. "That move sort of isolated ABC," a Time Warner executive said. "It helped move things along."

HEADLINE: Disabled Girl Is Found Dead, Amid Signs of Malnutrition

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN and C. J. CHIVERS 

 BODY:
A 5-year-old girl who had cerebral palsy was found dead in her Bronx apartment Wednesday, and a preliminary report by the chief medical examiner's office yesterday indicated that her tiny 17-pound body showed signs of acute malnutrition.
The police and prosecutors detained the child's mother for more than 24 hours before deciding to release her. Law enforcement officials said last night that a final autopsy would be needed before they determined whether to seek criminal charges against the mother, Ebony Carzan, 24, in the death of her daughter Ahsianea. 
 Investigators said that the woman's three other children appeared healthy, but that the apartment was a filthy shambles, that no food was in the refrigerator, and that roaches had bitten Ahsianea, who was no taller than a toddler and had the weight of an 8-month-old baby.
Until a further investigation is done, the authorities said, it is impossible to say whether the child's death was the result of parental neglect or the sad end of a life stunted by extreme physical problems, inadequate resources and family conflict.
"This may be a misguided mother who attempted to take care of a child that no one could take care of," a senior police official said. "We don't know if this was neglectful, if it was a mother incapable of doing the right thing, or if it was a mother who was doing the right thing."
Late yesterday evening, Alberta Hanley of Harlem, the child's paternal grandmother, whose call brought the police to the child's death bed, provided a copy of a long e-mail letter she said she had sent more than a year ago to Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner of the city's Administration for Children's Services. In the letter, she accused the mother of a systematic pattern of abuse and neglect, and said that the agency's caseworkers had repeatedly failed to take action, and she begged for help.
Starting in 1996, "I personally witnessed forms of abuse," the grandmother wrote in the e-mail message, which was posted to the city's official Web site on Feb. 22, 1999. It goes on to refer to numerous calls made to the state child abuse hot line.
"The outcome is always the same," the e-mail message said. "Services are offered to the mother. She complies as long as an A.C.S. worker is assigned to her, her case is closed. The abuse begins again."
The agency's Web site notes that complaints cannot be accepted by e-mail, but must be called in. Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that the surviving children had been placed in foster care and that the way the case had been handled was under investigation.
Based on court records and interviews with child welfare officials, lawyers and police officials, Ahsianea Carzan's short, difficult life had become a source of angry charges between her estranged parents and had been the subject of at least two court-ordered investigations by the city agency responsible for protecting the well-being of the city's most vulnerable children.
As recently as last December, a law enforcement official said, the mother took the child to a doctor. Ahsianea then weighed less than 17 pounds, the official said, but given the great difficulty of nourishing a child with her severe disabilities, the doctor found no reason to suspect neglect. Cerebral palsy, usually caused by lack of oxygen and nutrition to parts of the brain before birth, can cause a wide range of problems, including a failure to grow normally.
Twice, the child was the focus of inquiries by the Administration for Children's Services. In November 1998, child protective workers checking a report of medical neglect arising from the parents' custody dispute in Family Court found that the mother was providing "adequate care," and referred Ms. Carzan to programs providing help with housing, counseling and support for children with cerebral palsy.
Child welfare officials closed the case in August 1999.
Then last October, responding to another in a series of accusations by the child's father, Caseim Brown, 29, a caseworker from the Administration for Children's Services visited the apartment to check on the children, Family Court records show. The caseworker found two older siblings -- a girl, 7, and a boy, 6 -- in good health, but apparently left without seeing Ahsianea. The court records said the father had been uncooperative in the investigation.
Court records indicate that child welfare authorities had reason to be cautious about the father's complaints because he had a long history of domestic violence against Ms. Carzan, and had repeatedly violated orders of protection requiring him to stay away from her. Ms. Carzan, who also has a 16-month-old child, had repeatedly fled from him, living at a domestic violence shelter in Staten Island in 1996, and in apartments in Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx.
Prosecutors in the Bronx said Mr. Brown is currently facing criminal charges that he choked and punched Ms. Carzan last September and took her cell phone and jewelry, and he has pleaded not guilty.
In an interview last night, Mr. Brown, a barber, said that when he picked up his three children for visits, they often appeared dirty and thin, but did not seem dangerously uncared for. Ms. Carzan, he added, did not drink or use drugs. To avoid confrontations with her, he said, he always picked up the children at the 40th Precinct station house in the Bronx. He said he last saw them over Thanksgiving.
Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in Ahsianea when she was 1 or 2 and she became blind as a result when she was 3 or 4, Mr. Brown said.
Efforts to locate Ms. Carzan last night for comment after her release were unsuccessful.
At 5:36 Wednesday morning, when the police entered the sixth-floor apartment in the Patterson Houses, they found the child's body in bed, wearing a diaper, with roach larvae in her hair. A law enforcement official said it appeared that the 7-year-old girl had at times been the caretaker for her little sister, who was so physically disabled by her congenital condition that she swallowed with difficulty.
A law enforcement official said of the mother, "She was probably giving up on the child. It took about an hour to feed her."
Neighbors watched through peepholes as the police and emergency workers arrived at the dingy public housing project at 2465 Third Avenue where the Carzan family had lived for less than a year. Several said they were astonished to learn of Ahsianea's existence. DeNobia Brooks, 23, remembered glimpsing her once before Christmas, "a thin little girl in a wheelchair" that Ms. Carzan was pushing to a bus, but then simply forgot that a disabled child was part of the Carzan family because she did not see Ahsianea again.
Rafaela Martinez, who lives down the hall from the Carzan family and is herself raising a foster child with cerebral palsy, said she had regularly seen the two older children playing in the hallway in their school uniforms, but had no idea that Ms. Carzan, who was not known to socialize in the building, had been caring for a child like Ahsianea. "I wish I had known," Ms. Martinez said. "I would have lent her a hand."
More recently, the son of another project resident reported he had seen Ahsianea. "My son told me she was so skinny, so small, like a little bird," said April White, who lives in another building in the project.
Dr. Irwin Redlener, a pediatrician who directs the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, said that although cerebral palsy can range from mild to catastrophic, at the severe end of the spectrum the children are very hard to nourish and require a complicated array of medical specialists to keep them from succumbing to infection.
"Children like this put fantastic stress on families," he said. "It is even more stressful to families with little economic resources. This is a very malnourished child with cerebral palsy. The question is, under any circumstances, could this child have been better nourished?"
Across the hall from the family apartment, Agnes Berger and her daughter, Michele, were unwilling to pass judgment too quickly. "A lot of people are at fault here, not just the mother," Mrs. Berger said.

HEADLINE: Expecting Fraud, Peru Challenger Drops Out of Presidential Runoff

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, May 18

 BODY:
The outspoken challenger in Peru's presidential race said today that he was pulling out of the runoff election scheduled for later this month because he believed the vote would be a fraud.
The challenger, Alejandro Toledo, asked President Alberto K. Fujimori to delay the vote to mid-June, so international election monitors could test computer systems to ensure a clean vote. Even then, Mr. Toledo did not promise to participate unless he received equal time on the main television stations. 
 But President Fujimori rejected such an idea before Mr. Toledo made the request. For several days, Mr. Toledo had threatened to back out of the race, and earlier today, Mr. Fujimori told campaign audiences that he would not change the election day.
Mr. Toledo's withdrawal leaves Mr. Fujimori open to win a third five-year term in voting on May 28. But it could prove to be a Pyrrhic victory, capping a campaign tainted by international observers' complaints of dirty tricks and vote tampering in the first round, on April 9. In that vote, the president fell just short of an absolute majority, forcing a runoff with Mr. Toledo.
Should Mr. Toledo and Mr. Fujimori hold firm, the Clinton administration and the Organization of American States would be put in the difficult position of having to validate an uncontested re-election victory or reject it because of irregularities. A decision to reject the election could lead the United States Congress and the Organization of American States to apply economic and political sanctions to Peru, which would be damaging not only to the country's weak economy but to its alliance with Washington in the fight against cocaine trafficking.
"I hope President Fujimori will not push the country over the cliff," Mr. Toledo said at a brief news conference this evening. "We are firm. We will not participate in a fraudulent election process like the one of the first round."
Over the last several days, Mr. Fujimori has publicly pledged that he would not change the election date no matter what Mr. Toledo or the Organization of American States observation team said.
"There are some who say we should postpone the elections," Mr. Fujimori said at a rally in the city of Chiclayo on Wednesday night, "but we just won't do it." He ridiculed Mr. Toledo, saying the challenger was trying to destabilize the country by traveling to Washington and Buenos Aires in recent weeks to complain that the election process had been so corrupted that it was probably impossible for him to win.
Tonight, the National Elections Commission, the final authority on elections, announced that it would not change the election date. Upon hearing the news, at a rally tonight in Lima, Mr. Toledo said: "The dictatorship has taken the cruel decision of staying in power. We will not allow five more years." He then called on the country's university students to take to the streets to defend democracy in peaceful demonstrations.
 At a campaign rally yesterday in Ayacucho, 230 miles southeast of Lima, protesters yelling, "Get out, tyrant!" stoned Mr. Fujimori's pickup truck, cracking the windshield, The Associated Press reported.
In the April voting, ballots were counted over three days amid calls by the Clinton administration and the Organization of American States that a second round was necessary to ensure a fair result.
Mr. Toledo, a 54-year-old, American-educated business professor, has been threatening to drop out of the race ever since he came in second in that vote, a tactic that has sometimes made him look indecisive and like a sore loser. But today he cited a new report by the Organization of American States observation team calling for a delay in the election, and said he was only following the recommendations of a nonpartisan body invited by the Fujimori government.
In the report released today, the organization's team sharply criticized the election authorities for choosing a new computer software program since the April vote without consulting foreign or Peruvian opposition monitors.
Organization of American States monitors said there had been tampering with ballots, but most important, it said that the disappearance of ballots and tally sheets for hours at a time when votes were supposedly being counted made it impossible to verify the results.
"This second round of the presidential election has to choose a winner with a clear and transparent result," the report concluded. "But confidence continues to be lacking, and the calendar conspires against recuperating that confidence."
Referring to the new computer software, the report continued: "When did they initiate the development of this new application, and why did the National Office of Election Processes not share this information?" It added that "the election calendar makes it impossible to do a complete test" of the new software to ensure that it would give the opposition access to the final count as the votes are being counted.
In endorsing the findings of the report, Mr. Toledo said that even if the vote were postponed, he might not re-enter the race.
"The dirty war against my candidacy must end," he said, referring to a campaign by several tabloid newspapers and several television stations of either not covering his campaign or filling their coverage with stories about his marriage, allegations that he has a daughter outside of marriage and claims that he has a drinking problem.
At another news conference today, officials at the National Office of Election Process disputed the Organization of American States report. They said they needed to change the computer program because, unlike the first round of voting, the May 28 ballot would not include congressional races. They also said that all of the software was being properly shared with the opposition.
Aides to Mr. Toledo said they concluded that they needed to take drastic action to prevent fraud after they completed their own study that showed that in scores of remote voting sites, Mr. Fujimori had inexplicably high vote counts last month.
For example, in some vote tables, Mr. Toledo received no votes. In polling places outside Lima where there were no independent observers, Mr. Fujimori received a strong 57.8 percent of the vote, more than 8 percentage points higher than his national total, according to the official count.
Mr. Toledo's aides again demanded today that the local poll-watchers in April, who were chosen by lottery, be replaced by new monitors in the second round. But Mr. Fujimori's allies in Congress have refused to change a law that requires that the same poll-watchers who worked in the first round be used in the second.
In an interview Wednesday night, Mr. Fujimori denied that there would be any fraud or problems in the May 28 vote. "At this moment there are no more irregularities," he said.
Under Peruvian law, the runoff must be held within 30 days of the publication of the final results of the first round. The election board announced the outcome of the presidential vote on April 12 -- three days after the vote. But the counting in other races has dragged on for weeks, especially for congressional races, so the opposition has proposed that a final round of voting could be held 30 days from today, on June 18.
On Wednesday night, Mr. Toledo's advisers had decided to give Mr. Fujimori a 48-hour deadline to comply with their candidate's demands. But during the news conference today, Mr. Toledo issued no ultimatum and simply said he would pull out of the May 28 vote.

HEADLINE: Social Security, as Seen at 19 and 65

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (column, May 17) suggests that the market's current overvaluation makes this an inappropriate time to invest Social Security in stocks. Much as I agree with his valuation assessment, participant contributions to the proposed plan would be only 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax.
It's not that significant amounts must suddenly be invested at inflated market levels. Rather, this amount (presumably adjusted for inflation) would be invested yearly throughout a participant's 40-year working life, which would smooth the ups and downs of the market over time. 
 Historically, from almost any starting point, long-term returns have exceeded the 1.5 percent that a current participant realizes on his or her Social Security contributions.

City's Jobless Rate Is Lowest Since '88

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York City fell sharply in April to the lowest level in almost a dozen years, according to data released yesterday by the State Department of Labor.
In the five boroughs, the jobless rate dropped to 5.5 percent, down from 6.4 percent a year ago. Though the unemployment rate in the city is now lower than it has been since December 1988, it remains far higher than the national average of 3.7 percent and the statewide average of 4.4 percent. 
 Adjusted for seasonal factors, unemployment in the city fell about three-tenths of a percentage point in April, while the jobless rate in the rest of the state rose by that amount. Nationally, the unemployment rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point.
Because the unemployment rate is based on a small survey and is extremely volatile, many economists prefer to look at data on job creation. In that regard, the city and its suburbs continue to boom. Employers in the city added more than 16,000 jobs in April, and those on Long Island created more than 15,000.

HEADLINE: A Happiness Index With a Long Reach;
Beyond G.N.P. to Subtler Measures

BYLINE: By ALEXANDER STILLE 

 BODY:
After eight years of record-breaking economic growth, many people assume that the presidential election will be determined by the stock market. But social scientists and communities from Jacksonville to Honolulu are beginning to say, "It's not just the economy, stupid."
They are looking beyond purely economic numbers -- at health and crime statistics, clear-air days and commuting time -- to gain a fuller measure of people's elusive sense of collective well-being, to create what is essentially a happiness index. In the process they are making some surprising discoveries. 
 On a national level, William J. Bennett, the conservative writer and political adviser, has begun producing an index of leading cultural indicators, while the environmentally oriented group Redefining Progress has created something called the genuine progress indicator, in which social costs like legal fees, medical bills, divorce and crime are subtracted from the gross national product to measure the state of the nation. At the same time, a recent proliferation of local monitoring groups like Sustainable Seattle, Livable Tucson, Minnesota Milestones and Oregon Benchmarks show a growing interest in measuring the quality of life and values like friendliness and vitality in their communities.
"What I think this shows is that there is something out there that all of us are trying to capture that is extremely important," Marc Miringoff, a professor of social sciences at Fordham University, said in an interview. His own social health index is one of the most systematic nationwide surveys.
Mr. Miringoff and others are pushing hard to promote the idea of a regular national social report card similar in nature to the index of leading economic indicators.
"If the country knows that interest rates are up by one-quarter of a percent, people need to know that the we have a child poverty indicator that is the worst in the industrial world," Mr. Miringoff said. "When that hits a new low, bells ought to go off the way it does when Alan Greenspan decides to slam the breaks on inflation. That should be reported on CNN and be part of the political discourse."
In the last 20 years every other major industrialized country from Britain and Norway to Turkey and Japan has begun to publish an annual social report, even though the idea originated in the United States. In 1929 President Herbert Hoover sponsored a comprehensive social report that was published five years later. And in 1967, Senator Walter F. Mondale, the future vice president, proposed creating a permanent Council of Social Advisers, like the Council of Economic Advisers, to produce regular reports on social issues. The idea was shelved after the Democrats lost the presidential election of 1968.
It's back, the sociologist Ron Inglehart speculates, because now that many people's immediate material needs have been met, some Americans are developing post-materialist values.
And what these latest indices show is that whoever is doing the measuring -- left-of-center groups concerned with social justice or conservatives worried about moral values -- the overall trend has been downward over the last 30 years despite the growing prosperity.
Mr. Miringoff's social health index -- which combines 16 social indicators, including child poverty, infant mortality, crime, access to health care and affordable housing -- plummeted from a rating of 77 out of a possible 100 in 1973 to 38 in 1993. And although Mr. Bennett placed a greater emphasis on cultural issues like out-of-wedlock births, divorce, community participation and levels of trust or distrust in government, he arrived at similar results.
True, in the last few years Mr. Miringoff's index showed that the country has made a small but appreciable jump, from 38 to 46 from 1993 to 1997. It is a trend that Mr. Bennett has reported as well. "The decade of the 90's has seen progress in some key social indicators: reductions in welfare, violent crime, abortion, AIDS, divorce and suicide; upswings in SAT scores and charitable giving." Even so, according to the various measurements of social well-being Americans are, on the whole, richer but unhappier than they were three decades ago.
Some people are wondering whether these findings might help explain the mysterious X-factor in American political life: why there are so many disenchanted voters in a period of unprecedented prosperity? "The decline in the index coincides with the decline of trust in government," according to surveys, Mr. Miringoff said. Could it also account for such diverse phenomena as the popularity of Ross Perot, Jesse Ventura and the Reform Party; Pat Buchanan's and Ralph Nader's presidential bids; and the recent protests against globalization in Seattle and Washington?
"No one is saying this is a perfect science," Mr. Miringoff said. "But the fact that Bennett, who is looking at moral and cultural things, and I, who take a more social and economic approach, come to similar conclusions says something interesting."
Not everyone has confidence in these measures, however. "The problem I have with some of these indices is that they start to take on a political connotation," Benjamin M. Friedman, a political economist at Harvard University, said in an interview. He criticizes Mr. Bennett's attempt to quantify moral values by looking at rates of divorce and participation in church groups as well as Mr. Miringoff's decision to include income inequality in his social health index. "I happen to think income inequality is very important, but some people don't consider it a problem," Mr. Friedman said.
Mr. Friedman favors simple bare-bones indices like the United Nations human development index, which has three sets of statistics: per capita income, life expectancy and educational enrollment. By this measure, the United States ranks No. 3 in the world, after Canada and Norway. "Everyone agrees that life expectancy is a good thing," Mr. Friedman says. At the same time the United Nations international poverty index ranks the United States No. 17, at the bottom among industrialized nations.
But Mr. Miringoff argues that while there is a subjective and political element to any survey, many of the categories he includes in his social index -- alcohol-related traffic deaths, youth suicide, teenage drug use, infant mortality, low-weight birth, unemployment, real wages and child poverty -- involve hard data on matters of obvious importance.
The reason for exploring the messier world of social health, he explains, is that in the post-industrial economy, per capita income and gross national product don't reveal as much as they once did. Until about 30 years ago social indicators like crime, infant mortality, drug and alcohol abuse moved up and down with the G.N.P. Now they no longer do.
"It used to be that a rising tide lifted all boats, but at a certain point during the 1970's, social health and per capita income split apart," Mr. Miringoff said. "And this may be a result of the new economy: the loss of steady, well-paid jobs with benefits for less skilled, blue collar workers."
The very element Mr. Friedman suggests eliminating -- income inequality -- may be the key indicator for understanding the phenomenon, Mr. Miringoff says. While per capita income rose on aggregate, average weekly wages went down from a high of $315 in 1973 down to $256 in 1996, measured in constant dollars. The income of the top fifth of the population went from $86,000 to $125,000, while that of the bottom fifth dropped from $11,640 to $11,388. The percentage of children living in poverty went from 14.2 percent in 1973 to 22 percent in the early 1990's and has only recently dipped below 20 percent. These economic factors, which affect access to affordable housing and health care and are reflected in both Mr. Miringoff's social index and the genuine progress indicator, may help account for some of the symptoms of moral decline noted by Mr. Bennett: increases in crime, alcohol-related deaths, drug use and out-of-wedlock births.
Meanwhile, a measure like the genuine progress indicator put out by Redefining Progress tries to include things like time spent taking care of children and doing household work, which are not counted in the G.N.P., and subtracts other items like legal and medical bills, commuting time and money spent on locks and house alarms.
While it may be difficult to reach a national consensus on what to measure, many states, cities and counties are creating their own scales. In Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, has adopted Mr. Miringoff's social health index without controversy to measure social problems and formulate policies.
In Traverse City, Mich., which is at the center of five rural counties, a local group instituted a quality of life index by surveying 2,000 residents about what they considered important. "They put three things right at the top: environment, education and public health," said Mary Swaney, research coordinator for the project. "Out here -- we don't have too much money but a great environment -- we have an expression, 'A view of the bay is worth half the pay.' " The city's bay opens into northern Lake Michigan. Among the measures adopted to track the state of the environment is a count of the number of bird and frog species.
The Michigan group also measures things like shoplifting and litigation as signs of social trouble and the number of septic tanks as a way of tracking sprawl, something residents say they would like to avoid.
In Tuscon, the city is gearing up to count pedestrians in different neighborhoods because many residents said they felt safer and happier seeing other people out on the streets. John Laswick, the manager of Tucson's Sustainable Communities Program, says the sudden concern for quality-of-life issues, even in affluent places like Tucson, is a symptom of rapid economic growth and sprawl. "Sprawl has become a big issue in the last couple of years," he said. "I think that with the last five minutes of commuting time, something snapped. I think that intuitively people sense that there is something wrong there. They are missing relationships, community, urban form and a connection with the environment -- things that are not measured in the G.N.P."
In many cities and states, like Jacksonville, Fla., the indices are used by local government to assess the performance of city agencies. Jacksonville, Tuscon and other cities have not yet combined their numbers into a single index but are looking for ways to study the links between their various measures. "There are a set of connected relationships that define community health," said Mr. Laswick of Tucson. "People's perception of the safety of the schools affects whether parents let kids walk to school or drive them. If they insist on driving them, that means more oil dripping on the roads and into the streams. We are trying to show that there are these connections. People are looking for a more subtle and more meaningful way of measuring what's important to them."

HEADLINE: Abner Levin, 88; Ran Store at Dawn of LP Era

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE 

 BODY:
Abner Levin, a music connoisseur and a former geAbner Levinneral manager of Sam Goody's record store in Manhattan, died on May 12 at a convalescent home in Hilo, Hawaii. He was 88.
In 1948, at the dawn of the era of the long-playing record, Mr. Levin joined Sam Goody's to manage its flagship store. Goody's went on to become a New York phenomenon and the largest record retailer in the America, and one of the first to discount prices. 
 Mr. Levin listened to records virtually every minute of his waking day and decided which records Goody's would stock. He was also editor, publisher and music critic of a monthly catalog, The Long Player, one of the first critical guides to LP's.
Abner Fisher Levin, who was known as Abbey, was born on Dec. 24, 1911, in Hartford. He graduated from New York University with a degree in economics and attended Columbia University. He had scant formal music education.
"My musical education really began when I got a part-time job in a record store," he said in 1954. "It was during the Depression and customers were scarce. I spent most of my time listening to records."
At the Goody's store on West 49th Street and Broadway, 4,000 customers a day would jam the aisles, browsing through bins crammed with 38,000 albums, an impressive number before the advent of chain stores and the Internet. In 1955, Goody's cash registers rang up 7 percent of the total national sales of 33 1/3-r.p.m. disks.
After leaving Goody's in the mid-1960's, Mr. Levin worked briefly at Folkways records with Moses Asch, the founder, before managing an Eastchester, N.Y., store owned by Columbia Records. He remained there until his retirement in 1979.
Mr. Levin is survived by his wife of 67 years, the former Flora Mishkin; a daughter, Jo Levin of Manhattan; two sons, Robert Levin of Manhattan, and Andrew Levin, a state senator in Hawaii; and one grandson.

Trade Deficit For March Hit $30.2 Billion

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit widened to a record in March as surging demand for oil, automobiles and other imports overpowered a second consecutive monthly increase in exports, government figures showed today.
The deficit in goods and services deepened to $30.2 billion in March from $28.7 billion in February, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected a $29.5 billion deficit. Although the United States shortfall with China narrowed, record imports from Japan, Canada and Western Europe caused the trade gaps with those regions to widen. 
 "We are buying from everywhere," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. "The rest of the world is purchasing U.S. products but clearly cannot keep up with the effervescent American consumer."
Total imports and exports rose to records in March. That underscores the economy's strength, which has led Federal Reserve policy makers to raise the overnight bank lending rate six times since last June -- to a nine-year high of 6.5 percent -- in an effort to slow growth and keep a lid on inflation.
William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said today that a further benefit of the Fed's actions might be to reduce "the excessively large current account deficit," which adds investments to calculations of trade.
Imports of goods and services in March rose 3.4 percent, to $117.4 billion, as the average price of crude oil increased to the highest level since the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990. Higher oil prices pushed total crude oil imports to a monthly record of $7.6 billion.
Excluding oil, imports still rose 2.5 percent, led by the largest increase in auto deliveries since August 1998, when General Motors workers returned to assembly lines in Canada and the United States after a two-month strike.
Imports of consumer goods -- including clothes, furniture, appliances, compact discs and pharmaceuticals -- rose 5.6 percent, the biggest gain since March 1998. Imports of building supplies like lumber, plywood, shingles and wallboard also rose.
Exports increased 2.9 percent, to $87.3 billion, as shipments to Canada, Mexico, Western Europe and newly industrialized countries including Korea and Taiwan set records. Much of the gain came in goods for business investment like industrial machinery and computers.
The rise in exports might have been higher if Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, had not reported delays in shipments because of a 40-day strike by its largest union of engineers, which was settled in March. Aircraft exports fell 49 percent in March after declining 37 percent the month before.
For the first three months of the year, the trade deficit totaled $86.3 billion, compared with $54.2 billion in the corresponding period of 1999. The trade deficit totaled a record $267.6 billion for all of last year.

HEADLINE: Traveling On the Wings Of the Dollar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Just before his wedding in 1985, Mark Lesser priced a honeymoon in Paris. Even though the dollar was stronger then than at any time since the early 1970's, the trip was out of the question.
But in August, Mr. Lesser, 37, and his wife, Stacy, will celebrate their 15th anniversary in Paris and Nice. 
 "I saw how much further the dollar would go," said Mr. Lesser, now the sales director of an Internet software company and a resident of Manalapan, N.J. Fifteen years ago, he said, "Our income was a quarter of what it is now, so now is just a good time for us."
Now seems to be a good time for other American travelers, too. Like the Lessers, many are reveling not only in their increased income, but also in their incredible buying power abroad. The value of the dollar has surged recently against most of the world's currencies, but especially against the euro, which 11 European nations introduced as their common currency in 1999. As the dollar rises, the costs of hotel rooms, restaurants and related items generally decline for Americans, making foreign trips enticing.
The European Travel Commission, based in Brussels, expects 12 million Americans to visit Europe this year, a 3.5 percent increase from last year and the seventh consecutive annual increase.
"I have never seen it quite as heavy as this year," said Iris Citron, the president of Creative Travel in Springfield, N.J., and Mr. Lesser's travel agent. There is an "enormous amount of travel to Europe by people who in the past would go on inexpensive cruises or cheaper trips to the Caribbean."
Still, low air fares and individual feelings of wealth are driving summer travel plans more than the currency's strength, some travel agents say.
"I think it's a very big year for Italy, and Paris is packed," said Jackie Rush, vice president at Waters Travel in Washington. "It's only because we are so affluent here; we are so rich."
Though travel agents say many of their clients do not realize what a bargain Europe is, some tourists go on spending sprees when they see how far their dollars will go. Savvy travelers pay for their hotels after they arrive, when they can more easily take advantage of rates quoted in the local currency instead of buying travel packages in dollars, said Ralph Ferrara, president of Schneider Travel, a small agency in Butler, N.Y.
The dollar generally peaked in 1985, but it has surpassed or reached its levels then against a few of the 11 currencies that the euro is replacing. So far this year, the dollar has gained 12.2 percent against the euro. And it is up 16.5 percent since last summer, making a significant dent in prices in Continental Europe.
(Until January 2002, when euro bills and coins will begin to circulate, the individual European currencies are being used for most purchases, although credit card charges and electronic payments are calculated in euros.)
Against the Portuguese escudo, the dollar has eclipsed its 1985 level. It is virtually at its 1985 level against the Italian lira and just below its 1985 peak against the Spanish peseta. And it has climbed to levels not seen since the summer of 1986 against the German mark, the French franc and the Dutch guilder.
The euro ended yesterday at 89.71 cents, just a bit above its record low, making the dollar worth 2,158 lire, 185.45 pesetas, 223.45 escudos, 2.18 marks, 7.31 francs and 2.46 guilders.
The dollar is moving higher against other major currencies, too, though the rally has been smaller. It has risen 11.2 percent against the British pound since January and is now the strongest there since the spring of 1994. Against the Canadian dollar, the United States dollar is moving back toward its record high of the summer of 1998. Even against the Japanese yen, it has eked out a small gain recently, though it remains 27 percent below its most recent high in August 1998.
Though the rise of the dollar against the pound has been enough to cut vacation costs in Britain by 7 percent since last summer, a trip to Canada will still cost about 1 percent more than last summer. And a trip to Japan will be a lot more expensive, with the dollar down more than 9 percent from a year ago.
The flip side of a stronger dollar, of course, is that it becomes more expensive for others to travel to the United States.
So far, however, Europeans have not cut back significantly on American travel. According to the latest available data from the United States Commerce Department, tourism from Western Europe grew 5.6 percent in 1999. It was up 11.9 percent from Spain, 7.5 percent from the Netherlands, 4.5 percent from France, 4.4 percent from Germany and 2.5 percent from Italy.
And the Commerce Department predicted this week that the growth would continue as the economic revival in Europe helps offset the decline in purchasing power from weaker currencies. For this year, the government forecasts that the number of visitors from the Netherlands will increase 6.8 percent from a year ago; Spain, 6.6 percent; France, 5.6 percent; Germany, 4.4 percent; and Italy, 3.5 percent.
Though final figures on American travel for last year are not yet available, the Commerce Department says the number of Americans traveling by air to Western Europe jumped 7.4 percent in the first three months of 1999 from the comparable period a year earlier. Travel by Americans to all other countries rose 7.7 percent over that period. Preliminary data for the entire year show that 24.6 million Americans traveled overseas by air, excluding trips to Mexico and Canada, for a 6.5 percent increase over 1998.
People simply have more money in their pockets, said G. Anna Schoeman, an agent with Polk Travel in Denver. Only about 20 percent of her clients mention the dollar's power as a factor in their travel decisions, she said.
"Incredibly inexpensive air fares are more of a motivation than the strength of the dollar," she said. "When you can go from Denver to London for $450 or Denver to Paris for $500, the strength of the dollar might come up after they purchase their ticket, and maybe even after they arrive in Europe."
Laird G. Newman, an analyst with Andersen Consulting, said he was pleasantly surprised after he arranged an April trip to Italy through Ms. Schoeman. "We did find that the dollar was at the exchange rate" of 2,000 to 1, "and we thought, 'That's great,' " he said. "We ended up doing a lot and spending a lot and thinking how great the dollar was."
As Americans spot bargains in foreign goods, American-made products are becoming more costly to Europeans and others. And some analysts suspect that the strength of the dollar may be cutting into American exports. In 1999, total American goods sold to countries in the European Union rose 1.9 percent, down from gains of 5.9 percent in 1998 and 10.2 percent in 1997.
Given that much of the world is still rebounding from financial crises in 1997 and 1998, "The most plausible reason for the decline is the appreciation of the dollar," said Gordon Richardson, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington.
But it is too early to see a clear pattern, in part because the pickup in economies around the world may be hiding the dollar's effect. Trade data released yesterday showed that American exports rose to record levels in March.
The increase in short-term interest rates this week by the Federal Reserve has given the dollar yet more support. And the strength of the American economy is attracting foreign investment, which also helps bolster the value of the dollar.
But the Federal Reserve is intent on slowing the torrid pace of growth of the American economy. Once signs of slowing appear, the dollar should begin slipping. That will cut into the buying power of American travelers. But it may take a real economic slowdown and not just a slip in the currency to stem the tide abroad.
Ms. Rush, the travel agent in Washington, said, "I don't believe for one second that the euro going up will slow the flow of Americans going to Europe."

HEADLINE: After a Victory, Ethiopia Looks Toward Other Fronts

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: BARENTU, Eritrea, May 19

 BODY:
It took three days for Ethiopian troops to battle their way into this town, and now that they have it, they are pressing deeper into Eritrea, denying with every step that they plan any long-term invasion of their neighbor and once-tight ally.
"We have no intentions, no plans, no need to occupy Eritrea," an Ethiopian commander, Col. Gabre Kidane, said tonight as he stood on the old Italian fortress in this hilly town 45 miles inside Eritrea. "The only intention we have is to weaken the forces that have occupied our country and to regain our sovereignty. That is all." 
 A week after Ethiopia started an offensive that it says is aimed at ending the two-year-old war, it is now clear that the whole of Eritrea could become a battlefield. With hundreds of thousands of civilians fleeing the region, Colonel Kidane said Ethiopian soldiers continued to skirmish with Eritrean soldiers on the run here in western Eritrea.
Tonight, Ethiopian officials said planes bombed the main Eritrean military training center at Sawa, an American-built base 100 miles west of Asmara, the capital. The officials also said they had taken a village, Maidema, 30 miles from Asmara, on the way from the western front to the central front along the disputed border. That is where the next round of fighting, already heavy, is generally expected.
For Eritrea, Ethiopia's rapid advance out of the border trenches into the countryside is not merely a military setback. For 30 years, when Eritrea was the northernmost province of Ethiopia, rebels fought two successive governments in Addis Ababa for their independence. Those rebels, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, now are in power in Eritrea, and they say this advance is a frightening continuation of Ethiopia's attempts at domination.
An Eritrean government statement said today that a bombing on Thursday south of the port of Massawa killed a civilian. That death, the statement said, was "further evidence of Ethiopia's resurgent aim to annex this country and, in so doing, to make targets of Eritrea's civilian populations."
Ethiopia said the target was a military installation.
The paradox is that the leaders of Ethiopia fought side by side with the Eritreans to oust the military government of Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. For the first few years, the two governments were close friends, so close that they never demarcated the border when Eritrea became independent in 1993.
But tensions grew over personality clashes and economic rivalry, exploding in May 1998 when Eritrea claimed the Badme border region based on old colonial maps. Eritrea moved troops into the area.
Ethiopia said it was invaded, and a war ignited that has defied long peace talks and claimed tens of thousands of lives on both sides.
Until Ethiopia began its offensive last Friday, the fighting had been confined to three fronts along the 620-mile border. But since then, Ethiopia has pressed 65 miles into Eritrea, displacing 340,000 people, the World Food Program said today.
Officials in neighboring Sudan said today that an additional 50,000 Eritreans had fled across their border. In both places, relief officials said, people lack food and shelter. Even without the war, the United Nations says 800,000 Eritreans face food shortages because of drought.
Most civilians fled from around this town, the regional capital and a strategically important point because the area was a main supply route for Eritrea's westernmost front.
The battle has been intense. Starting on Monday, Colonel Kidane said, Ethiopian troops had pounded areas around the town with bombs, tanks and artillery and then engaged Eritrean troops along a mountain pass eight miles from town.
Along the heavily mined road from the south, the route of Ethiopia's advance, huge numbers of empty mortar shells, captured Eritrean ammunition and destroyed trucks from both sides remain. At spots, the smell of rotting corpses was strong. Colonel Kidane would not give the number of casualties.
On Thursday morning, Ethiopian troops took the town, the biggest one that they have captured, and called it a major victory. The Eritreans said they had staged a tactical withdrawal.
This evening, Ethiopian troops milled around and ate their rations at the hilltop building that was once a fortress for Italian troops in the colonial period and that, until Thursday, according to the Ethiopians, was the command center for Eritrean troops in the region. The Ethiopians joked about marching on to Asmara.
"It's nice to take the place of the invading army," said an Ethiopian soldier, Seife Yechenku, 21, who has fought in the army since the war began. "There is no question I am very happy."

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Court and Congress

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Today's conservative critics often condemn as undemocratic the Supreme Court's power to hold legislative actions unconstitutional. Former Judge Robert Bork has gone so far as to propose, in the name of democracy, that all Supreme Court decisions be subject to reversal by majority votes in Congress.
This week's Supreme Court decision striking down part of the Violence Against Women Act as beyond Congress's power over interstate commerce puts those critics in something of an ironic bind. Most of them probably disliked the act. But the court's 5-to-4 majority overrode a signal example of the democratic process: years of hearings and mountains of evidence showing that violence against women is so pervasive in this country that it affects interstate commerce. 
 I think it was a close case. The provision struck down by the court, allowing abused women to bring civil damage suits in federal courts, was indeed at the edge of Congressional power. On the other hand, Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion for the majority was troubling in the way it substituted its appraisal for Congress's careful effort to show the effect on national commerce.
The really troubling part of the decision is the larger context. In a series of cases in recent years the five-member majority of this court has undertaken to cut back the power of Congress vis-a-vis the states.
For the first time in half a century the majority has second-guessed Congress's exercise of its commerce power. The same majority, in its most extreme decisions, has held that Congress cannot authorize damage suits against state institutions to enforce federal wage-hour and other laws.
In those cases the majority seemed to believe that it was returning to a historic role of the Supreme Court in protecting the states from federal power. But a masterly recent article in the Columbia Law Review, by Prof. Larry D. Kramer of the New York University Law School, shows that view of history to be a myth.
In its early days, Professor Kramer points out, the Supreme Court repeatedly upheld such expansive federal legislation as the establishment of the Bank of the United States. It took a broad view of the federal power over commerce. Before the Civil War, the court stepped in only once to protect state sovereignty. That was in the ill-fated Dred Scott case.
In fact, as Professor Kramer says, "States do most of the governing in this country." Their law covers most contracts, property, torts, domestic relations, crime and so on. So despite the vast growth of federal law, the states have held their own. They have done that, mostly, not because of protection by the Supreme Court but because our political traditions and institutions work in that direction.
"This system may not be perfect," Professor Kramer concludes, "but its costs are probably less than those likely to follow from aggressive judicial intervention in politics. . . . More than two centuries of successful federalism without the aid of an aggressive judiciary suggests that no such intercession is needed."
The practical difficulties of trying to draw judicial lines on what is "interstate commerce" are also great. The Supreme Court tried that early in the 20th century, for example deciding that mining was not "commerce." That effort collapsed.
If the violence against women case and other recent decisions are part of a judicial effort to define categories of activity that are beyond federal power, my guess is that it will not work. Our economy and society are too dynamic to be confined in such abstract terms.
But it does not seem to me unwise to have the Supreme Court as an ultimate protector of federalism. Politics, for example, has not proved to be effective in keeping federal criminal law out of traditional state areas. Paranoia about drugs and crime has led to much unwise federalization of criminal law.
For such reasons, Prof. Gerald Gunther of the Stanford Law School took a benign view of the violence against women decision. The court should have paid more heed, he said, to the record made by Congress. But "it was not a catastrophe."
What would be a catastrophe is a headstrong majority pressing a dubious historic vision to a serious clash with Congress, and with reality.

HEADLINE: U.N. Expands Troop Limit For Mission In Sierra Leone

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 19

 BODY:
The Security Council today increased the number of troops allowed in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone by 2,000 and is likely to expand the force by several thousand more in the next week or two.
The Sierra Leone mission, originally limited to 11,000 troops by the council, is already the largest United Nations peacekeeping operation anywhere. 
 But today's increase was required after reinforcements from Bangladesh, Jordan and India arrived this week. Those troops were expected to push the force above the limit set in February, just before the United Nations took over peacekeeping in Sierra Leone from a regional contingent led by Nigeria.
But another increase to as many as 16,500 troops, which Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to recommend to the council in the next few days, will represent a substantial commitment to bringing peace to Sierra Leone, even while rebels there are still holding more than 300 peacekeepers hostage.
Some hostages have been freed, but with alarming delays, United Nations officials said. Releases have been promised, then have not taken place, causing the United Nations to increase the number of troops listed as missing. More than 500 soldiers and monitors, most of them African, were seized by rebels at the beginning of the month.
Any increases in the size of the peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone pose a problem for American diplomats here because they are expected to give Congress, where there is considerable opposition to these operations, 15 days' notice of any new or augmented mission. The administration can waive this notification, as it apparently did for today's vote, but the procedure could seriously delay the next move in Sierra Leone.
Meanwhile, officials are concerned about how a weak elected government in the capital, Freetown, will deal with Foday Sankoh, the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, whose forces took the hostages. Mr. Sankoh is now in custody after nine days in hiding. But the fact that the government has not decided what to do with Mr. Sankoh appears to be emboldening some of his followers to demand that he be freed if the war is to be settled.
The government said today that it was investigating Mr. Sankoh's case. His troops have been responsible for savage brutality in a civil war that has lasted nearly nine years. In 1997, Mr. Sankoh was sentenced to death for treason. In an agreement signed in Lome, Togo, last July, Mr. Sankoh was nevertheless given amnesty -- not recognized by the United Nations -- in return for a promise to disarm. But when his soldiers began turning in weapons to peacekeepers, rebels in the group responded by taking the hostages.
Today, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative at the United Nations, who introduced the resolution to enlarge the peacekeeping force, said that Mr. Sankoh had violated the Lome agreement, implying that all promises made to him in the peace accord were off. Mr. Sankoh had also been promised a role in a power-sharing government.
Ambassador Greenstock also warned that there could be no negotiating for the release of hostages or attempts to link the fate of the United Nations soldiers to any other issue.
Britain has about 800 troops in Sierra Leone who were sent to evacuate foreigners. But now those troops are playing a major role in keeping Freetown reasonably calm, United Nations officials say.
With an increase in United Nations troop strength for Sierra Leone, Nigerian troops are likely to return to the country, along with other West African peacekeepers representing a regional organization, the Economic Community of West African States and its cease-fire monitoring group, known as Ecomog. It is still not clear whether they will be under direct United Nations command or deployed in some other way.
In Monrovia, Liberia, today, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a special envoy sent to the region by President Clinton to work for the release of the hostages, said that there was no room for negotiation. "Peacekeepers cannot be target practice for the R.U.F.," he said. Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, another former rebel leader with ties to Mr. Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front, has been credited with a role in the freeing of about 150 hostages before the releases stopped.
Mr. Jackson told reporters in Monrovia that during an earlier stop in Lagos, he had urged Nigeria to send more troops to Sierra Leone to help settle the political crisis. "They have the power to remove the R.U.F. as a military consideration in negotiations," he said at a news conference at Monrovia's airport.

European Cities Of Two Minds On One Bourse

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 19

 BODY:
The pioneering merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges is running into heavy resistance in both cities.
In Germany, regulators and the nation's state-owned banks fear that Frankfurt will lose control over the market for small growth companies, which has been a huge success here in the last three years. 
 In Britain, the fear is that Frankfurt will grab all the good business and that London traders will be left with little except the costs of switching over to Frankfurt's system for electronic trading.
Some British executives also complain that the merger has been engineered by big American investment banks that want lower trading costs even if London is diminished as a financial center.
But even some of Europe's biggest trading institutions, which badly want a more efficient pan-European stock market, are complaining that the deal announced two weeks ago has serious problems.
"Everyone is in favor of getting a single trading system, but this isn't the way to do it," said an executive at a London trading institution. "This is two exchanges that are trying to carve up everything for themselves and monopolize the market."
Under the deal, the market for smaller growth stocks is to be based in Frankfurt while London assumes responsibility for blue-chip stocks.
But the two exchanges also plan to form a joint venture with Nasdaq, which is focused on the same kinds of small technology stocks in the United States. The joint venture will be incorporated in London.
Executives at both exchanges say their merger plans are still on track. The supervisory board of Deutsche Borse, the parent of the Frankfurt exchange, will vote next Tuesday on the plan, which needs support from three-quarters of the members.
But at least 2 of the 21 board members have publicly criticized the plan. More ominously, the economics minister for the state of Hesse, who regulates the Frankfurt exchange, is raising pointed questions as well.
And Donald Cruickshank, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, acknowledged on Wednesday that members of the London exchange would not approve the merger until they received more detailed information. That will not be coming until July, because many details remain to be negotiated.
In the meantime, Dieter Posch, the economics minister of Hesse, the state that includes Frankfurt, has demanded that the Deutsche Borse answer a list of 14 detailed questions.
Addressing Werner G. Seifert, chairman of Deutsche Borse, Mr. Posch questioned whether it was even realistic to create a system that would operate under two regulatory regimes -- a British one for blue-chip stocks, and the German one for small growth stocks.
Mr. Posch also demanded to know whether the Nasdaq venture would be managed from London; why the parent company of the new exchange, called iX, will be based in London; and whether German investors might end up paying higher transaction fees if they had to buy German blue-chip stocks in London.
Germany's powerful Bundesbank, whose board members heard a presentation by Mr. Seifert on Thursday, seems to cautiously support the merger.
At a news conference today, a Bundesbank board member, Hans Reckers, warned that Frankfurt had to keep control of trading in small growth stocks but said that the merger was fundamentally positive.
The main opposition in Germany appears to be coming from publicly owned savings banks and cooperative banks. Manfred Zass, head of the DGZ Dekabank in Frankfurt and a member of the German stock exchange's supervisory board, said on Wednesday that he would not agree to a merger that amounted to a "takeover" of the Frankfurt market.
Heinz Hilgert, a managing director at SGZ Bank, a cooperative bank in Frankfurt, said today that the overriding fear of smaller banks was of losing control of the market for growth stocks -- the "neue markt."
"This is clearly the domain of cooperative and public-sector savings banks, in both I.P.O.'s and in trading," Mr. Hilgert said. "The growth of this growth market has been in German, not Spanish, not French and certainly not British," he added, referring to companies.
Mr. Hilgert predicted that Nasdaq's American executives would inevitably view London rather than Frankfurt as their European center.
But some British executives are worried that London will lose its primacy, noting that Mr. Seifert is to become chief executive of the combined entity.
"The proposed takeover of the London Stock Exchange -- for that is effectively what it is -- by the Deutsche Borse has serious implications for London's continued role," wrote George Cox, director general of a British business association called the Institute of Directors.
In a letter to The Financial Times, Mr. Cox said that Mr. Seifert "is hardly likely to have London's interests as his main concern" and that the merger was being promoted by a small group of "powerful stock exchange members, all of whom appear to be American."
Goldman Sachs was the lead investment bank advising Deutsche Borse, while Merrill Lynch was among the banks advising the London Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Guatemalan Squatters Torching Park Forests

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: EL CEIBAL, Guatemala

 BODY:
The distant roar of howler monkeys echoed like a ghastly dirge on a recent day in the smoldering remains of a thick forest of palms, cedar and mahogany. Illegal loggers had cut down the best trees and hauled them off at night, while land-starved peasants torched what remained to clear the land for cornfields.
The effect of a population boom here has been disturbingly visible during the peak of the dry season in April and May, with the area's natural beauty shrouded in smoke from countless fires. 
 Although El Ceibal is a national park that is home to Mayan ruins, it is protected only on paper. The fires were set by invasores, or squatters, more than 200 of whom have lived in the park in two settlements of thatched-roof shacks since 1998.
They are part of an unending internal migration to Guatemala's Peten region, which covers a third of the country. It includes the sprawling, environmentally sensitive jungles of the Maya Biosphere Reserve, which is rich with wildlife, thick clusters of trees and majestic temples. The area's population is estimated to have grown from 20,000 in 1960 to almost a half million today -- not all illegal, but nonetheless harmful.
The fires, by and large, are set; some are from slash-and-burn farming gone awry, and others are touched off by poachers who hunt armadillos and large rodents by smoking them out of burrows and hollow logs. Some are even believed to be set by poor peasants who hope that the local authorities will hire them to help the understaffed local fire brigades.
The migration, with its accompanying fires and deforestation, underscores the problems facing Guatemala as it emerges from 36 years of civil war, ending in 1996. Peasants, including thousands who returned after years of exile in Mexico, scramble to find a patch of land they can farm. In their struggle for self-preservation, conservation is forgotten. And the government lacks money and manpower to fight all the fires, much less arrest wrongdoers.
"The Peten has served for the last 20 years as a pressure valve," said Roan McNab, the Guatemala program director for the Wildlife Conservation Society. "How can Guatemala prioritize conservation in the face of overwhelming pressure? When you're hungry for tomorrow, it's impossible to think 20 years down the road."
Since early April, fires have raged not only in El Ceibal, but also in several larger parks inside the reserve, scaring off or killing wildlife. The Guatemalan government mobilized soldiers and authorized $400,000 to fight the fires all over the country, a small amount for damage that is expected to extend to 125,000 acres, if rains do not start soon. But the aid has been slow to get to the hardest-hit areas.
The United States and Mexico have lent helicopters to help spot the fires and to bring water and food to park workers who have been battling the flames, snatching a few hours of fitful sleep on palm fronds spread on the jungle floor.
While the blazes can be battled, if slowly, it has proved more difficult to stem the flood of people who see the Peten as the promised land. It is a deceptive vision of lush land, since the thin layer of humus is unsuitable for agriculture. Settlers burn trees and bushes to enrich the ground with nutrients, which makes the land arable for three years at most. Then new land is cleared.
Peten natives used to earn a living by carefully managing the forests, tapping the sap from chicle trees for export to chewing gum manufacturers or plucking the leaves of xate palms to be used overseas in floral arrangements. The area's remoteness was its best protection.
But in the western part of the reserve, where oil production has been allowed, squatters followed the roads built to carry oil, carving out settlements when they could not find work in the oil fields.
Neria Virginia Guerrero Pinelo, who grew up in the central Peten, remembers how, as a child, she saw planes before she ever saw a car. When a road was built from Guatemala City in the 1960's, the transformation for the worse began. The situation deteriorated further during that era as the government encouraged development through an agency essentially run by the military that cleared land for farms and cattle ranches.
Now, she said, native Peteneros are in the minority, squeezed out by migrants from the south who bundle their belongings into pickup trucks and head to the Peten like latter-day Okies.
"They think the Peten is a paradise, and they hear the land is so rich," she said. "They come looking for work, but there is no work, so they take a little piece of land for a cornfield. There are large groups that go in, and they begin to cut trees and burn."
Some squatters, desperate for money, have been enlisted by illegal loggers who give them chain saws to cut down trees, then use them as security guards, having dozens ride on the trucks with their illegal bounty, ready to confront any authority who would try to stop them. In several recent instances, policemen or park workers were reported killed or tortured by squatters working for the loggers.
In El Ceibal, the squatters do not bother to hide. Their houses line the road into the park. The buzz of chain saws is common, said park workers, who, fearing attack, try to avoid the squatters. A few months ago, the squatters stole the solar panel that powered the park's only phone to prevent the administrator from calling the authorities.
Recently, while workers were trying to clear areas with machetes to contain a fire, the squatters were right behind them putting fresh wood on the fire, park workers said. There have also been scattered incidents of squatters stealing Mayan artifacts.
"When they finish with the wood, they will throw themselves into excavating the ruins, because that will be all that is left for them to destroy," said William Perlas Pineda, El Ceibal's caretaker.
Conservation has been difficult to promote. When Guatemala established the National Council for Protected Areas, peasants were angered that someone would interfere with their ability to use the land as they saw fit. Most regard the idea of protected lands as something foisted on them by groups from the United States and Europe.
"Some say we are protecting land for the gringos, while we Guatemalans have a right to land," said Marie Claire Paiz, the administrator of the Sierra del Lacanadon National Park.
Ms. Paiz said the peace accords' reference to every Guatemalan's right to land has been broadly interpreted. "Public land is seen as nobody's land," she said.
Equally new is the idea of enforcing the country's environmental laws, considered the best in Central America. Park workers and the police grouse that when they talk to squatters about their illegal land use, they are quickly told that to remove them would be a violation of their human rights. There is also fear that forcing the squatters to move would be denounced as mistreatment of indigenous peoples.
The government has been working with some international groups to sort out a quagmire of land titles, and it started a program this year of low-interest loans to acquire land. Officials have also enlisted international conservation groups to negotiate with the squatters to relocate them outside of environmentally sensitive areas. The Peten governor is trying to find land in a nearby town to resettle the El Ceibal squatters.
"There have been some positive examples of such moving, but very few," said Goran Fejic, director of the United Nations' mission monitoring the peace accords in Peten. "You need a long-term strategy of social development."
While some people fault the government for a lack of political will to address the problems, some initiatives are seen as hopeful signs. The government has been granting 25-year land concessions to some communities, letting them live off the area's above-ground resources as long as they come up with management and business plans.
The village of Uaxactun has the largest such concession, more than 200,000 acres. Run by a local assembly assisted by outside advisers, the concession has developed plans to sell allspice, xate palm and handicrafts.
To keep squatters out, Uaxactun has been made accessible only by passing through the guarded gates of Tikal National Park, to the south. Anyone wishing to move into the village must be approved by the entire community, though no one has yet to get the nod. Recently, a family whose carelessness led to a fire's getting out of control was expelled. But residents worry that the government may allow oil exploration nearby, which would mean more roads and settlers.
"Other people look at this with an eye to destruction," said Julio Cesar Corado, the vice president of the assembly. "Our plan is to manage and conserve this. Our area is rich, but we are not trying to get rich. We are only looking for equality among the members of our assembly, human rights, health and schools for our children."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Stock Prices Fall as Fears of More Interest Rate Increases Grow

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
United States stock markets suffered another down trading session yesterday as investors became increasingly afraid that the Federal Reserve plans to raise short-term interest rates through the summer.
Technology stocks led the way down, with the Nasdaq composite index falling 148.31 points, or 4.2 percent, to 3,390.40. But other indexes were not spared, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 30.26 points, or 2.1 percent, at 1,406.95. The Dow Jones industrial average finished at 10,626.85, down 150.43 points, or 1.4 percent. 
 As has been the case for most of May, trading volume yesterday was light, with investors in no hurry to buy the new-economy companies they craved so ardently earlier this year.
Investors had shaken off their pessimism earlier, with rallies on Monday and Tuesday in advance of the Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point. Bulls had hoped that Tuesday's increase might be the Fed's last, because rate increases slow the economy and can hurt corporate profits.
But now investors seem to think that the Fed is not done. "After the rate hike, there was temporary euphoria. People said, 'They did 50 basis points. Phew, that's going to be it,' " said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners, which manages more than $1 billion. "Now people are saying that there's going to be more." (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
 Barton Biggs, the global strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and a longtime bear, said he expected more rate increases. "The cyclical news on inflation is not good. Wage costs are increasing, and wage costs are sticky, so once they get embedded in the system, it's not so easy to get them out," he said. With energy prices also increasing, the Fed has no choice but to raise rates to slow the economy, Mr. Biggs said.
"Interest rates are going up," he said.
In addition, many money managers say they believe that the biggest technology companies will have to drop further before they are reasonably valued compared with both nontechnology companies and smaller Internet-focused technology names like Ariba and Phone.com. Last month's sell-off brutalized the money-losing companies that soared to huge valuations in 1999 and early 2000 as investors threw aside traditional valuation measures. Some of those stocks are down as much as 80 percent from their highs of March.
But their bigger cousins, like Cisco, Oracle and JDS Uniphase, have come through the last two months relatively unscathed. At 53 7/16, Cisco is down roughly one-third from its March 27 high of 82. Oracle has dropped to 70 1/16 from 90, a 22 percent slide.
Still,the technology leaders are hardly cheap. Both Cisco and Oracle trade at more than 100 times trailing earnings, almost four times the valuation of the average S.& P. 500 company and a level rarely seen before the last two years. Now, many professionals think the rout in the technology sector will not end until even the megacaps feel significant pain.
"The bear market is incomplete in technology stocks and the Nasdaq," Mr. Biggs said. "In this next stage, the big-cap tech companies that are wonderful companies but very overpriced stocks are going to get hit." He expects the Nasdaq to fall below 3,000, a drop of more than 10 percent.
Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter and a longtime technology bull, expects the Nasdaq to remain at its current levels until the fourth quarter of this year, when earnings at leading technology companies finally begin to catch up with their stocks.
"Some of the smaller ones are getting reasonable, but you look at a Microsoft or Cisco, and they've come down by half, and they're still expensive," Mr. Murphy said.
Still, Mr. Murphy said he did not think the Nasdaq would fall below 3,321.29, its April 14 low, and he advised investors to remain patient. Demand for technology stocks is stronger than ever, he said.
"What's supporting the market is earnings. Earnings are just great," Mr. Murphy said. "Internet traffic is still doubling every 100 days. That's a huge driver. Computing is strong; communications is very strong, and consequently, semiconductors look good."
Michael Manns, senior portfolio manager at American Express Asset Management in Minneapolis, said he did not expect to see a commitment of capital to technology stocks until the Fed finishes raising short-term rates. "Investors are nervous," he said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Manns plans to keep buying technology and telecommunications. He recently attended a conference of automotive and industrial companies and found they were spending heavily on Internet equipment as a way to cut their operating expenses.
"Industrial companies are looking at the Internet as a really concrete way to lower their procurement costs and rationalize S.G.& A.," Mr. Manns said, using a common term for selling, general and administrative expenses, or corporate overhead.
"This is the area of growth in the marketplace," he said. "I'm willing to go ahead and buy on the dips."
For now, individual investors seem to concur. AMG Research, which tracks purchases and sales of mutual funds, said $7.9 billion flowed into stock funds for the week ended May 17, including almost $600 million into technology funds.

Challenging Islamic Myth on Organ Transplants as Ailments Rise

BYLINE: By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., May 17

 BODY:
Even now, six months after her decision, Najah Bazzy's family is still upset with her. Her 14-year-old daughter pleads with her to reconsider. Older relatives fear that she has offended God.
But Mrs. Bazzy is resolute. When she dies, her heart, liver, kidney and lungs will be donated. While thousands of other people have made the decision to sign organ donor cards or become live donors, Mrs. Bazzy's declaration is controversial. As an Arab-American Muslim, she is part of a community that ardently believes it is forbidden for Muslims to donate organs, even to a relative. To see Heaven, they say, their bodies must return to God in one piece. 
 These days, that notion is being challenged as increasing numbers of Arab-Americans here in what is perhaps their largest and most influential community in the United States, as well as their relatives back home, are found to have liver and kidney disease.
"There is a saying in Islam: He who saves a life saves humanity," said Mrs. Bazzy, a 40-year-old Lebanese transcultural nurse who is spearheading an initiative to include in Islamic wills a section for organ donations. "Why are we so eager to take our organs with us and give up the opportunity to save a life? How do I know I'm not depriving the world of a genius?"
That is why religious leaders are rallying with doctors and community outreach workers to dispel a decades-old myth that the Koran forbids organ donation.
At the same time, the International Association for Organ Donation, a year-old nonprofit organization founded by a former marketing executive whose teenage son was battling kidney disease, has started an education campaign. By introducing reluctant donors to Arab-American patients waiting for transplants and by holding dinners, distributing posters, bumper stickers and T-shirts, the group hopes to sign up thousands of the more than 275,000 Arabs here and in parts of Detroit. Doctors say organ transplants between relatives or people of the same ethnicity have a higher rate of success.
"There is no Islamic taboo banning the donation of organs," said Imam Hassan Qzawani, who heads the Islamic Center of America, which has more than 8,000 members and is one of Detroit's largest mosques. "People have reservations because it was not practiced in the old countries and because of Islam's strict guidelines about disfiguring the body. But as long as you're not giving your eyes or an organ that is needed for one's own survival, we have the right to help save someone's life."
Nadia Hammoud, 29, tried desperately last year to persuade her father to accept a kidney from his son. But he opted for a cadaver donation, which later failed.
"He would have waited another eight years rather than take it from my brother," Ms. Hammoud said.
In Michigan, about 20 people are waiting for either a kidney or liver transplant, said the Gift of Life Transplant Society of Michigan, which only last year started studying Arabs as a separate group. In the last six years, only one Arab-American donated an organ in Michigan, though at least a dozen have received transplants, doctors and organ donation researchers say.
Of the 69,399 patients waiting for organ transplants in the United States, it is unclear how many are Arabs. The United Network for Organ Sharing, in Richmond, Va., which oversees transplants in the United States, traditionally counts Arabs as Caucasian, a spokesman said.
But Joanna El Hajj, a health care coordinator at the Arab Community Center for Economics and Social Service, said she needed only to pick up her phone to know that the numbers were growing. The calls come with frightening frequency, Mrs. El Hajj says. Almost every day she is talking to someone, or the relative of someone, waiting for a kidney, liver or bone marrow transplant. The center routinely sponsors fund-raisers to help patients across the country pay medical bills and bring sick relatives to the United States for help.
"Four years ago, I would get maybe one call, two calls," said Mrs. El Hajj, who recently decided to become a donor. "Now, every day there is a new case. I get calls from Tulsa, from Boston, Maryland, Jordan, Iraq. We can't continue to ignore what is happening."
Mrs. El Hajj, who received a heart tissue transplant 26 years ago in London, has a theory about the increase in need: "We're seeing the aftereffects of war, I believe. A lot of the people who are coming, they lived through the chemical pollution of the civil wars in Iraq and Lebanon. It's like in Vietnam when they sprayed the gases, you only see the effects over a period."
Others believe that the Arab population is merely in the midst of growing pains.
"Anytime you have an immigrant community this large, eventually they will develop the same disease as the larger population," said Marwan Aboujould, director of transplant surgery at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. "The problem is that medical technology and the population have surpassed the community's education.
"That can be as hard to overcome as issues of culture and faith."

HEADLINE: Coup Attempt in Paraguay Is Quickly Quelled

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ASUNCION, Paraguay, May 19

 BODY:
For the third time in four years, Paraguay's fragile democracy was severely tested today, this time by mutinous soldiers and police officers who fired at the legislative building from armored personnel carriers before surrendering four hours later.
The government was back in full control this morning, and soldiers with automatic weapons set up checkpoints around the capital as passers-by gawked at bullet holes in the legislature's building. 
 President Luis Gonzalez Macchi, who took office in March after another crisis, went on television to assure citizens that the "antidemocratic" forces believed to be loyal to a former coup plotter had been defeated for good.
"Rest easy, countrymen," Mr. Gonzalez Macchi said. "Public order has been restored. The destabilizing and antidemocratic forces have been disbanded, the crisis brought under control, and the mutineers detained."
He said his government's response would be to accelerate economic and social reforms in the face of high unemployment and discontent.
Three members of Congress and 12 police officers were detained. Their roles in the uprising were unclear.
Interior Minister Walter Montalto Bower said the rebellious soldiers were sympathetic to former Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo of the army, a fugitive wanted in the killing of Vice President Luis Maria Argana last year, an assasination that brought Mr. Gonzalez Macchi to power. General Oviedo was also suspected in a brief mutiny in 1996.
The crisis began when soldiers barreled through the capital late Thursday and headed to the palace. The standoff ended when the soldiers surrendered at 2:45 a.m., Col. Felix Dario Collante said. He would not say how many surrendered.
The permanent council of the Organization of American States "vehemently condemned" the coup attempt and expressed full support for the government.
This wobbly democracy, which emerged from the defeat of the 35-year dictatorship of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner in 1989, has been buffeted by one crisis. The latest was in March 1999, when Raul Cubas Grau was ousted as president and replaced by Mr. Gonzalez Macchi.

F.T.C. Is Seeking Authority To Protect Privacy Online
Concluding that companies on the Internet have not properly protected the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade Commission has decided to ask Congress for authority to impose tough consumer privacy safeguards.
The F.T.C. approved a staff recommendation in an unannounced vote to seek legislation giving it such authority. The action comes as the agency has stepped up investigations of several major Internet companies over their use of consumer data. It represents a sharp departure from the agency's previous policy of relying almost entirely on the industry to police itself. Democratic lawmakers in both the House and Senate, however, said this week that the prospects for final passage of any privacy measure were not strong. Page A1. 

Nissan Reports $6.3 Billion Loss
Nissan Motor said its loss widened to 684.4 billion yen on a consolidated basis, or $6.3 billion at current exchange rates, in the fiscal year ended March 31. Carlos Ghosn, the company's president, contended that while lower, the sales in fiscal 1999 were more profitable than in the previous year. C2.
 
China Trade Bill Edges Near Victory
Opponents of a decisive China trade bill refused to admit defeat and vowed to step up their lobbying over the weekend. But growing signs indicated that barring an unforeseen shift in votes or provocation by Beijing against Taiwan, the measure was edging toward victory. House Republican leaders scheduled a vote for Wednesday. A4.
 
Appeals Court Upholds Cable Law
A federal appeals court upheld the constitutionality of a law that sets limits on the size of a cable company. The ruling strengthens the hand of the government as it reviews AT&T's pending merger with MediaOne. C4.
 
Intel Revises Earnings Down 1 cents
Intel said that it had revised its first-quarter per-share earnings downward by a penny and had lowered sales by $28 million, disclosing the initial financial hit it would take for circuit boards found earlier this month to have a defective component. C14.
 
United States Trade Deficit Widens
The United States trade deficit widened to a record in March as surging demand for oil, automobiles and other imports overpowered a second consecutive monthly increase in exports, Commerce Department figures showed. The deficit in goods and services grew to $30.2 billion in March from $28.7 billion in February. Economists had expected a $29.5 billion deficit. Although the United States shortfall with China narrowed, record imports from Japan, Canada and Western Europe caused the trade gaps with those regions to widen. C2.
 
Korean Traders Plan Monday Strike
Thirty-thousand members of South Korea's securities industry union are planning to strike during their lunch hour Monday, when the stock exchange plans to continue trading during what has historically been a midday break. The change, approved by the South Korean government, makes this country the first in Asia to keep its stock exchange open during the lunch hour. C2.

CAMPAIGN BRIEFING

 BODY:

THE DEMOCRATS
 
A GETAWAY FOR THE GORES -- Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, escaped Washington yesterday to spend their 30th wedding anniversary at Bethany Beach in Delaware. The Gores were staying at the beach home of Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's presidential campaign chairman, through Sunday. The couple took a Marine helicopter at taxpayer expense -- a requirement of the Secret Service, a spokesman said. Accompanying them were Mr. Gore's Secret Service detail, a military aide and a press aide, although the White House had not notified reporters of the vice president's travel until yesterday afternoon, after the Gores had left Washington. Mr. Gore last month had told reporters covering his presidential campaign that he would notify them when he traveled, including on his anniversary. "I will err on the side of openness and full access as much as possible," he said. But he apparently had not shared this decision with his wife, who has said she hopes to maintain her family's privacy even if her husband becomes president and in a recent interview questioned why reporters would need to accompany the vice president on private trips. Katharine Q. Seelye (NYT) 

THE REPUBLICANS
 
BUSH IN KENTUCKY -- Wending his way across Kentucky on a campaign bus, Gov. George W. Bush took his "compassionate conservatism" on the road yesterday, calling on the elderly to volunteer. At a center for the elderly in Paducah, Mr. Bush praised retired volunteers who share "wisdom, experience and values" as foster grandparents or mentors. He proposed to increase federal financing for such volunteer programs from $183 million a year to $240 million annually across five years. Some of the money would go to a pilot program, under which 10,000 low-income elderly volunteers would earn a $1,000 scholarship for a grandchild or a child of their choice. Alison Mitchell (NYT)
 
THE ISSUES
 
GORE WEB SITE ATTACKS BUSH PLAN -- Certain that Governor Bush has handed them the perfect campaign weapon with his Social Security proposal, the Gore campaign unveiled a new Web site this week devoted to attacking his plan. Its not-so-subtle address: www.bushinsecurity.com. The home page features a photograph of rolling dice (Mr. Gore likes to accuse Mr. Bush of promoting "casino economics") and a picture of a slightly crazed-looking Mr. Bush over the caption, "When he was asked if people could lose money under his plan, Bush replied, 'Maybe, maybe not." Asked to respond to the Web site, Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said, "Having invented the Internet, you would have thought Al Gore could have used it for something positive and not just another attack barrage." He added that he would check the site to see whether it included a link to the White House Web site that promotes the Clinton administration's proposal to invest Social Security money in the stock market, an idea Mr. Gore once supported. James Dao (NYT)
 
CONSERVATIVE NAMED TO N.R.A. BOARD -- Grover G. Norquist, president of a nonprofit anti-tax group called Americans for Tax Reform and a leader in conservative circles, has been elected to the board of the National Rifle Association, Mr. Norquist and N.R.A. officials said. Mr. Norquist has close ties to the Republican Party -- he is a friend of former Speaker Newt Gingrich and accepted $4.6 million in 1996 from the Republican National Committee to flood Congressional districts with literature defending Republican candidates. So his election is viewed by Democrats and gun-control advocates as further evidence of tightening bonds between the Republicans and the N.R.A., which he calls "the nation's largest civil rights group." Joining him on the board will be David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. James Dao (NYT)
 
THE STATES
 
END OF POLITICAL WINDSTORM -- Richard A. Gebhardt, whose sound-alike primary challenge to the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, had Democrats in a tizzy in recent months, dropped his candidacy, a state spokesman announced yesterday. Mr. Gebhardt, 65, filed paperwork on Thursday withdrawing from the Third District primary and will not appear alongside the congressman on the Aug. 8 ballot, said Jim Grebing, a spokesman for Secretary of State Bekki Cook. "I stirred up a lot of wind, didn't I?" Mr. Gebhardt said with a laugh. (AP)

HEADLINE: Taiwan's New Leader Ends Decades of Nationalist Rule

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Saturday, May 20

 BODY:
Chen Shui-bian was sworn in as president of Taiwan this morning, a landmark for Taiwan's democracy but the start of a risky period in relations between this prospering island of 23 million people and a strengthening Chinese mainland that claims Taiwan as its own.
With his inauguration, Mr. Chen ended 50 years of rule -- much of it under martial law -- by the Nationalist Party that fled from the mainland under Chiang Kai-shek in 1949. 
 As the candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, which has long advocated Taiwan's independence from China, Mr. Chen won a three-way race in March, in the island's second election of a national leader.
He succeeds Lee Teng-hui, 77, the flamboyant Nationalist who became world famous for ushering democracy to Taiwan but whose recent tenure was increasingly tainted by his party's vote-buying and corruption.
"This is the first peaceful transition of power from one political party to another in Taiwanese history and probably in all of Chinese history," said Wu Yu-shan, a political scientist at National Taiwan University. "But this triumph is being overshadowed by the prospect of deep tension across the Taiwan Straits."
Today, in his first speech as president, Mr. Chen repeated pledges not to declare independence unless Taiwan comes under attack, but he did not give Beijing the commitment to "one China" it demands, and serious new tensions seemed likely.
"Long live freedom and democracy," he shouted as he concluded.
The inauguration took place in a brief ceremony inside the presidential palace a few minutes after 9 a.m. Mr. Chen bowed before a picture of Sun Yat-sen -- who is claimed by both the Taiwanese and the mainland governments as founding father -- then pledged to uphold the Constitution and was handed the national seal.
The ceremony capped the storybook rise of Mr. Chen, 49, whose intelligence and preternatural determination took him from mud-house poverty to success as a corporate attorney before he became involved, in 1979, in the dissident movement against the Nationalists' authoritarian rule. He became a star of the opposition after his election as mayor of Taipei in 1994.
Annette Lu, 55, was sworn in as vice president. She is an outspoken feminist and advocate of Taiwan independence with a law degree from Harvard who spent more than five years in Nationalist prisons in the early 1980's.
Until recently, Mr. Chen called for Taiwan's formal independence from the mainland -- a step that Beijing has repeatedly said would bring a military attack. Seeking to broaden his appeal among the worried electorate and to placate the United States, which is pledged to help defend Taiwan but does not want to be drawn into war, Mr. Chen has moderated his position.
Mr. Chen now says that since Taiwan already functions like a state it does not need to declare independence. He has held out olive branches to Beijing, proposing to talk about strengthened commerce and even about the meaning of "one China."
Beijing officials have expressed growing impatience with Mr. Chen's refusal to accept their absolute precondition for any talks -- that Taiwan is part of a single China.
Earlier this week, the Communist Party's flagship paper, People's Daily, said that Mr. Chen has "adopted an evasive and defiant posture" over the one-China principle and that his friendly gestures "lack sincerity." It reminded him that "matters of sovereignty are not for negotiation."
In recent months, China has warned that indefinite delay in progress toward unity may be grounds for military action.
Mr. Chen's long-anticipated inaugural speech today was almost an anticlimax, devoted mainly to calls for domestic reconciliation, cleaner politics and economic issues.
In the most scrutinized portion, on cross-straits ties, Mr. Chen offered good will and pledged not to take formal steps toward independence. As long as the mainland does not use military force against Taiwan, he said, "I pledge that during my term in office, I will not declare independence."
He made one cryptic reference to "jointly" dealing "with the question of a future 'one China,' " which fell far short of the kind of commitment Beijing has sought.
The international turnout for today's ceremony provided a stark reminder of China's relative power and its campaign to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. Listed as attending were only four heads of state -- from Swaziland, Nicaragua, Palau and Nauru -- countries drawn from fewer than 30 states that have dared to recognize Taiwan in return for its financial aid.
Representing President Clinton was Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former White House adviser. Although the United States sells defensive weapons to Taiwan and has strong economic ties, senior American officials do not visit since the United States, by agreement with Beijing, does not grant formal recognition.
Taiwan's political status and relations with Beijing are always central issues here. But Mr. Chen's strongest mandate from the election, analysts say, was in domestic affairs, especially to start cleaning up corruption in politics, including growing ties between local Nationalist politicians and organized crime.
As he takes on these and other issues, Mr. Chen will be operating in what for Taiwan is the novel territory of a divided government.
Mr. Chen received less than a majority of votes in the election and faces a legislature dominated by the Nationalists. Experts give him good marks for cobbling together a multiparty cabinet that may blunt some opposition. But many still wonder whether he can govern with any force in a jumbled system of presidential and parliamentary institutions that in the past was always controlled by one disciplined party.
In what many people here regarded as a master stroke, Mr. Chen persuaded the former Nationalist defense minister and a retired general, Tang Fei, to serve as prime minister. Mr. Tang is one of several holdovers in the national security field, a deliberate effort to assure various parties -- China, the United States and the Taiwanese -- that Mr. Chen will not act rashly to incite China.
Mr. Tang's powers relative to the president's are not clearly defined, and he has lately been suffering complications from surgery.
The cabinet includes a mix of Nationalists, members of Mr. Chen's party and others. But divisive questions have already been raised within the Nationalist and the Democratic Progressive parties about the party loyalty of those in the cabinet, and the extent to which they should follow Mr. Chen's lead on issues.
Since Mr. Lee, the outgoing president, was forced from his job as Nationalist Party leader, the Nationalists have been in chaos.
A new third party, led by James Soong, a former Nationalist, is struggling to lure supporters from the legislative ranks and define its role. And the Democratic Progressives have begun squabbling as well.
"Any new government is going to be somewhat messy and incoherent," said Shelley Rigger, an expert on Taiwan at Davidson College in North Carolina who gives Mr. Chen high marks under difficult circumstances. "Chen is trying to put together a government that can actually govern, and he had to violate the conventional rules of party politics."

HEADLINE: Financier Uses Scholarships To Spur Action

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
In a drive to fill all of the 7,500 empty seats in parochial and private schools in New York City, a philanthropic organization co-founded by Theodore J. Forstmann, the billionaire financier, has offered $50 million in new, partial scholarships to underprivileged children for this fall.
The program will be managed by the Children's Scholarship Fund, which Mr. Forstmann co-founded with John T. Walton, the son of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton. The two men started the fund, which sends children from poor families to private schools, by each donating $50 million and then raising an additional $80 million from outside donors. 
 Letters awarding the 7,500 new scholarships were mailed this week.
The new scholarships, which will be paid for mostly by Mr. Forstmann, are part of his campaign against what he calls the "government monopoly" in elementary and secondary education. He wants to establish a system that would allow parents to send their children to any school with taxpayer-provided money, a move that he says would engender competition and draw scores of companies to start new schools.
"By the time this is over, I am going to give parents of this country a voice," Mr. Forstmann said in an interview yesterday. "And we will find out whether they want to be in charge of the education of their children or not."
Mr. Forstmann is one of a growing number of wealthy Americans who have turned their attention to elementary and secondary education. Among such philanthropists are Eli Broad, the chairman of Sun America, the insurance and financial services company; Leonard Riggio, the chairman of Barnes & Noble; William H. Gates 3rd, the co-founder of Microsoft; and George Lucas, the film maker.
Unlike most of those donors, Mr. Forstmann, who made his fortune on leveraged buyouts of companies like Gulfstream Aerospace and Dr Pepper, is intent on doing away with public education as it is structured today.
Describing himself as "a necessary voice for a new model for education," Mr. Forstmann foresees what some experts -- but not he -- would call a voucher program, that would allow parents to put the taxpayer-financed dollars that currently go to public schools toward sending their children to any school, religious or secular, private, for-profit or otherwise. Mr. Forstmann said he disavows the word voucher, however, because of the political implications it carries.
The Children's Scholarship Fund's initial $180 million is being used to help finance four years of private school for 40,000 children from low-income families around the country. Participating families are required to contribute about $1,000 annually toward the tuition. This year, the fund paid about $47 million, or up to $1,700 per child, including $2.5 million that went to 1,955 students in New York City.
The additional New York City scholarships were awarded on the same basis as the original ones: by lottery from among the 166,000 applicants who did not previously receive money.
The foundation received about 1.25 million applications from around the country.
About 92 percent of the New York City children who receive aid from the Children's Scholarship Fund attend church-affiliated or religious schools, about two-thirds of them Catholic. Mr. Forstmann said a survey of the city's parochial and private schools by the scholarship fund found about 7,500 available positions, mostly in church-related schools.
Mr. Forstmann said his program is not intended to promote religious education, but that those are the only alternatives now to public school.
"The demand is there, but the supply is not," Mr. Forstmann said. "Guess why? Because the one thing the government monopoly is very good at is keeping supply out."
By requiring taxpayers to pay for public schools and, if they want an alternative for their children, to pay that tuition as well, the government makes it economically not feasible for companies to open schools, he said.
The expanded scholarship program, Mr. Forstmann said, like the original, will help to awaken parents to the need for competition in the educational system. That, Mr. Forstmann believes, is the only way to increase the supply of education providers and encourage companies like General Electric, Microsoft or National Geographic to start schools to compete for the $370 billion spent annually in the United States on private and public elementary and secondary education.
Mr. Forstmann said yesterday that he intended to spend a considerable amount of time and money on the effort. While he briefly considered seeking the Republican nomination for United States Senate as an alternate to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Forstmann announced that he would not run early this week, before the mayor left the race. Instead, he said, he will campaign between now and November to encourage parents to demand change in the country's educational system.
The purpose of Mr. Forstmann's campaign is "to wake people up," he said.
"Who should be in charge of the education of a child -- the parent or the government?," Mr. Forstmann said. "Certainly most of the parents in America would say, 'Of course, it should be me.' But if they can't pick the school, they can't pick the subjects, and they can't pick who teaches the subjects, then you please tell me what they are in charge of."
While the scholarships are intended to help children from low-income families, he said: "We're also trying to get people to pay attention to what's really going on. If the current system was any good, we would be out of business in the Children's Scholarship Fund."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Said to Seek New Law to Bolster Privacy on Internet

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
Concluding that companies on the Internet have not properly protected the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade Commission has decided to ask Congress for authority to impose tough consumer privacy safeguards, government officials said today.
In an unannounced vote taken today, the commission approved a staff recommendation to seek legislation giving the agency such authority. The action comes after the recent completion of a survey by the commission that found that only about 20 percent of major companies on the Internet had adequate standards for protecting the privacy of Internet users. 
 The commission's decision comes as the agency has stepped up its investigation of major Internet companies over their use of consumer data. It represents a sharp departure from the agency's previous policy of relying almost entirely on the industry to police itself. But lawmakers said that the prospects were not strong for Congress to adopt legislation so late in the session.
The legislation sought by the commission would permit it to regulate the kinds of notice given to consumers about use of information regarding them, as well as whether consumers can block that use. It would allow the commission to establish rules for keeping the information secure from third parties. And it would authorize the commission to penalize companies that violate privacy rules.
Commission officials are preparing to brief members of Congress about the proposal on Monday. The commissioners are also planning to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday.
Democratic lawmakers in both the House and Senate who have been the most vocal advocates for privacy legislation said this week that the prospects for final passage of any privacy measure were not strong, since the Republicans have largely sided with industry and there are not enough legislative days remaining to pass a significant new measure.
"I would say the chances are virtually nil," said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose own privacy bill has stalled. "The Republican leadership is committed to not doing privacy this year in any area."
Nonetheless, a group of nine Democratic senators led by Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia is preparing to introduce a measure next week that is similar to what the commission has sought. The legislation also contains measures that appeal to Internet companies, most notably a provision that pre-empts all state law on Internet privacy.
"For many, privacy concerns represent the only remaining obstacle impeding consumers' full embrace of the Internet's ample commercial opportunities," Mr. Hollings said today. "Advances in technology have provided information gatherers the tools to seamlessly compile and enhance highly detailed personal histories of Internet users.
"Nonetheless, industry has to this point nearly unanimously opposed even a basic regulatory framework that would ensure the protection of consumer privacy on the Internet -- a basic framework that has been successfully adopted in other areas of our economy. My bill gives customers, not companies, control over their personal information on the Internet."
A report accompanying the commission's proposal for legislation found that the industry had made significant progress in policing itself, but not enough. Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the trade commission, has said recently that there is a big role for companies to monitor themselves, but that as the market develops, there may also be a need for government to play a role as well.
Mr. Pitofsky has recently told others at the agency that while self-regulation was a crucial element of protecting privacy rights, he had also come to believe that the marketplace had developed sufficiently to seek new authority to give the government tools to prosecute companies that do not police themselves.
But industry groups say any effort to give the commission new rule-making authority would be an unwarranted incursion by the government into regulating cyberspace and could discourage the development of many start-up Internet companies.
"Even though this industry is the basis for a tremendous economic boom, most of these companies in fact aren't making money right now," said a lobbyist for a major Internet and entertainment company.
Christine A. Varney, a former member of the trade commission who is now representing an industry group, said the agency already had significant authority to crack down on companies that violated the privacy interests of consumers by engaging in deceptive practices.
"Clearly they already have authority and they have exercised it," said Ms. Varney, an adviser to the Online Privacy Alliance, a group of about 100 companies and associations interested in Internet issues.
But some privacy advocates call the agency's record disappointing.
"The bottom line is that the privacy gap between the safeguards in place and the intrusions seems to be growing not narrowing, and that has as much as anything to do with the lack of enforcement at the F.T.C.," said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research organization that studies privacy issues and technology. "There is little indication that self-regulation is working."

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S DECISION: THE GOVERNOR;
Lazio Was the Main Choice For Pataki From Beginning

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 19

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's decision to drop out of the Senate race today may or may not turn out to be good for New York Republicans. But for one top Republican, Gov. George E. Pataki, there was no such ambiguity.
Mr. Pataki much preferred Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island as the Republican candidate to oppose Hillary Rodham Clinton. He supported Mr. Giuliani a few months ago only because of a growing consensus among State Republican Party leaders that Mr. Giuliani would be Mrs. Clinton's strongest opponent. 
In an interview today, Mr. Pataki said he believed that Mr. Lazio would ultimately be the party's choice to run against Mrs. Clinton. He described Mr. Lazio as a worthy candidate with a politically appealing record in Congress on issues like tax cuts and smaller government.
"I think he will be a very strong candidate," Mr. Pataki said. "He knows the issues. He has a knowledge of policy in Washington. He has a very different philosophy than Mrs. Clinton. He believes in what has worked in this state."
Mr. Pataki also tried to cut off speculation that he might enter the race himself, saying that he is happy to remain in his current job and support whoever becomes the Republican Party's candidate. "I think governor is one of the great jobs, and I love New York," Mr. Pataki said.
But many Republican officials interviewed today expressed some disappointment that Mr. Pataki has refused to jump into the race, saying that he is probably the strongest candidate the party has at this point.
Kemp Hannon, a Republican State Senator from Nassau County, said he had mixed feelings about Mr. Pataki's decision to stay out of the race. On the one hand, he said, the governor would pose a daunting challenge for Mrs. Clinton, given his statewide stature. But Mr. Hannon added that the governor's absence from Albany would be a major loss for the state and the party.
"He would be the strongest candidate," Mr. Hannon said. "But people support his policies in Albany and want to keep him as governor."
Another Republican senator put the matter more bluntly. "We would love the governor to run because he is by far the best candidate," the senator said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "There is no question that he would be the party's first choice, possibly even before Rudy."
Mr. Pataki, the de facto head of the state party, is formidable in many respects. He is the most successful fund-raiser in state history, and has won two statewide races in a largely Democratic state. He has also kept his political operation running at a feverish pace in a nonelection year, raising $3.2 million since 1999 through three political action committees he has established.
The governor has used the money to raise his profile nationally. He has hired nationally known political consultants like Benjamin L. Ginsberg, an elections specialist and Washington lawyer who serves as a campaign adviser to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and Stephen Moore, an economist with the Cato Institute in Washington.
But Mr. Pataki has good reason to want to stay put. If Mr. Pataki stepped down as governor, he would forfeit his annual state salary of $177,984 a year and any additional income that he earns from outside activities. He received $48,000 for three speeches he gave last year, and $50,000 for speeches he gave in 1998. He also received $24,000 for his autobiography. His salary would be considerably less in Washington, where rank-and-file members earn about $140,000 a year.
As governor, Mr. Pataki also appoints hundreds of people to important positions in state government -- people who, in turn, could return the favor in a number of ways, including volunteering in the governor's campaign and raising funds for him. As senator, he would be entitled to make only a couple of dozen appointments.
The governor's job also gives Mr. Pataki the status of the unchallenged boss of the state party, not to mention control over a $77 billion-a-year enterprise full of jobs and lucrative contracts that can be awarded to friends. United States senators rarely get that kind of power, either in their own party or in the day-to-day affairs of government.
That said, Mr. Pataki has shown some interest in leaving Albany. Last year, for example, he gave a series of speeches around the country in an effort to bolster his national stature. Mr. Pataki was widely seen as vying for a spot on the Republicans' national ticket, possibly as a vice presidential candidate.
But today, Mr. Pataki tried to dispel any notion that he was seeking a job in Washington, including a cabinet post in a new Republican administration. "Right now, I see myself in New York," he said in an interview. "If I were looking in Washington, I would have taken a harder look at the Senate race."

HEADLINE: Three States After Plum Role: Hollywood East;
De Niro and Miramax Scout Locations for a Studio

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
They are the bouquets and bonbons of the economic-development world, and these days they are raining down on Robert De Niro, the Academy Award-winning actor, and Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films, who are still looking for a place to build a sprawling film studio.
New York State is down on one knee, pledging a road and perhaps even a sewer system. New Jersey is whispering sweet nothings about sales tax exemptions and possibly a direct capital investment. And Connecticut, though hush-hush about its exact courtship strategy, is also dangling tax incentives. 
 In the seven months since a tentative film studio deal between New York City, Mr. De Niro and Miramax Films collapsed, the three states have wasted no time in wooing the taciturn film star and his influential partner, Mr. Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax. Officials say they are eager to pick up the ball they believe Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani dropped.
It was no secret that the partners felt burned when the Giuliani administration announced in October that it had chosen another set of developers to build studios at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Mayor Giuliani had, after all, tried out his best Godfather imitation for Mr. De Niro and then held a glittering news conference in Brooklyn about their collective vision for a sound stage complex there.
But the city's sudden shift in favor of other developers (after administration members decided that that group would build the studios faster and require less city money) apparently did not dim the interest of Mr. De Niro in creating a film studio in the New York region. Although a record number of films and television shows have been shot in New York and New Jersey in recent years, members of the movie industry and state officials have long complained about the area's shortage of sound stages, which has forced filmmakers to go to Los Angeles and Toronto for indoor photography.
The leading studio site contenders appear to be properties in the city of Yonkers in southern Westchester County and in the Hudson County town of Harrison, N.J., two municipalities desperate to redevelop their industrial waterfronts with the sort of sexy centerpiece that the movie partners could provide. Mr. De Niro and Mr. Weinstein had briefly considered sites in New York City, but they have zeroed in on those two tracts, according to someone who went on some of the tours.
Neither Miramax, a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company, nor Mr. De Niro's company, TriBeCa Productions, would comment on their quest for a parcel. But people who have met with the actor and Mr. Weinstein and seen architects' sketches for the two sites say their plan goes beyond a large film studio to include housing and possibly stores and restaurants. Such elements could make the proposal more attractive to investors skittish about the possibility of studios sitting empty between productions.
"There's a dire need for studios in New York," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, New York State's economic development agency. "The problem is these things do not work by themselves. They do not generate enough money, so they have to have some additional development with them."
Some developers and film executives doubt whether Miramax and TriBeCa Productions will ever get a shovel in the ground. They cite a series of grand plans for film studios in recent years that either evaporated or were drastically scaled back, mostly for lack of financing.
Abandoned late last year, for instance, was an ambitious plan to build a television and movie studio complex on top of a Manhattan office building at Houston and West Streets. The $160 million project, called Hudson River Studios, was to include five sound stages. But the developers lost their financing after two soap operas that had committed to using the space pulled out.
In addition, after years of robust growth, the number of feature films shot in New York City actually fell by 12 last year to 209. The Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting is quick to point out that film production was down slightly nationwide as well. But the office still contends that there is not enough studio space in New York to meet demand.
Others disagree. They cite a glut of studio space in Los Angeles and fear an eventual glut in the New York region, too, especially if the developer selected for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York Studios, realizes its plan for 11 sound stages. The development group, led by Douglas C. Steiner, is demolishing buildings at the site.
And Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens is adding a seventh studio, but its president, Hal G. Rosenbluth, said: "We're pushing the envelope to believe you can build dozens of stages and actually fill them. We're never going to displace Hollywood. All the creative decisions to green-light things are still in Los Angeles, and the majority of the actors, directors and producers live in L.A."
But officials in New York and New Jersey are downright bubbly, promoting the superiority of their respective sites as they assemble incentive packages for Mr. De Niro and Mr. Weinstein.
Connecticut is more coy. Edward Dombroskas, executive director of the state's film office, said the filmmakers "are looking at a couple of different sites, but I can't reveal where they are." Mr. Dombroskas was also circumspect about incentives, but did say breaks on sales and property taxes were available to companies locating in so-called entertainment zones.
In New Jersey, the filmmakers are looking at a former steel plant on the Passaic River in Harrison, according to local and state officials. In 1998, an independent film production company in Manhattan, the Shooting Gallery, settled on the same 41-acre site for a grandiose studio plan with 15 sound stages and a $75 million price tag. That plan was abandoned for a much smaller project in Manhattan, on Leroy Street in the West Village.
Harrison officials think a Miramax-De Niro studio would have a better chance of succeeding given the principals' track records. The mayor of Harrison, Raymond J. McDonough, said he met with representatives of TriBeCa Productions and Miramax in April, and "they asked me how they could obtain all the property in the redevelopment area."
Meanwhile, officials are offering several lures, from financing through the Hudson County Improvement Authority to annual payments to the studio company over 10 years that would represent a portion of the state income tax revenue generated by the new jobs.
Gualberto Medina, New Jersey's secretary of commerce, said the state was also considering a direct investment of money in the project and was working with the filmmakers on a "joint request for proposals" from potential real estate developers.
Local and state officials said the Harrison property would be perfect for a studio complex: it has a cavernous column-free building with 103,000 square feet and a 100-foot-high ceiling, and it is across the street from a PATH train station. Gregory J. Castano, the lawyer for the Harrison Redevelopment Agency, said, "No other site offers a building like that."
The Yonkers site, a former wire factory, also has a building with a 100-foot ceiling, sans columns, although it is smaller, at 30,000 square feet. The 13-acre parcel may be a bit cramped for a mixed-used development, but it is a striking location, sitting alongside the Hudson River, with the wooded cliffs of the Palisades across the way and the Manhattan skyline to the south. It, too, is convenient to public transportation, with a Metro-North Railroad stop only a couple of hundred yards away.
The soaring main building, which is clad in unfortunate powder-blue panels, was recently used to film a scene from "Sleepy Hollow" -- a nighttime shot of a cornfield that entailed hauling in 600 tons of dirt.
"The girth of the walls, the thickness of the floors, the enormity of the space -- it's got such character," said Paul W. Adler, the general manager of commercial services for Prudential Rand Realty, which represents the property's owner, BICC P.L.C. "Some of the offices look like something you could film a Bogart movie in."
BICC, a transportation and development company in London, is talking to Mr. Weinstein and Mr. De Niro about a joint venture, Mr. Adler said. That would also enable the company to oversee a necessary environmental cleanup of the site, estimated to cost $7.5 million.
Mr. Gargano, the economic development chairman in New York State, said the state reached out to the filmmakers after learning that they were looking in New Jersey last fall. While New York would not contribute "seed money" to the studio project, the state could help with infrastructure improvements and savings on sales tax, he said.
"The key thing here is to get them to build studios in New York," Mr. Gargano said. "That's a very important industry, and it's good for New York State. New Jersey is ahead of us because they've been dealing with them longer."
So are Mr. De Niro and Mr. Weinstein stringing along New Jersey and New York, the same way that the Giuliani administration treated them? State and local officials say their eyes are open. "They've been candid that they're looking at other areas," said Mr. Castano, the lawyer for the Harrison Redevelopment Agency, "and we've known that from the beginning."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Sather One Step Closer to the Rangers

BYLINE: By JASON DIAMOS 

 BODY:
After 24 years with the Edmonton Oilers, Glen Sather, the team's president and general manager, announced his resignation yesterday. The only question now is whether he will end up in New York or Phoenix, running either the Rangers or the Coyotes.
Sather, 56, is the Rangers' first choice for their vacant team presidency. Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, who has already met twice with Sather, will most likely attempt to arrange a third meeting in the next few days, said a person familiar with the Garden's thinking. 
 Checketts's time frame may be affected by Wayne Gretzky's plans. Gretzky, who played for Sather in Edmonton, Alberta, and is good friends with him, is mulling an offer to become the majority owner in Phoenix and could try to persuade Sather to go with him.
The Oilers' general manager for the last 21 years, Sather gave up his positions yesterday morning, forfeiting the last two years of a contract that would have paid him almost $2 million a year.
"I am a free agent," Sather said at last night's news conference in Edmonton after announcing his resignation. "I don't like the process, but I think it's the right thing to do."
Cal Nichols, chairman of the Edmonton ownership group, said the Oilers would not seek compensation from any team that signed Sather. He also said the Oilers would not pursue tampering charges against other teams, after saying Thursday that they might.
"We just thought it was the ethical thing to do, just drop it and let everyone get on with their lives," Nichols said.
Sather said he did not have a job offer on the table. "This is the first time since I was 16 years old that I've been unemployed."
Speaking about the possibility of a position with the Coyotes, Sather said, "The last I looked, Phoenix had a general manager, they don't have new ownership and I'm not sure Wayne's going there." But he also said his decision would not depend on what Gretzky did.
Sather said he would not have left the Oilers had Jim Hole not been succeeded by Nichols. "I never thought I'd leave the organization," he said. "I thought I'd retire here. But things change."
Nichols said that "this didn't happen in 24 hours," and, noting that the Oilers' owners expected to lose $8 million this season, added, "In part, this all boils down to money."
 Before flying to Edmonton for the news conference, Sather spoke from an airport near his home in La Quinta, Calif. "I would say that my biggest regret is that it eventually had to come to this," he said. "But sometimes in life, you need a new adventure. I'm looking forward to whatever happens. I haven't decided on what I'm doing. I'm just going to take it one step at a time."
As has been the case throughout his search for a new Rangers president, coach and general manager, Checketts had no comment yesterday.
Friends and associates of Sather have expressed skepticism that he was leaving Edmonton for New York. Sather is more comfortable in the West.
But Sather played down that factor. "It's easier and quicker to get from New York to La Quinta than it is from Edmonton to La Quinta," he said Thursday night, adding that his wife is from Philadelphia. "When I played in New York, I loved it."
Sather played left wing for the Rangers for four seasons, from 1970 to 1973. Later, as coach and general manager in Edmonton, he came to be synonymous with the Oilers, who won five Stanley Cups with him at the helm.
Four of those cup triumphs came with Gretzky as the Oilers' captain. Gretzky, who retired from the Rangers a year ago, is weighing an offer from Steve Ellman, an Arizona developer, to become majority owner of the Coyotes. Ellman, however, is having difficulty meeting payments to secure his purchase of both the team and land for a new arena in Scottsdale.
Those in hockey who know both Gretzky and Sather say that the race is on between the Rangers and Gretzky. "If the Rangers do what they can do, they'll make Glen make his decision before Gretz makes his," said one person, who insisted on anonymity. "The Rangers need to move quickly now."
Earlier this month, the Rangers and Ellman were both granted permission to speak with Sather by Hole, who represents Edmonton on the National Hockey League's board of governors. Hole is a close Sather ally. Nichols, who replaced Hole as chairman of the team earlier this season, is not.
Many expressed surprise that Sather decided to leave. But he grew frustrated with the constraints of running a small-market team. Edmonton's $21.2 million payroll this season ranked 22nd in the 28-team league. Yesterday, Sather cited a change in ownership, a change in the leadership of the ownership, and the inability of Canadian teams to receive financial subsidies from their national government as factors in his decision.
"I don't think it's been an instant, spin-of-the-moment, not-thought-out decision," Sather said. "It's been around for a couple of years. I've been there for almost 25 years. I had a lot of great times and a lot of great experiences. I just think it's time to look around and take some time off.
"Unfortunately, this had to come to an end," Sather said. "But I've been thinking pretty hard about it for quite a long time."

HEADLINE: John Sawhill, Ex-N.Y.U. Chief Who Led Conservation Group, Dies at 63

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
John C. Sawhill, a former president of New York University who advised three presidents on energy policy and for the last decade of his life was president and chief executive of the Nature Conservancy, died on Thursday at a hospital in Richmond, Va. He was 63 and lived in Washington and Virginia.
 The cause of death was diabetes, the Nature Conservancy said. 
 Mr. Sawhill became head of the conservancy, which describes itself as the world's largest private conservation group, in January 1990. The organization's mission is to preserve animals and plants by acquiring land and water to protect the environment from development.
 The conservancy said in a statement today that during Mr. Sawhill's tenure it had protected more than seven million acres of land in the United States; that the conservancy work force had tripled, to about 3,000, and that its membership had more than doubled, to 1.1 million people.
 The conservancy said that in 1995, under Mr. Sawhill's direction, it completed the largest fund-raising campaign in the history of the conservation movement, raising $315 million. Last March, Mr. Sawhill announced the start of a $1 billion campaign.
 Mr. Sawhill was president of New York University from 1975 to 1979. When he took office, the university, like its hometown, was mired in debt and its very future seemed in danger. Mr. Sawhill, who was a professor of economics while serving as president, led a huge fund-raising drive and was widely credited with putting the university's finances back in order.
 Ann Mancuso, dean of the N.Y.U. School of Education, said today that Mr. Sawhill was a risk taker and a strong manager, believing that crises required new approaches. She praised him for helping women achieve positions of responsibility at the university.
 Mr. Sawhill was a lean six-footer, ascetic in behavior and diet. He rose early, often running for a few miles before starting his workday. Lunch might be fresh fruit, cheese, crackers and a soft drink. Ms. Mancuso recalled fondly that some of his first luncheons at N.Y.U. were notable for "extremely tiny portions of unappetizing food." More seriously, she wondered whether his habits were part of his never-ending campaign to stave off the effects of diabetes, a disease she never knew he had.
 Laurence A. Tisch, co-chairman of Loews Corporation and a longtime friend of Mr. Sawhill, also expressed surprise today upon learning of Mr. Sawhill's disease. Mr. Tisch described Mr. Sawhill as "a very private man," especially for a public figure, and one who managed to be blunt and honest without being rude.
 Under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, he was administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, deputy administrator of the Federal Energy Office, and associate director for energy and environmental matters in the Office of Management and Budget.
 In late 1974, Mr. Sawhill was forced out by President Ford, undone in part by his candor. With the country still reeling from an oil shortage, Mr. Sawhill favored additional gasoline taxes, and said so in public. President Ford opposed new gasoline taxes.
 Mr. Sawhill also conceded in an interview that the Ford administration did not have a plan to stop the rise in oil prices -- an admission that was not exactly a surprise, but one that fanned criticism of the administration as having a less than clear-cut energy policy.
 Though his credentials as an environmentalist became impeccable, Mr. Sawhill's positions were not always predictable. In 1974, for instance, he said that the environmental risks of strip-mining coal might be acceptable to meet national energy demands. That year, he said oil drilling off the New England coast, an idea that horrified fishermen, lobstermen and many environmentalists, should not be beyond consideration.
 And he told a Senate committee in 1974 that higher fuel prices were not necessarily bad, especially if they encouraged oil companies to find new supplies.
 Mr. Sawhill was deputy energy secretary under President Jimmy Carter, then became chairman and chief executive of the United States Synthetic Fuels Corporation. From 1981 until 1990, he was a director of McKinsey & Company, the international management consultants, specializing in energy issues.
 John Crittenden Sawhill was born in Cleveland on June 12, 1936, and grew up in Baltimore. He graduated cum laude from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1958 and received a doctorate in economics from New York University in 1963. From 1960 to 1963, he was assistant dean and assistant economics professor at N.Y.U.
 He is survived by his wife, Isabel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; a son, James, of San Francisco; a brother, James, of Newport News, Va.; two sisters, Sally Supplee of Palo Alto, Calif., and Munroe Hodder of London, and a grandson.
 As head of the Nature Conservancy, Mr. Sawhill pressed for more cooperation between business interests and environmental groups. He refused to see an unbridgeable chasm between profits and clean air and water, and he insisted that Americans would never succeed in cleaning up the environment unless there was growth in per capita income.
 In 1998, George magazine announced, not entirely tongue in cheek, that Mr. Sawhill's accomplishments and free-ranging intellect made him ideal to be president of the United States.
 "I saw President Clinton after the George story came out," Mr. Sawhill said. "I told him he didn't have to worry."

And Bear in Mind
(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)
 
DREAMBIRDS: The Strange History of the Ostrich in Fashion, Food, and Fortune, by Rob Nixon. (Picador USA, $23.) Camouflaged as natural history, ode to gawky beauty and social study of precarious empires built on feathers, this book is at bottom a haunting memoir of a South African boyhood.
 
THE FEAST OF LOVE, by Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) A luminous he-said-she-said of a novel, in which He, a handsome toadlike man, and She, Ex-Wife No. 1, unspool contrary narratives of their life together.
 
THE HUMAN STAIN, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) The novel's doomed protagonist is a modern converso: a black man passing as a Jew so he'll be taken for white; our old friend Nathan Zuckerman tells his story.
 
HUNTS IN DREAMS, by Tom Drury. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) A sequel to "The End of Vandalism" set in the same bleak farm community, this novel centers on the ex-vandal, now a plumber (gone straight more from detachment than maturity), as he confronts the breakup of his marriage.
 
JOHN RUSKIN: The Later Years, by Tim Hilton. (Yale University, $35.) Opening when its subject is 40 and a rising authority on aesthetics, Volume 2 of this vast biography charts Ruskin's unraveling from passionate cataloger (rocks, plants, buildings, paintings, clouds) to tragic obsessive (irrigation, drainage, running water, little girls).
 
THE MAN WHO WROTE THE BOOK, by Erik Tarloff. (Crown, $23.) Dead-ended at a jerkwater college, the scholar hero of this riotous novel strikes pseudonymous pay dirt as a pornographer: his magnum opus, "Every Inch a Lady," out-Potters Potter and draws a glowing notice -- by Updike yet -- in the very pages you are holding.
 
THE MANY ASPECTS OF MOBILE HOME LIVING, by Martin Clark. (Knopf, $24.) This first novel by a Southern judge features . . . a Southern judge, who logs overtime as cuckold, bribe taker, treasure hunter and devoted tester of controlled substances but by the end has become a guy worth knowing. (Caveat: Contains one scene in which a certain discomfort befalls two small kitties.)
 
MEN IN THE OFF HOURS, by Anne Carson. (Knopf, $24.) There is a startling freshness deep down these poems, the work of a writer for whom the ever-sharp world exerts attractive and repulsive forces in equal measure.
 
NEWJACK: Guarding Sing Sing, by Ted Conover. (Random House, $24.95.) A journalist's account of his year as a correction officer, where his moral well-being was as much at risk as his bodily safety.
 
SIX FIGURES, by Fred G. Leebron. (Knopf, $22.) The yuppie couple in this novel, no strangers to anger, covetousness and envy, now confront great violence -- and the suspicion that it is home-grown.

HEADLINE: BOOKEND;
Navigating the Amazon Circle

BYLINE: By Katie Hafner; Katie Hafner is a reporter for the Circuits section of The Times.

 BODY:
Introduce a computer to a heap of raw data and the temptation to slice the information every which way can prove irresistible. One example is Amazon.com's purchase-circle program, which enables customers to see what books are popular among different groups. Apparently, the idea is that readers can learn the buying preferences of people with whom they might have something in common, or about whom they might be curious, and that one can glean insights into a place or company by seeing, for instance, that a top seller in Kenya is "The Carbohydrate Addict's Lifespan Program" or that in Hoboken, N.J., a number of people want to know how to put on a Jewish wedding.
Amazon has two types of purchase-circle lists. There are rankings strictly by the numbers, and the Harry Potter books invariably top the list. More interesting are the "uniquely best-selling" books -- titles that are more popular with a particular group than among Amazon.com customers generally. 
 A recent look shows that people in affluent Pacific Palisades, Calif., for example, are working hard on their marriages and culinary skills. Winter Park, Fla., is steeped in self-pity; its residents read "Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in Their Struggle for Self." And religion is a big deal in Nyack, N.Y.; the books selling there are "More Light on the Path: Daily Scripture Readings in Hebrew and Greek" and "Encountering the Old Testament."
Overseas, meanwhile, all of Luxembourg seems worried about the stock market and the Internet bubble, while Romanians are obsessed with management and public relations. Latvians are more well rounded in their tastes, if a bit slow on the uptake, as they are just now discovering "Emotional Intelligence," Daniel Goleman's 1995 best seller, and "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People," which was published in 1989. As expected, the French are worried about the United States. Amazon's No. 1 seller in France is "Manifest Destiny: American Expansionism and the Empire of Right," a book that normally ranks around 102,000 on the company's main list. The French are also obsessed with Raymond Carver's "Short Cuts."
In Chappaqua, N.Y., the new home of the Clintons, kids matter a lot; the biggest sellers there include "Nurturing Good Children Now."
What are those in government buying? Representatives are working on their golf games and apparently taking some pleasure in reading about the fall from grace of their former colleague Dan Rostenkowski. Senators, on the other hand, are dipping into slightly more highbrow literature -- that is, until you reach
No. 8 on their list: "Diana in Search of Herself."
Then there are corporate purchases -- or, rather, purchases made by people who supply Amazon with their corporate e-mail addresses. Much has been made of the competitive lessons that can be taken from a company's reading list. At Qualcomm, a highflying high-tech company in San Diego, it would appear that when workers aren't busy exploring their surroundings ("Afoot & Afield in
San Diego") and exercising, they are worrying
about money, with five books on stock options and investment guides among the 10 best sellers.
If you believe the purchase-circle data, employees at Wired Ventures are not only happy-go-lucky youngsters, they are uninterested in business books altogether, as they devour such works as "Mind Hunter: Inside the F.B.I.'s Elite Serial Crime Unit" and "The Simpsons Forever!" No. 9 there is "How to Be a Great Lover: Girlfriend-to-Girlfriend Totally Explicit Techniques That Will Blow His Mind."
Not only are many Texaco employees on the same carbohydrate-rich diet that all of Cairo (Egypt, that is) is trying, but -- personnel managers, take note -- many are also buying "What Color Is Your Parachute? A Practical Manual for Job Hunters and Career Changers." They're shedding pounds over at Toyota, too, but the workers are also interested in new approaches to management and are buying "First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently."
Not a frivolous moment is to be had at the Gap, where workers are buying "Nothing's Impossible," a book about leadership, and "The End of Fashion," about the mass-marketing of clothing. Then there's the beleaguered Levi Strauss & Company, whose top books are "Journey to the Emerald City: Achieve a Competitive Edge by Creating a Culture of Accountability" and "Building Strong Brands."
And at Microsoft? Everyone appears to be learning Japanese.
The purchase-circle lists also neatly reinforce stereotypes. In Sedona, Ariz., known for its love of all things New Age, they're reading "Sanctuary: The Path to Consciousness." Managers at the United States Postal Service still have a few morale kinks to iron out, as a big seller there is "Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed to Do and What to Do About It." And NASA really is filled with geeks reading "Low-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing."
Manhattanites, of course, are obsessed with parties, housing and finding a private school for their tots. Sure enough, they're reading "The Manhattan Directory of Private Nursery Schools," "The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools," "New York's 100 Best Places to Have a Party" and "Tenant Power" (author: Tenant X).
Fun, isn't it? Maybe. Amazon has taken a lot of heat for the threat to privacy that its circles pose. It makes the argument that it does not make individuals' purchases public (even though its database is capable of doing so), and the lists give no actual sales figures. Further, a company or group can opt out and request that its buying habits not be included in the listings. Barnesandnoble.com, Amazon's biggest rival, which happily followed suit when Amazon began posting each book's sales ranking, has reached for the moral high ground. It publishes no equivalent to the purchase-circle lists. But the privacy concern seems to be something of a red herring. The real objections to the lists should center not on the threat to personal privacy they present, but on their silliness.
So why does Amazon have purchase circles? To keep users on the site, clicking away voyeuristically while catching the Amazon aura? Even the company's executives seem a bit unclear on this point. During an interview, J. J. Jacobi, Amazon's director of product development, stumbled a bit at this question. Customers enjoy the lists, she said, and look at them "just for fun." She carried on in this vein until her public relations woman, who was monitoring the interview, broke in to help her out. "It's to help customers make better purchasing decisions," she said.
Just how these lists are supposed to help customers make purchasing decisions is a mystery. But no matter. They will also tell you what's big in music, videos and electronics. Only in its selection of videos does Manhattan's intellectual bent emerge: after "Sesame Street" sing-along videos are "The 400 Blows," "Last Year at Marienbad" and "Jules and Jim." Chappaquidians, it turns out, are mad for the soundtrack from "The Simpsons" and the Backstreet Boys, the Palm V electronic organizer and the "Yellow Submarine" DVD. In fact, folks in Chappaqua buy a lot more DVD's than videotapes, which tells you something about their disposable income level, in case you didn't already know.
IN La Jolla, Calif., another affluent community, the purchase lists show residents reading "Life: The Science of Biology" and "The Pump House Gang." But if you want some real insight into La Jolla's literary preferences, ask Adrian Newell, a buyer and manager at Warwick's bookstore, whose inventory is small but whose customers realize that she always has them in mind. She knows they go for science essays and inspirational books but not celebrity biographies. She keeps "Galileo's Daughter" well stocked, along with "Eleanor of Aquitaine." She also knows a good deal more about the lifestyles and political bent of her neighbors than Amazon does. "The majority of my clientele is 50-something," she said. "They are politically conservative, they like to travel and they have disposable income." She knows, too, that what sells well in La Jolla won't sell in the bookstore in the neighboring town of Del Mar. That store "sells younger, edgier fiction," she said. "Tons of Nick Hornby. Whereas I carry all these cozy mysteries."
When Amazon's computers can create a virtual Adrian Newell for each of its purchase circles, then it might really be on to something, even if that something is less fun to browse.

 BODY:

 Ben Tillman and
 the Reconstruction
 of White Supremacy
 By Stephen Kantrowitz.
 Illustrated. 422 pp. Chapel Hill:
 The University of North Carolina Press.
 Cloth, $49.95. Paper, $19.95. 
 BENJAMIN RYAN TILLMAN came of age in 1876, Stephen Kantrowitz writes in this thoughtful biography. As the commander of Edgefield County's Sweetwater Sabre Club, a paramilitary unit dedicated to terrorizing Republican officeholders and restoring white rule in South Carolina, the 29-year-old Tillman, with his red-shirted troopers, participated in the Hamburg Riot on July 8, an occasion marked by the coldblooded murder of a number of black militiamen who had had the effrontery to conduct a celebratory parade through the mostly black town of Hamburg, S.C., four days earlier on the Fourth of July. As Tillman himself would later put it, "The leading white men of Edgefield" had decided "to seize the first opportunity that the Negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach the Negroes a lesson" by "having the whites demonstrate their superiority by killing as many of them as was justifiable." None of the perpetrators of the Hamburg murders were ever brought to justice.
Tillman's role in the Hamburg Riot established him as a leader of men in that time and that place. His involvement, about which he boasted constantly in future years, was the cornerstone upon which he would build a remarkable political career, first as governor of South Carolina and then, for 24 years, as a United States senator.
How could these execution-style murders of 1876 serve as the springboard for such extraordinary political advancement -- and a legacy of racism that would keep Tillman's name alive as Pitchfork Ben well into the 20th century? The explanation lies, Kantrowitz believes, in the determination of white men in the post-Civil War South to reclaim what they had lost through emancipation and the experience of Reconstruction: their sense of independent, unfettered manhood. "Tillman sought to transform the slogan 'white supremacy' into a description of social reality, reconstructing white male authority in every sphere from the individual household to national politics," Kantrowitz, who teaches American history at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, writes. Tillman's constituents responded to his leadership because they too believed that the end of slavery and the enfranchising of blacks had set loose a threat to white society that had to be checked by whatever means necessary. It took a man like Tillman -- an ideologue, an organizer and a terrorist" -- to give voice to their fears and to translate their determination into physical and political action.
Tillman proved to be a master at pillorying his well-bred political opponents -- white Negroes," he called them, or effete urban "dudes" produced by aristocratic institutions of higher learning like the Citadel or the University of South Carolina. When it came to reforms that might actually help to relieve the farmer's economic plight, however, Tillman offered precious little: an agricultural college for white men (Clemson), a new school for white women (Winthrop College) and a state-run dispensary system to regulate liquor sales. Almost everything else he proposed had a single goal: the suppression of the state's black population to a position of permanent inferiority.
In 1892, a group of Tillman's supporters in Abbeville, S.C., prepared a banner anointing the governor the "Champion of White Men's Rule and Woman's Virtue." Earlier that year, Tillman had coupled a statement opposing lynching with a declaration that he would "willingly lead a mob in lynching a Negro who had committed an assault upon a white woman." His "lynching pledge," as this promise became known, was never personally carried out, but it reveals a great deal about Tillman's rhetorical and political strategy. The black man, in Tillman's words, "must remain subordinate or be exterminated." An epidemic of mob killings broke out in South Carolina in the 1890's, and in the upcountry counties of Abbeville, Edgefield, Laurens and Newberry, lynchings outnumbered legal executions during that decade.
When Tillman went to Washington, his message went with him. Now known as Pitchfork Ben -- in 1892 he had threatened to stick a pitchfork in that "bag of beef" Grover Cleveland -- Tillman became the "resident wild man" of the Senate. His record was a model of negative consistency. He opposed woman suffrage (the vote would "rub the bloom off of the peach," he said). He opposed American overseas expansion (building an empire comprising nonwhite peoples he looked upon as a form of insanity). And he opposed any exercise of federal authority that would allow the national government to intrude in a state's "domestic affairs." This ensured his opposition to any measure that might actually provide some economic relief for the farmers back home.
Tillman also became a star on the national lecture circuit. His lecture on "the race problem" was by far the most popular, aiming to preach "the gospel of white supremacy straight from the shoulder," and preach he did, year after year, from one end of the country to the other. He offered up a witches' brew of bare-knuckled, no-holds-barred racism and earned a handsome annual income from these performances.
When the 70-year-old Tillman died in 1918, he left behind a political legacy almost totally devoid of positive achievement. But, Kantrowitz reminds us, he left a powerful and tenacious legacy of another sort. In South Carolina, Tillman and his political allies "fatally undermined the possibility of the development of a race-neutral language of manhood and citizenship." The consequences of this perversion of democratic doctrine would burden the South deep into the 20th century.
"Tillman's true legacy lives on wherever Americans continue to shore up the battered foundations of white supremacy," Kantrowitz notes at the end of this thoroughly researched, brilliantly argued book. "It lives on wherever dissent is met with violence, wherever white men are the only first-class citizens, wherever 'populism' is reduced to what one contemporary called Tillman's 'gospel of discontent.' "
"Ben Tillman and the Reconstruction of White Supremacy" is a rich and insightful dissection of the rise of American racism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Kantrowitz has given us the best study we have of Benjamin Tillman, but he has also given us a way to understand how racism took hold in the post-Civil War South and gradually spread its tentacles to the rest of the country. "White supremacy was hard work," he observes, and no one worked harder at it than Pitchfork Ben Tillman.

 Profits and Principles
 Global Capitalism and
 Human Rights in China.
 By Michael A. Santoro.
 241 pp. Ithaca, N.Y.:
 Cornell University Press. $29.95. 
 Who could have imagined that so wonkish a subject as trade with China would turn into the kind of overheated political issue that, like abortion and gun control, splits people into noisy warring camps? Lines have been drawn in the sand, with choices reduced to stark either-ors: human rights or expanded commerce, worker protection or globalization. But to anyone looking for reasoned discussion instead of rhetorical posturing, Michael A. Santoro's "Profits and Principles" is a fine place to start. Santoro, who teaches at the Rutgers Graduate School of Management, has been visiting China every year for nearly a decade. He has spoken with hundreds of businessmen, workers, government officials and human rights advocates inside and outside China. The stiffness of his prose will doubtless limit his readership, but his solidly grounded analysis deserves a wide audience.
Santoro begins with a valuable distinction. American companies doing business in China can be broadly divided into two types: those seeking to expand their operations by establishing themselves in the increasingly lucrative Chinese market, and those in a global marketplace wishing to reduce their production costs by taking advantage of the country's low-wage labor. The first group makes a firm, long-term commitment to China. Motorola, for instance, has invested more than $1.5 billion in state-of-the-art facilities. Santoro reports that the company's Tianjin plant, which employs about 10,000 workers, is "spacious, clean and well lit." None of the workers "appear to be in the least bit haggard or oppressed." It is, he concludes, "a place that a young graduate of Purdue, North Carolina State or Cal Tech would find congenial."
The businesses of the second group, on the other hand, are responsible for the sweatshop image that dominates American notions of Chinese workplaces. They tend to be in low-tech, labor-intensive, cutthroat industries like apparel and toys, where the economic pressures are constantly downward. In their "race to the bottom," these companies (or, more often, their local subcontractors) provide the lowest possible wages in the grimmest possible conditions.
Santoro's distinction immediately complicates the human rights question. The first group, the market builders, are improving human rights in China, he points out, simply through their presence there. They are changing their workers' values by teaching individual initiative. Outside the factory, they foster a business environment that adheres to rule by law. Perhaps most important, they are creating a meritocratic middle class with a power base independent of the Communist Party. The market builders, Santoro says, are "doing good while doing well."
It is among the second group that the human rights problem is most acute. After reviewing proposals for voluntary regulation, Santoro urges the World Trade Organization to adopt an enforceable code of international labor standards. His impulse is honorable, but one wishes he had been tougher-minded.
Santoro notes that third world governments consistently oppose international codes -- not because they are eager to exploit their own citizens but because they see the codes as a kind of hidden protectionism: if wage, health and safety standards are set too high, these countries lose their comparative advantage. As usual with such matters, the Chinese present the most dramatic illustration of the issue. It is estimated that China will have to create 18 million jobs each year for the foreseeable future simply to stay where it is. In a Malthusian world where millions of Chinese are faced with the alternative of jobless desperation or employment under what the West considers sweatshop conditions, the sweatshops win every time. Attempting to define wage and safety levels that are not so high as to jeopardize job opportunities for people already living at the edge -- and to do so under a system of fluctuating exchange rates -- is a task to try the capacities of even the wisest of men, women and computers. Just how many Solomons are there at the W.T.O. anyway?

 BODY:

 The Selling of
 "Free Trade"
 Nafta, Washington, and the Subversion
 of American Democracy.
 By John R. MacArthur.
 388 pp. New York:
 Hill & Wang. $25. 
 You would have to go back to the 19th century to find a trade battle in Congress that was as divisive as that over the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993. What has been needed is a dispassionate study that gets past the sound and fury. John R. MacArthur's study, "The Selling of 'Free Trade,' "is not really that. It mixes a passionate attack on the treaty with a journalistic account of its passage and effects. Die-hard opponents of the agreement will probably like this book. Others may find it irritatingly one-sided.
Nafta emerged from at least three different impulses: first, Mexican officials, frightened by a growing foreign debt that was crippling their economy, wanted to attract American investment; second, American businesses wanted to be able to invest in Mexico free from export restrictions and domestic content rules, and from the ultimate threat of expropriation; and third, American officials and policy makers, worried about political instability and a torrent of illegal immigrants, wanted to incorporate Mexico into a Common Market-type arrangement that would lead to the revival of its economy, the reform of its government and the reduction of cross-border tensions.
MacArthur understands the first two impulses. He understands that Nafta was primarily an investment agreement rather than a free trade treaty. But he plays down or ignores Americans' broader concerns. Nafta, he insists, was "entirely about money."
MacArthur, the president and publisher of Harper's Magazine, is at his best describing the lobbying that occurred after the treaty was signed and went to Congress in August 1993. He shows how business lobbyists worked hand in glove with the treaty's Congressional supporters. But he has surprisingly little to say about the negotiations themselves, or about the domestic political conflicts that occurred while the treaty was being negotiated. His account of these tends to render shades of gray as black. When the Bush administration proposed that Congress agree to a fast-track vote (up or down without amendments), Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader and a Democrat, backed Bush on the condition that the treaty contain rules on labor standards and environmental protection. MacArthur dismisses this position as nave and opportunistic. (Gephardt "was presumably ambitious to be liked by the sort of people, honest or not, who can make you president.")
A year later, during the presidential campaign, Bill Clinton, under the influence of Gephardt and two advisers, Derek Shearer and Richard Rothstein, adopted the same position. MacArthur treats Clinton even more contemptuously than he does Gephardt. He says Clinton "had already made up his mind on trade to the point where there was no substantial difference between his position and Bush's." Clinton's stand, he says, was primarily based on fund-raising. That assertion leaves little middle ground between those adamantly opposed to Nafta and those enthusiastically in favor. MacArthur may be right, but when I covered the negotiations I found otherwise.
In the Nafta negotiations, Clinton and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, earnestly attempted to get Mexico and Canada to agree to set up commissions that would have significant punitive powers. They failed, primarily because of Mexican and Canadian opposition, as well as opposition from the Business Roundtable and Republicans in Congress. But they also failed because the A.F.L.-C.I.O., instead of trying to work with the administration, took a position of unequivocal opposition to the treaty in any form. Clinton and Gephardt found themselves caught between business-style internationalism and labor protectionism.
The resulting treaty was flawed. MacArthur's view, which also became Gephardt's, was that it should have been rejected, but MacArthur now criticizes Gephardt and John Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, for failing to press for Nafta's repeal on the grounds that it has worsened the condition of Mexican and American workers. In drawing this conclusion, MacArthur ignores two important considerations.
He acknowledges that Mexico was in difficult straits on the eve of Nafta, but he attributes these problems to the Mexican government's abandonment of older high-tariff import substitution policies. Under these policies, MacArthur writes, there was "less social inequality and more purchasing power for the average Mexican." But he fails to note that before the 1980's, the Mexican economy was propped up by oil earnings. When oil prices began to fall, the economy began to stagger, and it is still not on its feet. Nafta may not have improved Mexico's economy, but it is not clear that it has made things worse.
The second consideration has to do with the impact of American investment in Mexico on American jobs. Investment increased somewhat after Nafta was signed, but the boom in American investment in Mexico predated Nafta. And if that investment had not gone to Mexico, it might have ended up in Central America or Asia, not in the United States. If Nafta depressed American wages, it did so indirectly -- by giving credibility to corporate managers' threats that if a union organized or demanded too much for its workers, the company would move to Mexico. Modifying Nafta to strengthen its labor and environmental commissions could benefit both American and Mexican workers, but repealing the treaty doesn't hold any obvious promise for Mexico, the United States or Canada.
To MacArthur's credit, he has tried his best to make a potentially dull subject interesting by treating himself as a character in his narrative; by interspersing long interviews with lobbyists, politicians and affected workers; and by telling the story of one factory in New York that was affected by Nafta. But he is not the most artful author, and the book sometimes drags. It would have been much more lively at half the length. But it probably would not have been any more accurate a portrayal of the choices facing American policy makers and citizens in 1993.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Outside Tucson, A Family Goes Underground

BYLINE: By BETSY RUBINER; BETSY RUBINER, a freelance writer based in Iowa, visits Arizona frequently.

 BODY:
I NEVER knew something could be so cool," my 8-year-old son, Noah, whispered as we stepped into the huge "Throne Room" at Kartchner Caverns State Park, Arizona's latest geological gem, which was unveiled just in time for my family's annual spring trip to Tucson.
There it was: the "Kubla Khan" -- the tallest known column in an Arizona cave. It looked like a Dr. Seuss concoction: a majestic 58-foot-high pillar of hardened mineral built by drop after drop of water falling into the cave for thousands of years. It was impossible not to gawk. 
 When I read last November that the cave -- a rare living and growing one -- was finally opening for tours (25 years after its discovery) I snagged a mid-March reservation. I'm glad I did. By the time we got to Tucson -- 40 miles northwest of Kartchner Caverns -- tours were booked through May. "I hope you have a reservation," a rental car agent warned us.
Hands down, the cave was the highlight of our two-day trip around the Tucson area. But as we have learned in other visits to see my parents (who spend winters in southern Arizona), Tucson can't promise economical travel during the peak tourist season. Tickets to favorite spots like the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum and comfortable family-friendly lodging for me, my husband, Dirck, and our children, Lily, 7 and Noah, can add up. We try to cut costs elsewhere -- picnicking when possible and hiking in glorious Catalina State Park, just north of Tucson (entry fee: $5 a car).
Kartchner Caverns was worth the price of $10 to drive into the remote 550-acre park in the Whetstone Mountains and another $40 total for the 70-minute cave tour. What makes the seven-acre cave system special is that it is so unspoiled. Strange as it sounds, Kartchner Caverns was opened to tourists to protect it. The two spelunk ers who discovered the cave on the Kartch ner family's land in 1974 feared that with out making it a state park (which turned into a $28 million project) and regulat ing the number of visitors, Kartchner Caverns would be overrun and ruined like others.
This helps explain the pricey admission, the tightly controlled access (three tours per hour, 18 people per tour) and the high-tech gadgets, including a misting system that keeps the cave moist as outsiders enter. It also explains why the tour guides watched us so closely.
My family easily spent three hours at the park, starting with the hands-on exhibits in the Discovery Center. Noah and Lily made a beeline for the 80,000-year-old bones of a Shasta ground sloth found in the cave. They also had fun squeezing through a replica of the cave hole that the founding spelunkers used. I passed. We all fingered a fake stalagmite -- touching the real ones is forbidden.
By the time we left for our tour, Noah and Lily had grown very quiet -- a bit spooked, I suspected, after learning about the original spelunkers' crawl through tight tunnels and cold mud into a very dark place. I had the jitters too as we entered the cave through a series of six huge steel freezer doors that help keep out the dry desert air.
Not to worry. The three cave rooms we visited were wide-open spaces, discreetly lighted so we could see their many treasures. As two guides with flashlights ushered us along a paved, dimly illuminated path wide enough for a wheelchair, it felt like we were in the upper balcony of a dark opera house.
Looking down, we saw the original spelunkers' footprints in the mud. Looking up, we saw countless mineral formations in countless colors and shapes. We were surrounded by stalactites and stalagmites in reds, grays and browns. Some resembled carrots, fried eggs, popcorn and well-done bacon; others looked like delicate hollow "soda straws."
Our guide treated us more like geology students than sightseers, making interesting observations in terms we all could readily grasp. One drawback: because the tour was so choreographed and clinical, the cave didn't seem quite spooky enough. That changed when we got to the Throne Room, where the Kubla Khan (named after the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem about a terrestrial paradise) presides. There, a brief light-and-music show helped us experience the cave's intrinsic mystery and romance. The show began with the cave dark and silent enough to hear a drop of water land. Then, like a spelunker's flashlight, hidden lights within the cave illuminated one marvel after another.
After we stumbled back out into the sunlight, our clothes strangely moist, Noah and Lily were "sworn in" as junior rangers, earnestly repeating an oath to protect the caves.
Next? Fresh apple pie. We found it 12 miles northeast at the Horseshoe Steakhouse and Cantina in the dusty town of Benson. Four slices of pie with wonderful flaky crust and four drinks came to $14.49, a splurge after our prudent picnic back at the park.
Driving back north, we scrapped plans to stop at Tucson's famous 18th-century Mexican Baroque church, the Mission San Xavier del Bac, when we discovered Lily and Noah asleep in the back seat. (Rule No. 1 when traveling with kids: Don't wake them up.) But by the time we got to our hotel in north Tucson, they were ready for the pool. Our two-room suite at the cheerful Windmill Inn at St. Philip's Plaza, a swanky shopping complex, cost $129 a night, including tax. Had I started looking earlier, I might have done even better, but we liked what we got: a bedroom with two double beds plus a living room with a small eating area, microwave and mini-refrigerator.
Dinner got off to a shaky start that night when we found an almost two-hour wait at El Charro Cafe, a lively Mexican restaurant downtown. (Unfortunately, we hadn't made reservations.) The apologetic host promised us a table the next night. Moving on, we drove with my parents about 25 minutes east to the Hidden Valley Inn, a bustling restaurant popular with families. The lavish Western decor was more clever than cheesy and the kids loved it -- especially the glassed-in displays of Western scenes featuring moving miniature cowboys carved from wood.
In a lounge that looked like Miss Kitty's Saloon, we enjoyed listening to Jess Hawk Oakenstar croon Patsy Cline songs at the edge of a busy dance floor. Hidden Valley is the kind of steak place that lists a half a barbecued chicken ($9.99) on its light menu, and mine was delicious. So were the ground sirloin steak ($9.99) and the kids' "cowpoke chicken" strips ($4.99). Choosing carefully and skipping liquor, we kept our bill to $66.21 for six. We needed no dessert.
We stayed above ground the next day, driving 12 miles west from downtown Tucson to the Desert Museum through landscape that really was straight out of a western movie. We passed Old Tucson Studios, where many westerns were filmed. Snaking through winding passes in the jagged Tucson Mountains, we had a breathtaking view of the desert valley that is home to the museum. Hundreds of saguaro cactuses waved at us like happy Gumbys.
We paid $33.35 for five tickets (my mother joined us, my dad played golf) to the Desert Museum, which is part zoo, botanical garden and natural history museum. Although it was crowded, the Desert Museum is mostly open-air so there was plenty of elbow room. All the animals -- coyotes, javelinas (which look like pigs), even the mountain lions -- were out. So were the enthusiastic docents with their animal skulls and geology models. Lily and Noah got to pet a small gopher snake. Three hours whizzed by. It was time for another picnic, this one at a secluded table outside the museum.
We were reminded how miserable a southern Arizona family vacation can be when a sudden storm rumbled over the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson, where we'd hoped to take an afternoon hike in Catalina State Park. Instead we drove past the park about 20 miles northeast to an attraction that's long been on our "maybe" list: the Biosphere 2 Center, where eight adults lived in isolation from 1991 to 1993 and now a scientific research center run by Columbia University. We discovered you couldn't see much from the entrance gate and that the tour was a budget-buster ($12.95 each for adults; $6 each for Noah and Lily). So we skipped it and gladly returned to the hotel.
That night, the host at El Charro kept his promise. For $57.75, the six of us ate well, thanks to the restaurant's enormous portions and delicious signature dish, carne seca: strips of beef marinated in lime and garlic and sun-dried in cages atop El Charro's roof. For dessert, we spent $12.77 at an ice cream shop near the University of Arizona.
By morning, our last at the inn, the storm had cleared. Dirck took Lily window-shopping near the hotel. Noah and I borrowed some of the hotel's one-speed bikes, hit the dusty trail behind St. Philip's Plaza and rode off into the sunshine.
 
The bottom line on a family trip around Tucson
Our family of four spent about $260 a day on our hotel, meals and sightseeing during a two-day March trip to the Tucson area to visit Kartchner Caverns State Park. Both dinners were for six people, including my parents. Lunch and sightseeing the second day was for five people, including my mother.
 
Transportation
We rented a four-door compact car from Alamo, (800) 327-9633, at the Tucson International Airport for about $50 a day; rates are substantially lower now.
 
Hotel
We stayed at the Windmill Inn at St. Philip's Plaza, 4250 North Campbell Avenue, Tucson; (520) 577-0007; fax (520) 577-0045. It is a three-story pink stucco Southwestern-style hotel with 122 suites, situated in an attractive north Tucson shopping complex. We paid $120, plus $9 tax a night. The suite originally cost $135 a night during peak season from January through April but I got a lower rate with a casual inquiry. In May, rates are $99 or $120 poolside for a similar suite, dropping further in June.
Our bedroom had two double beds and a handy extra sink. The living room had a small eating area, mini-refrigerator and microwave. We also got muffins, hot drinks and juice delivered to the suite for breakfast, a courtyard pool and Jacuzzi, plus bikes, board games and books on loan.
 
Activities
Tours of the cave at the new Kartchner Caverns State Park are already so popular that reservations must be made months in advance; in early May, tours were fully booked through July. The seven-acre cave system is an easy 45-minute drive southeast from Tucson, nine miles south of Interstate 10, off Highway 90 in Cochise County. To book a tour, call (520) 586-2283. The tour lasts 70 minutes and the walk is about a third of a mile.
Open daily, the park offers three cave tours an hour (limited to 18 people and two guides), with the first at 8:30 a.m., the last at 4:30 p.m. The tours cost $14; $6 for children 7 to 13. Park officials do not recommend the tour for children under 7 but there is no charge for those who take it.
The cave is wheelchair accessible, but no electric chairs are permitted; the park can supply a push chair if needed. Walkers are not allowed. There is an additional $10 charge to drive into the 550-acre park, which also has an interesting Discovery Center with a 15-minute film and interactive exhibits, plus two hiking trails, a hummingbird garden and picnic tables.
Mission San Xavier del Bac, 1950 West San Xavier Road, (520) 294-2624, is about nine miles south of downtown Tucson. The glistening white church, finished in 1797, is full of exquisite baroque Mexican art and recently underwent a six-year restoration for interior cleaning; exterior restoration is still going on. Admission is free. Open 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday Masses are at 8 and 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.
We visited the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, 2021 North Kinney Road, to learn about the plants and animals native to the Sonoran Desert region, which includes parts of Arizona and California as well as northern Mexico. The 21-acre museum, a 25-minute drive from downtown Tucson, has almost two miles of paths, two restaurants and two snack bars. It is open seven days a week from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. March through September; 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. October through February. On Saturday nights June through September in the summer, it is open until 10 p.m. Admission is $8.95 March through September, $9.95 the rest of the year; $1.75 for children 6 through 12; free for children under 6. Information: (520) 883-2702.
Columbia University's Biosphere 2 Center, 32540 South Biosphere Road, (520) 896-6200, is in Oracle, about 20 miles north of Tucson on Highway 77. Admission is $12.95; $8.95 for ages 13 to 17; $6 for ages 6 to 12; free for children under 6.
 
Places to Eat
The Hidden Valley Inn, 4825 North Sabino Canyon Road, (520) 299-4941, is a Western-style restaurant and entertainment spot about 15 miles east of downtown Tucson. This is a big barn of a dining hall lavishly outfitted with wagon wheels and saddles. We spent $66.21 for six, without drinks, by ordering carefully. The children's menu has selections in the $4 to $6.50 range including "little bronco burgers" and "gunslinger grilled cheese." Open daily, for lunch and dinner, Hidden Valley also has dinner musical shows in a separate room two or three nights a week ($30, including the meal).
Tucson now has three branches of El Charro Cafe, but we stick with the original, which opened in 1922. It's a hopping place downtown at 311 North Court Avenue, (520) 622-1922. Reservations must be made at least a day in advance. We ate enormous burritos and tacos made with the house specialty, carne seca (strips of beef marinated in lime and garlic, then sun-dried). The total came to $57.75 for six, including a couple of margaritas. El Charro is open for lunch and dinner daily.
After our picnic at Kartchner Caverns, we drove 12 miles to Benson, for apple and cherry pie at the Horseshoe Steakhouse and Cantina, 154 East 4th Street, (520) 586-3303. Four slices of pie, two iced teas and two glasses of milk cost $14.49.

HEADLINE: Birding at the End of Nature

BYLINE: By Jonathan Rosen; Jonathan Rosen is the founding culture editor of The Forward and the author of the novel "Eve's Apple." His next book, "The Talmud and the Internet: A Journey Between Worlds," will be published in September.

 BODY:
Early this spring, long before the trees had leafed, I found myself standing in the rain in a dark field in southern New Jersey waiting for woodcocks -- shy, chunky, long-billed birds -- to rise out of the shadows and begin their mating dance. Sometimes called timberdoodles, woodcocks are not the most graceful birds on the planet. Their eyes are spaced so far apart that you might wonder how they can see the trees in front of them. As the late winter days begin to lengthen, they throw caution to the wind, and at dawn and dusk the males rise straight up into the air some 200 or 300 feet and then spiral down, uttering a plaintive, musical series of notes. Although deterred by cold, they don't seem to be bothered by rain -- and that's a good thing, too, because this "sky dancing" is how they maintain themselves as a species. The mystery is what was I, a devoted urbanite, doing there?
I've been watching birds for six years. It all began at a brunch in Manhattan when someone happened to mention that soon the warblers would be arriving in Central Park. I didn't know what precisely warblers were, but I knew in some uncanny way that when they arrived I would go out to find them. The next day, I signed up for a course in beginning bird-watching at the New York City chapter of the Audubon Society. There were two classes and two field trips -- one to the Jamaica Bay wildlife refuge and one to Central Park. To get to Jamaica Bay, I took the A train to Broad Channel in Queens, where I saw glossy ibis and snow geese and egrets rising against the Manhattan skyline, sharing the air with jets taking off from Kennedy Airport. On the trip to Central Park, not two blocks from where I live, I saw warblers -- tiny, colorful neotropical migrants, flitting with mysterious life in the trees and bushes of the Ramble, the 36-acre woodland at the heart of the park. 
 Some 300 of North America's 700 bird species pass through New York City each spring on their way north. Discovering these birds in the park where I had played as a child was a revelation. I had not known at the time that nature was missing from my life, but this newfound connection to something wild made me feel, for lack of a better word, whole. It was as if I had never seen the stars and someone tapped me on the shoulder one night and told me to look up.
With a convert's zeal, I began spending countless hours stalking birds with my binoculars, and as soon as spring was over, I began to look forward to fall, when they would come back on their return flight. I began subscribing to mainstream periodicals like Audubon and Natural History and then to specialty journals with names like Birder's World, Birdwatcher's Digest and Winging It. I bought Birding by Ear tapes and Peterson's guide to Eastern birds, then the more comprehensive "National Geographic Guide" and species-specific volumes like "Warblers of the Americas" and "Hawks in Flight." I began to plan my vacations and even my work assignments to birding hot spots like Madera Canyon in southern Arizona, Bosque del Apache in New Mexico, the Orkneys in Scotland, the Everglades.
I had stumbled into a vast, largely invisible world. It seemed like a private discovery, until it dawned on me that I was part of a quiet revolution. The first time I traveled for the express purpose of birding I went to Point Pelee in Ontario. Pulling into the bed-and-breakfast where my wife and I were staying, I saw a car with vanity plates that read "Birder." At 6 a.m. in the packed parking lot of the nature preserve the next morning, I found hundreds of people wearing sun hats and binoculars; though somewhat taken aback by the crowds, I felt a thrilling shock of recognition. Like the birds themselves, the world of bird-watching had simply been hidden from me. Once I was initiated, I found a whole complex culture waiting to receive me.
According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service, somewhere between 42 million and 50 million Americans over the age of 16 watch birds, far more than the numbers of people who hunt and fish combined. Birders spend some $20 billion a year -- on travel and optics and gear and seed -- and scores of birding festivals have sprung up in the last few decades, reversing the fortunes of small coastal towns in Texas and rural backwaters in regions that were once neglected. There are now more than 400 franchise stores, like Wildbird Unlimited, specializing in birding gear and birdseed, and some 600 more independents. Twenty years ago there were almost none. This August, Houghton Mifflin -- which, since publishing Roger Tory Peterson's first field guide in 1934, has sold eight million Peterson bird guides -- will publish a new field guide to the birds by Kenn Kaufman with a first printing of 150,000 copies, making it Houghton Mifflin's biggest book of the year. In October, Knopf will bring out "The Sibley Guide to Birds," created by the master bird artist David Allen Sibley, with a print run of 100,000.
The appeal of birds may be mythically ingrained -- think of the bird gods of Egypt -- but there are also practical explanations. For one thing, they're still here. Remnants of wild America may lurk in corners of the country, but birds, thanks to their ability to fly, span the continent. "There is probably no place in North America where you can stand and not hear birds," Pete Dunne, director of the Cape May Bird Observatory, told me recently. Even from my apartment, I hear blue jays and mourning doves and house finches and the occasional downy woodpecker. In the heart of downtown, pigeons pace the windowsills in memory of their cliff-dwelling rock dove origins, and sparrows peep out of the hollow metal crossbars of virtually every traffic light. For Dunne, the environmental movement of the 1960's "left its imprint on everyone," so that grown-up baby boomers with time on their hands are not simply discovering nature but returning to something that touched them when they were teenagers learning about the effects of DDT.
Dunne, 48, himself typifies the new sort of birder; he has helped popularize the pursuit with lively books like "Tales of a Low-Rent Birder" as well as serious field guides. He is also the creator of the World Series of Birding, a freewheeling annual event that takes place the second week of May in which participants have 24 hours to find as many bird species as possible using the entire state of New Jersey as the playing field. The team with the most sightings at the end of the day wins. Begun in 1984 with 13 teams, the World Series now attracts more than 50 teams from all over the world and raises about half a million dollars for conservation groups. The World Series and numerous similar events, like the Great Texas Birdathon, gratify the naked competitive energy that fuels a certain sort of bird-watching -- sometimes referred to as "birding," distinct from bird-watching. Birders are more likely to keep "life lists" of what they have seen and are known to travel great distances to add a single bird -- a lesser prairie chicken in, say, Kansas or a rose-throated becard in Arizona -- to their lists.
I am neither a fanatical "lister" nor a casual backyard bird-watcher but something in between. Of course, birding itself is an in-between activity, half science and half pastime, half sport and half conservationist crusade. Born of an ancient impulse, it required the 20th century, when binoculars replaced the shotgun, to be fully realized. Some primal, conquering hunter's urge is never far below the surface when I'm out with my binoculars, even though the living bird is all I'm after. Linked to the natural world, bird-watching nevertheless forces me to stand at a slight remove. It is more about the interplay of the human and the natural -- naming, labeling, fitting the wild world against the ordering grid of human understanding, even as I am simultaneously lured farther out into animal habitats. I am left with something both untamed and ordered -- a weirdly satisfying, deeply human mixture of elements.
But things may not be as satisfying for the birds. "The owl of Minerva flies only at dusk" -- Hegel's comment about civilizations flourishing as they move toward the brink of extinction -- has an eerie echo for bird-watchers. Just as nature was, in some sense, beginning for me, Bill McKibben was foretelling "The End of Nature." The inexhaustible, self-renewing environment of our fantasies died with the Industrial Revolution, and unless we change our ways, he posited, rising temperatures, acid rain and a host of other ills will carry off what's left of the natural world. Bird-watching, alas, is not necessarily an indication of the health of the bird population. George Fenwick, president of the American Bird Conservancy, a small but important advocacy group, points to the fanaticism of British bird-watchers, well known in this country because so many show up at American birding spots. "The best birders are there and everyone's obsessed with birds," he told me, and yet "there's hardly a wood lot left -- everything's been developed and redeveloped. I'm glad the Brits are so interested, but I hope that's not our fate."
Bird-watching, in other words, may be what you do at the end of nature. According to Frank Gill, director of science for the National Audubon Society, one out of every six species in North America is in trouble, declining 2 to 10 percent a year; over 20 or 30 years, that means whole species would be cut in half -- or worse.
On the wall of my study, near a multiplying collection of bird books, hangs a reproduction of Audubon's portrait of two passenger pigeons. Although these birds roosted communally and flew in flocks so vast that they darkened the sky for hours while passing overhead, Audubon has given them individual life, a male and female, touching bills. I find these birds, peach and blue and gray, not merely beautiful but haunting, a sort of avian memento mori. One hundred years ago, on March 24, 1900 (and it adds a weirdly modern element that we know the exact date), the last wild passenger pigeon ever recorded was shot out of the sky in Pike County, Ohio. Fourteen years later, the last surviving member of the species, a bird named Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoo.
Today's imperiled birds include the Bicknell's thrush, a modest species that nests on mountaintops from New York to Canada and winters on the island of Hispaniola in the highest elevations of the Dominican Republic -- where 90 percent of the land has already been deforested. Development and population pressures there are such that there is a real danger of extinction, not merely for the Bicknell's thrush but for other species wintering there as well. The grand migratory flights of birds that I found so exhilarating because they carried my imagination in all directions, even standing in Manhattan looking up, began, as I became more aware of their imperiled status, to darken the sky with danger -- and with politics.
Paul Kerlinger, an expert in bird migration who studies the economic impact of birding, wants bird-watchers to wake up to their enormous spending power. They might agree to a tax on birdseed, he says, or endorse legislation like the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, which would use revenues from offshore oil drilling to support habitat conservation. His studies have shown that ecotourism often brings more money to an area like the Delaware Bay than a local industry like horseshoe crab harvesting, which has a directly adverse effect on the birds. But his economic approach has had only limited appeal. "I don't know if they're all Luddites or Socialists or what," Kerlinger says in frustration, alluding to the deep-seated fear among some bird-watchers that market forces are at odds with environmentalism.
However birders feel about economic strategies, it is not easy to organize people who do something so solitary and so individualistic. Unlike hunting or fishing, birding requires no license -- you need only slip out the door with a pair of binoculars, which is why Kenn Kaufman, who dropped out of high school and hitchhiked across the country looking for birds, calls bird-watching a "subversive" activity.
Make a birder, make a conservationist, Roger Tory Peterson said. All I really wanted was to look at birds -- but that won't be possible if I don't give in to this secondary duty and make my thinking as global as the birds themselves are. It remains to be seen if the rise in bird-watchers can somehow stop the disappearance of the birds -- since saving the birds means saving the places they live, which is to say what's left of the natural world.
The great biologist Edward O. Wilson coined the term "biophilia" to describe the inborn need of human beings to affiliate with nature because as a species we evolved within the natural world. We may have an urge to conquer nature, but we still need it around us for our mental and even our genetic health. If this is true, then conservation is really only a form of self-interest. And bird-watching, as I have long suspected, isn't really a hobby, any more than rearing my daughter is a hobby. It's just a way of participating in the natural world that produced me, if only in a token, postmodern manner.
In his poem "The Oven Bird," Robert Frost made this small warbler with a stripe of orange down the middle of its head (easily seen in Central Park in May) a metaphor for the vanishing natural world. "The question that he frames in all but words," the poet wrote, "is what to make of a diminished thing." That is still the question bird-watching poses. I think of this in my field in southern New Jersey, where the light is failing, my patience is waning and the woodcock, as a chill wind kicks up, is making itself scarce.
Nature itself may be failing -- and we may be failing it. But from out of the darkness, I suddenly hear the call of the woodcock -- a buzzy, nasal "peent" not altogether unlike the "meep meep" sound the roadrunner makes in the cartoon when he sees the coyote. Everyone in my group falls breathlessly silent, and then there is a whir of wings that make their own music as the bird launches himself from a nearby patch of scrub straight up into the air. When he reaches the apex of his flight he begins to drift down in a wavering series of spirals, singing as he goes. If his song is successful, then when he lands, in the exact spot he took off from, a female woodcock will be waiting for him and they will mate.
The woodcock is dimly visible against the dark sky, and for a moment philosophy and ecology and poetry and politics all go out the window. What to make of a diminished thing? It will take a lifetime to figure that out. But for one brief, heart-stopping second, the bird itself seems like answer enough.

HEADLINE: Green Acres, and How They Stay That Way

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE WOODSIDE 

 BODY:
PARKS, golf courses and beaches have two qualities in common.
Looking at them is relaxing, and maintaining them so that people will want to look at them requires long hours, dedication and specialized equipment. The maintenance experts at three beautiful Connecticut recreation sites know this all too well. 

Elizabeth Park
Nine city workers and at least 150 volunteers maintain the pastoral scene at Elizabeth Park in Hartford, the only public botanical garden in Connecticut. This 102-acre city park is the former Charles Pond estate, named for his wife in the late 1800's.
Visitors stroll through two and a half acres of roses, a tulip and annual garden, perennial beds, a rock garden and two herb gardens. All of this requires constant grooming by the workers and volunteers.
The pastel beauty of the rose garden consists of 15,000 bushes of 800 to 900 varieties. Donna Fuss, the rosarian, invites anyone to count them, as she has often in her job tending the garden for the Friends of Elizabeth Park. The Friends formed in 1977 by some members of the Federated Garden Clubs of Connecticut at a time when the city, running out of money, was about to raze some of the gardens.
Resources are not lavish even with the Friends to help. Mrs. Fuss said she quickly uses her yearly rose bush replacement budget of $8,000, which comes from donations.
The rest of the plants in Elizabeth Park come from the park's labyrinth of greenhouses, where Robert Prill, the park's maintenance supervisor, grows 25,000 seedlings (of 50 plant varieties) each year. The plants from the greenhouses also go to other city gardens, such as those around City Hall.
Each week, year-round, Mr. Prill and his staff mix at least four bags of peat moss and pearlite into four wheelbarrow loads of topsoil and two wheelbarrow loads of sand to make a starting mix. There is no time of year when they are not nurturing some little thing in the greenhouses.
Around the gardens are the grass. The staff uses two specialized mowers that can weave around plants. They also own about a half-dozen regular push mowers and two riding mowers. Most parts of the park get mowed once a week which means something is being mowed almost daily.
"It's like a maze out there and you have to have a certain kind of machine that can make the turns without taking out the bushes or the flowers," Mr. Prill said.
 
Hammonasset Beach State Park
Six workers and a supervisor sweat over a fleet of heavy machinery to tame the 940 acres that make up this state park in Madison. One person spends four hours a day, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, just raking the beach. The worker rides a tractor dragging metal fingers along the two miles of sandy waterfront. The rake is attached to a conveyer that pulls in everything in its path -- cigarette butts, cans, diapers, old forks and the like.
But the tractor can't handle some of the bigger junk that ends up here. Once the workers found about 50 tires had washed up during the night, said Lori Quirk, the maintenance supervisor. It is common in the early spring to find tree trunks that floated down the Connecticut River and then washed west to the park. This spring they had to dispose of a dead beaver.
Once summer comes, another laborer does nothing but mow all day, five days a week. The job involves driving a tractor with three 7-foot-wide mowing arms that can be lifted up and down as the need arises. The behemoth whirs its way over 400 acres of fields where people set up tents, play ball, or otherwise romp.
Workers also prune bushes and trees. A real struggle for them in recent years is to try to get rid of non-native plants, like autumn olive and Oriental bittersweet, that are choking trees and native plants. The problem is worse in the last few years, Ms. Quirk said, possibly because the maintenance crews were smaller for several years and had less time to cut back the weeds.
She said the addition of two workers this year has improved the situation but the crew still is not as large as it was in the late 1980's. The park's 1.5 million visitors need to park their cars, drink water and use restrooms, and the maintenance crew must deal with those problems, too. They repair walls and plumbing in 22 bathhouses, maintain the boardwalks and make improvements in the parking lots. This spring a new layer of gravel will fill in ruts in one of the dirt lots.
While most of the work runs on a predictable schedule, nature brings surprises. One year the winter storms left the parks water main exposed along the beach. The crew had to repair damage to the pipe, but the state does not truck in sand here. Luckily, later storms covered it over again.
 
Clinton Country Club
Inside a brand-new 3,000-square-foot maintenance building sits the fleet of mowing equipment that keeps this private golf course looking so beautiful. Each spring the pressure is on to get the fairways, greens and even the rough in shape for more than 300 members who play on the par-72 course.
They must like this 100-acre, 18-hole course and driving range, which are on an otherwise wooded road in the waterfront town of Clinton. People who want to join are put on a waiting list. Right now it takes 10 years to get off it. From early April to mid-May, Michael Decker, the superintendent, and staff of three full-timers and three seasonal workers, are deep into the rush to get things ready. Mr. Decker has a $500,000 budget to pay workers and buy supplies and equipment. He also is linked to a weather satellite that reports conditions every 15 minutes.
Mr. Decker said the economy is so good right now that it is hard to attract young people to work at the course in the summer. This year workers planted new trees near the entrance, placed sod on a new driving range and began the season's relentless schedule of mowing the grass to the exacting lengths designed to enhance the game.
Three times a week, workers ride the fairway mowers to clip the grass to nine-sixteenths of an inch. Why nine-sixteenths of an inch? That is the length that works best here, he said. (Some courses cut to a half-inch.) A four-foot-wide swath between the fairways and the rough gets clipped to 1 1/2 inches.
Two days a week, another worker rides the articulator, a mower that can go over bumps to mow the rough to a woolly 2 inches deep -- long enough to be a challenge, short enough so the golfers can see the balls. The rough used to be 3 inches deep, but people couldn't find their golf balls, Mr. Decker said.
The club owns two spraying machines. Workers ride on these to dispense anything water-soluble, including grub killers, fungicides and growth regulators. Mr. Decker said he keeps such applications to a minimum because no one likes to be around chemicals, least of all the workers. The grass is well established and requires very little insecticide, he said.
Then there are the two specialized riding mowers that cut and roll the greens. Every day a worker trims the greens to one-eighth of an inch. Every other day, the grass around the tees is trimmed to same length. The machine's rollers press down the blades to a smooth, faster surface. Mr. Decker said people occasionally ask him if its imitation grass.
The maintenance crew also has to rake the bunkers, or sand traps. This year they made a new bunker at the second hole. The old one was so deep that golfers were having too hard a time getting out of it.
Mr. Decker said few people realize the amount of care and attention that goes into caring for a golf course. His main concern is the grass itself, which he describes as a never-ending battle. He combines two varieties of grass, one a native variety of bluegrass that is robust and another, known as bent grass, that is softer and does not sprout seed heads the way the bluegrass does.
The way he handles it at Clinton is by constantly overseeding with the softer variety of grass. Periodically the crew rolls an aerator over the grass and inserts new grass seed in the holes.

HEADLINE: Pigs, Quilts, Tomatoes: It Must Be Fair Time

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
FROM July to October, if you want to tout your prize tomatoes or brag about your baking skills, promote your photography or show off your string beans, there is an agricultural fair somewhere in Connecticut where you can do it.
Agricultural fairs started as a day off, a time at harvest when farmers could socialize with their peers, when their children could enter their prize animals in competition and quilters could compare their handiwork. Though agriculture represents a shrinking sector of the economy, the tradition continues. 
 "People are still growing things out in their yards, and they still want to find out how they did compared to everyone else," said Raymond Schaer, president of the Cannon Grange Agricultural Fair, which is held on the last Sunday of August every year in Wilton. "It's a fascination with the basic life style, sort of back to the earth. I think sometimes, for some people, on a Sunday, it's a nice way to go back to a simpler time."
The fairs range from gatherings of a few thousand people in a single day in Orange to crowds approaching a quarter-million over long weekends in Durham and Woodstock. Prize money could be as little as $200 at the smaller fairs to $80,000 or more at the state-level events.
Every fair has the standards: produce competition, livestock judging, probably a beauty pageant, square dancing and a tractor pull. But many develop their own specialty. It might be a flea market at one, a horse show at another, or a pie-eating or nail-driving contest, perhaps an egg toss. There are usually picnic areas, and live entertainment of some sort, ranging from local magic acts to national headliners at the Durham Fair, which in the past has offered country singers such as Billy Ray Cyrus, Patty Loveless, Loretta Lynn and Boxcar Willy, and the rock artists .38 Special and Three Dog Night.
And it can be had pretty cheap in most cases, from free admission to a high of about $5 for adults; most fairs admit children free. This year the fairs run from July 13, when the North Stonington Agricultural Fair opens, until Oct. 15, when the Riverton Fair closes.
Paul R. Schweitzer is president of the Harwinton Fair, the last major fair, always the first weekend in October, this year Oct. 7 and 8. "About 12 years ago, we got snowed out on Sunday," he said. "We literally had to shut the fair down. Then other years, we've had temperatures in the 80's."
James M. Zeoli, president of the Orange Country Fair, Sept. 16 and 17, said the men generally head for the doodle bug pulls -- a doodle bug is sort of a homemade contraption on the chassis of a heavy truck -- while the women are partial to the antique dealers and arts and crafts, and the children check out the police and fire department booths and the animal exhibits.
"It's more chickens and rabbits than larger animals, but we usually get a couple of dozen cows, some goats, and maybe a sow with piglets," Mr. Zeoli said. "Sometimes we set up an incubator with chicken eggs, and when word gets around that a hatch is in progress, the kids gather around. Years ago, you took for granted that everyone had seen a chicken hatch, because everyone kept them. But it's not something most people have an opportunity to see today."
One way to keep people coming back, Mr. Zeoli said, is to offer something new. This year for the first time the Orange Country Fair will bring in the Old Time Indian River Lumberjack Show, which features sawing and chopping competitions and a log-rolling contest.
For a first-timer, a fair could easily produce sensory overload: the one-lunger engines chugging away to power a shingle mill, the bellowing of a tractor pulling a huge concrete block, the cackle of chickens or the grunting of pigs. Then there are the smells from the food booths: fried dough, sausage and pepper grinders, five-alarm chili or clam chowder or deep-fried onions and potatoes. And, from the animal barns, the earthy scents of cattle and horses, sheep and goats, chickens and rabbits, perhaps even a llama or two these days.
"Those are sounds you don't hear anymore, scents that are no longer familiar," said Charles J. McCullough, president of the Norfield Grange Fair in Weston, held each year the first Sunday after Labor Day.
His is a small fair, attracting 3,000 to 3,500 people. Others are much larger, such as the Woodstock Fair, which drew more than 216,000 people over the Friday-to-Monday Labor Day weekend last year, and would have topped 250,000 if it had not been for rain the last day, said Annette M. Hamilton. This year, Mrs. Hamilton finishes her fourth and last year as president. She is the first woman elected to the job in the 137-year history of the fair.
Until a few years ago, vendors pitching kitchen aides and encyclopedias filled the main exhibition hall at Woodstock, but they were relegated to a smaller building when some thought the fair was becoming too commercial. Now,the vegetables, flowers, photography and crafts take center stage. "You need your vendors because that's what pays your bills and allows you to open the doors," Mrs. Hamilton said. "But you can't let them overrun the fair. Our main goal is that people get the culture of agriculture, that they get the feel for what it is to be a farmer."
With fewer farmers in the state, some fairs are finding it more difficult to fill the exhibition halls, she said. "We're drawing from Rhode Island and Massachusetts and New Hampshire and even Maine," Mrs. Hamilton said. "It's not just Connecticut farmers anymore.."
Planning goes on year-round, she said, with monthly meetings increasing to once a week as fair weekend draws near. She estimated that there are 200 volunteers with the fair association, and another 1,800 who show up to staff booths for the Lions, Elks, volunteer fire departments and other community groups. Even with all that labor, though, the fair has had to hire a year-round general manager, concession manager, secretary and assistant manager.
"It never ends," said Mrs. Hamilton. "We have all of the things set up for this year already, and we're already planning for 2001."
Even the fair officers are elected in a succession from second vice president, to first vice president, to president, holding each of the jobs for four years; when a new president takes office, the succession is pretty much assured for the next 12 years. But it's getting harder to put on the fairs, because most of the active members are getting old, and there are no young people coming in behind them.
"At our meeting last night I told the members we were going to have a site on the Internet, and you'd have thought I was talking about Star Wars," said Mr. McCullough of the Norfield Grange Fair. "The average age of the members is probably well into their 60's, and we've got some into their 80's. If we're going to survive, we've got to get young people involved."
John H. Hauser, president of the Greenfield Grange Fair in Fairfield, agreed. He said when he joined the Grange 14 years ago, there were 12 Granges in the county; today, it has dwindled to 6. Generally, fewer than 20 people are at the monthly meetings, down from about 40 when he started. When he was growing up in the 1950's there were 150 active members.
"They keep losing membership because young people just aren't joining, and when they don't have enough they just close the doors and turn their charters back to the state," Mr. Hauser said. "We're hanging in there, but just barely. If the Grange goes belly up, most of the agricultural fairs will go with it."

Very Early Admission

BYLINE: By Anemona Hartocollis 

 BODY:
This is the season when many parents begin the perilous journey of getting their toddlers into the right preschool and face the possibility of their social and intellectual rejection. As applications for the fall of 2001 loom, two of New York City's veteran preschool directors, Marlene Barron, head of the West Side Montessori School, and Jean Rosenberg, founder and director of the Chelsea Day School, offer an inside view of the dreaded admissions interview.
Barron: We had a 2-year-old program, and we got rid of it because we were turning down families with children we had interviewed at 18 months, and I just could not do that, ethically. I could not live with myself. I could not deal that ego blow to a family. 
 Rosenberg: I had a Japanese family who applied, and they didn't get in. The day after the letters went out, this woman arrived in my office. She came to me while I was greeting my kids and broke down in tears and said, "What did I do wrong?" Culturally, it was probably devastating to her to stand in front of an authority figure and say that. Those kinds of things break my heart, they kill me, every year.
Barron: Parents have the mistaken idea that there's one thing their child does that means he's in, or there's one thing their child does that means he's out. There's no such one thing.
Rosenberg: I tell my families, "You're coming to have a visit -- I'm not screening your child."
Barron: We want people who are not trying to sort of act their way into it.
We had a family one year, and Mom comes in and is interviewed and her whole posture was around ethnicity. She's really interested in families that have different ethnic backgrounds -- racial backgrounds, I mean -- because she knows that's important here. And hers is a white family. The interviewer at that point was white. And we felt that it was an oversell. We did not accept the child. The following year she applied again, and this time we gave her a black interviewer. Little did she know, it was a very wealthy black interviewer. And then she started going on about -- well, trashing, in a subtle way -- rich people. You know, she likes the school because there's an economic mix. She kept trying to give the right answer, and it was artificial. Why couldn't she have just been herself? What was her point in all this? And though we laughed about it behind the scenes, this woman wasn't comfortable in her own skin.
Rosenberg: And unfortunately that impacts on her child.
Barron: That's right. The child was fine, perfectly acceptable. But we felt
this family would always be trying to second-guess. And it wasn't needed.
There is no school that just does six items with a child, six test kind of items, and says, O.K., this makes or breaks it.
Rosenberg: Kids are being trained to pass these tests, so that the test doesn't mean anything after a while. If everybody's taking a course to take the test, it doesn't work anymore. So the rules are going to be different.
Barron: Everything is subjective. We're all looking through our own eyes, our own history. There is no perfect. There's no perfect husband, there's no perfect wife, there's no perfect apartment, there's no perfect restaurant. Everything is a matter of negotiation and making some sort of adjustments. And parents have to think about that in a school. That notion of perfect -- we've got to get rid of it.
Rosenberg: Yeah, life does not begin and end in the place that you go to school.
Barron: And they won't have perfect children, either. No child is perfect. Children are an ongoing process. Moderated by Anemona Hartocollis

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 5-21-00: The Ethicist;
Worse for Not Wearing

BYLINE: By Randy Cohen 

 BODY:
I often ride my motorcycle without a helmet. Our state helmet law basically applies to motorcycle riders under 18. I figure I'm not putting anyone but myself at risk. My friends say that this is tantamount to suicide. But isn't it just one of many risks all of us take everyday? -- Kelly Krebs, Minneapolis
 If riding without a helmet affected only you, then helmet laws would be intrusive and paternalistic, and you'd be doing nothing unethical by riding bareheaded. An autonomous rider living free of the larger society is an attractive and romantic idea, but like most romantic ideas, it has little correspondence with actual life. Should you get in an accident, you are likely to be more seriously injured than you would be wearing a helmet, and thus you'll consume enormous medical resources. And should you die, your dependents might need a variety of public assistance. In other words, all sorts of social costs will increase, from insurance to emergency services; other people will be paying the price of your riding with the wind. And that is unethical. So I'm afraid that, law or no law, you've got to wear the helmet. However, if you remain determined to feel the wind in your hair, you can ride without your pants, which will not greatly augment your chance of dying, except of embarrassment. 
 I am a 17-year-old who is half Hispanic and half Caucasian. I am in no way disadvantaged, but neither are many other blacks and Hispanics. Would it be unethical for me to list my race as Hispanic on college applications?
-- Anonymous, New York
Colleges ask about the ethnic backgrounds of their applicants not only because they want to compensate them for presumed disadvantages or the effects of past discrimination, but also out of a belief that it is in the school's interest to assemble a diverse group of students. Remember, the application asks a great deal about you -- your address, your high school, your financial situation -- so the college has a pretty good idea of what hardships you may or may not have overcome.
If you would like to be particularly scrupulous, you could always write on the form what you've written here -- half Hispanic, half Caucasian. But if the application limits you to marking a single box to denote your ethnic origins, you may check "Hispanic" with a clear conscience.
In planning for a conference, I registered for an evening event for an additional $45. I did not attend this event for personal reasons (which included gorging on cable, something I do not have at home). However, I still put the charge on my expense report. Should I have swallowed the cost myself?
-- Rebecca Petruck, New York
Everyone is allowed -- or should be allowed -- a personal day now and then. If you enrolled in this event with every intention of attending, you were right to include it in your expense report, just as you would have had you missed it because you were ill and had taken a sick day. However, each company has its own policy about personal days, and you might want to clarify this with your boss.
Of course, if what you mean by "personal reasons" is a chance to see Mel Gibson naked on cable TV, then you might write to the F.C.C. asking why free network television deprives a hard-working woman like you of this viewing pleasure and thereby deprives her company, and the American economy, of her full attention.

HEADLINE: FILM;
What's It All About? The Kids Know. Do You?

BYLINE: By MARCELLE CLEMENTS; Marcelle Clements's most recent book is "The Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life."

 BODY:
GOING to the movies used to be no big deal for kids. Many of us would see films the way we read books: because it never occurred to us not to. I remember walking, every Saturday, to the RKO or the Loew's on East 86th Street. There'd be a double bill, and no one was too particular about what was playing or what time it started. "This is where I came in" still had meaning then, and often it wasn't until the movie ended and began again that you learned what the title was. My friends and I saw every single movie that was made for us, and many that weren't. And later, we also occasionally sat upstairs in the balcony and necked and sneaked cigarettes, but that's another story. Or perhaps not.
Nowadays -- in these much more salubrious, enlightened days of ratings and $5 popcorn and clean, no-smoking, no-talking theaters -- when people take their children to the movies, what do they want to get out of it? Perhaps it just happens to be the shape that an American family outing takes, especially when the weather isn't fabulous. 
 Judging by the amount of complaining and the lack of specificity, it seems that many people know only what they don't want. They don't want to be left flat. They want to have fun with their kids. That's all, really, that people demand of the movies for their families: they want to be happy.
"How was it? Was it violent? Was it scary?" you'll hear one adult say to another. And they're talking about "Stuart Little." Surely, there must be a correlation between the huge number of new books on parenting and the extraordinary concern about so-called family movies. Worried parents have taken to wandering in a maze of intricacies of what is and isn't appropriate -- appropriate language; appropriate amount of violence, sex, fear, diversity; appropriate amount of stimulation and lack thereof; appropriate amount of play of the imagination; appropriate amount of good and bad news about life.
Well, then, parents of small and mid-size children had better strap themselves in. Getting ready to zoom, glide, slide, swat, trundle and chug-a-chug-a onto their neighborhood screens this summer is a particularly vexing collection of movies, buttressed by colossal ad campaigns, marketing deals, tie-ins, link-ups, crossover and franchising strategies. Why vexing? Because each is like a discrete galaxy. How do you tell, ahead of time, whether you're going to be happy outside the Milky Way?
"Chicken Run" (June 23), "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" (June 30), "Pokemon the Movie 2000" (July 21), "Thomas and the Magic Railroad" (July 26) -- and some of the more adventurous parents will want to add "X-Men" (July 14) -- are all big-budget, big-big-concept entertainment. A "family" film these days is not only 90 minutes in a theater, it's a design universe and a lifestyle. It trails in its wake not only the highly visible logos endlessly appliqued, stickered or hologrammed onto junk-food wrappers, mugs, T-shirts, pajamas, CD-ROM's, books, Game Boy cartridges, soundtracks, trading cards, Web sites and heaven knows what else, but also a language, an attitude, an ambience and a technological ideology.
It was at a recent press presentation for "Dinosaur" (which opened on Friday) that I realized something new and really different was going on. In part, I was taken aback by the extraordinary effects: Disney's "Dinosaur" is a Herculean enterprise combining computer graphics and live action that took about a decade to assemble. An entire team of animators, we were told, worked solely on the fatty tissue problem, and a second team then layered on muscle bulges and jiggling flesh, effecting "breakthroughs" in portraying skin and musculature. Millions of dollars went to the problem of the fur of the lemurs who pal around with the dinosaurs. At one point, every lemur's coat contained 1,200,000 hairs, each with a serial number -- so that it could sway with the wind, for example, when the script called for it. All that fur hogged so much memory, however, that the computers slowed down too much and the process had to be set aside.
B UT what really amazed me was when a journalist asked whether a "single" -- a "Dinosaur" theme song -- would be released at the same time as the movie, and the producer, Pam Marsden, answered "No."
"Not even over the titles?" insisted the journalist. The others laughed.
"No," said Ms. Marsden. "At least none is planned."
So there was no intention to hedge the bet here. Was there that much faith in the movie?
Family pictures have completely changed in the last 10 years," said Brian Levant, the director of both Flintstone movies. "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas," which opened April 28, was shot, with the help of some 4,500 extras, on the biggest set since Cecil B. DeMille's "Ten Commandments"; it was built -- or, rather, Flintstonized -- from scratch. In preproduction for close to a year, it employed a crew of 1,000. "You get to create the whole world," said Mr. Levant, "a civilization. Those things that made 'The Wizard of Oz' such an incredible voyage visually we can do very easily now. So many films being made now tax the imagination of both the filmmaker and the audience. There are no stories that cannot be told."
There are no stories that can't be told. What does that mean for our children?
In the good old days of straightforward dualities, there were two neatly opposing theories about storytelling for children. On the one hand, according to psychoanalysts, mythologists and literary types, children use tales to enlarge the span of their own imaginative play and also to learn to live with the dark side of themselves. On the other, according to the excessively sentimental and purple television star, Barney, "I love you, you love me, we're a happy family."
While parents' concerns are understandable, any attempt to bring the problem back down to a nicely manageable pro or con sort of proposition is a Sisyphean task.
For while some adults remain obsessed with issues of appropriate and inappropriate, or with the big bad evil marketing specialists, filmmakers and kids have gone on to embrace a much more complex, multilayered experience, of which the film is only one aspect.
"We should have had a full education for the parents saying this is what the world is," says Norman Grossfeld, the American producer of the first Pokemon movie. "We never warned them that the Pokemon only spoke their own names." Released theatrically last year and recently out in video, it consists of a 22-minute short and a 76-minute feature.
"The adults barely watched the first movie," Mr. Grossfeld continued. "It wasn't enjoyable to them because they were not prepared for a 20-minute movie without dialogue. And here we were thrilled because we got the characters to emote without speaking. So they didn't have an open mind when they got to the main feature, and it didn't get the attention that it deserved."
The kids, of course, all knew. They knew because they had fully inhabited the whole Pokemon world long before the movie came out. In the press, there was much talk at the time about the economics and the consumerism of it all. (And parents may well have resented the hit on their wallets.) But among kindergartners, the talk was of the Pokemon themselves -- their names (all 151), families, types, exotic powers and weaknesses and how some evolve. Unlike their adults, the kids going to see the Pokemon movie knew what the characters were capable of, whether they were good or bad guys and what their relationships were to the others.
I remember being struck, watching the first movie, by a panorama of the Pokemon characters flying together looking -- of all things -- quite beautiful. Seeing them in formation like this I realized how reminiscent they were of characters from Greek mythology. Many adults remain fixated on the violence in Pokemon, but closer scrutiny would perhaps persuade them that conflict is amply accounted for by a clear system of morality in which integrity is rewarded, and honorable heroes are attractive to children (thereby fulfilling the time-honored terms of fairy tales, which may be essentially immoral, but which feature an alluring moral hero with whom the child will wish to identify).
Undoubtedly, the Pokemon also spend a good deal of their energy and powers preparing for and engaging in some quite original (and not at all gory) battle, and they display a considerable amount of aggression -- perhaps as much, say, as your average kindergarten class at recess. But in addition, kids are certainly taken by the themes of quest, valor and honor, by the nurturing friendships between the trainers and their Pokemon. And of course part of what attracts kids is what confounds adults, which is that the whole thing is so byzantine. There are so many of them, so many alliances and back-stories and subplots to keep track of. No wonder children are mesmerized.
In the new movie, the world is thrown out of balance when an eccentric collector captures the various birds of the Pokemon myth, each of which controls a separate part of the balance of the universe -- the bird of ice, the bird of fire, the bird of electricity. Ash, the Pokemon hero, has coincidentally been chosen to be king of a festival, and as the balance of the world becomes disturbed he is called upon to become the hero he represents in the festival.
He teams up with a new Pokemon called Lugia, a big, serpenty, white-and-blue bird with psychic powers. Five other brand-new Pokemon will appear in the movie, trailblazers for the more than 100 silver and gold theme characters that will be released in the fall.
"Kids can absorb so much more information and language than when they get older," says Mr. Grossfeld. "We don't write down to them -- we have a healthy respect for what kids can handle. They're not being marketed to or at, they're being entertained."
The first Pokemon movie was never intended for export, and its animation is offbeat and somewhat dark by American standards. Mr. Grossfeld says the new movie will be brighter. "The first movie had one story line," he says. "This one has a subplot and more characters and many more stories converge at the end."
To my suggestion that the first movie had been underestimated, Mr. Grossfeld responded that it was perhaps too cerebral for most adults. "What kind of a movie has a main character who has to figure out what his reason for being is?" he asked, rather apologetically, and definitely rhetorically.
O NE adult with no trouble grasping the need for these themes in children's lives is Britt Allcroft, the director of "Thomas and the Magic Railroad" -- a film many would see as the antithesis of "Pokemon" and the boat it came in on. "Thomas" is based on the tranquil character whose principal ambition is to be a very useful engine. The little blue wooden train is well known to boys and girls from the prize-winning television series "Shining Time Station," which Ms. Allcroft created in Britain in the late 70's.
As I told Ms. Allcroft -- who seemed the sort of person one could confide in -- my son, Luc, had been for a hefty portion of his total of nearly 6 years a passionate admirer of Thomas the Tank Engine: a singer of the Thomas the Tank Engine theme and the owner of a Thomas the Tank Engine railroad set, of Thomas memorabilia, videocassettes and pajamas. Indeed, in his closet now there are still boxes containing Thomas the Tank Engine trains, tunnels, bridges, underpasses, roundhouses and clickety-clack tracks, all of which he refused to surrender.
But he'd moved on in his viewing interests. I thought he never would, but he did -- to Fred Astaire musicals and Billy Wilder comedies like "Some Like It Hot" and Jacques Tati farces like "Playtime" and adventure movies like "The Swiss Family Robinson" and also, of course, to every sort of superhero movie -- be it trashy or transcendent.
And why shouldn't he? My hope is that he will be able to use them all to activate different locales in his fantasy life. Sometimes, he might want to hark back to the serene days of tooling about the British countryside with Thomas, the really useful engine. On other, more active days, he might want to be fuming with the rather ill-tempered Gengar or Mewtwo (or whatever his current favorites are among the Pokemon), or feeling helpless and adorable with Stuart Little, or scowling along with Batman or Superman (or Wonder Woman? Where is she, producers of America?).
"I'd like my son to be able to watch both 'Thomas' and 'Pokemon,' " I told Ms. Allcroft.
"Exactly!" she said. "Why shouldn't young children enjoy both? On my shelves, I've got 'Auntie Mame' there and here I've got 'Memories, Dreams and Reflections' and over here I've got 'Greatest Mountain Journeys in the World.' If he kind of tucks the Thomas times of his life away and then he comes back to them, I would be very happy.
"The core viewers of Thomas start at about 18 months and go up to about 7 or 8, but they enjoy these stories at different levels," Ms. Allcroft continued. "And what I think is very important to the longevity of those stories is that they're stories the grownups can enjoy along with the children."
"Thomas and the Magic Railroad" actually features grown-up actors -- and they're not just voice-overs. In the movie, the 11-year-old Lily (Mara Wilson) takes the wrong train on a visit to see her grandfather (Peter Fonda), a once happy railway engineer who now lives a solitary life. She ends up in the scenic town of Shining Time, where she meets the magical Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin), who of course takes her on an adventure to the Island of Sodor, a toy world where Thomas, the tiny blue steam engine, lives.
Mr. Baldwin, who succeeded Ringo Starr and George Carlin as the narrator of the television show, got on board the Thomas bandwagon in part because Thomas is a favorite of his daughter's. Similarly, "Thomas and the Magic Railroad" is produced and distributed by Destination Films, which is headed by Barry London -- who worked for years to acquire the rights because he, too, had a little girl who loved Thomas.
And that seems to be what it's about, really, all the fuss. It's very moving and more than a little disturbing to watch your child fall in love with a character other than yourself. Like their first blankies, these "transitional objects" accompany children to worlds that are not of our own making. Real or imaginary, they are the places where our children play and dream.
But this is not what people talk about when they talk about kids' films. Should we or shouldn't we let our kids see "The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps"? This is the sort of decision about which contemporary parents seem to think they need to develop a tough moral framework. "I would rather have my kids laugh at humor about flatulence," I heard someone say recently (though she used a much less fancy word), "than watch gratuitous violence. Of course, you have to explain this is something that happens in a movie, not something that's appropriate in real life."
Of course. And while plenty of parents would think nothing of taking a child to an Eddie Murphy movie, others would have them arrested. This time around, the decision was taken out of our hands by the film's PG-13 rating, but many people give up going to the movies once they have children, and among them there are further subdivisions about what to watch on tape. Books, magazines and Web sites now rate films, breaking them down for each age group and grading them by category, according to how they depict not just sex and violence, but also drinking and drug use, profanity, scatology.
Among parents, the sole comfortable and unanimous point of agreement is on the subject of gratuitous violence. (Against!) But alas, this is not all that useful, since it is difficult to find any in a big-budget film that bills itself as a family picture.
In the end, none of this arguing addresses the only real question, which is this: Now that we really understand how vulnerable children are, how do we best protect them? By showing them the world or by shielding them from it? It seems logical to conclude that there is no one answer, only a balance.
Of course, there are movies in which technology takes over, in which violence seems to spring out of nowhere, everywhere, as if an anonymous, mechanistic, amorally vengeful environment will confound and ridicule man, robbing him of dignity and volition. I am thinking, for example, of Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times," which Luc and I have now watched several times, finding it funnier on each occasion.
Perhaps we displace onto movies our feelings of powerlessness about so much else -- our children's schools, friends, choices, the frighteningly complex and confusing society in which they must navigate and the even less controllable future. But it's too bad to set up such a simplistic yes-no argument here, when something so much more profound and resonant is at stake.

HEADLINE: THEATER/THE TONY AWARDS;
The Award Theater People Hate and Love

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
FOR die-hard theatergoers -- the kind of devoted fans who gnawed their cuticles over the battle between "Dreamgirls" and "Nine" in 1982, or agonized over which actor from "Two Trains Running," Laurence Fishburne or Roscoe Lee Browne, to root for in 1992, or pulled for "Pacific Overtures" to upset the popular favorite, "A Chorus Line," in 1976 -- the Tony Awards have been as exciting as the Oscars.
And here it is again, that theatrical rite of spring: Tony time, when this season's actors, directors, playwrights, choreographers and designers get to enjoy their brief anointed status as nominees, and producers can salivate about the prospect of being able to plaster "Best Musical" or "Best Play" above the titles of their shows and hear their box office cash registers go ka-ching. 
 Many theater professionals say the Tony Awards are a prestigious prize that celebrates Broadway's talent and sells Broadway shows, and that the awards' marketing power is potent, particularly on the road.
But these same professionals concede that Tony season has also become an annual opportunity for carping and soul-searching within the industry, not only about the theater but also about the Tonys themselves. This year, the debates seem to point to a fundamental shift in the conception of what constitutes live theater on Broadway.
The controversy over whether "Contact," a dance show with no singing or live music, should be considered a musical goes to the heart of a larger question about the direction of the American musical. The three other shows besides "Contact" nominated for best musical this year also defy conventional definitions. "James Joyce's 'The Dead,' " which recently closed, is a play in which the characters sing Irish songs for one another at a Christmas party. "Swing!" is a dance revue that mixes classic swing music with new pastiche pieces. And Michael John LaChiusa's "Wild Party," like his other new musical this season, "Marie Christine," features virtually no dialogue at all, blurring the lines between musical theater and opera.
Indeed, this year's Tony Awards suggest a rejection of the traditional book musical, given that Disney's "Aida" was not nominated for best musical, although it received five other nominations.
The nominators were apparently hard pressed to fill out the category for best musical revival, nominating "Tango Argentino," a dance show, which has closed, and "Jesus Christ Superstar," which received almost universally poor reviews, in addition to Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" and Meredith Willson's "Music Man."
Two members of the Tony nominating committee resigned this year. A. R. Gurney, the playwright, said he resigned because he was not permitted to abstain from the vote on whether Mandy Patinkin should be nominated for best actor in a musical. Mr. Patinkin had been absent from the performance Mr. Gurney attended of "The Wild Party." "I just didn't think it was fair to vote for or against him if I hadn't seen him," Mr. Gurney said. (The playwright elaborates on his concerns about the Tonys in an article on page 9.)
Jack Goldstein, the executive director of the Theater Development Fund, resigned over objections to "Contact's" being considered a musical.
Some nominators expressed frustration that they were unable to award something special to the two actors who alternate roles in "True West," Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly. Even though the nominators had taken the trouble to see both versions of the production, they said they were forced to vote for best actor based only on the play's opening night casting.
"They're both superb and they both share the play," said Frances Sternhagen, the actress, who serves on the nominating committee. "So why do we have to have this rule?
"Theater so needs a boost that you don't want to be difficult," Ms. Sternhagen continued. "But it's just so hard when you want to give credit where credit is due."
The Tonys this year also had to grapple with the notion of what is a Broadway show. For example, "Dame Edna: The Royal Tour" and "Jackie Mason: Much Ado About Everything" were deemed ineligible despite their popularity with audiences. One way the Tony administrators have handled unorthodox shows is to give them special Tony Awards, as they did this year with "Dame Edna."
The nominations this year also speak to the dearth of new writing on Broadway. Two revivals -- "Kiss Me, Kate" and "The Music Man" -- led the nominations, with 12 and 8 respectively. Two of the four productions nominated for best new play are actually old, though they are new to Broadway: "True West" by Sam Shepard was originally produced Off Broadway in 1980, and "The Ride Down Mt. Morgan" by Arthur Miller was first produced in London in 1991. Similarly, Noel Coward's "Waiting in the Wings" is eligible for consideration as best new play because it has never before been on Broadway, even though it was written in 1960.
Despite various complaints about the selection process, most people associated with New York theater agree that the Tonys are no more problematic than any other awards show in which an industry honors itself.
Although there are many other theater awards given out around this time -- the Outer Critics Circle Awards, the Obies, the Drama Desk Awards and the Drama League Awards -- producers say the Tonys are the only ones that sell tickets. Winning best musical or best play, they say, means money in the bank.
"To win a Tony is a powerful calling card," said Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters.
Added Emanuel Azenberg, the producer: "It's industry-created to hype an industry. And in that it succeeds."
But what exactly is that industry these days? Since Broadway has become dominated by revivals and British imports, is some of the best work happening elsewhere? And what exactly are the Tony Awards intended for? To honor the best of New York theater generally, or to promote Broadway specifically?
Last year, the League of American Theaters and Producers, the national trade organization for the commercial theater industry, which presents the Tony Awards with the American Theater Wing, established a long-range planning committee to examine the future of the league, including Tony matters.
"I'm in the thinking stage on all this right now," said Elizabeth I. McCann, a longtime producer who serves on the committee. "You have to look at the season as it plays itself out. You can't force it into rigid rules that were created when theater was different.
"I would like an impartial panel of three people who would view the situation and make recommendations to the committee based on this season on Broadway," Ms. McCann continued. "Why jam 'Riverdance' into the category of best musical when it is really basically a dance revue?" The show had been termed eligible by the Tony administration committee, though it did not receive a nomination from the Tony nominating committee.
When producers want to get actors or shows considered for certain Tony nominations, they must petition the Tony administration committee. This year the producers of "True West" petitioned to have Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Reilly considered jointly so they would not compete against each other for a nomination in the leading actor category. The request was denied. In another case, the producers of "A Moon for the Misbegotten" asked that Roy Dotrice, who plays the heroine's father, be considered in the featured actor rather than the leading actor category. That request was granted.
Such efforts notwithstanding, Jed Bernstein, president of the league, said the process generally worked. "It's easy to take potshots at individual rules and individual outcomes," he said. "But once you start to understand the ultimate goal -- that there ought to be a level playing field -- whether it's right or wrong, at least it's fair."
Some producers beg to differ. Since 1994, Roy Gabay has produced, or been general manager for, three Pulitzer Prize-winning plays -- "Three Tall Women," "How I Learned to Drive" and "Wit" -- all Off Broadway, none Tony eligible. "That to me is wrong," Mr. Gabay said. "I don't understand how that can be, that plays that were honored for excellence in the theater are not eligible for an excellence award."
The Off Broadway industry itself has in the past resisted the idea of becoming Tony-eligible because of logistical and financial obstacles. Trying to get all the Tony voters into the multitude of small Off Broadway houses to see every production would be almost impossible. In addition, it could drive up the costs of producing, due to the loss of revenue that would result from having to give away seats to Tony voters, and because the unions might then demand Broadway rates -- or at least a higher wage scale -- for their services.
Some theater executives suggested creating a few Off Broadway Tony Awards and appointing a special Off Broadway Tony committee so that every voter would not have to see every Off Broadway show. "I don't know if it's feasible," said Daryl Roth, an Off Broadway producer who has also produced on Broadway. "But it feels like the right thing to do and where we're heading."
Because Off Broadway productions are excluded from the Tonys, Ms. Roth said they miss out on national exposure during the Tony Awards show. This is particularly critical to productions that can barely afford their own marketing. Broadway producers often counter that Off Broadway has its own prizes. But others say these do not have the prestige of the Tonys in terms of what they can do for a show's fortunes and a performer's reputation.
"Careers change when they get a Tony Award," said Virginia P. Louloudes, the executive director of the Alliance of Resident Theaters/New York, a service group for nonprofit theaters. "And God knows, the actors deserve the recognition. So do the directors and designers."
What it comes down to, it seems, is what the Tonys are really about. "If the point of the awards is to promote Broadway, then keeping Off Broadway out of the awards is appropriate," said Todd Haimes, artistic director of the Roundabout Theater Company, an Off Broadway house that also produces on Broadway. "If the point is to award excellence in the theater in the New York metropolitan area, then to keep Off Broadway out is ridiculous."
Broadway executives say the Tony is not an equal-opportunity perk; it is reserved for those foolhardy enough and financially able to gamble on Broadway. Big risks, this argument goes, deserve the biggest potential reward.
"No business is going to give away its franchise for nothing," said Mr. Landesman, the producer. "Would Rolls-Royce say, 'Here's our emblem, go put it on a Chevy?' I don't see why we're expected to do that."
Mr. Gabay said the major flaw of the Tonys was who rules on eligibility. "You're looking at people with completely vested interests," he said about the 24 members of the Tony administration committee. "It's not a group of people who can make a fair decision. They are theater owners, they are producers. Why would I want 'Wit' to be eligible when I'm producing 'Art' or 'The Beauty Queen of Leenane'?"
Mr. Gabay said that when a producer appears before the administration committee to argue his case, as he has, the deck is stacked. "You feel like you're just going through the motions," he said, "because it's completely political in there."
Producers who serve on the committee defend the selection process, saying, essentially, welcome to the real world. "Is it any different in this industry from the television industry or the recording industry or the film industry?" asked Barry Weissler, who, with his wife, Fran, has produced several of Broadway's biggest hit revivals. "It's the same. Everyone has self-interest."
Moreover, Mr. Azenberg, the producer, said, the Tonys make no pretense of being about which artist or project is better than another; it isn't like winning a track meet because you ran the fastest. "We have an artificial competition," he said. "Shows don't compete. It's just a subjective choice between people."
Mr. Bernstein, of the league, pointed out that many of those who criticize certain rules are not prepared to present viable alternatives. Some people in the industry, for example, have objected to considering "True West" a new production because, although it was written in 1980 and produced Off Broadway, the play has never been produced on Broadway. But then, Mr. Bernstein asked, what does the definition of a new play become? A production that was never done in New York City but might have been done in Connecticut or New Jersey? A play that has never been given an "important production"? And if that is the case, what defines important?
As to what constitutes a musical, that appears to be up for grabs these days. With shows like "Smokey Joe's Cafe," "Fosse," "Riverdance," "Swing!," "Contact" and "James Joyce's 'The Dead' " stretching the boundaries of a traditional book musical, it is hard to know what a musical is anymore.
SOME theater professionals suggested creating more specific categories, along the lines of London's Olivier Awards or Hollywood's Golden Globes -- like Tonys for best solo performance or best entertainment -- though this would mean more to squeeze into the already crowded broadcast.
Then there are those who argue that there are not enough voters with the appropriate expertise in each category, like craftspeople who can judge design. But critics of this idea caution that the voting pool is already bloated and adding voters is not the answer.
"I think there are too many people voting," Mr. Azenberg said. "You can't get a lifetime franchise by producing one play. Some of us still want to be judged by our peers." He said he had given Tony voters $125,000 worth of tickets to "The Iceman Cometh," which he produced last year in a limited run starring Kevin Spacey (who was also a producer of the play). "If I'm going to do a play for 12 to 14 weeks, that's giving away 25 percent of the potential profit if the play is successful," Mr. Azenberg said. ("Iceman" orchestra tickets were $100.)
With increasing numbers of new people dabbling in Broadway, "it will get out of hand," he warned. "It is out of hand."
Two years ago, the league stepped up its enforcement of a policy mandating that only producers who have produced a show in the previous four years could remain active members and therefore have a Tony vote, though they may retain their league membership -- a decision that angered several voters, about 30 of whom have drafted a complaint against the league that has been sent out to members of the group for approval. This reduced the number of Tony voters from 825 to 705, a figure that will jump slightly, because the league recently lengthened the required time period within which someone must have produced to six years and decided to create a new lifetime membership category for inactive theater veterans to honor their service.
Nevertheless, there are still a lot of voters, each of whom is entitled to a pair of tickets per show, which amounts to a potential loss of about $100,000 for each production. Moreover, many producers complain that some voters give their tickets away but cast their votes nonetheless -- a violation of rules that producers nevertheless feel unable to enforce without alienating voters.
"I don't want to be offensive and cost myself a vote," Mr. Gabay said. "Will they get really annoyed and not vote for me if I put the screws in?"
When the Tonys were created by the American Theater Wing in 1947, the ceremony took place at the Waldorf-Astoria. The award consisted of a scroll and women got a monogrammed sterling silver compact; men a cigarette lighter or an engraved gold money clip. Some people miss the old days.
"I enjoy the intimacy and the feeling of family in the ballroom that we had then," said Isabelle Stevenson, chairwoman of the American Theater Wing.
Ms. Stevenson makes no secret of her belief that the Tonys have become too concerned with commercial interests. "The Tony Award was created to reward excellence in the theater," she said."There was no thought of it being of economic value.
"You can't be blind to the fact that it is an important economic boost to the theater. On the other hand, it cannot become just that. The commitment to excellence must remain. You cannot use it only as an economic marketing tool."
Even those who believe that bigger is better for the Tonys complain that the show has not found its own identity. "If you're going to go on network television, you're going to try to ape the Oscars and use what happens on television to sell tickets," said Ms. McCann, the producer. "It's a tough problem for the theater to compete against the Emmys, the Grammys, the Oscars. Yet CBS expects us to."
With ratings a struggle, and Broadway actors radiating considerably less star power than movie actors -- with the exception of actors who visit Broadway from Hollywood -- the pressure has increased to make the Tony Awards show more of a draw for viewers (the first hour is broadcast on PBS, the second two hours on CBS).
Thus, it has now become not just an advantage but something of a necessity to present the awards at a glitzy location like Radio City Music Hall rather than in a theater or ballroom, and to have Rosie O'Donnell as host. (When she did not appear last year, the overnight ratings dropped considerably -- to 7.9 from the 10.3 when she presided in 1998.)
Some industry insiders say the awards have become overly concerned with the promotion potential and star power of the television show rather than simply with honoring outstanding work.
Ms. Sternhagen, who is in the second of her three-year term as a Tony nominator, said the Tony administrators expressed disappointment last year when she and her colleagues failed to nominate Nicole Kidman for her performance in "The Blue Room," because the movie star would have boosted television ratings.
Nominators said they were frustrated by having to nominate a certain number of musicals to satisfy the CBS contract that specifies a minimum of seven "entertainment segments" on the Tony broadcast. Some suggested featuring musical numbers without having to nominate the musicals.
Then there is the "damned if you do, damned if you don't" problem of honoring straight plays on the broadcast. When they are excluded, some argue that the awards do not reflect the true picture of a Broadway season. But producers have yet to come up with an effective way to feature straight plays; last year's delivery by Mr. Spacey and several other actors of a montage of lines from various plays was widely criticized as a mishmash.
"The wing is concerned with excellence," Ms. McCann said. "Broadway producers are concerned with selling tickets. So everybody has a different agenda for that show."
Although some people in the theater worry that CBS may drop the Tonys because of low ratings, Leslie Moonves, the network's president and chief executive, said CBS remained committed. "I still think the Tony Awards is one of the most prestigious events on television," he said. And, he added, "We have some very loyal sponsors who feel the way we do."
Similarly, William F. Baker, president of New York's WNET, said he was proud to carry the PBS presentation of behind-the-scenes awards (i.e., costumes, lighting) "to celebrate and provide an understanding about the people who create the plays and are in some ways unsung heroes."
Winning a Tony is still a significant achievement in the industry, producers say. Even Peter Schneider, chairman of Disney Studios -- which would hardly seem to need a Broadway award to enhance its worldwide fortunes -- said he was excited when "The Lion King" won best musical in 1998.
"We were thrilled," he said. "It was an acknowledgment from our peers that the show was good."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester;
Starwood Leases a White Plains Building for Its HQ

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THIS city's rebounding office market has received another major boost with the announcement this month that Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide plans to lease more than 200,000 square feet, occupying an entire office building along the Interstate 287 corridor, where it expects to establish its world headquarters.
"This is the biggest lease we've seen in Westchester in several years," said Frank Tomasulo, a first vice president with the CB Richard Ellis brokerage company. "It's way beyond the size of the leases we've been seeing lately, and is indicative of what's happening now in Westchester's market. Lots of companies that are now looking for large blocks of space are looking in Westchester because they can't find them in Fairfield County or in New York City anymore." 
 Starwood had been looking for an appropriate headquarters location for about three years, according to Rob Martin, a senior managing director for Insignia/ESG, which had been representing the company in its search, which also included lower Fairfield County. Starwood eventually settled on 1129 Westchester Avenue, along what is known as the county's Platinum Mile, a stretch of corporate parks bordering Interstate 287 that is considered one of the most prestigious office locations in the county.
Although most recently used as a corporate headquarters for Nine West, the shoe company, 1129 Westchester Avenue was built on speculation and designed for multitenancy.
"Starwood wanted a prestigious Class A building," Mr. Martin said. "That was the most important thing, since they have clients coming in from all over the world and need the right image. It also has good visibility from the highway and is convenient."
Starwood will sublet the space for 12 years from Nine West, which had once occupied a total of 366,000 square feet at 1129 and 1109 Westchester Avenue. Nine West recently downsized to 90,000 square feet at 1109, and sublets 30,000 square feet in that building to Ameritrade, an Internet trading company.
Nine West has offered Starwood the option of expanding into 1109 if space becomes available. Starwood is "a growing company," Mr. Martin said, "and it was important to them to have the possibility of expansion."
While they looked for permanent space, Starwood took out short-term leases in two other White Plains buildings, at 777 Westchester Avenue and 44 South Broadway. "We were always shuttling back and forth between meetings," said Seth Ruzi, associate general counsel for Starwood. "We needed someplace to consolidate. And staying in White Plains was desirable since it will make things easier on our employees who already work here."
STARWOOD expects to complete its move into the new building in the second and third quarters of 2001. And it expects to retain its present Westchester work force of 300, and add an additional 300 employees by 2006.
Starwood, which recently acquired the Sheraton and Westin hotel chains, is now one of the largest hotel and leisure companies in the world. Through its subsidiaries, it now owns and operates 700 hotels in 80 countries, said Dan Gibson, a senior vice president of corporate affairs. In May 1998, the company relocated its headquarters from Phoenix.
A major inducement in selecting Westchester for its permanent headquarters, Mr. Ruzi said, was the "cooperation of the state and county governments," as well as a package of economic incentives that include tax abatements worth $775,000, provided by the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency, and a $500,000 jobs-creation grant from the state.
The state grant is contingent on Starwood's maintaining its current Westchester work force and adding 150 more jobs by 2003, said Maura Gallucci, a spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corporation.
Although Starwood's may be the largest lease signed in Westchester in many years, it is part of a trend toward larger leases that has been established in the last several quarters, according to Mr. Tomasulo. "Anything over 200,000 square feet is, of course, rare," he said. "But we've seen several large leases recently."
Last year Atlas Air leased 120,000 square feet at Texaco's headquarters building, at 2000 Westchester Avenue in White Plains. Also in recent months Towers Perrin leased 108,407 square feet at 100 Summit Lake Drive in Valhalla; AT&T took 95,000 square feet at 500 Mamaroneck Avenue in Harrison; and Metromedia leased 80,000 square feet at 360 Hamilton Avenue in White Plains.
"There's been a 50 percent increase in the last 18 months in leases in excess of 25,000 square feet," said Al Gutierrez, a senior associate with CB Richard Ellis.
"The leases now are way beyond the sizes we had been seeing in the market," he said, where average leases had been around 7,000 square feet.
Mr. Tomasulo said that "companies looking for large blocks of space are now looking at Westchester."
THERE are still several large blocks of space available," he said. "And we know that major companies are now looking at them."
Some of the large blocks left include the former Kraft Food headquarters at 333 Westchester Avenue in White Plains, with more than 500,000 square feet; Mount Pleasant Executive Center in Mount Pleasant, with 380,000 square feet; and 445 Hamilton Avenue in White Plains, with 350,000 square feet.
Westchester's office vacancy rate in the first quarter of this year reached its lowest point in a decade.
The countywide rate of 12.5 percent was down from 17.6 percent at the end of last year, according to CB Richard Ellis. And the amount of vacant space dropped by 458,423 square feet in the first quarter of 2000, compared to a drop of 181,174 in the last quarter of 1999.
As a result, rents have been creeping up, but are still a comparative bargain in relation to Fairfield County and Manhattan, where rents can be 30 percent to 65 percent higher respectively.
Average annual asking rents in Westchester are now $24.48 per square foot, relatively unchanged since the end of last year, but up from $20.94 in the first quarter of 1999, according to CB Richard Ellis.
"If we had been able to find the right property for Starwood in Fairfield, it might have won out and they'd have moved there," said Mr. Martin of Insignia/ESG. "But the economics of Westchester sort of evened the playing field. In White Plains, they're saving 30 percent, and could even expand if they want to. As it turned out, that was very significant."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
Simply 'Writer' Will Do

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
LAN SAMANTHA CHANG cringes when she's told she's the next Amy Tan or Maxine Hong Kingston -- that she is the next great female Asian-American writer.
"When my book came out, immediately there were two reviews that put me in this group with these Asian-American women writers," said Ms. Chang, crinkling her face and cringing at the thought. "Others started comparing me to Jewish writers. I don't know how to feel about all of it." 
 What has raised expectations about Ms. Chang is "Hunger" (Penguin Books, $12.95), a novella and story collection that has earned a collection of outstanding reviews.
All this for a woman who didn't take a writing course until she was in graduate school, whose career has blossomed late -- fortunately so, in her mind.
"I was older, well past the age where you could be said to be precocious," said the 35-year-old Ms. Chang, who is at Princeton University on an Alfred Hodder Fellowship, given to allow young artists to pursue their work with freedom for a year.
"I was a precocious violin player, but then adolescence came," she said over lunch at the elegant Lahieres Restaurant in downtown Princeton. "Adolescence weeds out those with a true calling from those who are just talented. I'm glad I didn't write until later, so I didn't have to go through the same thing with my writing."
Ms. Chang's tales are primarily of Chinese immigrants to America and their tribulations about leaving one culture behind for a new and often strange one. Typical is the beginning of "The Unforgetting," one of the short stories in the collection:
"On the summer day in 1967 when Ming Hwang first saw the eastern Iowa hills, he pulled his car off the road and stopped the engine. He felt overwhelmed, as if he had arrived once more at the sea that he had crossed to reach America and his destiny lay again upon some faraway shore. The neat, green fields rolled out to meet the sky. The narrow strip of highway looked barely navigable. Surely no Chinese man could ever have laid eyes upon this place before."
Despite spending most of her adult life on the two coasts -- she has degrees from Yale and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and was a Wallace Stegner writing fellow at Stanford -- there is a great feeling for the Midwest in Ms. Chang's writing.
In fact, she grew up in Appleton, Wis. -- home of Harry Houdini and Senator Joseph McCarthy -- where her father was a chemical engineer, researching paper science at Lawrence University. Hers was one of two Chinese-American families in the small city, both of whose children were all girls.
"It's intrinsic to her work that her parents were immigrants," said Peter Rock, who was a Stegner Fellow with Ms. Chang at Stanford and now teaches writing at the University of Pennsylvania. "But it's more important that she grew up in Appleton.
"When she came to speak at my class, she named several influences in her writing who were white males," said Mr. Rock. "The Asian-American women were upset, saying, 'Aren't you selling out?' All of the people who I know who have had success writing and who are ethnic have to put up with that."
Ms. Chang is using her year at Princeton to research and write a novel, to be published by Norton, based on events in Hang Zhou (Hang Chow) and Chong Qing (Chung King), China, in the 1930's and 40's. She has spent hours poring over old maps and guidebooks in Princeton's Oriental collection.
"When my parents came to visit, we all went over there," she said. "They helped me with the Chinese. It was great fun for all of us."
Her father had wanted Ms. Chang and her three sisters to become doctors, so they would never have to worry about security. But uninterested in medicine, she pursued a degree in Asian studies at Yale and then went to the Kennedy School. Eventually, one sister fulfilled her father's wishes.
"I knew I would come out of there with my dream -- the kind of job where you would wear pantyhose," she said. "Life would make sense if I took these economics courses. Unfortunately, I came to the realization that I hated it."
She decided to take a writing course, but not at Harvard.
"That would have been too hard," she said. "I would have been too insecure to show my writing to Harvard undergraduates."
Instead, she went to the Cambridge Center for Adult Education. She wrote and wrote and, after getting her Harvard degree, went straight to the University of Iowa writers program. She published a story in The Atlantic Monthly, and agents called her saying they could get a book contract.
"I was 28 and I wasn't ready for a book," she said. "I was afraid of being that young writer whose acclaim surprised me into silence. I wanted to wait until I knew what and who I wanted to be as a writer. I wanted to be, well, serious.
"Being a young writer of color, I'm lucky to have had the time to find my voice," she said. "The bridge between the first and second book is difficult. There are now expectations."
Even now, some of those expectations come from her parents. When they visited last month and Ms. Chang gave a reading from "Hunger," Joyce Carol Oates, the practiced and prolific author who teaches at Princeton, was there to meet them. And in the Oriental library, Ms. Chang found out something new about them.
"It turns out they were just like me, loving stories and looking at history," she said. "It's just that they hid it much of the time. We didn't have books around when I was a child. To my parents, they were too much baggage. But it turns out they were just too heavy to carry when they were escaping from the Japanese invasions, when they would have to move quickly.
"When we came to the library together, they took out books and loved the whole experience," she said. "Being a close-knit family and somewhat isolated in Wisconsin, they are what I draw from for my stories. So it is wonderful to find a new aspect with them."
Ms. Chang's novel will not appear until next year, by which time she will be on another fellowship at Radcliffe. But she has already given thought to coming back to New Jersey.
"Princeton is a wonderful kind of place, where you can feel both anonymous and part of a greater world," she said, pointing out several accomplished faculty members in Lahieres. "It's a quiet place with intense people, which, despite appearances is what a writer is -- quiet and intense."
 
A Sternness Born of Love
An excerpt from "Hunger" by Lan Samantha Chang.
Ruth grew tall and almost painfully slender; in the sixth grade, she began to practice on Tian's full-sized violin. At 14, she won a citywide competition for young musicians. As the winner, she would perform a concerto, accompanied by the orchestra that had sponsored the competition. Tian had chosen the Sibelius concerto, and for many, many months he and Ruth practiced those wondrous loops of sound, the joyous slithering movements of Sibelius.
He treated her as cruelly as he did himself with complete disregard for her age and temperament. But she did not complain to me or Anna. She would play and sob for hours, but emerge from the room without a word. She believed, she had known from infancy, that she held him in her hands. Now he had replaced his tenderness with this stern passion and she followed him there, believing the source of his sternness lay in love. In this blindness, I began to see, she and her father were alike.
All morning during summer vacations, plus two evenings a week, he sat in the tiny room for hours and helped her practice. I remember the way he looked at her when things went well; intense, prideful, the dispassionate yet hungry stare that I learned to recognize on television in coaches or trainers as they watch the taut bodies of their favorites. They exchanged few words; just an occasional "no," or "again," or "tone." "Bad fingering." "Again, again."
Ruth did not grimace or stop to complain. To this day I hold an image of them practicing under the skylight: Tian in the corner with his impenetrable and hungry gaze, and Ruth, stark-faced, her clear features lit gold or gray from above, lips pale and nostrils flared; her half-closed eyes, shadowed beneath.
Her long-sleeved T-shirt flapped as she moved her arms. Her days were filled with school and practicing, carrying some enormous weight. It must be difficult to find some time to think, living as she was under the spotlight of her father's fierce attention.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
HUD Moves to Shore Up Section 8 Subsidy Program

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
A METAPHOR helps to explain what the "marking down to market" program is all about, said the housing official. Then he launched into an elaborate one.
Picture a fleet a ships floating gently down from Washington. Each one is a housing development, built with federal mortgage insurance under the Section 8 program, the name for a national subsidy system that assists low-income people.
"Those that are listing we take out, and once we right them they go back into the HUD portfolio," said Patrick Eckman, who is acting director for the New York region of the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring, a branch of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The office was created under the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997. 
 The buildings that the act is designed to assist were built either new or as substantial rehabilitations from the late 70's to the mid-80's. They received insured mortgages running for 40 years, but the Section 8 subsidy contracts that supplement the rents that the tenants pay typically run for only 20 years.
Many of these housing ships are listing because they are supporting high mortgages, which were required to get the housing built. In negotiating new contracts the government is seeking to make rents reflect market rents. In most cases this will mean reducing subsidies and lowering the building's mortgage burden. But it may also involve raising subsidies, HUD officials say. Eight applications from New York City buildings to "mark up to market" have already been received by the branch of HUD that handles them, the Office of Housing, the officials said.
Under the Section 8 program, tenants pay 30 percent of their modest incomes as rent. The subsidy pays the additional amount required to make total rental income sufficient to meet operating expenses, local taxes and mortgage payments. The total authorized rent is called the contract rent.
For example, the tenant might be paying $500 a month on an income of $18,000 a year. The contract rent might be $1,200 a month, with the government paying $700 to supplement the tenant's payment.
The true market rent, however, might be $800 a month, not $1,200. HUD would therefore want to mark the contract rent down to $800. The tenant would still pay $500, but the subsidy would be $300 a month, not $700.
The Government's fiscal stake is substantial. Its insurance portfolio has $12 billion in project-based Section 8 loans outstanding.
The new contracts will also provide the money to pay for the major building improvements required after 20 years.
With the signing of a contract in March by the housing company that owns a cluster of three buildings in East Harlem, the city now has an example of the mark-to-market program in action. The East Harlem contract was negotiated under a national demonstration that was set in motion before the permanent program went into effect, with the city's housing finance arm, the Housing Development Corporation, acting as HUD's agent. The demonstration reveals some of the issues that the permanent program faces.
HOUSING professionals predict that most of the Section 8 buildings will stay in the program. But in strong market areas, including Manhattan and some other city neighborhoods, others may decide to leave it. This would not deprive the low-income tenants in those buildings of access to subsidized apartments, though not necessarily in their own buildings.
If a building leaves the Section 8 program, its tenants are assured of one more year of occupancy. If the tenant cannot afford the new market rent, and the owner will not accept voucher tenants, the tenant is eligible to participate in a HUD relocation program to move to another building that does take vouchers.
The process of "opting out" of the Section 8 program would nevertheless diminish the total inventory of apartments reserved for low-income tenants. Vacated apartments would be reoccupied by tenants paying rents too high for low-income households.
According to HUD, 448 projects in the city, with 111,300 apartments, are benefiting from project-based Section 8 subsidies. Staying in the program might lead to better, or at least more secure, economic results for the building than leaving it, housing professionals say, since an owner is assured of steady, adequate rent payments through any market cycle over 20 years, without the need to hunt in the private market for conventional financing that current tenant rents will probably not support.
"We don't think that New York City properties will opt out," said Ira G. Peppercorn, director of the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring. "We give something in exchange for rent reduction. We will restructure the mortgage if necessary and we will contribute 80 percent of the rehabilitation cost. If we do the job right, the owner will have no financial incentive to leave."
There are skeptics, however. Among them are the representatives of state housing agencies. They object to HUD's detailed 400-page rule book and the agency's one-size-fits-all compensation schedule, which they say has forced agencies in high-cost states and localities, including the city's Housing Development Corporation, out of the implementation process.
"It was the clearly Congress's intent that state and local governments should be the restructuring agents, which would be the best way to preserve as much low-income housing as possible," said John B. McEvoy, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies in Washington.
OTHERS foresee problems in the law itself. Under the original Section 8 program, Congress committed the funds to fulfill the 20-year contracts up front -- in the first year. But under the permanent program enacted in 1997, the funds must be appropriated annually, subject to the terms of the 20-year contracts. "Owners may figure they would be better off with vouchers rather than playing Congressional roulette every year," said David A. Smith, president of Recapitalization Advisors, a low-income housing consultant in Boston. They could abandon project-based subsidies but still accept voucher tenants, he noted.
In addition, the new act requires owners to put up 20 percent of rehabilitation costs, and pay 50 percent of the substantial transaction costs in negotiating a new contract, without providing an incentive by which general partners can induce their investment partners to provide additional capital.
"Even if I want to stay in the program, how do I finance it?" asked J. David Page, a principal in Southport Financial Services of Tacoma, Wash., an owner-operator of 8,000 subsidized and market-rate apartments across the country. "There's no compensation for the restructurer. How is he supposed to get it done -- and why?"
Southport was the owner's consultant and also the provider of new capital in the mark-to-market demonstration in East Harlem. Now a partner in the ownership, it assisted in the negotiations with the Housing Development Corporation. The buildings are 1775 Houses, A. K. Houses and M. S. Houses, a total of 543 apartments on the west side of Lexington Avenue between 126th and 129th Street.
The buildings are managed by Marion Scott Real Estate, a Manhattan firm that runs 15 Section 8 buildings in New York City and Newark. "It's a difficult process," said David H. Berezin, a senior vice president of Marion Scott in charge of the East Harlem buildings. "The demonstration program is certainly a lot easier for an owner to participate in than the permanent program appears to be at the present time."
Marking down to market in East Harlem meant a reduction of 23 percent in the contract rent, Mr. Berezin said, and the elimination of 27 percent of the mortgage debt. The repayment schedule for the balance due was strung out over 27 years. A $7 million rehabilitation is under way.
"We now have the capital to replace all the buildings systems -- roofs, heating plants, windows, elevators," Mr. Berezin said. All the kitchens and appliances will also be upgraded. Tenants' rents will not be affected.
But Herbert D. Freedman, a principal in Marion Scott, predicted that about 20 percent of the buildings that get project-based Section 8 subsidies in New York City would withdraw from the program. "Any owner who has the option to get out of the program, because of the location of the property and its condition, undoubtedly will," Mr. Freedman said.
One possible outcome in New York City, housing specialists say, is that neighborhood-based nonprofit companies may come forward to purchase Section 8 buildings from owners who want to leave the program. And further Congressional action is still possible to provide the tax or other incentives to make it easier for owners to sell to other entities, nonprofit or otherwise, that would keep the buildings as low-income housing.
The Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring itself expresses optimism. So far 33 projects in New York City have come forward to negotiate lower contract rents, said Mr. Eckman, the acting director of the regional office. "We are happy with the level of participation so far," he said.

HEADLINE: Built-In Grills in a Comeback

BYLINE: By ELZY KOLB 

 BODY:
BRICK and mortar is making a comeback. Elaborate brick and stone barbecue fireplaces are starting to appear in backyards around the region.
"We began to have people asking for them about four years ago," said Trish Calabrese, office manager of Creative Stone Works Inc., in Park Ridge, N.J. "This year, there has been a huge increase. It's amazing what people are doing in their yards right now." 
 The booming economy is at least in part behind the resurgence of interest in these backyard behemoths. Higher disposable income makes it possible, even desirable, to dress up the mundane things in life. "The stonework has an Old World feeling, and it definitely looks a lot better than the plain, black-box gas grill," Ms. Calabrese said.
There's some nostalgia involved, too. Simple but pleasant childhood memories often bring clients to the offices of stonemasons and landscape architects. During the planning stage, "customers will mention the little old fireplaces, like they had in parks or in rest stops on the Thruway," said Tom Ciccariello, owner of Seven Sons, a stone-working company in East Hampton on Long Island. "For many of us, those cookouts were a big part of growing up."
But today's manifestation of those memories typically goes far beyond the basic wood-fired, single-grill units of cookouts past.
Cameron Brand, a certified landscape architect and office manager of Oliver Nurseries in Fairfield, Conn., views the stone barbecue as the open-air equivalent of a commercial range, saying, "It's the Viking of outdoor products."
Florence Bogart, a landscape architect at Sprainbrook Nurseries in Scarsdale, agrees. "What I'm seeing is elaborate outdoor cooking spaces. Really, it's like an outdoor kitchen."
Most are fueled by natural gas rather than wood or charcoal. And most are "elaborate fireplaces tied to something, not just a lump of stone," Mr. Ciccariello said.
There's an extensive wish list of things that can be tied to such a setup. The brick or stone barbecue might have a top-of-the-line stainless steel cooking unit with an enormous grilling surface and be topped off with a tall chimney with a flue. Many cooking areas contain rotisseries, gas burners and a hooded cooking surface.
"These are big, sophisticated units," Mr. Ciccariello said. "People cook corn on the cob and lobster. You can have a clambake along with the grilled food."
Counters surrounding the cooking area are topped with marble, ceramic tile, granite, bluestone slate or Corian. Beneath those counters you might find built-in storage units or cabinets with wood or stainless steel doors. Other amenities include running water for wet bars or preparation sinks, under-counter refrigerators and lighting fixtures.
The surrounding area gets tied in, too. Because of its imposing size and stature, the barbecue is almost always the focal point in a landscaping plan, and its look is carried over into other elements in the yard. The cooking unit is sometimes built into a stone wall, or matching walls are built to shelter the cooking area.
"It could be a seating wall, a retaining wall or a freestanding wall to separate, say, the lawn from the patio," Mr. Ciccariello said. "It gives the sitting area more privacy. You can also add a stone table -- a big slab of natural stone." Granite-topped bench-style seating is another add-on.
This may seem like a lot of trouble to go to, to cook outdoors twice a year. But that's not the case, said Matt Horn, owner of Matterhorn Nursery Inc., in Spring Valley.
"With gas, everyone's cooking outside, all year round," he said. "These fireplaces are great for entertaining; they have a great ambience. More people want to be outdoors, even if they only have a small area. People will sit out all evening. We're even installing some fire pits -- people can sit around, cook, talk and be warm, even in the spring and fall."
Ms. Brand explained the attraction this way: "It's a way of getting back to nature, even if you're outside a mansion. It's like being around the campfire; you can be at one with nature at the barbecue."
If you build it, they will come. And they will want to participate, too. "When friends come over, cooking at the barbecue gets people involved," Mr. Ciccariello said. "Everyone congregates around the grill and takes turns flipping."
Mr. Brand said: "When you have guests, it's much more social than standing around the stove inside. It's a very active way to cook. It gets you outside and gives you a feeling of participation in the gathering. It's a way for men to feel they're participating in the dinner hour, without feeling inept in front of the stove."
What's the bottom line on this wonderful combination of conspicuous consumption, nostalgia, ambience and bonding? "These things are not cheap," Mr. Horn said. "You might start at $10,000 for a decent one; allow about $4,000 for the mechanism, plus the masonry."
Mr. Ciccariello said: "It could be $6,000 to $14,000 for a grandiose project. It's a statement; it's not about function at that level. It's a hold on our past."
Mr. Calabrese said: "Quality is a consideration over price. People want to get something that's going to last. I can't imagine people spending like this in the late-80's."

Bridgewater Commons Is Entering the Home Stretch

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: BRIDGEWATER

 BODY:
A STRONG economy and a strong office market are pushing forward plans for the final component of the 120-acre Bridgewater Commons mixed-used center here, 16 years after the project was first announced.
The Hines Interests Limited Partnership, an international real estate firm based in Houston, is buying the last 20 acres at the site and plans to build 600,000 square feet of office space. The first of two eight-story buildings is to get under way this fall. 
 A 347-room Marriott hotel is now under construction at Bridgewater Commons, the 900,000-square-foot shopping mall that opened in 1988. The mall is close to Interstates 287 and 78 as well as Routes 202-206 and 22, at the heart of this 32-square mile Somerset County township.
The mall's owner, the Rouse Company, the real estate investment trust in Columbia, Md., plans to expand it in phases by as much as 750,000 square feet. Rouse bought Bridgewater Commons 18 months ago from TrizecHahn Centers, the retailing division of the TrizecHahn Corporation of Toronto, and its partner, the Prudential Realty Group, the real estate arm of the Newark-based insurer.
At the time of Rouse's purchase, Marriott was already on board to build the hotel, which will be completed in 18 months, according to Jeff Spilman, a vice president for hotel development at Marriott. But the office component was still to be decided.
Plans for office space were part of Bridgewater Commons when it was first envisioned in 1984. But those plans were modified in 1997 to expand the mall and to rearrange the size and mix of the hotel and office space under a new agreement between the township and TrizecHahn and Prudential. The new plans still called for a full-service hotel, but they reserved space for the mall to grow. The plans also gave the owners flexibility: they could reduce the office space to 300,000 square feet, or they could replace it with an all-suite hotel or with 160,000 square feet of retail space.
Michael Sarkissian, Bridgewater's planning director, said that the center is proceeding along the lines of the original plan, except that the mall has been expanded. "The township is developing as envisioned by its master plan," he said. What was envisioned, said William Lanigan, the lawyer for the township who was its mayor in 1961 when the Bridgewater Commons site was rezoned for a regional shopping center, "was a multiuse facility that would serve as a town center for Bridgewater."
The site for the new offices is across Commons Way from the mall and next to the 8.5 acres where the hotel is rising. Robert Byrne, a vice president of Rouse, said while his company builds office space, it generally does so where it has set up one of its development groups, which is not the case in New Jersey. "It was logical for us not to build the office space, but rather to sell the land," he added.
Enter the Hines limited partnership. The privately owned company outbid several other developers for the Bridgewater Commons site, buying it for $14 million.
Location was a crucial factor. "It is in an office market that is achieving rents that are high enough to support new construction," said Jeff Spiritos, a vice president in Hines's Manhattan office and a manager of the $120 million project, which will be called Bridgewater Crossing. Financing for the project, which still must get final approval from the township's planning board, is coming from the $427 million Hines U.S. Development Fund, in which several pension funds have invested to develop suburban office buildings.
Michael Pride, another project manager at Hines, said that the fund "favors suburban core locations that are amenity rich." The Bridgewater project fits that description, given its proximity to the mall and the hotel and its access to highways, he said, adding that such access "provides the greatest catch net for tenants to retain and attract employees."
The project will be the first in New Jersey that Hines is building for its own account. But in the last decade, the partnership has served as the development manager for office projects for a number of corporations. For example, Hines is the development manager for the 1.6-million-square-foot complex Goldman, Sachs is planning on the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City.
Somerset County's office market is rebounding from the surfeit of space that came to market nine months ago, particularly in the submarket in the Interstate 287-78 area where Hines wants to build. "That was more or less a passing phenomenon," said Stephen P. Jenco, the research manager at the Fairfield office of Grubb & Ellis, the national commercial brokerage company. That space is being absorbed as corporations, particularly those in the financial, pharmaceutical and telecommunications industries, expand or consolidate into new quarters, he said.
For example, the Pharmacia Corporation, formed by the merger of Monsanto with Pharmacia & Upjohn, is leasing a 115,000-square-foot building constructed by Gale & Wentworth, the real estate services company in Florham Park, in partnership with the J. P. Morgan Investment Company of Manhattan. It is one of two similar-sized speculative buildings the partners built at their Somerset Financial Center on Route 206 at Lamington Road in Bedminster.
Mark Yeager, the president of Gale & Wentworth Commercial, said the partners also expect to announce a lease soon for the 130,000-square-foot speculative building they are developing as the first structure at MountainView, their 169-acre corporate campus at Interstate 78 and Martinsville Road in Bernards Township. Eventually, the campus could accommodate up to 850,000 square feet of space in six buildings.
"Fundamentals like highway access that made this a strong submarket still exist," Mr. Yeager said, "It can handle new product, in moderation."
In Bridgewater, across from Hines's planned office project, the last 65,000 square feet of space at a 250,000-square-foot speculative building at the Somerset Corporate Center has been leased by Siemens Financial Services, which is expanding. The building is the second that SJP Properties of Parsippany has built and leased at its 125-acre campus, where two more buildings, totaling 620,000 square feet, are under construction for Aventis Pharma, formed by the merger of Hoechst Marion Roussel and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
LEASING in the I-287-78 market is expected to continue. Douglas A. Gaffney, a vice president in the Chatham office of the Trammell Crow Company, the commercial brokerage, development and management company, said, "There are six to eight tenants with requirements of over 100,000 square feet looking for space."
Mr. Spiritos of Hines said the size of the buildings planned at Bridgewater Crossing would be an advantage, given that "there are not a lot of options for large users since the Aventis lease."
Sam Buckley, a director at the Saddle Brook office of Insignia/ESG, the project's leasing agent, described it as "the only project offering 600,000 square feet of contiguous space."
Although some real estate executives expressed concerns about traffic congestion at Bridgewater Commons, Mr. Spiritos said that $20 million in road improvements were completed before the shopping mall was built and that Hines would widen the portion of Route 22 in front of the office project.
The buildings at Bridgewater Crossing, designed by the Hillier Group of Princeton, will have an exterior of two shades of reddish granite and will feature floors of 37,500 square feet with 45 feet between columns. The buildings will offer high-tech wiring, including high-speed Internet access and two sources for telecommunications and electricity. M. Arthur Gensler & Associates' Parsippany office designed the interiors.
Mr. Spiritos said construction of the first 300,000 square foot building would begin once 20 to 25 percent of the space is preleased, probably in October, about the time that final approvals are expected from the township. Rents are projected to be $32 to $33 a square foot a year, which brokers said would be competitive for new buildings in the area.

 BODY:
A BLUE sign outside the mammoth industrial plant here on Marcus Avenue still reads "Lockheed Martin." But a new owner, i.park Lake Success, which bought the property from Lockheed in March for $21 million, has already begun demolishing interior partitions as a first step toward transforming the 1.4 million square feet into a sophisticated center for telecommunications and dot-com companies.
Leasing through Cushman & Wakefield of Long Island, a division of the national real estate brokerage company, has begun, and the first tenants are expected to move in by early fall. Annual rents of $23 to $25 a square foot include taxes and common-area charges, but not utilities, which will be separately metered. Tenants must take a minimum of 50,000 square feet, but incubator space for start-up companies is also planned. 
 The availability of large blocks of space will allow companies whose operations are scattered in several locations to consolidate under one roof and to have access to fiber optics and heavy-duty power supplies, said David C. Leviton, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield of Long Island. A single tenant is being sought for the three-story office building on Marcus Avenue that is connected to the plant, he said.
Development of the Internet and of Internet service providers is creating opportunities for the redevelopment of industrial sites like the former Lockheed plant, said Lynne M. Ward, a vice president of i.park Holdings of Greenwich, Conn., one of the partners in i.park Lake Success. The second partner in the Lake Success venture is the Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund IV of Manhattan.
"The defense companies in many ways have had their time, and the information companies have their time now, so we think this project is almost symbolic," Ms. Ward said. She estimated that the partnership's total investment in the Lake Success project would be $70 million, including the $21 million purchase price.
The Apollo fund, which has $1.1 billion in assets and is one of a group of similar real estate funds, will provide 95 percent of the cost. I.park Holdings, which was formed by principals in National RE/sources of Greenwich, an experienced real estate developer, will be responsible for the remaining 5 percent. It will also handle the development, leasing and day-to-day operations of the project.
The Lake Success complex occupies 93 acres stretching from Marcus Avenue south to the Union Turnpike Extension. Lakeville Road borders the property to the west. The site is notable for its history: The United Nations had its first home in the Marcus Avenue office building from 1946 to 1951. Lockheed Martin was the last of a series of defense contractors to own the site, where a variety of navigation, radar and fire-control and surveillance systems were manufactured for almost 60 years. Just before it shut the plant in 1998, Lockheed was making navigation systems for Trident submarines.
ALL the existing space will used for the new technology center except for some smaller buildings facing Union Turnpike, about 75,000 square feet in all, that will be demolished to expand the parking lots, which can currently accommodate 4,500 cars.
The office building on Marcus Avenue has about 73,000 square feet on three floors, with 1.35 million square feet to the rear, most of it in a sprawling one-story industrial building. About 140,000 square feet is in a separate building, the former foundry.
Because of its former manufacturing use, the property already has heavy-duty electric service. Tenants will be given a choice of multiple carriers, keeping prices competitive. Alternative electric power routes will be added to the building "because these companies can't have their computers go down even for a second," Ms. Ward said.
Mark A. Tsocanos, a principal in the Apollo investment group, said the i.park project would provide a collaborative environment for the very technical telecom switching and Internet hosting services and the creative activities of Web site and software developers.
The Long Island Technology Center in Great River, which opened about a year ago in a manufacturing plant once owned by Northrop Grumman, offers a similar concept: space devoted to high technology and occupied by tenants who can share ideas and create a synergy.
But Great River is 50 miles from Midtown Manhattan, and Lake Success is only 16 miles away. In fact, the i.park project's location will allow employers to draw workers from the entire metropolitan area, said Richard J. Mack, another principal in the Apollo fund, and the proximity of La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports will help draw national and international companies.
Interior demolition work has begun on a 350,000-square-foot portion of the main industrial building. With partitions ripped out, the 640-foot-by-220-foot area gives potential tenants an idea of what the space can offer.
Steel supporting columns are spaced 40 feet apart in one direction and 80 feet in the other, allowing for very open floor plans. The ceiling heights are 16 feet and 22 feet. The raised areas of the roof were originally designed to accommodate large vehicles and also to provide light monitors, the vertical skylights that suffuse the interior of the building with large amounts of natural light. The wood-block floors are being replaced with carpet over the existing concrete. Additional light flows in through two rows ofhorizontal windows that extend along the exterior of the building. New partitions will be installed and interior renovations will be tailored to individual users.
"A lot of industrial buildings like this are perfect for new office-space layouts because they have very tall ceilings and as in this case, very large spans between columns," said Michael M. Samuelian, a project designer and an associate at Hellmuth Obata & Kassabaum, the Manhattan architectural firm that is handling the renovation.
New entrances will be added to the main industrial building. The goal is to give each tenant its own front door and also to add architectural interest. The former plant is 1,440 feet long and 640 feet wide. The design of the new entrances will reflect the "midcentury late Art Deco style of the former administration building," Mr. Samuelian said.
The new plans for the grounds, which Hellmuth Obata & Kassabaum will also handle, include a new ring road with access points to each entrance. Existing trees will be saved and new trees will be planted along the ring road to form a boulevard. A small park of three to four acres will be created on the southern part of the site near Union Turnpike. The property also contains retention basins surrounded by a grove of trees, where some groundwater contamination is being cleaned up.
"I think the developers of the i.park will be successful because technology is growing rapidly, not only on Long Island but also in New York City, where 25 percent of leases executed during the first quarter of 2000 were with dot-com companies," said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association in Commack, a nonprofit organization that represents some 5,000 businesses and civic groups.
Many of New York City tenants are outgrowing their current spaces and are now facing annual rents of $30 to $40 a square foot, Dr. Kamer said. "So the next step for a lot of these technology and new-media firms in Manhattan is to move into the outer boroughs, which is already occurring in Long Island City, and then into Long Island, where rents are 30 percent to 40 percent below those in Manhattan," she said.
The federal government originally built the Lake Success plant. Sperry Gyroscope moved in as the first tenant in 1941. Ten years later, Sperry bought the property, later selling off 50 of its original 143 acres to an office developer. Sperry became the Sperry Rand Corporation, and in 1986, it merged with the Burroughs Corporation to form Unysis. In 1995, when the Loral Corporation bought the defense electronics division of Unysis, it became the property owner. Then Lockheed Martin acquired Loral in 1996.
Lockheed shut down its Lake Success operation in 1998 as part of a plan to dispose of surplus properties that it owned around the country. Lockheed originally wanted to be its own developer and came up with a plan to demolish the buildings and to sell off the land for offices, a hotel, housing and retail development. But rezoning could have taken years.
"We liked a lot of the Lockheed Martin plan because it offered a lot of opportunities to do a lot of different things," said May W. Newburger, the town supervisor of North Hempstead, where 50 of the site's 93 acres are situated. "The i.park concept has the advantage of creating jobs without the upheaval of getting permits and site plan approvals," she said.
Ms. Ward of i.park Holdings said her company, in partnership with the Apollo investment group, hoped to complete similar speedy conversions from industrial to telecommunications space around the country.
"We are looking for existing facilities that can be retrofitted because of the speed with which that can be done," she said. "The opportunity is now. These companies need the space yesterday."

HEADLINE: Discovering Bed-Stuy's Brownstones

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL 

 BODY:
WHEN brownstones were constructed on block after block of Brooklyn in the late 19th century, they provided housing for well-to-do people whose live-in servants, usually immigrants from Italy, Ireland or Germany, would dust the intricately carved moldings and cook in the ground-floor kitchens, sending food upstairs to the dining room by dumbwaiter.
Eventually though, brownstonesin much of Brooklyn became associated with the working class, and then the poor, who moved in when the buildings were divided into rooming houses. People with money, by and large, didn't want brownstones in Brooklyn; they wanted to live in apartment buildings in Manhattan or houses in the suburbs. 
 All that of course has changed. Brownstones are chic. They're appreciated. And of course they're appreciating. Houses that were affordable to the middle class not long ago are now homes for the rich, some selling for $1.1 million and more in well-established brownstone neighborhoods like Park Slope, and $750,000 in Fort Greene and Clinton Hill.
There is however, a section of Brooklyn that is close to Manhattan and still has hundreds of town houses and brownstones occupied by regular working and professional people: Bedford-Stuyvesant. To the people who live there, mostly African-Americans or those with Caribbean roots, it is a tight-knit, family-oriented community that has been saddled with a negative image that does not reflect the reality there.
To real estate brokers it is a gold mine, just waiting to be discovered by newcomers who have no idea of its charms, of its thousands of historic homes just 15 minutes on the A train from downtown Manhattan.
Everett H. Ortner, chairman of the citywide Brownstone Revival Coalition, says Bed-Stuy may have as many as 6,000 brownstones, perhaps more than any other neighborhood. "The quality is superb," he said. When houses go on the market, brokers say they are often priced at less than $300,000.
Walking the streets of Bed-Stuy, it feels like many other brownstone neighborhoods did 10 or 15 years ago, before they became home to chic little shops and restaurants. Lovely homes fill block after block, but the commercial activity consists mainly of beauty parlors, nail salons and other prosaic services and products.
Some of the main commercial streets are dotted with vacant storefronts. On a hot day, it is hard to find a shop selling sandwiches or ice cream cones. "You can go block after block and not see a grocery store," said Kenneth Adams, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. "There's a lag on the commercial side."
That disparity between the quality of the housing and the variety of stores is something that is starting to change, and if it does in any significant way, the neighborhood will become more appealing to people who associate city life with a convenient cup of coffee.
Recently, local people have started the kinds of enterprises they want to patronize. Jean Williams-Cutler, a native of Jamaica, and her husband, Timothy Cutler, an Englishman, opened a small, casual restaurant at the corner of Marcy and Putnam Avenues last fall called Doctor's Cave Cafe, after the beach in Jamaica where they met 11 years ago. Ms. Williams-Cutler said they decided to open a cafe in the building they have owned and lived in for 10 years because the space had been occupied by a "greasy spoon" and they believed the neighborhood needed better restaurants. Ms. Williams-Cutler, a nurse, and her husband, a lawyer, serve things like homemade pizza, quiche, roasted oxtail, pastas and curry.
Not far away, on Lewis Avenue, Monique Greenwood and her husband, Glenn Pogue, have bought a building with five commercial spaces, all to be rented by local entrepreneurs, and six apartments above. A bookstore called Brownstone Books is scheduled to open, as is an antiques store called the Parlor Floor. And in July, when the new stores open, Ms. Greenwood and Mr. Pogue will start a cafe, named Mirrors by their 8-year-old daughter, Glynn, "so people can come in and see their beauty," Ms. Greenwood said.
They already own a restaurant on the same block, Akwaaba, opened two years ago, and a few blocks away on McDonough Street, the Akwaaba Mansion, where they cater to a bed-and-breakfast clientele in four elegantly furnished rooms in their 18-room house. "Akwaaba" means "welcome" in Ghana.
MS. GREENWOOD, who is also the editor in chief of Essence magazine, said she and her husband became entranced with the neighborhood when they went on a tour of historic homes 11 years ago that was sponsored by the local Brownstoners. "First we fell in love with the houses," Ms. Greenwood said, "and then with the people who lived in the houses." The community, she said, "has everything I would ever want, except some amenities."
Her passion for the neighborhood is typical among many of those who own the brownstones, many of them with their original details intact and some of them part of the official Stuyvesant Heights Historic District. It is not unusual to meet people in Bed-Stuy with extended family in their homes or on the same block. Houses tend to stay in the same family for decades.
It is that stability that seems threatened by the sudden interest by brokers in selling the homes to people who are not from the neighborhood. Residents complain of aggressive door-to-door solicitations by brokers seeking listings, and offering to pay cash. Brokers who have for years done business in Bed-Stuy say they have to find more listings in the neighborhood to satisfy potential buyers who can't find anything they can afford in neighboring Clinton Hill or Fort Greene.
Eva M. Daniels, who has her own real estate company in Fort Greene, says escalating prices have put houses in Clinton Hill and Fort Greene beyond the reach of many aspiring buyers. "Bed-Stuy," she said, "is a very hot community right now. I cannot tell you how many calls I get every day asking for Bed-Stuy."
But prices are rising quickly. She said she received a call from a mortgage broker recently looking for comparables for a house that was selling for $365,000. Last year, Ms. Daniels said, she sold eight houses in Bed-Stuy, and the one that went for $265,000 was considered high at the time. Now, the same house might be $310,000.
Right now, she said, "I have three listings in Bed-Stuy, and it's not enough. I'm setting out to increase my listings. You write letters. You make calls. I know a lot of people. I get a lot of referrals." Her two grown sons live in the neighborhood, and she said it's a place that has "only gotten better, and it was never as bad as people thought it was."
A few years ago, she said, people from outside the neighborhood were typically uninterested in renting there. Now, she said, she is renting floor-through apartments for $900 a month or so, and duplexes for as much as $1,800.
Brokers say that people interested in Bed-Stuy rarely ask about schools, but that if clients do ask, the brokers refer them to books that evaluate local public schools.
The area is also receiving a new focus from the Corcoran Group, a large and aggressive Manhattan-based broker that has been expanding its Brooklyn operations and expects to open a new office in Fort Greene in late September. Jerry Minsky, who will be the managing director of downtown sales for that office, said Bed-Stuy has as many as 20 blocks in its historic district alone of "fabulously intact town houses."
For the entire neighborhood, he estimates that the average selling price of a town house last year was $180,963, up from $156,006 the year before. He believes he has customers who can pay between $350,000 and $399,000 who would buy in Bed-Stuy because they can't afford Clinton Hill or Fort Greene, and they want "museum condition" brownstones.
That is exactly the kind of price hike that will make it difficult for young people who have grown up in Bed-Stuy to remain. "Bed-Stuy is a community of extended family," said Tohma Faulkner, a member of the Brownstoners of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the local group dedicated to preserving the old housing. She owns a house with her sister, which they share with their mother. "Young people are having problems coming back," she said. "My goddaughter is going to law school. When she comes back in three or four years to buy a house, she's priced out."
Bed-Stuy may not be known to outsiders for its tight community of brownstone owners, but that community has existed for years. "There have always been middle-income and upper-income African-Americans there -- sophisticated, well-educated people," said Jerome Krase, chairman of the sociology department at Brooklyn College and the Murray Koppelman professor. But, he said, because of racism, and because Bed-Stuy was populated by blacks, "people figured it was a slum."
The area has had a high percentage of poor people for decades, as well as problems with abandoned housing. But the city, as well as nonprofit groups like the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation and the Bridge Street Development Corporation, have made progress toward solving some of those problems.
The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development has, in partnership with nonprofit groups and developers, had 700 two- and three-family houses built in Bed-Stuy in the last decade, and 2,800 housing units rehabilitated. The commissioner, Richard T. Roberts, said that the city had also encouraged retail development, particularly on Fulton Street, that has led to some services people in the neighborhood said they needed, like a sit-down restaurant, Choices by Oasis.
The city has contracted with developers that have successfully renovated and resold most of the 79 brownstones that the city owned in the neighborhood.
Charles Brass, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, said the buyers of the 900 new homes his group has completed are stable, employed people earning incomes up to $70,000. "There haven't been any defaults to speak of," he said. "In all of our projects, there's still strong demand."
THOSE houses let people know that the neighborhood is not being ignored. "The infrastructure has gotten much better," said Bryant Johnson McInnis, who has published a book with photos and text about Bed-Stuy, called "Glory in a Snapshot."
The rehab of vacant buildings has made a major change," said Mr. McInnis, a homeowner in the neighborhood who is the assistant director of Neighborhood Housing Services' Bed-Stuy office.
The biggest change now needs to come in the commercial area, according to Charles Atwell, a longtime broker and property manager who owns Stuyvesant Heights Realty. Mr. Atwell is disappointed that more local people are not starting businesses. A space that's 900 square feet, he said, rents for only $1,200 a month. With the influx of brokers from elsewhere and the rising residential prices, he fears that when businesses do arrive to cater to the newcomers, they will be run by outsiders, or national chains.
It is difficult to generalize about crime in Bedford-Stuyvesant, because the area is covered by several police precincts. But crime figures for the first four and a half months of this year, a police spokesman said, show that incidences in all the major categories, like murder, robbery and burglary, are down from last year at the same time, for the area bounded by Fulton Street on the south, Halsey Street on the north, Tompkins Avenue on the west and Stuyvesant Avenue on the east, which includes the historic district. Only the incidence of rape has increased.
The changes in Bed-Stuy are taking place in an area with strong block associations and so many churches that some blocks have more than one. In fact, it was the presence of the churches that led Laurie Cumbo to open Bed-Stuy's first museum this year.
Ms. Cumbo, a graduate of Spelman College in Atlanta with a master's in arts administration from New York University, did her thesis on Bed-Stuy's ability to support a museum. Studies showed, she said, that people of African-American descent who attended museums regularly were also dedicated churchgoers. That was one thing that led her to believe that the community -- with by her count 82 churches -- was ripe for a museum.
Ms. Cumbo, 25, circulated her thesis to local politicians and church groups and found interest from Bridge Street Church, a black congregation now located on Stuyvesant Avenue that was formed in 1766. This year, in 1,000 square feet of the church's newly renovated space, she opened Mocada, an acronym for Museum of Contemporary African Diasporian Arts. Her current show, of work by Melvin Clark, attracted 300 people to its opening reception.
The museum is just one outlet for artists. Some Bed-Stuy artists are showing their work through a relatively new group calledSonya, which stands for South of the Navy Yard Artists. Gigi Stankiewicz, an artist who creates works based on the human genome project, lives on Classon Avenue in Bed-Stuy. Although people associate lofts with artists, she says brownstones provide good working space because of the high ceilings on the parlor floors.
Ms. Stankiewicz moved to New York after receiving her master's degree from the Rhode Island School of Design, and says she is particularly charmed by Bed-Stuy because she lived in Newport for six years and likes the historic houses and quiet streets in both places. "There is a renaissance going on here," she said. "Homes are getting fixed up. We're at the beginning."
Some of the significant art activity in Bed-Stuy isn't immediately obvious, but it is there, and growing. Benjamin and Elaine Antonetty recently opened an art gallery on the parlor floor of their Jefferson Avenue brownstone, which they bought two years ago. It had been a rooming house occupied by 13 tenants, many of them not even paying rent, said Mr. Antonetty. Over a year, first by persuasion and then by legal action, he removed the tenants, and when they were gone began restoring the house.
Now, their new home is a showplace. Mr. Antonetty worked as the general contractor, having all of the wainscoting stripped and the carved wooden moldings returned to their original state. "Everything was painted," he said, even the subtly colored tiles in front of the fireplaces.
Everything is returned to its original glory, with mahogany on the parlor floor, cherry on the second, and beech on the top. Mr. Antonetty has a passion, he says, for wood, which may be the source of his strong feeling for these 19th-century houses. "To me, wood is strength," he said.
Mrs. Antonetty, who grew up in Fort Greene, and Mr. Antonetty, who grew up in a public housing project in Bushwick, moved to Bed-Stuy 15 years ago, and before buying their new house lived in one next door that they still own. "We fell in love with brownstones," she said. Their new house reflects the melding of Victorian and African influences, with a new stained-glass image in their front door that is an African symbol for belief in god.
They run their art business, which includes a framing shop, the gallery -- Aviva Arts, which is open by appointment only -- and a mobile gallery, where companies allow them to sell directly to the employees. They sell mostly lithographs, serigraphs and original paintings by people of African descent.
NEARBY, Doreen de Leon, a native of Grenada, lives in a brownstone on Jefferson Avenue that she bought in 1984 for $60,000. She also has her own real estate company in Brooklyn, which she started shortly after retiring from her job as a bacteriologist. She also has occasional art shows on the parlor floor of her home.
Ms. de Leon said she does a lot of sales and rentals in the area. Apartments that rent for about $1,000 a month, she said, would be $1,500 in Fort Greene, and they are drawing people with their fireplaces and parquet floors. "The majority of calls are people coming from Manhattan," she said.
For longtime homeowners, the new attractiveness of their neighborhood is both annoying and gratifying. Demetrice Mills, who works in computer systems on Wall Street, lives with his wife and three children on Classon Avenue. He came to New York 27 years ago as a teenager on his own from North Carolina and moved into a rooming house. He fell in love with the owner's daughter; they married, and eventually bought the house from her parents. They still own that house, as well as another on Classon that they now occupy.
The influx of real estate people looking for listings, he said, is grating on longtime residents. "There's a door-to-door campaign by realtors," he said, started in the last year. People have even posted notices saying they will pay cash for houses.
"A lot of the neighbors are quite upset with that," he said. "It's like an invasion. There's the sense that white people are coming to buy our houses, that we are being pushed out of our neighborhood."
It's disturbing, he said, that family members who might want to keep a house won't be able to afford to buy it from relatives. The neighborhood has a family feeling, he said, that is most evident in barber shops, where young boys and old men and every age in between hang out, talking, even if they're not getting haircuts.
He hopes, he said, that newcomers will become part of this open, friendly neighborhood, and that they will send their children to the local schools. He tries, too, to look at the economic benefits of the change that is just beginning.
African-American homeowners, he said, will have property that is far more valuable than it has been, property they can leverage, through home equity loans, into cash to improve their lives, to send their children to college. And maybe, to help them buy the more-expensive homes in their old neighborhood.

HEADLINE: THE RIGHT THING;
Tellingthe Truth, or at Least Most of It

BYLINE: By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN; Jeffrey L. Seglin teaches at Emerson College in Boston and is the author of "The Good, the Bad, and Your Business" (John Wiley & Sons). His column on business ethics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to: righthng@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN the results of an annual honesty and ethics poll were released last fall by the Gallup Organization, I had just begun a stint as a college professor and was feeling quite smug. There among the 10 professions ranked most honest by the American public was my new calling, with 52 percent of respondents judging its honesty as high or very high.
Then, after just a few minutes of basking in professional glow, I saw where the survey ranked another of my incarnations, that of online journalist: firmly among the bottom 10 on the list of 45, with only one respondent in 10 giving people in that line of work a good score. Talk about professional disconnect. 
 The findings present a puzzle. When introducing myself, what do I tell people I do? If I want them to trust me from the get-go, do I just say "college teacher" and withhold the part about writing for online publications?
If disclosing the complete picture leads people to an unfair conclusion about me, isn't it right, not to mention advantageous, to withhold some information? In a legal context, the answer is no. "It's better to include and explain than to omit and cast doubt," said Andrew J. Sherman, a lawyer at Katten Muchin Zavis in Washington. Of course, it is the job of a good lawyer to look through the lens of legal vulnerability and to caution against anything that may lead to trouble. But real life is rarely so simple.
Imagine that you are applying for a job during the McCarthyite 1950's. Years earlier, in college, you flirted briefly with radical politics. Should you disclose it and risk having the interviewer unfairly take you for a subversive, or hide it and be surer of getting the fair treatment you deserve?
Those pernicious days are behind us, thankfully, but ethically analogous situations still crop up. A few years ago, when a colleague was on vacation in the northern part of Ireland, he wanted to rent a car and was asked the name of his employer (an American newspaper). The rental agent told him that the company could not rent to people in certain "risky" occupations, including journalists. My friend swallowed hard and pleaded, somewhat disingenuously, that his job -- preparing maps, charts and diagrams for the newspaper -- was really more that of a commercial artist and not of a journalist. He got the car.
"We all practice selective disclosure," said Daryl Koehn, director of the Center for Business Ethics at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. "If we have been a professor at both Iowa State and the University of Chicago, we tell people we taught at the latter, because it is more prestigious. There is simply not enough time in the day to divulge our entire past history."
The ends figure in how we view these means. Sacrificing integrity to save a life is often, usually rightly, seen as heroic. Trimming the truth for personal gain -- landing a plum contract, for instance -- is difficult to justify. Somewhere in between is withholding true information that you think will lead people to false conclusions.
"We've stopped saying we are consultants, because as soon as we do, we find ourselves faced with a barrage of negativity and preconceived notions," said Michelle L. Reina, co-author with her husband, Dennis, of "Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace" (Berrett-Kohler), as well as, well, a consultant: the Reinas are principals of Chagnon & Reina Associates in Stowe, Vt. Too often, she said, people have difficulty separating individuals from professions and assume that any journalist is like all journalists, that any consultant is like all consultants. Now, she tells prospective clients she "works with organizations that want to bring trust into the workplace." As words go, "trust" strikes a better chord than "consultant."
Trust is also the key to solving the puzzle. Gallup polls notwithstanding, in all but the most extreme cases we simply cannot know with certainty how what we say will be perceived. Deciding to be less than honest about something trivial because we think the truth might provoke an unfair judgment of us is just a few steps away from deciding that deception for naked gain is appropriate any time we think we "deserve" it.
"Trust by its very nature is an act of reasonable faith," Professor Koehn said. "It exists precisely because we cannot control all circumstances. We should not make the mistake of thinking that all trust is contingent upon full disclosure." When in doubt about how the facts will be perceived, she advised, look gently for more clues. Otherwise, she said, she would proceed on the assumption that most people can be trusted to draw fair conclusions about us, regardless of what we do for a living.
Good advice. Did I mention that I was an online journalist?

HEADLINE: Those in the Know Pick the Wine for That Summer Meal

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
THE East End of Long Island is famous for duck, just-picked corn unloaded from burlap sacks and cornucopias of farm-stand vegetables christened by the morning dew.
As the langorous days of summer proper and then Indian summer dwindle down, backyard chefs and other stay-at-homes who rarely see the inside of a restaurant carry back to the city afterimages of relaxed, inexpensive feasts. 
 On the North and South Forks the opportunities for matching local wines with turf dishes at home are limited less by dollars than by imagination. (Surf meals are another story.)
Professional chefs, who spend their lives as culinary marriage brokers, offer some of the best recommendations around.
"I hardly ever cook duck at home," said Eberhard Muller, the chef and an owner of Lutece in Manhattan. "But if I did, I would roast the whole bird." By home he meant Satur Farms, in Cutchogue on the North Fork, where he and his wife, Paulette Satur, raise 15 acres of vegetables that are sold to restaurants and stores.
"With duck, I would serve cabernet franc," Mr. Muller said. "Schneider's would be great; they make a fabulous cabernet franc. Or a cabernet sauvignon. I'm torn: the '95 Paumanok or '95 Lenz cabernets, if you can still get them. Or a '97 Lenz. Or '95 or '97 Bedell.
"With the corn," Mr. Muller went on, "Lenz '97 gewurztraminer, because it's my favorite wine of the moment out there. It would go well with the sweetness of corn, I'd imagine. It goes well with everything.
"Salads are typically difficult to match with wine. The easiest to match are still off-dry rieslings -- and that's Paumanok."
Since its founding in 1973, Ross' North Fork Restaurant, in Southold, has championed Long Island cuisine and wines. More particularly, John Ross, the chef and an owner, said: "We've emphasized North Fork cuisine. We use everything possible local that we can. I've built my menu around these ingredients."
In the restaurant, "I serve roast duck with plum sauce," Mr. Ross said. "I like merlots with that. Bedell Cellars -- the '95, if you can get it. It was a great vintage. I am sorry to see those merlots go. The '97 is very good, too.
"Over the last four seasons," Mr. Ross continued, "we have served corn on the cob that is guaranteed three hours from the vine -- not from the stand but from the vine. With corn, I would go with our new viogniers, Macari's and Martha Clara's; Macari's and Hargrave's sauvignon blancs; and stainless-steel chardonnays: Lenz and Corey Creek I like a lot.
"With veggies, stainless-steel chardonnays are the best choice," Mr. Ross concluded. "That lemony-crisp acidity is refreshing to the mouth. Spring vegetables clash with wine, so you don't want to introduce a lot of flavors. The crisp acidity and cleansing is kind of nice. The vegetables stand up and taste like vegetables."
Todd Jacobs offers separate suggestions with duck recipes. As chef and owner, he is consolidating Tierra Mar in Westhampton and Atlantica in West Hampton Beach into one restaurant that will open this month in the Westhampton Bath and Tennis Hotel in West Hampton Beach.
For ambitious cooks who like canard a l'orange, Mr. Jacobs suggests a cherry brandy and cabernet franc sauce finished with sour cherries, and the same wine in a glass. "Schneider cabernet franc would be my choice," he said. "It's over the top. Palmer would be second."
With smoked duck breast, he would reach for a pinot noir -- primarily the '97 from Osprey's Dominion, then Jamesport's or Hargrave's -- or Lenz's gewurztraminer, or, from the South Fork, the reserve chardonnay from Wolffer/Sagpond.
As for corn on the cob, "white would come to mind," Mr. Jacobs said. "I'd like something crisp and light, maybe a sauvignon blanc, to offset the butter and salt. Again, Jamesport; in that category, they do a wonderful job. Also, Paumanok's chenin blanc, a great light summer wine.
"I'd love to do a salad" at home, Mr. Jacobs continued. "I'd go to a farm stand and get what's available. Zucchini, eggplant, tomatoes, scallions. I'd slice them, marinate them with olive oil, add salt and pepper, and grill them. I'd add fresh chopped chives, and then serve them on a bed of greens, with a squeeze of lemon. I'd use Palmer's '98 pinot blanc, a very light wine: For a light meal like that, you don't have overpowering flavors on either side."
What about the cost of wine?
For the budget-conscious, it's elementary that homebodies can drink and eat more thriftily (and often better) than restaurant-goers.
Consider, for example, a Long Island red wine that retails typically for $15.
Bought separately in a store, each bottle, with the 8.25 percent sales tax, costs $16.24. A 12-bottle case, with a standard 15 percent discount and the tax, comes to $165.62, or $13.80 a bottle; with an often-found 10 percent discount, to $175.37, or $14.61 a bottle.
Depending on a restaurant's standard markup, the $15-at-retail bottle can cost, with tax, $32.48 (with a 100 percent markup) to $64.95 (with a 300 percent markup). If a 15 percent tip is applied to the bottle, pre-tax, the costs rise, respectively, to $36.98 or $73.95.
Outside the restaurant, the savings would rise if you found a merchant who, in addition to holding periodic shelf-clearing knockdown sales, favored his cash-only customers with a supplementary discount, too. Pick up the wine yourself, and you save a possible delivery fee.
Case purchases of a single wine can be a recipe for boredom. But the arithmetic of stores' mix-and-match cases -- say, three merlots, two cabernet francs, one cabernet sauvignon, one pinot noir, three chardonnays, one sauvignon blanc and one pinot blanc -- can still save you money.
Remember, too, that magnums -- 1.5 liter bottles, which are twice the size of regular bottles -- sometimes can be found, and almost always cost less than two regular 750-milliliter bottles.
Moral No. 1: The economics of warm-weather entertainment argue for both careful study of wine ads and catalogs and the cultivation of dependable merchants who are grateful for the repeat business.
Some excellent New York City retailers deliver wine to Long Island customers, but, the ease aside, there is a benefit in buying from Island merchants, especially those who take big positions in East End wines and enjoy heavy turnovers. The proximity of Suffolk County producers to stores Islandwide ensures frequent deliveries, and, since producers store their inventories carefully in temperature-controlled cellars to avoid spoilage, consumers are likely to get steady flows of fresh goods.
Moral No. 2: As you fire up the grill for an afternoon or evening of family-and-friends pigging out or socializing -- or if sensibly, you, and not a caterer, have supplied the wine for a wingding under a striped tent -- you can feel good about having pursued a businesslike approach to wine planning and buying that keeps your hard-earned money at home.

HEADLINE: Happy Caterers, Many Frantic Customers

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
NOBODY is likely to go hungry this summer in the Hamptons, but that is small consolation to hosts and hostesses with many mouths to feed.
"I've never seen a year like this," said Brent Newsom, a Bridgehampton caterer. By the end of April, business at Brent Newsom Caterers was up about 80 percent from last year, he said, with every Saturday in July and August booked, as well as the whole month of September and the latter part of June. 
 "People have been calling earlier to book their parties," Mr. Newsom said. "They smell the scent of panic in the air and are beating each other to death for dates. We're selling dates for parties the way houses sell in Silicon Valley: on who wants to bid the highest for the date."
As early as February, Cheryl Stair, chef and partner of Art of Eating in Amagansett, called regular clients to warn them they had better choose their dates for summer events, or risk being shut out.
"Weekends have booked up early this year, which has created a longer summer season that now stretches from May right through the last weekend in October," she said.
By January several clients had locked in their dates with Christopher Robbins, a caterer who owns Robbins Wolfe Eventeurs in Bridgehampton. By last month, more than half the Saturdays through the summer were booked, he said, either with several large parties or up to 10 smaller ones.
Last-minute party planners may be hard-pressed to find a free Saturday in July or August. And forget about June and September.
"This year people seem to want the biggest and most important wedding, benefit, cocktail party or corporate function," Mr. Newsom said. "The weddings and benefits this summer are crawling all over each other, and some benefits have changed their dates because they were competing with another big one."
Michael Castino, owner and chef of Pacific East in Amagansett, said, "I've had to turn people away, and even when I suggest other places, they're also often already booked."
With so many weekend dates filled, Charlotte Sasso, co-owner of Stuart's Seafood Caterers in Amagansett, has been encouraging clients to plan parties during the week.
"I try to suggest something different," she said. "How about a Thursday or a Monday? Thursday is a great day because it's the start of the weekend. Some people are receptive; others insist on Saturdays."
Even if the caterer is available, there are still the challenges of finding entertainment, rental items, a tent, valet parking and other services, which are also tight.
"The busy season is wonderful for us," said John Kowalenko, co-owner of Art of Eating, "but for people planning an event this year, they'll be fortunate to have all their needs met."
Surprisingly, September is the first month to fill up, said Ms. Stair, mostly with weddings. "The weekend after Labor Day is going to be insane," she said. "We've already turned away about 50 couples."
Mr. Newsom's September calendar is also filled with weddings. "September in the Hamptons has turned into the nuptial capital of the Western world," he said. "Every bride wants to be married in the Hamptons in September. It used to be that at the end of August, everybody went home and the crush of summer people was over. But now the crush of September people is just as big."
Why the boom? Many attribute it largely to the strong economy and the flourishing stock market, and caterers were pleasantly relieved by the nonreaction to the recent dip in the market. "There was not a whimper," Mr. Newsom said, "not even a sniggle of a call asking to cut back on anything."
Aside from the economy, the millennium has also contributed to an unusually busy season.
"There was a lot of romance in the air on New Year's Eve because of the millennium," Mr. Kowalenko said. "There were more engagements than we can ever remember in the past because so many people wanted to be married in the year 2000. This has created a great need for wedding dates this year."
The fact that this is an election year has also added benefit parties to the Hamptons calendar, added Jim McManus, executive director of Party Rental Ltd. in East Hampton. "There are many fundraisers for political causes, competing for the limited time and resources of the caterers," he said. "This is contributing to the gridlock."
For caterers, gridlock also means that many of the same people will be going to more than one party on any given night, Mr. Robbins said. "If more than one party is on our books for the same night, we ask the clients if they know each other and if there are any of the same guests," he said. "Then we have to be sure not to serve the same menu."
Caterered events this summer range from formal sit-down dinners for 700 to home parties with a Caribbean or Hawaiian theme to casual clambakes on the beach. Of the growing popularity of clam bakes, Ms. Sasso said: "While there is an element of the Hamptons that is 'see and be seen,' there's another side that is 'kick off your sneakers and have fun.' People love to wear shorts and lobster bibs with butter slothered all over their chins."
At the other end of the spectrum, some parties are more sophisticated and stylized.
"Everybody in the Hamptons wants to make a statement," Mr. McManus said. "People have high-quality taste and many are looking to upgrade and spend more money on details like tablecloths, china and even chairs. We now have to offer choices, including more than 30 different patterns of china, a new line of embroidery for monogramming on napkins and chairs in 28 different colors. We're taking it up a notch."
Then there are the clients who want caviar and lobster on a hamburger budget, said Greg Deger, general manager of Red Horse Catering in East Hampton. "We can't give them foie gras and truffles for $20 per person," he said, "but we find a way to work out something that works for everybody."
For Red Horse Catering, one of the highlights will be the wedding of Jodi Della Femina, a daughter of the restaurateur Jerry Della Femina, and John Kim, whose family is Korean. Mr. Della Femina is also the owner of Red Horse Catering.
Planning a wedding between an Italian bride and a Korean groom has kept the caterers busy, Mr. Deger said.
"We've been working for eight months to create a wedding that brings the two nationalities together," he said. "There will be a traditional Korean ceremony on the beach, followed by a Korean cocktail hour, then a family-style Italian dinner."
Summarizing the pre-season frenzy, Ms. Stair said, "We're all dancing as fast as we can."
 
On the Side
 
It takes more than shrimp and chardonnay to make a summer cull of parties work. Here are other details on the checklist of one of the Hampotons' busiest caterers, Art of Eating Catering and Event Planning.
 
Renting more than 20 locations in excess of $200,000 for parties and weddings.
 
Donating more than $75,000 in products and services to more than $20 charities.
 
Interviewing more than 250 people for jobs as waiters, bartenders, and other positions.
 
Making more than 10,000 cups of coffee.
 
Ordering more than 100,000 glasses; 12,000 plates; 40,000 knives, forks and spoons from rental companies, as well as 20,000 napkins.
 
Going through more than 150,000 beverage napkins, 16,000 liters of soda and juice and 10,000 pounds of ice.
 
Using 1,500 gallons of gasoline, 6,000 pounds of propane and 5,000 trash bag.

HEADLINE: Some Menus Without Meltdown Prices

BYLINE: By RICHARD J. SCHOLEM 

 BODY:
THE tens of thousands of tourists who troop onto Long Island invariably gravitate to restaurants to savor the season, particularly places that offer outdoor, waterfront and water-view dining. Unfortunately, such locations, especially prime by-the-sea sites, are expensive and the cost of such real estate is passed on to patrons in the form of high food prices.
Yet many in-the-know, year-round residents find the foods of summer without experiencing budgetary meltdown. Summer on a shoestring dining can be pursued on two gently priced paths. First, there are weather-beaten fish markets offering fresh seafood, funky little outdoor ethnic spots, rough and tumble country roadhouses and ramshackle near-the-water old favorites, specializing in simple, satisfying seafood dishes. Another possibility exists for those with a good eye and self-restraint: creating an upscale experience for a downscale price by carefully scrutinizing the menus of more glamorous, atmospheric eating places. 
Bistro Blue, in the Sterling Harbor Marina, at 1410 Manhasset Avenue in Greenport (631-477-3940), falls midway between these two routes. Its commendable food, sharp young servers, waterfront site and spectacular marina and harbor views make it appear more expensive than it is. This summery, year-old East End entry is a place of sun-bright yellow walls and deep blue ceilings. The restaurant's many picture windows offer diners a floor show, boats gliding in and out of the marina.
A big bowl of the soup of the day costs $5, meal-sized hand rolls or wraps, served with salad or French fries, go for $6 to $9, six-slice pizzas are in the $7-to-$9 range, pastas are $10 to $14, four of the six desserts cost $5 or $6 and meat or fish entrees start at $14.
Among the blue-ribbon appetizers were a peppy, refreshing gazpacho ($5); a warm goat-cheese salad ($8) resting in a tangy toasted-tomato vinaigrette that boasts four or five types of lettuce (none of them iceberg); a couple of lively seasoned no-filler crab cakes ($8) served with savory corn salsa and vibrant remoulade sauce and a New Yorker entree-sized pizza ($8) large enough to be an appetizer for four.
Bonbori, a Japanese gem at 14 Elm Street in Huntington (631-673-0400), isn't a bargain, but it is a beauty, especially the enchanting Asian garden behind the restaurant. Thrifty diners can concentrate on page one of the menu, with its skewered seafood, vegetable and tofu appetizers and its soups, salads and noodle entrees, all of which are priced from $3.50 to $9.50.
During the warm weather months, except on nasty days, that garden is the restaurant. Diners enter through wooden pagoda-style doors and walk a path lined with plants, lanterns and Japanese artifacts to the secluded garden, which is bordered by rhododendron, shaded by trees, with its and soothed by the sound of gently trickling water.
Mix, match and share the starters, sushi and entrees from the restaurant's pocket-sized kitchen. The bold and fresh Bonbori salad ($6.50) blends its standard lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and endive with raisins, walnuts, bacon bits and shredded daikon (white radish) and carrots. The salad serves four, as does the bowl of udon ($9) with its thick, white noodles presented either in a hot broth or chilled dipping sauce.
Another opener for four, found on the separate sushi and sashimi menu, is the $7 sampler containing four pieces made from that day's freshest ingredients. (Tuna, fluke, sea bass and silk snapper one day with not a clunker in the bunch). Recommended appetizers are six oysters age-dashi ($8.25), shrimp-vegetable tempura $6.75), sauteed vegetables ($6.25), angry shrimp ($9), yakitori (($6.25) and shrimp kushi ($8.25). The batter on the fried oysters is not the ho-hum bread crumb variety, but kuzu starch. Speaking of batter, the feathery, crisp-covered tempura shrimp and vegetables is as good as it gets. Those four angry shrimp, pan fried in egg batter, sported a vibrant, though not incendiary, ginger sauce.
The Cull House is a seafood shack near the Fire Island Ferry in Sayville that serves consistently good food at easy-to-take prices. Keep it simple with straightforward American fish dishes and you will be rewarded. This rustic, 17-year-old spot, at 75 Terry Street (631-563-1546), has undergone some sprucing up during the off season, but its down-to-earth nautical ambience (ship's wheels, lobster aquarium, mounted fish, ship boat models) remains.
So do the bargain prices. Although a one-and-a-quarter pound lobster dinner is listed at $14.95, a lobster can be purchased during "Lobster Madness" every Monday through Thursday for $8.99. An additional $1.95 buys vegetables and potatoes, resulting in a $10.94 meal. During the first four days of the week, when "Shrimp Silliness" is in effect, patrons can purchase seven lightly breaded jumbos for $6.99.
Artie's South Shore Fish and Grill, near the water in Island Park, is wedged in sideways along Austin Boulevard (4257 Austin, 516-889-0692). It opened 25 years ago as a fish market. It still is, but two years ago Artie Hoerning, who always caught most of the fish, expanded and opened an unpretentious little cafe. He recently hired Jared L. Binns of Long Beach, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America who has worked at Mulligan's at Hampton Bays, Borderline Cafe, the Discerning Palate and Villa Lombardi.
You can't eat much fresher fish than those at Artie's. And that's the way to go. Tuna is $11.95, swordfish $12.95, salmon $8.95, halibut $9.95 and whole broiled fluke $10.95. All are cooked with a vigilance and respect that many local restaurants, including fancy ones, have yet to master..
Ignore the two tables in front of the Hampton Chutney Company, at 74 Montauk Highway in Amagansett (631-267-3131), that make it look like just another hot dog and hamburger drive-in. Instead, go behind the building to the lovely 12-acre, landscaped garden of the adjacent Bayberry Nursery, where interesting, sometimes exotic Indian and American dishes are served at six picnic tables.
Many of the dosas (airy sourdough crepes made with rice and white lentil flour), uttapas (pancake-like dosas made with the same ingredients) and sandwiches feature fresh cilantro, tomato, mango, curry, peanut and pumpkin chutneys. A good place to start is the basic Masala dosa ($6.50), a warm crepe, about 10 inches long, that is wrapped around a savory spiced (though not spicy) potato filling. The most expensive items on the menu cost $10.50.
Paddy McGee's is the fish house in everyone's mind's eye, with its dark wood paneling, checkered tablecloths, aproned waiters, life preservers and lobster aquarium. An authentic seaside touch is added by its waterfront locale on the Reynolds Channel in Island Park.
Fortunately Paddy McGee's, at 6 Waterview Road (516-431-8700), isn't as expensive as it looks. Although appetizers can cost as much as $8.95 and fish dishes top out at $18.50, two diners can enjoy a light, lovely meal by ordering the feast of the sea ($12.50 a person). This briny array of shellfish from the raw bar contains 10 fresh clams and 9 pristine oysters on the half shell, 8 peel-and-eat shrimp, 5 mussels, 2 tender sea scallops and a clump of tangy calamari.It is preceded by a substantial plate of carrots, celery, new pickles, cabbage and olives, long reedy bread sticks and warm bread. Add a soda or ice tea for $1.50 or a glass of wine for a bit more and you have an ideal summer on a shoestring dinner.
For those who crave more, there are bowls of peppy Manhattan clam chowder and soothing New England clam chowder ($3.50). Two gently priced fish entrees are worth ordering: mild broiled New England scrod ($14.95) and savory seared brook trout ($15.50).
The wide wrap-around deck at Steamboat Landing faces the Jude Thaddeus Glen Cove Marina and straddles Glen Cove Creek. The setting, at 76 Shore Road, Glen Cove (516-759-3921), is perhaps the loveliest, low-priced possibility for waterside dining on the Island.
Midday on Sunday is one of the best times for a visit. The $16.95 brunch, which includes drinks, is being scaled back to $12.95 (without alcoholic beverages) this summer. Tthe brunch is a retro buffet that offers predictable choices of ordinary fare -- fettucine a la vodka, eggplant parmigiana, breaded pork cutlets, sausage and onions, fried potatoes, made-to-order omelets, chicken in wine sauce, bagels, Jell-O and fruit salad.
Also available is the bar menu. Its choices, which are actually the appetizers from the evening menu, present more discriminating patrons with a somewhat more sophisticated selection at almost equally affordable prices. Those who opt for quality over quantity will want to share the cold antipasto ($7.95) with its array of tomato, cheese, mushrooms, pepperoni, roasted red peppers, caponata and mozzarella. The seven tiny baked clams ($8.95), topped with tasty oreganata crumbs, is another good choice and the four jumbos in the somewhat pricey shrimp cocktail ($11.95) are first rate.
Two salads, the Caesar ($6.75 and $11.25, with grilled chicken) and the house ($5.50 and $9.95 with chicken) took top honors. Both the Caesar, a cascade of fresh romaine, homemade croutons and creamy Parmesan dressing presented in a pastry seashell container and the house, a large tangle of tender baby greens with a good red wine vinaigrette were substantial enough to share, especially when they are topped with a generous helping of chicken.
Although its open-air deck, next to an often active boat-filled creek is the choicest spot at Steamboat Landing, the airy dining room with its high ceiling and many windows, is a desirable bad-weather alternative that also offers a marine vista.
When a mist rises from the Great South Bay or its waves cast a spray along the shoreline, they reach Babylon Fish and Clam, a half block from the water at 458 Fire Island Avenue in Babylon (631-587-3633).
It opened 33 years ago as a clam shack and remains a rustic knotty pine kind of placey, despite expansion that includes a restaurant, a fish market, an open deck with umbrellas, a covered porch and a clam bar -- all determinedly nautical in decor.
Savvy patrons target the basics. They order starters like the spirited, highly seasoned, dense-with-ingredients Manhattan clam chowder and the thick, rich New England clam chowder (both $1.95 cup, $2.95 bowl), or the shrimp cocktail with its six shrimp for only $5.95 and the 18 or so big chowder-type steamers for $6.95.
Entrees make appetizers unnecessary since their price includes either of the chowders or garden salad and a choice of baked potato, French fries, onion rings and vegetables. Some of the least expensive entrees are among the best, including crisp, greaseless fried clam strips ($9.95). Flat fish range from $10.95 (broiled or fried codfish) to $18.95 for specials like striped bass provencale.
To experience summer on Long Island, order a bottle of white wine for $13, pair it with a dozen clams on the half shell ($8), that shrimp cocktail or fried clams and head for the open-air deck.

HEADLINE: The Barbecue Grill Reaches a Higher Level

BYLINE: By ELZY KOLB

 BODY:
BRICK and mortar are making a comeback. Elaborate brick and stone barbecues are starting to appear in backyards around the region.
"We began to have people asking for them about four years ago," said Trish Calabrese, office manager of Creative Stone Works Inc., in Park Ridge, N.J. "This year, there has been a huge increase. It's amazing what people are doing in their yards right now." 
 The booming economy is at least in part behind the resurgence of interest in these backyard behemoths. Higher disposable income makes it possible, even desirable, to dress up the mundane things in life. "The stonework has an Old World feeling, and it definitely looks a lot better than the plain, black-box gas grill," Ms. Calabrese said.
There's some nostalgia involved, too. Simple but pleasant childhood memories often bring clients to the offices of stonemasons and landscape architects. During the planning stage, "customers will mention the little old fireplaces, like they had in parks or in rest stops on the throughway," said Tom Ciccariello, owner of Seven Sons, a stone-working company in East Hampton. "For many of us, those cookouts were a big part of growing up."
But today's manifestation of those memories typically goes far beyond the basic wood-fired single-grill units of cookouts past.
Cameron Brand, a certified landscape architect and office manager of Oliver Nurseries in Fairfield, Conn., views the stone barbecue as the open-air equivalent of a commercial range, saying, "It's the Viking of outdoor products."
Florence Bogart, a landscape architect at Sprainbrook Nurseries in Scarsdale, N.Y., agrees. "What I'm seeing is elaborate outdoor cooking spaces. Really, it's like an outdoor kitchen."
Most are fueled by natural gas, rather than wood or charcoal. And most are "elaborate fireplaces tied to something, not just a lump of stone," Mr. Ciccariello said.
There's an extensive wish list of things that can be tied to such a setup. The brick or stone barbecue might have a top-of-the-line stainless steel cooking unit with an enormous grilling surface, and be topped off with a tall chimney with a flue. Many cooking areas contain rotisseries, gas burners and a hooded cooking surface.
"These are big, sophisticated units," Mr. Ciccariello said. "People cook corn on the cob and lobster. You can have a clambake along with the grilled food."
Counters surrounding the cooking area are topped with marble, ceramic tile, granite, bluestone slate or Corian. Beneath those counters you might find built-in storage units or cabinets with wood or stainless steel doors. Other amenities include running water for wet bars or preparation sinks, under-counter refrigerators, and lighting fixtures.
The surrounding area gets tied in, too. Because of its imposing size and stature, the barbecue is almost always the focal point in a landscaping plan, and its look is carried over into other elements in the yard. The cooking unit is sometimes built into a stone wall, or matching walls are built to shelter the cooking area.
"It could be a seating wall, a retaining wall or a freestanding wall to separate, say, the lawn from the patio," Mr. Ciccariello said. "It gives the sitting area more privacy. You can also add a stone table-a big slab of natural stone." Granite-topped bench-style seating is another add-on.
This may seem like a lot of trouble to go to, to cook outdoors twice a year. But that's not the case, said Matt Horn, owner of Matterhorn Nursery Inc., in Spring Valley, N.Y.
"With gas, everyone's cooking outside, all year round," he said. "These fireplaces are great for entertaining; they have a great ambience. More people want to be outdoors, even if they only have a small area. People will sit out all evening. We're even installing some fire pits-people can sit around, cook, talk and be warm, even in the spring and fall."
Ms. Brand explained the attraction this way: "It's a way of getting back to nature, even if you're outside a mansion. It's like being around the campfire; you can be at one with nature at the barbecue."
If you build it, they will come. And they will want to participate, too. "When friends come over, cooking at the barbecue gets people involved," Mr. Ciccariello said. "Everyone congregates around the grill and takes turns flipping."
Mr. Brand said: "When you have guests, it's much more social than standing around the stove inside. It's a very active way to cook. It gets you outside and gives you a feeling of participation in the gathering. It's a way for men to feel they're participating in the dinner hour, without feeling inept in front of the stove."
What's the bottom line on this wonderful combination of conspicuous consumption, nostalgia, ambience and bonding? "These things are not cheap," Mr. Horn said. "You might start at $10,000 for a decent one; allow about $4,000 for the mechanism, plus the masonry."
Mr. Ciccariello said: "It could be $6,000 to $14,000 for a grandiose project. It's a statement; it's not about function at that level. It's a hold on our past."
Mr. Calabrese said: "Quality is a consideration over price. People want to get something that's going to last. I can't imagine people spending like this in the late-80's."

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS;
OlderOffice Space For the New Economy

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy. His column on the Main Street economy appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: grassrts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FRESH out of New York University Law School, Andrew Segal moved to Texas in the early 1990's to seek his fortune. Although he started with an inheritance of roughly $1 million, he felt that New York was too tough and expensive a place to build his own business empire.
Instead, he went looking where the pickings seemed easier, moving first to Dallas, where he bought some "see through" office buildings left virtually vacant after the oil crisis in the early 1980's. Yet as the real estate market improved there, he had to dig deeper for new opportunities, and began buying aging office buildings along Houston's downtrodden and dangerous Main Street. 
 That made some locals think that he was out of his mind -- or at least a very gullible outsider. "At the time," Mr. Segal recalled, "it looked like it was just another holdup on Main Street."
Now, his strategy of buying old, unwanted office buildings seems more like a stroke of genius. In the last five years, his Boxer Properties, based in Houston, has bought some 70 of them, 17 of which are of pre-World World War II vintage, in cities that also include Baltimore, Hartford, Dallas and Tulsa, Okla., as well as Hempstead, N.Y. Nearly all the deals have proved successful, with occupancy rates, rents and property values multiplying by two, three or more.
Mr. Segal, 33, appears on the verge of becoming a king of the once-disdained niche of so-called class B urban office space. His method is simple: he buys older buildings, fixes them and puts signs on them offering space for rent. As word gets around of the improved conditions in the buildings and of the low rents, which are sometimes as little as half those offered by landlords of fancier space nearby, tenants come and stay.
The entrepreneur, whose low-cost business style includes extensive traipsing from Baltimore to Tulsa and places in between on budget flights, may have seized the right niche at the right time. According to statistics from Reis Inc., a real estate information firm in New York, class B vacancy rates nationwide have dropped to roughly 11 percent from an average of nearly 20 percent in 1995. In some key urban centers, like San Francisco and Seattle, the rates are as low as 3 percent. Even in long-distressed markets like Tulsa, Baltimore and Houston, they have dropped by as much as half.
Mr. Segal credits the recovery of this niche in the last five years to broader changes in the economy -- including the explosive growth in the number of Internet, media and related businesses. These young companies may initially be attracted by the lower rents, but they also see these older buildings -- some of them stunning examples of Art Deco or Beaux-Arts architecture -- as reflecting their image as creative, nonhierarchical and unconventional.
Of course, Mr. Segal notes, the appeal of such buildings is not unconditional. To make them as functional as their more modern rivals, they often require upgraded telecommunications infrastructure and central air-conditioning systems, fresh coats of paint, and sometimes the removal of outdated features like carpeting over hardwood floors.
In many cities, such structures also benefit by being in or near districts that attract the young people who are so vital to many new-economy companies. Unlike high-rise buildings, these structures -- often less than 10 stories -- were usually built to accommodate ground-level businesses that open to the street. They also tend to have more light, and therefore less of the "concrete canyon" coldness found in many post-1950's downtown areas.
Throughout the country, districts dominated by class B buildings -- like Lower Manhattan in New York, Deep Ellum in Dallas, the Leather District of Boston and the South of Market section of San Francisco -- have first re-emerged as magnets for artists and denizens of hip clubs, then become hotbeds of Internet and other new-media activity. And with loft and other residential spaces available nearby, they create the kind of vibrant, 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week environment sought by dot-com employees.
"It's where the single people are, where you go to a bar to meet them," Mr. Segal said. "That's what makes it work. In Houston there are few places for people to walk around and promenade; downtown is the exception."
The movement of Web-related companies into these districts, he said, enhances their appeal for more traditional white-collar companies that he calls "dot-com wannabes." In that group are advertising agencies, publishers, fashion design companies, executive recruiters and even small law firms that seek out the latest "cool" space to impress both clients and prospective employees with their new-economy savoir faire.
OTHER pioneers include Richard Kirshenbaum, founder of Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York, an ad agency that prides itself on being hip. Kirshenbaum Bond moved from Midtown to Lower Manhattan more than a decade ago, in part to identify with the image of the area.
"If you are in a traditional area, you say you are a traditional business," Mr. Kirshenbaum, 40, said in his art-filled headquarters on Hudson Street. "It's taking risks, but we're a young agency and the area has sprouted up. It's having your own point of view and knowing your own mind."
For Mr. Segal, who tends to be a bottom-fishing King of the B's, markets like New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Boston, where class B rents can now reach $50 a square foot, have become too expensive. He prefers places like Tulsa, where he has bought seven prewar structures in the recovering downtown area; Kansas City, Mo.; and Baltimore. Space there can still be rented for as little as $10 a square foot and class B buildings bought for $1 million or less.
Mr. Segal is the first to acknowledge that these markets barely exist on the radar screen of big-name speculators and real estate investment trusts. He sees that as a plus, particularly if the market has falling vacancy rates, gradually rising rents and a growing community of high-technology companies. "I think the market will reward places that are cheaper and still offer a unique urban experience," he said.
These markets, he added, offer him the chance to duplicate the kind of windfall he has enjoyed on Houston's Main Street, now that downtown Houston itself may be getting a bit too expensive.
WITH the $525,000 he spent in 1996 to buy two 70-year-old office buildings in the city, he has made money two ways. Last year, he sold his 711 Main Street building for $2.1 million to a condominium developer. Each of the 40 lofts there, he estimated, is now worth more than the entire building was five years ago.
At the other Main Street building, which he still owns, the rental income has soared as commercial tenants have flooded in. Its vacancy rate, near 80 percent in 1996, has dropped to the single digits. New Web companies like SalvageSale.com, have moved in, helping to push rents from $6 a square foot to closer to $15, a big increase since 1996 but still at least $5 cheaper than nearby class A structures.
The growth of restaurants and clubs around the area, said Charlie Wilson, SalvageSale.com's president, has greatly enhanced the value of the office space -- a phenomenon seen in other cities as well.
"It's different, it's cool and it has history," said Mr. Wilson, 32, whose company now occupies 10,000 square feet in the building. "If you're going to be in Houston, this is where we want to be."

Vendors' Tricks, Water Woes and Upward Growth

 BODY:
NEW YORK has long been a subject of study by scholars and fare for academic as well as popular publishers. Here are excerpts from three recent books from university presses that explore various aspects of the city: a collection of essays from that quintessential New York observer, William H. Whyte; a history of how the city created its amazing water system; and a sociologist's view of how New York, along with Chicago and Los Angeles, take their place in the global economy. 

THE ESSENTIAL
WILLIAM H. WHYTE
Edited by Albert LaFarge
Fordham University Press
(Hardcover, $39.95, Paper $19.95)
Street vendors sell everything. There are perennial staples: junk jewelry, watches, umbrellas, plastic raincoats, toys. But the vendors are always trying out new items and occasionally most of them will be riding one fad, or whatever the jobbers are loaded up with. Several years ago it was leather belts. So many vendors took to selling them that it looked like the point of saturation had surely been reached. But supply created demand, and the sight of all those leather belts on the sidewalks drove people to buy more leather belts. They are still buying them.
The vendors have been growing in number. They have been broadening the range of the merchandise sold. To the aggravation of merchants, they have also been staking out more of the sidewalk space, that in front of stores especially. They have been doing more selling in winter and more night selling. Some illumine their racks and table with battery-powered fluorescent lamps.
Whatever the merchandise, the pitch is much the same. It's cheaper on the street. Ten dollars inside. One dollar here. Why pay more? The pitch is often made in a furtive manner, as if the deal were shady. Many vendors look shady. Many try to. It is to their advantage. There is a widespread assumption among knowing New Yorkers that much of the merchandise is stolen. Vendors do nothing to discourage this idea. As in a con game, the latent dishonesty of the customer is all for the good. He wants the goods to be stolen. That explains why he is going to snare a bargain. In actual fact, very little of the goods sold by vendors is stolen. They pick up their stuff from the jobbers in the Broadway-30th Street area who specialize in novelty merchandise. But if you ask the vendors where the goods came from, they may look at you slyly and wink.
 
WATER FOR GOTHAM
By Gerard T. Koeppel
Princeton University Press
(Hardcover, $29.95)
New York did not fare well during the Revolution. A fire two years into the British occupation destroyed much of what the 1776 fire missed, leaving the city "almost half Burned to Ashes." Shelter, food, and fuel were in short supply. In the winter of 1780, river traffic was blocked by ice and people froze to death from lack of firewood; during a 1781 reconnoiter, George Washington reported the island "totally stripped of trees."
Drought and deforestation played havoc with the groundwater. There was no rain for two months in the spring of 1780; in the summer of 1782, the town wells were dry and Hessian soldiers dug holes forty feet deep without striking water, arousing fears of death from thirst.
Sanitation, moderately efficient since the 1740's, had broken down by the first summer of occupation. A newly arrived Englishman believed a "treatise upon stinks" could be written about New York; a 1780 proclamation ordered all garbage dumped into Beekman's Swamp, an unhappy prospect.
Maintenance of the public wells and pumps fell to an ad hoc vestry. As civic order was breaking down just before the Revolution, control of well and pump overseer appointments had passed from the Common Council to the city's secular, elected vestrymen, whose primary responsibility since the 1740's had been ministering to the poor, collecting and distributing the poor tax, and overseeing the almshouse. This ward-based vestry disappeared under occupation, replaced by a group of loyalist citizens appointed by the British commandant of New York. The occupation vestry eventually took over the duties of the elected vestry, as well as most of the functions of the disbanded Common Council. Without tax collection, the appointed vestry did what it could about the poor, the pumps, sanitation, and other government duties by collecting donations, exorbitant rent on abandoned houses, criminal fines, and tavern license fees. This was no easy task; by the end of the war in 1783, the occupied town was bloated with some 30,000 people, most of them impoverished loyalist refugees.
 
NEW YORK, CHICAGO, LOS ANGELES: America's Global Cities
By Janet L. Abu-Lughod

(Hardcover, $39.95)
By the early twentieth century, it had become absolutely impossible to extend New York City's boundaries. This meant that its legal jurisdiction fell increasingly short of its metropolitan extent. Coordinated developments became more difficult, and different mechanisms, outside existing political structures, had to be invented. It was then that special districts and "authorities" were institutionalized to supplement and even substitute for municipal rule, and informal "regional" plans were advocated to guide a metropolitan expansion that could no longer be encompassed by city government. Because of New York's unique constellation of waterways, ports, and "inconvenient" state boundaries, this required inventiveness of the highest order.
Paralleling the process of horizontal expansion was a shirt upward in the vertical scale, and here, too, the "role of the state" was central. True skyscrapers came to dominate the skyline of lower Manhattan, as steel-frame structures and elevators became the taken-for-granted cliches of new construction. Zoning, first experimented with in New York City in 1916, was adopted as a planning mechanism for controlling densities and land uses in the city. It also had a forming effect on the skyline of Manhattan.

Asian 'It' Girls Say So Long to the Dragon Lady

BYLINE: By JENNIFER TUNG 

 BODY:
IN the Old Navy commercials shown during the Academy Awards in March, a new spokeswoman was promoting the cheap, cheerful clothing line: Lisa Ling, 26, co-host of "The View" on ABC. Ms. Ling, wearing red capris and a white T-shirt, said cheekily, "A good pair of shorts is hard to find, unless you know where to look." Behind her, a group of hunky young men sprinted by in cargo shorts.
I was amazed. Not at the sexual innuendo but at the sight of a young Chinese-American woman representing an enormous clothing company, on national television, on Oscar night -- the ultimate convergence of celebrity, glamour and fashion. Suddenly, Ms. Ling, with her crisp looks and newscaster-like delivery, was a style icon. 
 That might not sound like a big deal today, but I remember seeing a very different Ling (played by Tsai Chin) on television as a kid in the 1970's. My sisters and I were in our family room watching a rerun of the 1967 James Bond movie, "You Only Live Twice." One of the first scenes takes place in Hong Kong, or more precisely, in a bed in Hong Kong, where Agent 007 kisses a long-haired Chinese woman with blunt bangs.
"Why is it that Chinese girls taste different from all other girls?" he asks her.
"You think Chinese girls bet-tuh, huh?" she replies.
"Not better, just different -- the way Peking duck is different from Russian caviar, but I love them both," Bond says.
"Dah-ling, I give you very best duck," Ling says.
Then she jumps out of bed right before two men with machine guns burst in and try to riddle Bond with bullets.
Bond's Ling was the amalgam of almost every Chinese female stereotype: a submissive sex nymph speaking in breathy, broken English, and a calculating dragon lady. (If she'd leapt out of bed and into a lab coat and thick glasses, the cliche would have been complete.) She is also the only representation of Asian women in film or television that I remember from my childhood -- aside from the "ancient Chinese secret" laundry lady in the Calgon commercials. At the time, I didn't know enough to be angry or offended. I was just embarrassed.
But lately there has been an Asian population explosion in the pop culture landscape. In Hollywood, there's a new kind of A-list that includes Asian It Girls like Ming-Wa, Bai Ling, Michelle Yeoh and Lucy Liu. Beaming from a billboard in Times Square is CoCo Lee, the Hong Kong-born, San Francisco-reared singer whose first United States album, "Just No Other Way," was released two months ago.
There has also been an Asian style invasion: Vera Wang, the fashion designer, on the cover of Town & Country this winter, Ahn Duong, the artist, on the cover of Banana Republic's new catalog just last week. Fashion models like Devon Aoki and Ling are fixtures on the runways. Asian faces are even infiltrating society pages. The actress China Chow and the Visionaire editor Cecilia Dean are downtown scenesters who appear regularly in Vogue's party pictures. W magazine's May issue alone features a profile of Wendy Deng discussing the Asia Society and marriage to Rupert Murdoch, a story about Hong Kong-born Grace Leo Andrieu, owner of the celebrity-studded Hotel Lancaster in London, as well as a 12-page swimsuit portfolio starring Ms. Aoki.
But if Asian women are busting out of the China doll stereotypes, their new image does tend to borrow some of the old cliches. They may no longer be mousy math whizzes, but they're still brainy. Clawed dragon ladies might be out, but style queens with sharp tongues and sharp wardrobes are very in. "We're never portrayed as bimbos," said the Malaysian-born designer Yeohlee. "It's because of our flat chests."
That does not mean they aren't physical. On screen, Asian women often combine sexiness and action heroism with unusual ease, like Michelle Yeoh, the actress whose long, glossy hair flies as she leaps tall buildings in the Jackie Chan movies. Lucy Liu, the acerbic Ling Woo on "Ally McBeal," will be a kickboxing cop in the film version of "Charlie's Angels" in November alongside Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz. (It's somehow harder to imagine the neurotic Calista Flockhart chasing bad guys with a gun.)
Despite such new, cool roles, the effort to create a hip identity that can include Asian-ness rather than try to hide it is still pretty new and often self-conscious. When I met Lisa Ling at an event for Nutrisse home hair-coloring products two months ago, she said: "What I try to convey to other Asians with my sense of style is that we can defy the stereotypes that we are submissive and not gregarious. We don't have to conform. I can be obnoxious and blunt." As if to prove her point, Ms. Ling added, "So many Asians are label whores. Have you noticed that?"
But even Ms. Ling's bravado set in only a few years ago. "I hated being Chinese as a kid!" recalled Ms. Ling, who was born in California. "I was teased mercilessly. I went to public school, and the kids called me 'Risa Ring.' Kids would come over to my house, and it would smell like Chinese food, and that was embarrassing. Or if I had friends over, my dad would say, 'Tell them to go home' in Chinese, right in front of them."
I nodded vigorously in agreement, remembering the time a classmate of my younger sister's came over after school, smelled rice cooking and asked if we had pet gerbils. My sister explained the odor by saying that our heating system was broken.
It wasn't always clear, growing up in Albuquerque, how to bridge the divide between my Chinese heritage and my desire to fit in with the tall, tanned set at the tennis club. My parents, a scientist and a classical pianist, spoke Cantonese to each other, and to us, when we were small. In our house, high style was my grandmother wearing a cheongsam and singing Chinese opera as we kids padded around the house in our embroidered Chinese pajamas with frog buttons.
But away from home, being Asian could be nerve-racking. My white and Hispanic classmates flattened their noses with their fingers to mock my wide features. When we had to line up by height, I was always shortest and last. My beauty ideals were the blond models in Seventeen and in the ads for Ocean Pacific, the Southern California clothing company. When Madonna hit the charts, I wore crucifixes, black lace gloves and rubber bracelets up to my elbows. My New Wave phase followed: head shaved on the sides, dyed orange hair forced skyward with gel and diluted glue.
If only I had had a role model like Margaret Yang, the quirky high school girl in last year's film "Rushmore" who played rock guitar, acted in avant-garde school plays and got the boy in the end. Why the sudden embrace of Asian women and culture?
The designer Vivienne Tam, who was raised in Hong Kong (and whose style guide "China Chic" will be published in September by ReganBooks), links it to the new global economy and the opening up of Asia. "When Hong Kong went back to China in 1997, I think there was more awareness around the world of Asian culture," she said on the phone from her Seventh Avenue office. "And then Prada and Miu Miu started the whole chinoiserie trend."
Phoebe Eng, the author of "Warrior Lessons: An Asian American Woman's Journey Into Power" (Pocket Books), said it's not the rest of the world but Asian women themselves who have changed. "We are the crop of daughters who finally had choices," Ms. Eng, 37, said. "We didn't have the same sense of duty and boundness of our mothers, so we took our own paths and went into acting, comedy and entertainment. The number of Asian women entering F.I.T. and Parsons is amazing."
Ms. Eng also pointed out that Asians are not only fashion forward, but also have an ethnicity that is integral to their style. "You see lots of 15-year-olds wearing Hello Kitty and chinoiserie," she said. "And older Asian women have an androgynous look, and that is what makes the look sensuous. We used to think of Asian models as chiseled and Eurasian-looking. Now, some have very small eyes, and others have square jaws. Anything goes."
It didn't occur to me that my ethnic looks could be a style advantage when I took my first job after college, as an editorial assistant at a beauty magazine. Once again I was surrounded by lithe blondes, now with expensive haircuts and dressed in black. But it turned out to be a propitious time. One of my first writing assignments was a story about "universal beauty" and featured Irina Pantaeva, a Siberian model with northern Chinese features. Doling out advice on how to beautify the flat lids and sparse lashes of an Asian eye, I began to feel more in control of my looks and less concerned about fitting in.
Then something unexpected happened. I found myself part of an Asian style clique, a bunch of trend-happy editors and writers who introduced me not only to sample sales, but also to the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown. We often meet there after work, shove our Lambertson Truex totes under our chairs and order (mostly in Mandarin) greasy noodles and "lion's head," giant, gelatinous meatballs drenched in brown sauce and surrounded by a mane of greens, which we share, pecking at the communal platters with our chopsticks. In between bites of noodles and media gossip, I can rant freely about my family and my boyfriend, then gloat over the three $25 string bikinis I just bought from Old Navy, the store Lisa Ling represents on television.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD;
Jordan's Long Road To the Free-Trade Club

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan

 BODY:
MOHAMMED A. HALAIQAH'S trip to Seattle last November was to have been the culmination of his career. As Jordan's most experienced trade negotiator, he had spent five years arduously preparing for his country's entry into the World Trade Organization.
After a thorough and painful overhaul of its tariffs and investment rules, putting domestic industries like pharmaceuticals at risk, Jordan was finally poised to become the W.T.O.'s next full member. As the only country scheduled to join the group at its Seattle summit meeting, it hoped to attract worldwide publicity -- and American investment in the high-technology industries it sees as the key to its future. 
 It wasn't to be. Mr. Halaiqah (pronounced ha-LYE-kah) was stunned to find himself trapped in a hotel lobby as the police fought protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets.
"We were expecting something, but we didn't expect it to be so fierce," he said. "We were literally besieged in the hotel."
The chaos outside and policy clashes inside the meeting forced Jordan off the suddenly truncated Seattle agenda.
"Waiting for that big moment, we felt that Jordan was the victim of the contradictory interests of these different groups," said Mr. Halaiqah, now Jordan's minister of industry and trade.
Last month, at its Geneva headquarters, the W.T.O. ratified Jordan's entry, making it the 136th member and just the seventh Arab state to join. While Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and several North African nations are members, many Jordanian trading partners, including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Kuwait, are not.
Jordan won some important concessions: Agricultural subsidies can be maintained at their current high level for a 10-year transition period, and majority ownership of retailers is still reserved for local investors.
But most barriers to foreign investments and products must be phased out, exposing many Jordanian companies to international competition for the first time. For an economy that still depends on potash, used in fertilizer and chemicals, from the Dead Sea for the bulk of its export income, exploiting the opportunities of W.T.O. membership will be a challenge.
W.T.O. membership was granted almost a year after Jordan's new king, Abdullah II, summoned Mr. Halaiqah for a briefing on the effort to join the W.T.O. King Hussein, Abdullah's father, had died two months earlier, and the new monarch was determined to make economic growth his focus.
The king was convinced that Jordan needed to open up quickly. Per capita income had been declining. The Persian Gulf war in 1991 disrupted the flow of money sent home by Jordanians living and working in the gulf states, and sanctions against Iraq -- Jordan's biggest trading partner -- reduced trade to a trickle.
As the king saw it, Jordan's only alternative -- a quick foreign capital influx from privatization sales and high-technology industrial development -- would require strict adherence to international trade rules.
Mr. Halaiqah told King Abdullah during their April 1999 meeting that after more than four years of talks, Jordan was still far from complying with W.T.O. demands. After the Seattle assembly, he warned, the organization would begin a new round of global trade liberalization, raising membership hurdles higher.
Another reason to move quickly: "There was a lot of sympathy for Jordan after the death of His Majesty King Hussein, and I thought that we should take advantage of that," Mr. Halaiqah said.
So King Abdullah gave Mr. Halaiqah an ambitious order: Get Jordan into the W.T.O. in time for Seattle. For his part, the young king promised to ram a set of new trade and investment laws through the balky legislature. They had only six months.
As Jordanian officials concede, it would have been hard to find a country that was a less likely candidate for such a rapid turnaround. Fuzzy law and lax enforcement had made Jordan a capital of counterfeiting and patent piracy. Software, books, videos, cassette tapes -- all were produced and sold without copyright permission or royalty payments, often for export to neighbors. Media and computer industry lobbies in Washington and Brussels put Jordan near the top of their lists of intellectual property violators. Governments friendly to Jordan warned that without drastic changes, W.T.O. entry would not even be considered.
Most problematic were prescription drugs. By estimates of Jordan's own pharmaceutical industry, at least 15 percent of its patented drug output was manufactured without the patent holders' consent. Foreign analysts said the proportion was far higher. American drug companies calculated that Jordanian piracy cost them $25 million to $50 million a year.
"The pharmaceutical companies here were living in cuckoo-land, thinking that you could keep on stealing and stay in business," said Bassem I. Awadallah, the chief economic adviser to King Abdullah.
BUT with more than 4,000 employees and $140 million in export sales, the drug companies were one of this small economy's few growing sources of skilled jobs and foreign currency. Mazen S. Darwazah, the president of the Jordanian Association of Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers, says few of these companies are prepared to compete under W.T.O. rules, which make patent infringement grounds for costly trade sanctions. "Half of them will close down, and the families of 2,000 breadwinners will be out on the street," he predicted.
Yet as Mr. Darwazah acknowledged, his own company, Hikma Pharmaceuticals, is a potential model. Specializing in generic drugs on which the patents have expired, and with modern production facilities, Hikma exports to 30 countries from plants in sites including Eatontown, N.J.
"We have recognized that in order for us to survive, we need a niche," he said. "The world is run by the big corporations, whether we like it or not."
But few companies have the capital or technological sophistication to manage this transition, he said. And many Jordanians cannot afford imported medicines. "If we make Jordan a safe haven for intellectual property rights, we know that health care prices will rise dramatically," Mr. Darwazah said.
A few months ago, Jordan became one of the few Middle Eastern nations to be removed from the United States Commerce Department's watch lists of intellectual property violators. Its new patent protections are lauded by former critics in the computer and pharmaceutical industries. In March, dozens of American executives traveled to a Dead Sea resort to hear King Abdullah itemize incentives for software and telecommunications investors. Jordan offers high-technology companies a significant but underemployed pool of English-speaking engineers and technicians.
With W.T.O. membership in hand, Jordan is now negotiating free-trade pacts with Europe, having already reached agreements with other Arab states. Jordan's main goal now is a free-trade deal with the United States, an advantage already enjoyed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
Jordanian officials know from their Seattle experience that any free-trade proposal will meet resistance. Mr. Halaiqah is still irked by the contentions of American demonstrators that they were defending poor countries like his against the predations of the global trading system -- a system Jordan had labored to join.
"I understand the fears of environmentalists, of labor, but they should do their homework," he said. "No country has benefited more from international trade than the United States. These people cannot speak on behalf of the world, and certainly not on behalf of developing countries."

Lighting Up A Lesson In China Trade

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
WANDERING through a flea market in Shanghai earlier this year with Craig Smith, The Times's new correspondent there, I stopped at a stall that was selling cheap cigarette lighters with pictures of Mao Zedong pasted on them. Flick one open, and it plays the tune of "The East Is Red." I don't smoke, but I couldn't resist buying a handful.
Not far away, another merchant offered hundreds of hand-painted posters from the days of the Cultural Revolution. I bought one dated 1976, showing a smiling Mao leading a parade of workers and students into the promised land. We bargained a bit before settling on a price of about $5. 
 Say what you will about capitalism, but you must admit it has a marvelous way of turning even the most violent and earthshaking upheavals into safe, salable kitsch.
And that, above all, is why it is worth continuing to encourage Beijing to move along the path toward freer markets, private investment and open trade. Karl Marx (remember him?) said it as well as anybody in, of all places, the Communist Manifesto:
"The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all nations, even the most barbarian, into civilization. The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate."
What does this have to do with today's debate over China? Plenty.
The choice facing Congress this week over granting China what is called "permanent normal trade relations" -- part of a deal to admit China to the World Trade Organization -- turns on conflicting views of how to best induce change in China's authoritarian regime.
On one side -- opposed to normalizing trade -- are those who argue that Congress should vote every year on China's trade status, thus maintaining outside pressure on Beijing to respond to complaints of human rights abuses. The annual vote should not be given up, they say, because it is Washington's only stick for persuading China to ease repression and to free dissidents. Treating China as a normal trading partner, they say, will just entrench the current regime and encourage its belligerence.
Opposing that view are those who believe that change inside China can exert greater leverage for reform than any diplomatic pressure. Through broader trade and contact with the outside world, the Chinese people will be exposed to the full range of Western life, from the sublime to the ridiculous. In the end, the temptation will prove irresistible. Treat China as a normal country, this side argues, and it will eventually turn into one.
"Openness is a two-way street," Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said last week in a telephone interview from Beijing. "Already there are thousands of foreigners living in China and interacting on a daily basis across a very broad spectrum. That will only grow as China joins the W.T.O. At the same time, tens of thousands of the most promising Chinese have gone to the West as students. They've come back -- often to very high positions in government, banking and business -- changed for good."
I VISITED China for the first time this year. But even without an earlier point of reference, it was clear that though the economy remains very basic, the country has changed immensely in the last two decades.
As recently as the early 1980's, nearly everybody in Shanghai, the most Westernized city in China, still wore the famous blue Mao suits. Only top officials had cars; everyone else pedaled bicycles or rode buses. Lights were dim. Public restaurants and private enterprises barely existed. Architecture seemed frozen in a pre-World War II time warp. Today, everything is different: jeans and khakis are ubiquitous; cars and taxis compete with bikes on crowded streets; glass-sheathed skyscrapers abound; Shanghai throbs with activity day and night.
"We tend to forget," Mr. Lardy said, "how much change has already occurred."
As private enterprise spreads and markets open to real competition from domestic and foreign companies alike, tens of millions of Chinese are shedding their dependence on the state. They are richer and freer. It's not democracy, but it is the first step toward a genuinely pluralistic society.
And that is just the beginning.
"China now feels competitive heat across continents and oceans," Robert Wright wrote in a recent issue of The New Republic. "It must face the same logic the rest of the world faces. In the age of the Internet, even more than in the age of industry and print, granting enough liberty for cutting-edge prosperity while denying political liberty is a tall order."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Neil Barsky and Scott Sipprelle;
MRG Nucleus Fund

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
IT would have been easy for Neil Barsky and Scott Sipprelle to just join the crowd three months ago.
The two men run a $120 million hedge fund, the MRG Nucleus fund, from a modest office suite in Midtown Manhattan. They opened MRG Nucleus in July 1998, a few months after striking out from Morgan Stanley, where Mr. Barsky was a well-regarded casino industry analyst and Mr. Sipprelle a top investment banker. By February, 19 months into the fund's life, they found themselves stuck in the middle of the pack in the hotly competitive hedge fund business. 
 Hedge funds try to produce above-average investment returns using tactics ranging from traditional stock-picking to complex derivative and arbitrage plays. High minimum investments, redemption restrictions and aggressive strategies make them suitable mainly for more sophisticated and well-heeled investors.
MRG concentrates on overlooked and undervalued newly public companies, chosen eclectically without a particular sector bias. By ordinary standards, its returns have been solid -- 63.5 percent from inception through February, a 19-month stretch.
But over the same period, the Nasdaq composite index rose 151 percent. And many hedge funds posted even stronger returns with the help of aggressive leverage and heavy bets on technology -- techniques that Mr. Barsky and Mr. Sipprelle avoided. MRG fell further behind the index in February, when the Nasdaq rose a scorching 19.2 pecent, triple MRG's gain.
To be sure, with a return of 42 percent in 1999, MRG was not exactly facing a wave of redemptions from investors angry at missing the technology runup. Still, "it's always difficult in the investment business to underperform," Mr. Sipprelle said.
So when the two managers sat down to draft their monthly letter to investors after the February results came in, they felt compelled to explain: "We are not Luddites. We are huge believers in the power of technology to accelerate the efficiency of commerce, the productivity of workers."
What they did not believe in, they warned, was the market for technology stocks, which they concluded had gone seriously haywire.
"We have not drunk from the Kool-Aid that has mesmerized the market into thinking that 'growth at any price' is a sound investment strategy," they wrote. "We are underweight technology today, and expect to remain so as long as valuations stay at current levels. We think the stock market is in the midst of a dangerous game of 'chicken' with tech stocks. We suspect it will end badly; we don't know when."
They also spelled out a series of specific concerns, including accelerating price declines in software and hardware, and the explosion in initial public offerings.
"If there is one verity of the I.P.O. market that has proved itself over the years," they wrote, "it is that when capital becomes too available, a hot sector ends up gorging itself, overinvesting, and ultimately lowering returns for the entire industry."
Eleven weeks later, they look smart. The Nasdaq has fallen almost a third from its early March high, but MRG is up 15 percent since then. Mr. Barsky and Mr. Sipprelle say they try not to gloat, but they acknowledge feeling pretty good. "If you're building a long-term business, you have to weigh the easy money against the responsibility you have not to take outsize risk," Mr. Barsky said.
WHAT is MRG bullish on now? The fund is still staying away from high-growth technology stocks, which mostly remain expensive by traditional valuation measures even after their tumble over the last two months. Instead, the managers prefer small-capitalization companies that offer relatively strong growth on the cheap.
Consider Argosy Gaming, which runs midsize riverboat casinos and hotels across the Midwest and South. Drawing on his years as an analyst, Mr. Barsky keeps a close eye on the casino industry, which fell into a painful slump from 1996 to late 1998 before turning around last year. He expects the gains to continue, at least for smaller operators like Argosy.
Several macroeconomic trends are combining to invigorate the industry, Mr. Barsky said. The long economic boom has given adults more disposable income for gambling. It has also put local government finances into surplus, making states where gambling remains illegal less inclined to legalize it. With capacity constrained and demand rising, companies that do have licenses are seeing profits rise.
In addition, many states where Argosy has boats have recently relaxed regulations on their operation, allowing the company to cut costs and increase profits. Illinois, for example, dropped a rule that boats must actually cruise the rivers on which they float, rather than remain permanently docked.
Factoring out a one-time charge related to a debt financing, Argosy's net income soared from $5.7 million, or 23 cents a share, in 1998 to $41.7 million, or $1.44 a share, in 1999. Revenues grew from $507 million to $595 million.
Analysts expect continued growth this year and are now forecasting earnings of $1.73 a share, an estimate that has been rising recently. Yet Argosy closed on Friday at $16.50, less than 10 times expected 2000 earnings and barely five times the company's cash flow.
Argosy "is so cheap it's not even funny," said Mr. Barsky, who called the multiples "inexplicably low."
AT these prices, Argosy could be takeover bait for larger casino operators like MGM Grand or the Mandalay Resort Group, which now focus mainly on the Las Vegas Strip. The spread of Native American-owned casinos in California threatens companies with big investments in Las Vegas, making them "feel some need to diversify," Mr. Barsky said.
He thinks Argosy, which has accumulated a large database of gambler-customers and is among the strongest of the midsize riverboat operators, makes an inviting target.

For Bank C.D.'s, a Return to Fashion

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
TEMPTING, tempting . . . .
It has been a long time since the prospect of putting cash in the bank held any attraction for most people. Interest rates were paltry, and the eager money forsook income investments to chase capital gains in the stock market. That drove prices so high that the average dividend paid by companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 is now barely 1 percent. 
 But the Federal Reserve's drive to head off any surge in inflation is returning the luster to the word "yield" -- on bonds, of course, but also on such prosaic and convenient products as certificates of deposit and money market funds, especially for consumers willing to shop a little.
And, surprisingly, a bit of negotiating -- even a ploy as simple as inquiring whether your bank might be willing to improve on the rate posted in the window -- can also pay off.
"If you've got more than $50,000 or so, you can always get 25 to 50 basis points more, often by just asking," said Warren Heller, research director at Veribanc, which analyzes banking trends. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Not surprisingly, banks do not advertise or even acknowledge that this goes on, but some customers of major banks have found otherwise.
For many of the most succulent rates, the place to look is the Internet -- both the electronic offshoots of traditional banks and the stand-alone cyberbanks like Wingspanbank.com, E-Trade Group's Telebank, X.Com and USAccess Internet Bank.
A survey of online banking published last Wednesday by Consumer Action, an advocacy group in California, found "much better interest rates, not only on savings accounts but on checking and money market accounts and certificates of deposit," than were found elsewhere.
Their examination of 19 virtual banks, all federally insured, and 10 traditional ones showed, for example, that online operations paid about a half-point more interest on six-month C.D.'s, and that 4 of the 19 required smaller minimum deposits than any of the ordinary banks.
As promotion-minded as many a dot-com, Wingspanbank is temporarily offering an eye-popping 10 percent interest rate on checking accounts that Kevin Watters, its senior vice president for marketing, called "probably the highest in the country." The rate applies to amounts from $100 to $10,000 and runs until Sept. 1; after that. the accounts will pay 3.10 percent for deposits of at least $2,500 and 4.50 percent for $10,000 and up.
"We can pay such high rates because we don't have the physical infrastructure that brick-and-mortar banks have," Mr. Watters said, adding that Wingspanbank's computer system, built from scratch, avoided the technical incompatibility problems that traditional competitors face after numerous mergers.
ON 12-month certificates of deposit, Wingspanbank immediately echoed last week's half-point increase by the Federal Reserve for overnight money, bringing its rate to 7 percent. The average bank in the country offered 5.47 percent on 12-month C.D.'s after the Fed move, up from 5.42 percent the previous week, according to Bank Rate Monitor.
Wingspanbank, owned by Bank One, is based in Wilmington, Del., but you may not have to look beyond your hometown institutions for newly enticing deposit rates.
Citibank in New York, for example, has a cyberspace facility that it calls Citi f/i (for financial interactive). A visit to citifi.com, its Web site, found its insured money market account paying a 5.50 percent rate, for an annual yield of 5.65 percent, with a $1,000 minimum. As is common with Internet banks, Citi f/i reimburses any A.T.M. fees charged to its depositors by other institutions for withdrawals from its accounts.
Citi's online rates are well above the 4.59 percent rate (4.70 percent annual yield) offered at Citibank branches on "preferred" money market accounts, which require deposits or loans totaling at least $50,000 in a customer's accounts. Customers with $25,000 to $49,999 in their accounts get a 3 percent rate, yielding 3.05 percent annually.
The difference reflects "lower infrastructure costs," said Maria Mendler, a Citibank spokeswoman.
Textbook economics, however, holds that prices are made by supply and demand, not costs, leading analysts to suggest that Internet banks' rates are high because they are little known and because consumers hesitate over the idea of a bank they cannot visit.
"If something goes wrong with a transaction, it's not like just driving down to the branch and taking it up with the manager," said Mr. Heller of Veribanc, noting that credit unions often combine very close proximity with high rates.
And local banks sometimes bid so aggressively for money that there is no need to send it away to get a higher rate, he said. "Sometimes there's a pleasant surprise."

Workers vs. Workers

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
In the 1920's, South Africa's Communist Party campaigned under the slogan "Workers of the world unite for a white South Africa!" This wasn't quite as incongruous as it sounds: the political movement that eventually imposed apartheid had strong populist, even socialist roots. It was sincerely concerned with improving the economic status of the Afrikaner worker, and protecting him from the depredations of international capital. Unfortunately, the movement improved the lot of white labor mainly by preventing capitalists from offering industrial jobs to nonwhites, whose intense poverty made them willing to work for less.
The U.S. labor movement is not as brutally direct in its slogans. Probably its leaders don't even admit to themselves that their increasingly vociferous opposition to imports is, in effect, an effort to improve the condition of American workers by denying opportunity to workers in the rest of the world. But when the Teamsters' president, James P. Hoffa, declares, as he did on this page not long ago, that "American workers should not be asked to compete with foreigners who are not paid a living wage," the implications are clear. Given the low productivity of workers in third-world countries, their nations' lack of infrastructure and general lag in development, to insist that such workers be paid what Americans would regard as a living wage is to insist that they price themselves out of their jobs. And that is no accident: any policy that didn't price those workers out of the market would offer no relief to workers here. 
 There is a sort of tragic inevitability about the way labor has reached this moral impasse. The U.S. labor movement has every right to feel that American workers have gotten a raw deal. By standard measures, the real take-home pay of blue-collar workers is lower now than it was a quarter-century ago. You can quibble with the statistics, but without question blue-collar workers have been largely left behind by the nation's economic growth. And far from fighting this inequality in rewards, policy has in general reinforced it: taxes have become less rather than more progressive, public schools for those who can't afford to live in the right places have gotten worse, and so on.
A well-meaning economist can give you a list of things that might help America's working class: some form of national health insurance, bigger and better wage supplements along the lines of the earned-income tax credit, etc., etc. But if I were a labor leader, I would sneer at my professorial naivete. You know and I know that such proposals are pipe dreams, that in America today the left, such as it is, has its hands full holding back efforts to tilt the tax-and-benefit system even more toward the interests of the affluent. And the labor movement -- whose influence is far less today than it was even 20 years ago -- is in no position to reverse the political tide.
So what's a labor leader to do? Choose a fight that he might be able to win: a fight to limit imports that compete with the workers he represents. Voters might not see protection as a direct threat to their pocketbooks (though it is). The payoff may be limited -- the arithmetic suggests that even a total ban on manufactured imports from third-world countries would raise blue-collar wages no more than 3 or 4 percent -- but who's counting? And if the target is unattractive enough -- if it is, say, a nasty regime in China -- labor's limited but not negligible lobbying power just might pull off a victory.
In other words, it's understandable that labor has decided that it must try to help American workers by denying opportunity to even needier workers abroad -- while, of course, denying that it is doing any such thing. If I were a labor leader I would probably be a protectionist too. But to understand this political strategy, even to accept its inevitability, is not to approve.
Those who would like easy moral certainties -- which means all of us -- wish that it were simpler, that corporate greed were the only enemy, that people like Mr. Hoffa were standing up for the rights of workers everywhere. It's hard for liberals to admit that the U.S. labor movement, with its noble tradition, is now working against the interests of most of the world's poor. But it is.

HEADLINE: Detroit Journal;
Mexican Immigrants Lead a Revival

BYLINE: By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 20

 BODY:
When he was a boy growing up in west-central Mexico, Jesus Lopez and his brothers would load agave leaves onto the backs of donkeys and haul them to factories to be converted into tequila. Along the way, he would dream of living in a place with electricity and abundant water.
But the dream never included Detroit. Mr. Lopez had not even heard of it until the day that his brothers and many in Jesus Maria, his hometown, packed their bags and headed to America's Motor City. When an 18-year-old Jesus Lopez arrived here, he said recently, he was convinced that those who had come before him were crazy. 
 "In those days, over here there was only burned-out houses," he recalled. "Who would want to live here? It was not good."
But today, 18 years later, the view is much different in southwest Detroit, where many of this city's immigrants from Mexico live. So much has changed that it is being hailed as the nation's new Mexican boomtown.
Scorched shells of houses are being bought and resurrected by scores of skilled Mexican tradesmen. They have snapped up dozens of the old Victorians and duplexes for as little as $20,000, and they have nearly doubled the population to 90,000.
Their impact is undeniable. The three local Roman Catholic parishes have each added two weekend Masses in Spanish to accommodate the wave of new arrivals, who started showing up here six years ago, most directly from Mexico. They say they came to escape rising costs and growing hostilities against immigrants in Arizona, California and Chicago, and to reunite with older relatives who had been cashing in on Detroit's labor shortage for more than a decade.
West Vernor Avenue, the main strip here, is lined with evidence: Mexican bakeries, paleta (Popsicle) shops, taquerias, tortilla factories, Mexican grocery stores. Since 1994, about 35 businesses have opened and dozens have expanded, business groups said. An $8 million mercado and welcome center will be built next year. Amid the abundance of Spanish signs, it is easy to overlook the golden arches of McDonald's.
"Nobody over here saw the opportunity we did," said Mr. Lopez, who left a 10-year construction career five months ago to open his own taqueria. "Where we come from, you work all your life to have a house, a business, and you still don't get nowhere. That's why we work hard to make this good for us."
The Rev. Donald Hanchon of Most Holy Redeemer Catholic Church said: "These are people who are determined to be an asset. You see it in the churches, where they're helping with children and services. They genuinely want to make this a better place."
Father Hanchon said he believed that the renovation of run-down houses here was forcing drug dealers to find new dens.
Like Mr. Lopez, the majority of the families settling here come from villages in Jalisco, the Mexican state renowned for producing tequila, mariachi music and rancheros, Mexican cowboys. More than 40,000 of the people who live in southwest Detroit are either from Jalisco or have relatives there, said Maria Elena Rodriguez, who is a Detroit native and president of the Mexicantown Community Development Corporation.
Some of the businesses are named to honor Jalisco and its towns, like Arandas, Jesus Maria and San Ignacio. The connection is so strong that caravans of adults and children load up their cars each January and return to the towns to celebrate las fiestas patronales, a 10-day festival held in honor of patron saints.
"We go back, so they know we are proud to be from Mexico, from Jalisco," said Guadalupe Guzman, 70, who moved here to work in the steel factories in 1950. He and his family return to Jesus Maria every year.
It took two decades for 32-year-old Jose Zamudio to believe the stories that his brothers and sisters told about the untapped opportunities in Detroit. Even after five of them came here from San Ignacio, bought homes and found steady jobs, Mr. Zamudio refused to follow.
"It was too ugly," he said. Mr. Zamudio and his wife, Anna, chose instead to go to Oakland, Calif. But after four years of working for $10 an hour and living in cramped apartments, they gave up and moved back to Mexico. They built a home and had three children.
Then two years ago, when the whole family had obtained visas, they decided to give the United States another try, in Chicago this time. They stayed three months. The pressure of having five people in a $600-a-month one-room apartment was too much. Now they are gambling on Detroit.
So far, their gamble has paid off. Mr. Zamudio is earning $18 an hour as a bricklayer for a construction company. Six months ago, he and his wife bought a three-bedroom duplex for $40,000. But what thrills Mr. Zamudio most is seeing how much his family -- 5 brothers and sisters and 19 nieces and nephews -- and others from back home have done to help rebuild southwest Detroit.
"Look at it, it's like little Jalisco," he said. "We never knew people of our towns building this kind of business. They show if you fight and fight, you reach your dreams."

HEADLINE: Labor and the China Vote

 BODY:
John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., is doing his country and the labor movement a disservice by fighting so hard against permanently establishing normal trade relations with China. Of all the groups lobbying on this issue, none has made a greater historic blunder than organized labor. By bludgeoning Richard Gephardt and the Democrats into sticking with labor on the issue, which the House is set to vote on this week, Mr. Sweeney is squandering much of the good will he has built up in recent years and damaging the interests of American workers. House Democrats should back the bill, which deserves bipartisan support.
President Clinton has had trouble finding a sure footing in his approach on China. He began in 1993 by making tough demands on human rights and now too often looks the other way on these issues. But the administration has reached a formula that is basically sound. Human rights are served, not hindered, by opening China to more foreign goods, particularly in telecommunications and technology, which are bound to bring more information from abroad to the Chinese people. China's membership in the World Trade Organization will allow more scrutiny of its treatment of workers, its record of piracy and even its treatment of the environment. 
 Since the late 19th century, the Democratic Party has stood for workers' interests, and it interpreted their interests as being served by free trade. It used to be that big American corporations favored high tariff barriers to protect themselves against cheaper foreign goods, but Democrats saw that workers are served not by insulating their employers from competition, but by food, clothing and other necessities sold here at low prices.
The bill before Congress does not open the United States to more Chinese products. Rather, it opens China to more American goods and investment, and imposes a mechanism that can be used to challenge unfair Chinese practices. Labor fears that more investment abroad will lead to less investment at home, and fewer jobs. But if American technology and manufacturing companies are not allowed to compete in China with other foreign investors, they will be less able to serve as healthy employers in the United States. Some American workers will doubtless be hurt by foreign competition. But the solution is to help these workers, not to try to block the forces of economic globalization that are benefiting the country.
Mr. Sweeney's reasons for taking on this issue may have more to do with his own political interests than those of workers at large. He won his election with the support of the Teamsters union and is now listening to the Teamsters on this issue. Other unions within the labor coalition are less enthusiastic about the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s wrongheaded stance. Many Democrats in Congress are angry that organized labor has also opposed lowering trade barriers for Africa and the Caribbean, where some of the most miserably paid workers in the world would benefit. Organized labor claims it is now standing up for Chinese workers by opposing the trade bill. But workers in the developing world know that trade is one of their only avenues of hope.
The trade bill could be Mr. Clinton's last tough legislative battle as president. His commendable willingness to stand up to labor and most members of his own party on trade belies his reputation as subservient to his party's core constituencies. On the other side of the aisle, Gov. George W. Bush has shown leadership in repudiating the isolationists in his own party. Organized labor's decision to turn this into a make-or-break test of loyalty for its supporters has been shortsighted and destructive.

HEADLINE: Mr. Pataki's Nassau Travails

 BODY:
Nassau County on Long Island is one of the nation's wealthiest counties -- and also one of its most poorly governed. Years of irresponsible budget policies have brought it to the edge of bankruptcy. Earlier this month, Gov. George Pataki realized that allowing the county to sink into bankruptcy could damage the whole state's credit rating and undermine his own political standing. His proposal for an infusion of state money and a state financing agency to oversee the county is reminiscent of what Gov. Hugh Carey did for New York City in the 1970's. It was a welcome first step, but Mr. Pataki will have to step in more forcefully to help the county make extremely tough budget decisions in the future.
Like New York City's fiscal crisis of a generation ago, Nassau County's situation has resulted from the elected leaders' habit of piling up debt, rather than forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for their patronage-laden government. The Nassau County Republican organization prospered by handing out generous labor packages and patronage contracts, making it the envy of party leaders, governors and presidents. Last November, realizing that the cost of this system might force service cutbacks and tax increases, Nassau's voters revolted and elected the first Democratic legislature in modern history. Since then, Republicans and Democrats have been squabbling and barely nibbling at the edges of their problem. 
 Mr. Pataki appointed Frank Zarb, chairman of the group that runs Nasdaq, to make an independent review. He concluded that the county will need at least four years of stringent fiscal policies to reduce its budget deficit. Mr. Pataki's proposal of an oversight agency to issue debt and superintend budget savings could be taken up this week in the county legislature and later by the State Legislature in Albany. Democrats are supporting it in order to ensure that the governor bears some of the political heat for administering the bitter medicine. However, the governor, who would dominate the panel with his own appointees, should modify the plan to include participation by State Comptroller Carl McCall, a Democrat. Mr. McCall has been calling for reform in Nassau County for years and has an intimate knowledge of its finances.
Mr. Pataki's proposal would provide $100 million over five years to help the county out of its budget mess and require the county to present a plan to balance its budget in four years. Fiscal experts agree there is no way to achieve that goal without service cutbacks, major sacrifices by unions in the form of layoffs or givebacks on their contracts, a drastic cutback in other contracts that have been the patronage lifeblood of both parties, and very likely a tax increase of some kind, despite Governor Pataki's assertions that no tax increase will be necessary. In the process, the county has to thoroughly revamp its property tax system, which is riddled with unfairness and is costing $100 million each year in tax rebates.
The lesson of bankruptcy crises in New York City, Yonkers and Troy over the years is that tough steps must be negotiated in a spirit of shared sacrifice. Mr. Pataki is right to demand that the squabbling elected leaders in Nassau County try to come up with their own plans. But he may be naive to think they can avoid the need for him to intervene more firmly. New Yorkers throughout the state will understandably bridle at financial aid for such a rich county. But they may be willing to help if they see that the county is willing to change its ways.

How Much Higher Can Interest Rates Go?

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
Wall Street just couldn't shake its interest-rate jitters last week, even though the Federal Reserve did what many had expected when it raised interest rates for the sixth time since last June.
 Investors are uncertain about whether the Fed will continue to increase rates and about the impact tighter credit might have on corporate earnings and stock prices. In raising short-term rates half a percentage point, the Fed indicated that inflation was still a risk because the economy continues to grow steadily. 
 Investors are concerned about how high interest rates are going, said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards & Sons. Is there some level where interest rates could derail the economic recovery?
 Such worries, Mr. Goldman said, slowed trading activity, which accentuated the market's volatility.
 The Nasdaq composite index ended the week at 3,390.40, down about 4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average closed slightly higher, at 10,626.85, up 17.48 points.
 Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations, were among the losers, including Merrill Lynch. VIVIAN MARINO

HEADLINE: Rallying Round the China Bill,Hungrily;
Rallying Round the China Bill, Hungrily

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
WHEN the House of Representatives this week tackles the issue of liberalizing trade ties with China, the voice of American business will be heard loud and clear.
Not since Newt Gingrich tried unsuccessfully in 1995 and 1996 to make liability laws more favorable to corporations have so many types of American companies banded together to lobby for a single issue, according to Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. From agricultural processors to Internet businesses, and from automakers to movie studios, corporate America sees profits in China. 
 In the lobbying effort, the bigger fish are leaning hard on the smaller ones. Companies that sell everything from cleaning supplies to titanium to Boeing -- even hot dogs to its employees -- may not seem like exporters. But with Boeing increasingly reliant on overseas aircraft sales, and convinced that China will become the world's fastest-growing aircraft market, the company has enlisted its parts makers to badger members of Congress.
The effort could be potent, for there is a supplier in nearly every pot. Boeing's 10,000 suppliers are spread across 420 of the nation's 435 Congressional districts -- a distribution that rivals that of even the most politically durable military program -- and Boeing has contacted them all.
"Every one of those suppliers is an exporter and should understand the importance of China, and we think they do," said Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, who has made 10 trips to Washington this year. "You're just running an all-out campaign."
Trying to counter the corporate effort, unions and environmental and other advocacy groups have organized demonstrations, started letter-writing campaigns and sent supporters to Washington by the busload. But American business has responded with its own mobilization, using connections to lawmakers forged over years of nickel-and-dime lobbying.
The pact has wide corporate support because it would require China to lower tariffs, end restrictive business rules and dismantle many other trade barriers. The United States, in turn, would halt its annual Congressional reviews of China's access to the American market. Those reviews have often focused on human rights and have made some American companies leery of long-term investments.
Farmers and equipment makers want lower tariffs on American grain. Insurers, banks and brokerage houses want to eliminate licensing requirements that turn any hope of entry into China into a multiyear marathon of wining and dining government officials.
Automakers want an end to China's requirement that 80 percent of the parts in any car built there be made in China. Retailers are eager to import far more low-priced clothing from China. Hollywood, drug makers and high-technology businesses want improved protections against the illegal copying of movies, medicines and software.
"In terms of government regulation and intervention, we'd like it to be the minimum necessary," said Robert M. Kimmitt, vice chairman and president of Commerce One in Pleasanton, Calif., which has already set up business-to-business Internet exchanges in the United States and is trying to do so in China, too.
The normalization of trade would bring all this and more as China seeks to integrate its economy more closely with the global market by joining the World Trade Organization. Membership in the W.T.O. would require Beijing to comply with extraordinarily detailed free-trade rules, which extend far beyond tariffs and duties to cover most everything from intellectual property rights to the freedom granted to companies to set up their own distribution networks. Proponents say full entry into the world market will make China more prosperous, more open and less prone to abusing human rights.
"We tend to favor free trade and we also think that if we really do want to progress in human rights within China, one of the ways to do that is to actually open up trade," said Jacques Nasser, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company.
American labor leaders and their allies reject the executives' reasoning. The United States, they say, would lose its ability to influence human rights in China, particularly because the bill would eliminate the annual votes in Congress on trade ties -- votes that have sometimes prompted China to ease policies.
Still fuming over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they blame for a loss of jobs to Mexico, union presidents are even more fearful of free trade with the world's largest low-wage country. Stephen Yokich, president of the United Automobile Workers, said Congressional approval would "give American corporations an incentive again to ship jobs, this time to China, which is even cheaper."
But while unions worry about losing jobs, American companies fret about losing markets. "We have the potential of a 100-fold increase in travel per person in a country of 1.2 billion people, and that's a huge market," Mr. Condit said.
The trade deal, he contended, poses a question from China to America: "Is the U.S. a reliable trade partner and can we buy airplanes from Boeing, or is it not a reliable trade partner and do we look to Europe?"
Following are closer looks by reporters for The New York Times at how various industries would be affected by a new China trade agreement.

HEADLINE: Rallying Round the China Bill, Hungrily: Entertainment;
Hollywood Wants A Bigger Box Office

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

 BODY:
The entertainment industry -- especially Hollywood -- has been enthusiastic about easing trade barriers with China and has been pushing hard for the trade bill. There are two reasons: China is a huge potential market, even if few American movies are now released there. And studios worry that rejection of the bill would prompt Beijing to spitefully cancel the fledgling trade agreements already in place.
"Our trade with China is minuscule," said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, which represents studios. "The reason we are passionately in favor of the trade bill has far more to do with the long-range future." 
 Until last summer, China limited United States companies to exporting 10 movies a year there, with the studios keeping half the revenue and China the remainder. On the other hand, there was no limit to how many films the studios could simply sell to Chinese distributors. In recent years, 40 to 50 films made outside China, mostly small independent ones, have been sold for flat fees there.
Hollywood studios, however, are not interested in flat fees. They want a continuous share of the loot.
Last summer, President Clinton's trade negotiators reached a new deal that doubled, to 20, the number of American movies that could be imported, with promises of further increases in future years. That is still small potatoes by Hollywood standards, but a step in what the studios consider the right direction.
The studios now do about $25 million of business a year in China. That is a tiny fraction of what would start flowing in if most movies were given a Chinese release and if lower trade barriers continued to expand a Chinese middle class hungry for such diversions.
Some entertainment conglomerates have negotiated separate commercial deals with China. Disney is planning a new theme park in Hong Kong, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has an extensive telecommunications agreement.
Another issue is theaters. Most in China are in sad shape. The nation has been eager to attract foreign investment in new cinemas, but foreigners are limited to a minority share of any operation.
Again, not good enough for Hollywood. "We're not going to buy any theaters until we own them," Mr. Valenti said. "And we're not going to put more money into theaters if they're not letting in more American pictures." Under a new agreement, foreigners could own a controlling interest in new Chinese multiplexes within three years.
Video piracy is also a source of irritation. Even Hollywood films not released in China are often quickly available through bootleg sources. Then, of course, not a penny of revenue flows back to the studios.
In recent years, American trade officials say, the Chinese have clamped down more vigorously on bootleggers. Bringing more Hollywood movies into China, along with more multiplexes, would give the Chinese authorities reason to crack down harder, entertainment executives contend.
"If Congress votes no, my judgment is that all the agreements we have made will be null and void," Mr. Valenti said. "I mean, would you keep an agreement with someone who just exiled you and kicked you on the backside?" RICK LYMAN

HEADLINE: Rallying Round the China Bill, Hungrily: Textiles;
Cheaper Clothing, But at What Price?

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Americans love to get fashion on the cheap. Even with the economy booming, they are snapping up more $4.99 cotton T-shirts and Indian print sundresses than ever.
And shoppers are not being tricked into getting less. They have actually been winning the war on costs. Over all, apparel prices have fallen about 1 percent a year throughout most of the 1990's. Last year, prices fell even more. 
 The main reason that Americans pay so little for products from blue jeans to sneakers is that manufacturing jobs have been shipped wholesale to countries with cheap labor -- countries like China. Long before the trade agreement was negotiated, employment in the American apparel and textile industries was already plunging. Together, the two industries employed 1.2 million people in this country as of January of this year, according to the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. That is down from 2.5 million in 1973, the peak employment year for apparel workers.
There is little doubt that the trend toward exporting sewing jobs has been helped by earlier trade agreements that lowered tariffs and expanded quotas. Union data shows that in the 36 months before Nafta took effect, the United States lost 2,000 apparel jobs. During the following 36 months, the loss was 134,000.
But because so many jobs have already disappeared, the effect on manufacturing still based in the United States may not be as severe in the future -- even the union predicts a loss of 15,000 jobs a year at most. The real impact of the China agreement -- which allows it to participate in the phasing out of nation-by-nation quotas on clothing imports to the United States by 2005 -- is likely to fall mostly on other Asian countries that will not be able to compete with China's even lower-cost labor.
When judging China's importance, consider that Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest importer, already gets 53 percent of its clothing imports from China, according to a study of United States Customs Department documents by the Citizens Trade Campaign, which is critical of the company and opposed to the China trade agreement. Wal-Mart refuses to give specifics on its imports, but a spokesman, Jay Allen, acknowledged that the company contracts directly with "several thousand factories."
Once China joins the World Trade Organization, the retail industry says, there will be gains at home to offset the job losses abroad. Most important, executives argue, are the tariff cuts will allow them to sell more to China. "We see a great market opportunity," said Candyce Cummings, general counsel of the VF Corporation, maker of Lee and Wrangler clothing. LESLIE KAUFMAN

HEADLINE: Rallying Round the China Bill, Hungrily: Financial Services;
Investment Capital And Car Loans, Too?

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
It would be hard to find legislation that has been embraced so unconditionally by America's financial institutions as the China trade bill. Whether they think they have more to gain from its passage or to lose from its failure, they have been lobbying hard.
Companies with commercial banking operations, like Citigroup, salivate over the prospect of providing auto loans and other services. Investment banks are more concerned that rejection could chill relations with Chinese officials who have begun to tap foreign capital markets. 
 New York companies have played leading roles in raising capital for several state-run enterprises, including the initial public offering this month for PetroChina.
Fresh from political skirmishes over that underwriting, Henry M. Paulson, chairman of Goldman Sachs, said rejection of the bill could hurt his firm's chances of advising on future privatizations. But he is more worried that client companies would not play as big a part in China's economic development.
"We don't need any changes in the rules to work on privatizations and other assignments," he said.
Goldman Sachs advises the Chinese government and sells foreign securities in China. But the firm does not have an investment bank there, as it does in Japan, because the American company would be limited to a minority stake.
Commercial banks are much more eager to expand their physical operations in China. Citibank has only four branches there and cannot do business in local currency.
"There essentially is no consumer banking system in China," said Lionel Johnson, Citigroup's director of international government relations. "People have very limited relationships with banks, limited opportunities to invest their savings."
While China is expected to remain wary of anything that threatens the stability of its state-run banks, all that is supposed to start changing within five years under the trade pact, potentially giving Citibank and other foreign banks an even chance to compete with domestic banks for tens of millions of consumers. The banks see an opportunity to lend money to Chinese customers for big-ticket purchases, especially cars. They also anticipate being able to decide where to put branches, instead of having the government assign the sites.
"For the first time," Mr. Johnson said, "market forces will make those decisions." PATRICK McGEEHAN

HEADLINE: Rallying Round the China Bill, Hungrily: High Technology;
Intellectual Property And Other Issues

BYLINE: By SARA ROBINSON and SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
To the high-technology industry, China is a vast emerging market that is virtually out of reach. Analysts estimate that China will soon be one of the three largest markets for computers, software and Internet products. While companies like Motorola, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have some operations there, they say Chinese regulations and lax intellectual property protections significantly interfere with their ability to do business.
If the trade bill does not pass, the industry says, China will become a World Trade Organization member but will not be treated as such by the United States and thus will not have to follow the group's rules when dealing with Washington. 
 "What we negotiated will go to our non-American competitors," said James F. Whittaker, chairman of the U.S. High Tech Coalition on China, a lobbying group based in Washington. "We will be at a severe disadvantage in one of the most important markets in the world."
Critics, including labor organizations, are concerned that high-technology companies will exploit China's large pool of skilled engineers and weak labor protections and move jobs overseas. Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, noted, however, that while 60 percent of Intel's revenues came from abroad, 70 percent of its work force was in the United States. "Success in China," he said, "can help create jobs in the United States."
Telecommunications is also seen as a potential bonanza for American companies. Arthur L. Kobler, president of the China operation for AT&T, expects China's roughly $50 billion communications market to double by 2004, fueled largely by an explosion in wireless telephone use.
"Sometime this year or next year, China will become the second-largest wireless market, behind the United States but ahead of Japan," Mr. Kobler said. "China is a market that you cannot not be in."
For now, though, China's extensive restrictions on foreign business operations severely limit American high-technology and telecommunications companies. Foreign-made products are subject to high tariffs. Yet foreign companies that want to produce in China face restrictions on what parts they can buy from abroad and are permitted to distribute their products within China only through local distributors. State-owned enterprises control a significant share of the trade in electronics goods, and American companies complain that they give preference to higher-cost Chinese suppliers.
That could change soon. In the bilateral pact reached in November, China agreed to phase out tariffs and other restrictions and to immediately become subject to the W.T.O.'s patent and copyright rules. That provides tremendous opportunities not only to the United States but also to China, said David I. Levine, a professor at the Walter A. Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley.
"High tech," he said, "is one instance of the general theory that if you want to learn from the rest of the world, you trade with them."
Communications services are likely to be an important part of that trade. Moreover, the opportunity to sell services to Chinese businesses and consumers may well be surpassed by the chance to win over big foreign corporations that want to link their Chinese operations with their other units.

HEADLINE: Study to Develop Way to Monitor Cancer Care

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 20

 BODY:
Responding to a call to improve the quality of cancer care in the United States, a leading cancer organization said here today that it was working with other groups to develop a national system to monitor how well each cancer patient is treated.
The effort will begin this summer when researchers from Harvard University and the RAND Corporation begin examining the medical records of 600 patients to determine their outcomes from two types of cancer. 
 The first phase will be conducted in Cleveland, Houston and Los Angeles and will involve 300 people with breast cancer and an additional 300 patients with cancer of the colon and rectum, the study's leaders said at the opening of a meeting here of the American Society of Clinical Oncologists, the leading group of cancer specialists in this country.
The ultimate goal is to develop specific measures of quality spanning the entire course of care, from diagnosis to cure or death. Such measures could then be used to hold health care providers accountable for the quality of cancer care. An estimated 1.2 million Americans will develop cancer this year. Cancer is second to heart disease as a cause of death among Americans and one of the most expensive diseases to treat.
Breast and colo-rectal cancers were chosen because consensus for their care is greater than for other major cancers, said Dr. Deborah Kamin, the oncologist group's director of public policy.
The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation is the study's major sponsor, paying about half of the $2 million cost. Other contributors are groups representing surgeons, radiation therapists, nurses and the drug industry.
The three cities were chosen to provide a representative look at how different minority populations are treated. The study may be expanded to other cities to include 2,000 patients and possibly lung cancer if an additional $1 million is found, Dr. Kamin said in an interview.
Cases will be chosen at random among those whose cancer was discovered two years ago, thus allowing enough time to complete a first round of therapy. Some patients may be in relapse and others may be dead.
Because each patient may have received care at more than one medical center, the study could involve as many as 10 hospitals in each city. As is standard, the researchers will obtain permission from an ethics committee at each hospital before examining records and interviewing patients.
After determining whether therapy was intended for cure or palliation, the researchers will seek information about the therapies offered and given at each critical decision-making step in the patients' care.
Among the questions: Did surgeons recommend consultations with an oncologist? If treatment involved chemotherapy, were the correct drugs chosen and given in the proper amount? Was pain relief achieved? Was hospice care offered? And how well managed were other end-of-life care options?
Also, the researchers will interview the same patients to correlate what they say they were told with what doctors, nurses, nutritionists and other health professionals wrote in the records.
Patients and their families will be asked: Were all appropriate medical options explained and choices given? For example, were the patients offered radiation therapy after breast conserving therapy? Were doctors available when needed to answer questions and offer care? Did doctors recommend entering a clinical trial to evaluate newer therapies? Did the patients join a support group?
The oncology group's president, Dr. Joseph S. Bailes, who practices in Houston, said the effort was in response to a report released in April 1999 by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. In addressing issues in the prevention, control, diagnosis, treatment and palliation of cancer, the institute said that there was "a growing lack of public confidence" in the nation's system of fragmented cancer care.
"There is no national cancer care program or system of care in the United States," the report said. It also said that the government had numerous cancer programs and research, "but in no one place are these disparate efforts coordinated or even described."
A substantial, but unmeasured, number of cancer patients do not receive care known to be effective for their condition, the medical institute said, and the reasons for failure to deliver high quality care could come from overuse, underuse or misuse of proper therapy but have not been studied adequately.
Conducting clinical trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of therapies is a first step in assessing quality. But too few patients participate in such trials even though studies show that routine care costs in cancer clinical trials are no more than in standard care, cancer experts have said.

HEADLINE: Washington Mayor Gets Things Done Quietly

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
If all continues to go well, the nation's capital will be allowed out of the intensive care ward fashioned by Congress sometime next year. The District of Columbia will not only regain home-rule prerogatives lost in its profligate past; it will also confirm the stewardship of Mayor Anthony A. Williams, an unlikely politician as bland in his style as the paint on the municipal walls.
"There's a sea change from four years ago," the mayor said, his zest characteristically masked as he pursued a budget fight with the district council and tackled a school crisis. He hailed these problems as a healthy sign of the revival of local respectability. 
 "Here we are debating not whether we're going to spend the city into the ground or not," Mr. Williams said. "The new question is how much we're going to invest in the future."
This city-state by the Potomac, the perennial ward that Congress seems delighted to scold and micromanage, is clearly moving to a higher ground of civic morale. Constituents' confidence about the city's direction has more than doubled in the less than two years of the Williams administration, with 7 in 10 residents feeling positive about the city's course, according to polls of the district's often demoralized public.
Even more important, some of the watchdogs of Capitol Hill are snapping less.
"Mayor Williams is making real progress in turning around Washington," said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas Republican who heads the District of Columbia subcommittee.
Mr. Williams arrived here in 1995 as a grim technocrat and emergency budget cutter when Congress created a board of financial overseers to halt the capital's spiral of deficits and mismanagement and hired him as chief financial officer. From that narrow opportunity, he molted into a competitive politician and became the people's choice in a difficult time.
In his 16 months of incumbency, the 48-year-old mayor has labored to replace the city's wastrel image of the flamboyant Marion Barry era with his own jot-and-tittle devotion to quiet executive techniques. In a way, the best measure of Mr. Williams's initial success may be the fact that he is sometimes criticized for lacking the populist flash of Mr. Barry.
"He suffers from terminal caution," complained Mark Plotkin, a relentless civic goad and the political commentator for the local public radio station WAMU. Mr. Plotkin made the mayor sound like Calvin Coolidge, complimenting him for installing "rectitude and calm" in the city but faulting him for failing to fully tap the energy of his electoral mandate and "take us to another plane" by fighting with passion for needs like full self-rule and voting rights for the city's Congressional delegate.
"Well, we've had flair before," the district council chairwoman, Linda W. Cropp, said of the Barry era. She expressed no regret for the businesslike Williams style, even as she confronts him in the budget fight.
"He's given the district a sense of hope that things can happen," Ms. Cropp said. "He has many wonderful ideas, although when it comes to implementing them he's still on a learning curve."
Major problems like the tattered school system and persistent youth violence are far from solved. But the mayor and the council seem resolved to innovate: they are presenting the voters a referendum next month to give the mayor a role in school management through the power to appoint some members of the school board. They are also on the way to delivering four balanced budgets in a row, the required formula for regaining home-rule powers after years of chimerical bookkeeping.
In this endeavor, Mr. Williams has assiduously avoided what in the Barry era came to be known as "the race card" -- harvesting the vote of the divided district's black working-class majority by playing off the affluent white minority.
"I would never personally use race as an excuse for anything," said Mr. Williams, a Yale graduate. In an interview, he emphasized his obligation to unify and not to deal with the criticism, by now a cliche, that he might not be "black enough" for a city that is 60 percent black.
"I'm not saying it's not appropriate for others," he said of racial complaints. "But I've been given a lot of opportunities and advantages where I'm sure I can personally say race plays a role."
The mayor stressed that Washington "is still very fractured and divided." But he insisted that unheralded programs of mutual good will crisscross the Anacostia River, the city's main racial dividing line. He maintained that a recent increase in auto registrations indicated the viability of his goal of gaining 100,000 residents in this decade, including returning suburbanites attracted by the district's walkable neighborhoods and burnished housing stock.
Across the Anacostia in one of the low-income southeast wards that are part of the black political power base, the new mayor, despite his ruling-class aura, occasioned no great complaint at Brace's Unisex salon on Minnesota Avenue.
"Mayor Barry was a great people person," Alice Taylor said. "This new mayor is working at a different angle. But he's doing O.K."
Her friend Clara Sherrod agreed. "Barry was a street politician who knew our problems," she said. "But I'd say the streets are really looking better with Williams. He's having grass planted around here and cleaning up things."
Over in Georgetown, part of the district's white power base in the northwest quarter, there is palpable pleasure at the way the Williams bow tie is replacing the Barry dashiki as a D.C. signature. "He's made the city a lot more presentable," said Pat Scanlon, a volunteer at the Christ Child Opportunity Shop, a consignment store on Wisconsin Avenue that finances local charities.
Nearby, a white customer who would not give his name grumbled: "He still thinks this is a black city and packs the payroll with his own. What about us?"
"Well, it is a black city," Ms. Scanlon responded. "So what's wrong with hiring your people who are qualified so they work and pay taxes and have nice houses?"
In the Barry years, the payroll for the district, which must provide a mix of state and city services, was criticized as a strategic patronage trough when it ballooned to 50,000 employees for a city of 550,000. It has been cut since the fiscal crisis was declared five years ago; this year it reached a Congressionally authorized level of 32,719, a reduction of 1,450 from last year, although Mr. Williams wants it still lower.
"Running this city is like Roebling trying to build the Brooklyn Bridge and digging and digging for the bedrock," he said in frustration. He said he kept uncovering the "muck" of old corruption as he tried to reform such scandal-ridden agencies as the mental retardation treatment program, whose lethal failures were laid bare by The Washington Post.
"My answer is what I call agency bypass surgery," he said of a radical plan to create an entire new treatment agency alongside the existing failed system to supersede it.
The depth of these past failures has prompted Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's Congressional delegate, to caution that any criticism of Mayor Williams "should be tempered by the disaster disguised as a city" that he inherited.
"He's making this city work," Ms. Norton said. "He's what we needed -- a mayor who came to office who had done something other than run for office."
While he is portrayed as an un-politician who is making the city forget the slick Barry era, Mr. Williams actually apprenticed seriously in practical politics as an elected member of the New Haven board of aldermen when he was studying at Yale for his undergraduate degree in economics. Twenty years later, he is not above artfully stroking his Capitol Hill watchdogs; he even attended a fund-raiser for an influential conservative Republican, Representative Ernest Istook of Oklahoma.
"I've got to look out for my people, you know," the mayor explained, unapologetic about becoming the complete practitioner in the nation's ultimate political city.

HEADLINE: Former Critics Of Trade Bill Are Swaying Vote in House

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
If the China trade bill slips through Congress this week, as some supporters now expect, Sander M. Levin, a Democrat who has voted against all of President Clinton's major trade initiatives, will -- ironically -- take some credit for helping provide the margin of victory.
Mr. Levin won backing from House leaders late last week to amend the bill granting China permanent trade ties to establish a human rights and trade policy monitoring commission for China. Vote counters on both sides of the aisle said the proposal, co-sponsored by Doug Bereuter, a Nebraska Republican, has helped recruit perhaps two dozen undecided lawmakers into the pro-trade camp. 
 China has called the proposed commission an interference in its internal affairs. The Republican leadership had been cool to the idea. Clinton administration officials had kept their distance. Labor unions and some human rights groups have called it weak.
But Mr. Levin's proposal has proved crucial to Democrats, and a few Republicans, who have found it politically impossible to vote for trade deals in recent years because labor unions and consumer groups oppose them so strongly. If critics call it a fig leaf, supporters are hailing it as an innovative tool to keep political pressure on China even while granting it long-sought guaranteed trade access to the United States market.
"I waited to see what he would come up with before I decided," said Diana L. DeGette, a Colorado Democrat who announced her support for the Clinton administration's top remaining legislative priority after Mr. Levin detailed the commission's structure on Friday. "My constituents care a great deal about human rights and want to see something done on this front."
The idea was modeled on the Helsinki Commission, which inspected human rights conditions behind the Iron Curtail during the cold war. Mr. Levin envisions that Congress and the White House will appoint high-level commissioners, including members of Congress and distinguished outsiders, who could monitor conditions in China and report to both branches.
Each year, the commission would issue a report recommending legislative or administrative steps that might help raise pressure on China to improve its human rights conditions, though it would not have the power to enforce its recommendations. The commission could study ways of turning up the heat on Beijing that are not inconsistent with the World Trade Organization, including some kinds of sanctions and United States policy toward loans from international aid agencies.
A second part of the Levin-Bereuter proposal enacts into law provisions that would help the United States fight sudden surges of imports from China. Both provisions won backing from the Republican leadership last week, which agreed to include them as part of the bill that would grant China permanent trade status. A vote in the House is expected to take place Wednesday.
Mr. Levin represents a heavily unionized district of Michigan. With unions increasingly wary of trade deals that open markets and threaten industrial jobs, he has not met many trade agreements he likes. He voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994.
He said he decided late last year to find an alternative to a straight vote on China's trade status. He said he wanted to "reshape globalization" so that trade deals would promote human values, not just the free shipments of goods.
"It seems to me that trade and globalization can be forces for good, and we can't stop them," Mr. Levin said. "But we have to shape them. In China's case, you can't just vote yes and trust that social and economic changes will come along together."
Labor unions and consumer groups have criticized the proposal as ineffective.
"It's a well-meaning effort," said Thea Lee, a senior official at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and an outspoken opponent of the China trade bill. "But it's redundant with what's already done and may even be counterproductive."
Some human rights groups are less dismissive, though many say that the Levin commission could be much stronger if it had the power to force a Congressional vote on its recommendations each year.
"It could be stronger, and we think that there's a chance it will be stronger before this is finished," said Mike Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch in New York.
Mr. Jendrzejczyk said the Helsinki Commission had real influence on Soviet bloc nations, but that China, unlike the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, had not signed a treaty permitting review and inspection of human rights.

HEADLINE: As Political Crisis Mounts, Peru's Leader Relishes Fight

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, May 20

 BODY:
Taking a moment's break from a boisterous campaign rally the other day in the colonial city of Cajamarca, President Alberto K. Fujimori pointed to a dark cloud gliding over his head and cried, "Let there be rain for the farmers!"
Within moments, the sky poured open, and thousands cheered. 
 "Don't worry," Mr. Fujimori laughed into his microphone. "Everything is coordinated."
It has often seemed that way over the last 10 years, as Mr. Fujimori effectively confronted an array of plagues -- from hyperinflation to terrorism to an invasion of narcotics traffickers, from war with Ecuador to massive flooding caused by El Nino.
But only a day after Mr. Fujimori played with the clouds over Cajamarca, he faced a mounting political crisis that will surely challenge his considerable pluck and power. Alejandro Toledo, his opponent in the May 28 runoff presidential election, dropped out of the race on Thursday. Mr. Fujimori was left with an open field for victory and the prospect of a third five-year term, but one in which his legitimacy and credibility would be questioned both here and abroad.
Mr. Fujimori now faces the possibility of unending protest marches, criticism from Washington and other foreign capitals, and even, perhaps, economic sanctions from the United States Congress and the Organization of American States that could impede his fight against drug trafficking and unemployment.
The 61-year-old president, who is the son of Japanese immigrants, was able to face down international pressures after he suspended the operations of his own Congress and Supreme Court in 1992 because he had overwhelming popular support. But now Peru is badly split, with university students and labor unions preparing to mount the biggest street protests in more than a generation.
Mr. Fujimori, in effect, has become a victim of his own success. Now that he has virtually defeated the terrorists of the Maoist Shining Path, a growing number of Peruvians are seeking an easing of his authoritarianism. In the last three years, even as the terrorism waned, Mr. Fujimori did not ease his hold on power. He tightened it.
Mr. Fujimori decided he could run for re-election this year even though the Constitution prohibits three consecutive terms. He had three judges dismissed by Congress when they disagreed with his legal interpretation that the constitutional term limit did not cover his first term because it was completed before the Constitution itself. He then established control over several television networks through legal maneuvers, and withdrew Peru from the jurisdiction of a regional human rights court.
Mr. Fujimori's powers were amply on display in the first round of the presidential race when all television networks, save for one cable channel, virtually boycotted his opposition.
"He has been manipulating so much that even if he won fairly, people wouldn't believe it was a fair process," said Enrique Zileri, editor of the political magazine Caretas. "Whatever happens, Fujimori becomes a much weaker president who will be discredited internationally."
Hernan Chaparro Melo, a pollster, said, "With 57 percent of the people continuing to believe the election process is unjust, we are entering difficult times."
But Mr. Fujimori has had his back to the wall before, and he has always shown himself to be a leader of great resourcefulness and impeccable timing.
Over the last few weeks, Mr. Fujimori suddenly emerged from his early campaign slumber and appeared eager for a fight. He told enthusiastic campaign rallies with growing crowds that he would not accept a postponement of the election even before Mr. Toledo demanded that the vote be put off several weeks to give foreign election observers time to test new computer software installed to count the vote.
Mr. Fujimori sharpened his message on television and on the stump, arguing more forcefully that he is the one candidate strong enough to lead this desperately poor and often chaotic country. Taking on his greatest weaknesses, he pledged an all-out attack on unemployment and confronted his foreign critics with diatribes designed to inspire Peruvian nationalism.
"We don't need foreigners to tell us how to hold elections," Mr. Fujimori told a crowd in the city of Trujillo shortly after Mr. Toledo's announcement that he was dropping out of the race if the election was not postponed. "We're sovereign Peruvians and we have the right to hold our democracy."
And after underestimating Mr. Toledo, an American-educated business school professor who rose meteorically in the weeks before the first round vote, Mr. Fujimori finally began taking him on -- calling him a rudderless, indecisive leader who only knows how to turn to Washington, Buenos Aires and European capitals for political direction.
Mr. Fujimori's old magic was amply on display this week as he toured the north of the country. He laughed, danced and gleefully tossed cassettes of his campaign songs to passersby who thrilled at seeing their president.
As his campaign caravan twisted through the streets of Chiclayo, a local witchdoctor livened the proceedings by cavorting before the president's campaign truck, waving a giant pumpkin and spritzing some alcoholic brew through his teeth and onto the swelling crowds.
And as a brass band played his campaign theme song, Mr. Fujimori went into a fevered jig on the stump as a throng of more than 10,000 went wild. "My advisers tell me I shouldn't dance," President Fujimori laughed, "but I can't help myself!" It was the kind of populist touch that led him to landslide victories in 1990 and 1995.
Speaking in his heavily accented English for effect, he told the crowd, "They ask: 'What is happening in Peru?' " Then answering the question firmly in Spanish, he said, "We've had a government the last 10 years that has been decisive and has never ducked the tough issues."
To crowds that filled the central plaza of Cajamarca, a highland city of magnificent baroque churches, luscious cheeses and lyrical poets where the Incas made their first stand against the Spanish invaders in the 16th century, Mr. Fujimori called on the crowd to cheer loud enough so the Argentine government could hear.
Donning a tall straw hat popular with the Indian peasants here, he snickered at Mr. Toledo for traveling earlier in the week to Buenos Aires to consult with President Fernando de la Rua and former President Raul Alfonsin.
Speaking of his opponents, he said: "If they were really democrats and really trusted the people, they wouldn't complain all the time in Washington and Buenos Aires. They show by going abroad that they don't care about the votes of the Peruvian people."
Sharpening the nationalistic argument is Francisco Tudela, a former foreign minister and Mr. Fujimori's vice presidential candidate. "I think there is a fear, an ideological fear, of a very independent government in Latin America that is outside the establishment," Mr. Tudela said in an interview. He added, "The fact that President Fujimori did not negotiate with terrorist groups irritates some abroad."

HEADLINE: THE RACE FOR SENATE: THE MAYOR;
A Legacy in the Balance

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
If Rudolph W. Giuliani quit the mayoralty tomorrow, he would leave behind a city that is safer and more prosperous than it was when he took over City Hall in 1994.
A solid legacy, but a narrow one, especially since New York City's prosperity is linked closely to the thriving national economy and crime is down all over the Giuliani-less country. And the mayor's image is marred by a reputation for insensitivity, especially racial insensitivity. 
 So it makes perfect sense that Mr. Giuliani wants to devote the next year and a half to being "a better mayor," as he said on Friday when he withdrew from the Senate race -- to build on his successes and knock down the barriers he concedes he may have erected between his administration and many minority New Yorkers.
If revising his legacy is indeed the objective of the newly introspective-sounding mayor, the issues are out there waiting for him. He faces the skepticism of people who have heard similar commitments from him before, only to see them go nowhere. He may also find that he gets less attention than he used to. Nothing collapses as quickly as the prominence of a politician about to lose his platform.
"Who cares what he says?" asked H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller and likely candidate for governor in 2002. "He's a lame duck. He's on his way out. People are going to focus on the Senate race and who is going to be the next mayor. If he'd done this two or three years ago, fine, but he has already put his mark on history."
The comptroller recalled the mayor's pledge to reach out to minorities when he was running for re-election in 1997. He did not do so for a year, until Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was killed by police officers. Then he met with Mr. McCall and others. "Then I never heard from him again," Mr. McCall said.
But Mr. Giuliani still has 19 months in office. His health allowing, he can do a lot even if hampered by skepticism and the dimming of the spotlight. There is everything from the symbolic -- removing all those barricades around City Hall before the next mayor does -- to matters as complex as expanding health insurance coverage, a new Giuliani goal.
Some issues have been pending a long time. One of the most problematic for this mayor has been improving relations between the Police Department and minority groups in the city, especially in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Mr. Diallo and Patrick M. Dorismond.
"I wrote to him last week, said this is the time to drop his opposition to the independent police board," said Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker. "That would be great not only for the future of the city, but would have a strong impact on the city right now." Creating an oversight board might also be a way of responding to a recent report by the United States Civil Rights Commission, which accuses the police of racial profiling.
But the police commissioner, Howard Safir, rebuffed Mr. Vallone last week, and the speaker has yet to hear from the mayor, who is still fighting his idea in court.
Many other matters are before the mayor now, especially one that always tops the list of issues people care about in public opinion polls: education. The city's contract with the United Federation of Teachers is in negotiations, as are all municipal union contracts. The mayor has focused on a merit pay plan for teachers -- rewarding individual teachers with bonuses tied to higher student test scores. That is anathema to the teachers' union, which considers merit pay divisive and subjective. Nobody familiar with the powerful teachers' union gives the idea a realistic chance of success.
"He can say, 'I'd like individual merit pay, but I know it's a nonstarter, so let's come together on a group plan,' " suggested Mark Green, the public advocate, referring to merit pay for the faculties of entire schools rather than for individual teachers.
The mayor could also call for reduced class sizes and find the financial resources to make that possible -- dropping his proposal to cut the income tax surcharge and dedicating the income to schools, for instance.
He has often said he wants to eliminate the Board of Education; so does Mr. Vallone. Both want the school system to be under direct city control. The two could lobby for change in Albany, on schools and on another central issue -- getting the State Legislature to raise New York City's debt limit and allow the city to borrow more. If it cannot, projects like construction of schools are in trouble. "Now that he no longer has to worry what they think of him in Syracuse and Buffalo, he could do more; he's never been up there with me," Mr. Vallone said.
Mr. Giuliani said on Friday that he had become more sensitive to the importance of expanding health insurance coverage. That is not exclusively a city issue. But the mayor could channel more city money to the municipal hospitals, the refuge of many poor uninsured New Yorkers. The hospitals have lost a great deal of city financing in the last decade.
He could mobilize city agencies to encourage more people to enroll in a newly expanded state program for low-income New Yorkers -- Child Health Plus and Family Health Plus. Health care experts estimate that a half-million city residents are eligible but unenrolled.
As he reconsiders his mayoralty, Mr. Giuliani might look again at his policy requiring single homeless adults to work in exchange for shelter. That was shot down by a State Supreme Court judge, but the decision is now on appeal by the Giuliani administration.
The city is also still planning to deny shelter to parents who do not comply with city requirements -- participating in workfare, for instance; their children would go into foster care if shelter were denied. That plan is on hold, pending court action, but is still official city policy.
These approaches have led to broad criticism, and to Leno-Letterman caricatures of a heartless mayor. Mr. Giuliani strongly defended his policies toward the homeless as recently as three nights ago, during a nationally televised town hall meeting. He told his questioner, Andrea Mitchell, that encouraging dependency was cruel, while encouraging independence was humane -- long his approach to welfare and the homeless.
Other elected officials say they doubt that the mayor's plan to govern differently means that he is prepared to change his ideology. But they say just a change in his public temperament could make a difference. Mr. Green, who has been a target of Mr. Giuliani's disdain, noted, with amazement in his voice, that when he called the mayor after Mr. Giuliani dropped his Senate candidacy, the mayor took his call. "We said more than 'hello' for the first time in three years," Mr. Green said.
But can a change not in content but tone -- in itself a difficult thing to pull off for so entrenched a personality -- accomplish the mayor's goal of "reaching everyone in this city"?
After six and a half years of seeing one kind of mayor, some who work with Mr. Giuliani are openly dubious.
"If he is sincere and truly wants to reach out, I think the black community has always been open to wanting to work with the mayor," said C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president. But there are many skeptics, she added, because the mayor has made similar promises before, and failed to convincingly follow up. He can still keep his own commitment to change, she said. "But not easily."

HEADLINE: THE RACE FOR SENATE: THE DEMOCRAT;
Mrs. Clinton Says She Plans Congenial Discussion of Issues

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

DATELINE: MOUNT KISCO, N.Y., May 20

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton made it clear today that she has no intention of lashing out at her new competitor in the race for the United States Senate.
For some weeks, her staff members have extensively researched the voting record and positions of United States Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, the Republican candidate for the Senate. But after an appearance at the Boys and Girls Club of Northern Westchester, Mrs. Clinton mentioned the congressman in only the most cordial terms. 
 "I would like to welcome Congressman Lazio into this race for the Senate," Mrs. Clinton said, reading more or less verbatim from a statement that had been released earlier by her campaign headquarters in Manhattan.
"I'm looking forward to a real discussion with him of the issues," Mrs. Clinton said. "Because if Congressman Lazio is the Republican nominee, there will be a clear difference between us on a number of issues, because we've taken very different stands on everything from education, to health care, to the future of the economy, to how we take care of our children, as well as our elderly citizens."
The statement offered no specifics about the differences between Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Mr. Lazio, who is expected to be nominated at the Republican State Convention in Buffalo at the end of the month.
But it offered a dramatic contrast in tone to Mr. Lazio's statement on his entrance into the race earlier today.
Mrs. Clinton first told reporters that she would take "one or two questions," but after she read her statement, she left the podium and began shaking the hands of many of the roughly 250 people gathered at the Boys and Girls Club.
While she walked along a roped-off area shaking hands, signing autographs and posing for photographs with guests, reporters occasionally asked about criticisms Mr. Lazio had made of her.
In each case, she offered short responses. When asked about Mr. Lazio's depiction of her as an out-of-state politician, she said: "We'll have plenty to talk about on the issues. That's what's important."
In part, Mrs. Clinton's aides explained, the cautious, almost congenial tone of the first lady's statement reflected her belief that there was no need to inject negativity into a campaign that has more than five months yet to run. As Mrs. Clinton said at the end of her statement, "I think we'll have a lot of time in the next days and weeks and months to discuss those differences."
And with Mr. Lazio's emergence after Rudolph W. Giuliani withdrew Friday from the race, Mrs. Clinton concluded that there was little chance she could command the same level of media attention as the new Republican contender at that time, her aides said.
Moreover, her aides said, Mrs. Clinton wished to stick with the kind of schedule in which she has been immersed over the last few weeks.
Mrs. Clinton came here today from her home in Chappaqua, about a 10-minute drive, to attend the club's Youth of the Year Award program, where she gave brief remarks extolling the Boys and Girls Club. From there, she traveled to a fund-raising reception, also in Westchester County. On Sunday, the first lady is to travel to Albany to attend a convention of the New York State Council of Machinists and a luncheon hosted by the Rensselaer County Democratic Committee.

HEADLINE: A Philosophy With Roots In Conservative Texas Soil

SERIES: GEORGE W. BUSH'S JOURNEY: A Boy From Midland

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Tex.

 BODY:
The fourth-grade classroom erupted in titters as George W. Bush, one of the class clowns, faced his friends. He had quietly used an ink pen to draw a beard and long sideburns on his cheeks.
The teacher, Frances Childress, grabbed George by the arm, yanked him out of class and marched him down the long outside corridor to the principal's office near the main entrance to Sam Houston Elementary School. 
 "Just look at him," the principal, John Bizilo, recalls Mrs. Childress telling him. "He's been making a disturbance in class."
The next step was pretty obvious for anyone in the 1950's version of the West Texas oil town of Midland: Mr. Bizilo told George to bend over and then reached for his paddle, the thickness of a Ping-Pong paddle but narrower and twice as long. Mr. Bizilo gave George three "licks," and the boy's shrieks filled the office.
"When I hit him, he cried," Mr. Bizilo remembered the other day. "Oh, did he cry! He yelled as if he'd been shot. But he learned his lesson."
So he did.
Many of the roots of Mr. Bush's political philosophy as a presidential candidate -- including his belief in tough love for juvenile offenders -- seem to go back to his childhood. Midland, a conservative, up-from-the-bootstraps town that has grown from 25,000 when he was a little boy to almost 100,000 today, mirrors Mr. Bush's optimism, his faith in business and his doubts about an activist government. While playing Little League baseball, running for class president, or even sobbing in the principal's office, George W. Bush absorbed West Texas values that many old friends say are central to understanding who he is today.
"I think his political philosophy comes completely from the philosophy of the independent oil man," said Joe O'Neill, a fellow rapscallion in childhood. "His homage to his parents, his respect for his elders, his respect for tradition, his belief in religion, his opposition to abortion -- that's the philosophy he grew up with here."
Mr. Bush himself, in a long interview about his roots, made a similar point. "I don't know what percentage of me is Midland," he said, "but I would say people, if they want to understand me, need to understand Midland and the attitude of Midland."
It is in the soil of Midland that Mr. Bush has said he would like to be buried when he dies, and it was to Midland that he returned in the 1970's to marry and start a family. It gave him an anchor in real America.
Mr. Bush has often said that "the biggest difference between me and my father is that he went to Greenwich Country Day and I went to San Jacinto Junior High." That may be an exaggeration of the younger Mr. Bush's populist credentials, because he is also a product of Andover, Yale and Harvard. But there is still something to it.
The father, chauffeured to and from private school in Connecticut in a black sedan, suffered politically because of the perception that he was a blue blood who could not relate to ordinary people. The younger Mr. Bush also has been tainted by the idea that he was born into privilege with a visa to effortless wealth and prominence. Yet George W. Bush actually had a rather ordinary childhood, and his years biking around small-town streets in jeans and a white T-shirt left him with a common touch that is among his greatest assets as a politician.
"He understands Bubba because there is more Bubba in him," Karl Rove, the longtime political adviser to the Bushes, told a reporter in 1992, when Mr. Bush's friends were still carefree enough to say colorful things about him. "He is clearly the wild son -- even today. Part of it is rooted in Midland, where he grew up in an ordinary neighborhood, where houses are close together and risk was a way of life."
The Midland childhood is a striking contrast to that of another boy growing up at the same time, Al Gore, who instead of being paddled in Mr. Bizilo's office was attending the elite St. Albans School in Washington, swimming in the Senate pool and listening on an extension as his father the senator spoke on the telephone to President John F. Kennedy.
Midland, impatient with ideas and introspection, was a world of clear rights and wrongs, long on absolutes and devoid of ethical gray shades. It may be the source of some of Mr. Bush's greatest political strengths, the unpretentiousness and mellow bonhomie that warm up voters, and also of his weaknesses, including an image of an intellectual lightweight that is underscored whenever he mixes up the likes of Slovenia and Slovakia.
 
Boomtown in Black and White
It is easy to see why Midland does not support a postcard industry. It rests on an expanse of flat, baked nothingness. Even its residents, searching for a kind analogy, fumble a bit before coming up with "moonscape." The surrounding land, home to tumbleweeds and rattlesnakes, would depress even a camel, but in the 1950's it had one redeeming feature -- it was loaded with oil.
The oil made Midland a boomtown, attracting ambitious businessmen like the elder Mr. Bush and many other out-of-staters as well. These people made for a conservative town but not a redneck one; Midland had a large proportion of geologists, engineers, lawyers and accountants, and Ivy League college graduates were everywhere.
Mr. Bush recalls it in Norman Rockwell pastels, and so do many other residents. Children bicycled everywhere on their own, crime was almost nonexistent and if anyone suspicious -- say, someone with a beard -- showed up in town, then-Sheriff Ed Darnell (known as Big Ed) would stop him, escort him to the edge of town, and tell him to "get out."
Yet what no one volunteers is that it was also rigidly segregated in those days, like most places in the South. Black children went to their own school rather than to Sam Houston Elementary with George Bush. The bus station and train station had separate waiting rooms for blacks and whites, and there were separate, dilapidated drinking fountains marked "colored" at the stations and at the courthouse.
The Bushes' first encounter with West Texas racism came when they casually invited a black man, working for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to come by their temporary home in neighboring Odessa. The man had the tact to stay away, but neighbors heard about this and warned the elder George Bush to stop these invitations unless he wanted to be tarred and feathered.
Racial slurs were routine, and young George picked up the words from neighbors. Once when he was about 7 years old he used one in the living room in front of his mother, Barbara.
Michael Proctor, who lived across the street and was playing with George at the time, remembers watching as Mrs. Bush grabbed her son by the ear and dragged him into the bathroom. She washed his mouth out with soap as he spluttered indignantly.
"His family was probably the only one around that didn't use racial slurs," Mr. Proctor said. "I probably didn't realize it was wrong until I saw that."
Alongside the racism directed at blacks, there was a measured respect for the Mexicans who came over the border to work in the oil fields. As a boomtown, Midland needed laborers and welcomed Mexican immigrants, who were regarded as hard-working and thrifty. Some old friends find an echo of that attitude in Mr. Bush's efforts to push the Republican Party to reach out to immigrants.
"We saw these people cross the border and just wanting a good job," recalls Randall Roden, a neighbor boy and best friend. Mr. Roden recalls going out with George and his father to an oil well and spending the night sleeping in the back of the Bushes' station wagon as the crew -- Mexicans among them -- struggled to get the well going.
"I formed the very strong impression, and I think George has the same one, that these people came for economic opportunity and worked very hard," Mr. Roden said. "If you wanted a Mexican worker to have a new pair of boots, you'd have to buy it for him. Because if you gave him money, he'd send it home."
 
Gaining a Foothold in Texas
George W. Bush, though born in 1946 in New Haven, Conn., while his father was still an over-achieving student at Yale, moved to West Texas when he was not quite 2 and grew up in this nurturing environment. These days, as the son of a president and scion of a wealthy family, he is often perceived as a child of privilege, but neighbors in those days insist that in the 1950's that was not the case.
The Bush family in the Northeast had money, but the elder George left all that behind to make his own fortune in West Texas. Equipped with connections but initially without seed money, George and Barbara Bush and little George, their firstborn, settled in a tiny apartment in the hard-driving oil town of Odessa, where they shared a bathroom with a mother-daughter team of prostitutes living next door.
Local people say that you raise hell in Odessa but raise a family in nearby Midland, a much more respectable place. So, after a one-year interlude in California, the Bushes moved to Midland, living in a bright blue 847-square-foot bungalow on a newly built street in which every home was identical -- but painted bright colors to make them seem different. It was called Easter Egg Row, because the houses looked like colored eggs.
The family prospered in the oil business and moved into a series of nicer houses in Midland, culminating in one with a swimming pool. But this was not as much of a draw as it might have been. Just down the street lived Peggy Porter, one of the cutest girls in school, and because she had a pool as well, it was in much greater demand than the Bush family's.
Occasionally George W.'s grandfather, Senator Prescott S. Bush of Connecticut, would visit and cause a mild stir of interest in the neighborhood. But for the most part, the Bush family was regarded as fairly typical of the out-of-staters.
These days, Governor Bush is often seen as a princeling, the son of a president, the scion of a famous family, and Al Gore as more of his own man. But in the 1950's and early 1960's, it was the other way around. Back then, the name George Bush belonged only to an obscure Texas businessman. George W.'s closest connection to the White House was that he was a descendant on his mother's side of Franklin Pierce, America's 14th president. In contrast, in those days "Albert Gore" was virtually a household name, belonging to a prominent senator (the present candidate's father and namesake) who was sometimes mentioned as presidential or vice-presidential timber. The senator lost his seat in 1970 and faded into obscurity.
Yet young George was not some country hick, and he also learned to fit into the world of his Connecticut grandparents. The family regularly spent part of the summer at the family retreat in Kennebunkport, Me., and in 1954 the father took George and his best friend, Randall Roden, to Washington to see the White House, the United States Capitol and a baseball game with the Washington Senators (whose later incarnation would move to Texas and become the Rangers, owned in part by George W. Bush).
They had lunch at the senator's home in Georgetown, and a thirsty Randall promptly demonstrated the distance from Midland to Georgetown by drinking from his finger bowl.
When they are tracked down, the boys and girls who once played dodgeball at Sam Houston Elementary School, while now scattered around the country, offer recollections that are very similar: Midland was an idyllic place in which to grow up, and George W. Bush was a very typical child. In contrast to other recent presidential candidates, Mr. Bush in childhood is remarkable primarily for his ordinariness.
"He wasn't any different from anybody else," recalled Robert A. McCleskey, an old playmate. "You read about Clinton and Gore and how at that age they were planning to be president. Not Bush."
As a boy, Mr. Bush's ambition was to be another Mickey Mantle.
"All George ever wanted to be was a Major League baseball player," recalled a buddy, Terry Throckmorton. "That's all he ever talked about."
 
A Student of Baseball
No one has ever accused Mr. Bush of being an intellectual, and the indifference to books started early. Childhood friends recall Mr. Bush reading only two sets of books for pleasure -- the Hardy boys and a series of mystery books about baseball. As one asks about his reading habits, there are a few snickers.
"Did we sit around in those days reading books?" asked Mr. McCleskey, smiling broadly. "No."
George and Barbara Bush led a drive to build a school library (the school did not previously have one), but books were not a major part of a boy's childhood in Midland. Erstwhile acquaintances, while deeply admiring of the Bushes' goodness and decency, have trouble recalling early signs of greatness in the son.
"Well, no, I never did think about what he might do in life," said Austine Crosby, his third-grade teacher. "He was just a good, well-rounded young man, and he did his work."
And academically? "He was O.K.," Mrs. Crosby said, a bit defensively. "He was O.K."
So was he in the top quarter of his class academically?
"Well, in the upper half, anyway."
Even if he did not distinguish himself as a student, former classmates describe him as smart and blessed with an excellent memory. He had a passion for baseball statistics, a first-rate collection of baseball cards and a reputation as such a shrewd trader that boys were careful not to agree to a trade with George Bush without thinking it over very carefully.
In the mid-1950's, George came up with a scheme that showed remarkable ingenuity and helped make his collection of baseball cards the best around. He began sending baseball cards to famous players, enclosing return postage and a cheery good-luck message, and asking the players to autograph the cards and send them back.
This way, he got autographed cards from Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays and other famous players. Some of those cards are now worth thousands of dollars.
Mr. Bush's lifelong adoration of baseball began when he and other neighborhood boys would go early to school to play ball. Mr. Bizilo, the principal, would take off his jacket, loosen his tie and hit balls for the boys to field.
George was a good ballplayer, friends say, a bit on the small side but making up for it with enthusiasm and aggressiveness. He played catcher for the Cubs, a Little League team, and made it to the town's Little League All-Star team.
 
Becoming a Texan
Midland may not have had the best schools, George's onetime playmates say, but -- like Hot Springs, Ark., where Bill Clinton grew up -- it offered a nurturing environment and self-confidence for life.
"There's an assurance that you have growing up in a place like Midland, a self-confidence and a real genuine interest in connecting with people," said Marge Petty, the other politician in the group (a Democratic state senator in Kansas).
In particular, it was in Midland that Mr. Bush first learned to fit in, even if his parents were Yankees and his grandfather a senator. That ability to adapt and bridge groups has never left him.
Moreover, Midland values were remarkably unshaken by the 1960's. Some Midland alumni say they let their hair grow a bit longer, but -- like George W. Bush -- they mostly stood with the establishment instead of rejecting it. Very few seem to have protested significantly against the Vietnam War, seriously used drugs, thought of police as "pigs," denounced their parents as oppressors or picked up a copy of Das Kapital.
"It's a town of embedded values," Mr. Bush recalled, adding that it had "a heavy dose of individualism and fairly healthy disrespect for government." Asked if his own skepticism about the role for government is a product of Midland attitudes, Mr. Bush paused and finally nodded, saying: "I think there's a parallel there, I do."
Midland was steeped in optimism, and for many people growing up here in the 1950's, the moral of childhood was that the system worked, that anyone who struggled enough in that baking desert had a good chance of finding oil and striking it rich. The trajectory of the Bush family itself, from the apartment with the shared bathroom to the sprawling house and pool, underscored the point.
"The lesson lasted with George W. for years," said Bill Minutaglio, a Texan who has written a biography of Mr. Bush. "I think he truly believes that people can win the lottery if they work hard, that if they put their nose to the grindstone it'll all work out without government help or intrusion."
The antipathy for government seems a little odd, from afar, because in those days the oil business depended heavily on quirks in the tax code to encourage investments. Still, when the people of Midland sought a theater, a hospital and a new baseball diamond, they did not ask the government but raised money themselves and turned out on the weekends to do much of the work on their own.
When Mr. Bush talks about "compassionate conservatism" or "faith-based initiatives," he evokes what old classmates remember as the spirit of Midland of the 1950's. Asked if that is what he has in mind, Mr. Bush interrupts half-way through the question. "Yeah, absolutely," he said.
Those who know Midland are convinced that Mr. Bush is sincere when he preaches compassion and calls for a "responsibility era." But some also admit that it is fair to question the relevance of lessons from a town where raw capitalism made so many people rich and where community spirit wove such a strong safety net.
 
Surviving a Family Loss
In addition to church groups, various civic organizations were also active, and one of the local rituals for children was the meetings with cookies and milk at the home of a nice old lady who represented the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
The cookies were digested more thoroughly than the teachings.
"We were terrible to animals," recalled Mr. Throckmorton, laughing. A dip behind the Bush home turned into a small lake after a good rain, and thousands of frogs would come out.
"Everybody would get BB guns and shoot them," Mr. Throckmorton said. "Or we'd put firecrackers in the frogs and throw them and blow them up."
When he was not blowing up frogs, young George -- always restless and something of a natural leader -- would lead neighborhood children on daredevil expeditions around town, seeing how close they could come to breaking their necks. George also quickly acquired a colorful vocabulary.
"Georgie has grown to be a near-man, talks dirty once in a while and occasionally swears, aged 4 and a half," his father despaired in a letter to a friend in 1951. In another letter four years later, he lamented: "Georgie aggravates the hell out of me at times."
There was one terrible interruption in this relaxed life, occurring when George was 7. He was at school when he saw his parents' green Oldsmobile drive up in the parking lot. At first he thought he saw his 3-year-old sister, Robin, through the window.
But his eyes were playing tricks on him. His parents had come to break the news to him that Robin had just died of leukemia. The loss staggered the Bush family, and some friends say that George's closeness to his mother dates partly from his efforts to comfort her at that time.
His mother's hair began to turn gray, though she was just 28, and she often dissolved into tears. George's father worked hard and traveled frequently, and so the boy spent much more time with his mother than his father -- acquiring in particular her lacerating wit.
Robin's death is something that he has talked about very rarely with friends, and even some of his roommates at boarding school and college did not know about her. But occasionally when the moment was right, he would confide to friends about his tears and grief at the time, about his incomprehension that Robin could have been dying without his parents telling him.
Close friends say he had nightmares for years afterward. The death also left him as a quasi-only child, for his next-oldest sibling, Jeb, was six and a half years younger. Neil and Marvin were 9 and 10 years younger than George, and Dorothy was 13 years younger. So while George occasionally used Jeb as a punching bag in childhood squabbles, and always relished his role as elder brother, most of the time his playmates and confidants were friends and roommates rather than siblings.
Soon after Robin's death, George returned to school. Most of the time, the despair was hidden, and on the surface he soon reverted to the wise-cracking imp they had known before.
 
The Seeds of Leadership
Mr. Bush's political debut appears to have come in the seventh grade, although both he and his wife, Laura, (who was in the same seventh grade but barely knew him) say they have no recollection of it. Classmates recall that he ran for seventh-grade class president against Jack Hanks.
Jack was a formidable candidate, and four years later at Boys Nation he would be elected vice president, defeating a personable candidate from Arkansas named Bill Clinton. Yet in running against George, Jack was less fortunate, and classmates say that George was elected by a narrow margin.
"I voted for George because he was cuter," recalled Peggy Porter Weiss, "and in the seventh grade that's what counted."
Still, former classmates say that if they had been told that one of their number would become a presidential candidate, they would not have thought of George Bush. Instead, they say, the assumption would have been that it would be Bill Wood.
Mr. Wood, as bright and ambitious as he was athletic, beat out George Bush on the football field and was the first-string quarterback on the seventh-grade team (Mr. Bush was the second-string quarterback). Mr. Wood eventually became the junior high school and high school student council president and even headed the statewide association of student councils. If any young man in Midland seemed destined for the White House, classmates remember, it was he.
"Since then, the only thing I ever ran for," said Mr. Wood, now a lawyer and a bit flattered and amused by the memories of his classmates, "was the school board."

HEADLINE: THE RACE FOR SENATE: THE REPUBLICANS;
LAZIO OPENS RACE WITH AN ATTACK ON MRS. CLINTON

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island came roaring into the race for senator from New York yesterday, attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton as a "far left" candidate who has "no real rationale for serving here other than as a steppingstone to some other position."
"I think her ambition is the issue," Mr. Lazio declared in an interview before heading for the high school from which he graduated in 1976 to formally announce his candidacy in a race that has been upended by Rudolph W. Giuliani's decision to step aside because of health reasons. 
 Mr. Lazio, addressing a whooping and cheering crowd of supporters at West Islip High School, on Long Island, described the emerging contest between a little-known four-term member of Congress and the nation's first lady as a "clear choice" between candidates of competing ideologies and divergent backgrounds.
"My opponent is a liberal and a proud one, and I respect her for that," said Mr. Lazio, who lives in Bay Shore. "But make no mistake: she is no more a New Democrat than she is a New Yorker. She offers the big-government ideology that crippled New York in the 1980's. I do not believe we want to enter this new century pledging allegiance to the liberal ideas that so painfully failed us in the last century."
The remarks came as Republican leaders in New York and Washington lined up behind the candidacy of Mr. Lazio, who had suspended his campaign last year in deference to party leaders who wanted Mr. Giuliani as their candidate. Mr. Lazio announced a two-day state fly-around, an aggressive come-out-of-the-box approach intended to discourage any other Republicans who might be thinking about challenging him. And Michael Long, the state Conservative Party leader, was said to be preparing to endorse Mr. Lazio, as Joseph DioGuardi, a former Westchester County congressman who had been seeking the Conservative Party nomination, told friends that he would quit the race to make way for Mr. Lazio.
Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, Howard Wolfson, assailed Mr. Lazio for his attacks on Mrs. Clinton in the interview. "I'm shocked by the approach they are taking," Mr. Wolfson said. "They are so overwhelmed by their hatred for her. I guess you have to run a negative campaign when you're a Gingrich Republican with a record that's too extreme for New York."
Mrs. Clinton, at an appearance yesterday afternoon, took a softer line, but made it clear that she, too, saw this as a contest of ideologies. "If Congressman Lazio is the Republican nominee," she said, "there will be a clear difference between us on a number of issues because we've taken very different stands on everything from education, to health care, to the future of the economy, to how we take care of our children as well as our elderly citizens."
The tenor of Mr. Lazio's comments in both the interview and the formal announcement speech suggested that the campaign, with the change in candidate, was going to be harsh and fast-paced, with a particular emphasis on Mrs. Clinton's attempt to run for office in a state to which she just moved five months ago, and on what Mr. Lazio described as her liberal ideology. Mrs. Clinton's advisers have moved to portray Mr. Lazio as extreme and conservative, noting that he supported many of the initiatives of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, as they tried to discredit his candidacy.
Mr. Lazio, 42, said he considered himself "a centrist, a mainstream Republican."
"We're conservative, right-of-center on budget and tax issues, national security issues," he said. "And I think we're realistic on social issues."
He described his Democratic opponent as "far left," adding: "She's part of the discredited philosophy that helped lead New York to ruin during the Cuomo years. I think we've turned the corner, and we don't want to go back to those failed days."
In the interview, Mr. Lazio jumped at almost every opportunity to criticize Mrs. Clinton. He responded vigorously when asked if he would make an issue out of the fact that Mrs. Clinton did not live in New York before this year, a subject that Mr. Giuliani, as mayor of New York City, frequently raised.
"I'm the real thing," he said. "I don't have to try to be someone else. I was born here. I went to school here. I fished in these waters. I clammed in its bays. I graduated from our schools. My children were born in New York State. I've lived here my whole life. There will be no question of my commitment to this state."
Mr. Lazio's announcement speech was scattered with references to his own New York roots and indirect jabs at his opponent. "You can tell from my accent that I am a lifelong New Yorker," Mr. Lazio declared, grinning broadly as the audience responded with laughter and applause. "You see, I don't have to fake it. New York isn't just a place I represent -- it is my home. And I've never needed an exploratory committee to decide where I want to live."
At another point, borrowing from what had been another of Mr. Giuliani's refrains, he said, "I can't call on Air Force One whenever I need a ride."
By contrast, he said in the interview, Mrs. Clinton is hurt both by the fact that she has only recently lived in the state where she wants to serve, and because of the cloistered life she has lived as a first lady.
"You don't know New York if you have bodyguards around you all the time," he said. "You've got to know what it's like to ride the subways, to drive your own car, to buy your own gas, to buy groceries here.
"I think people can see through who Hillary Clinton is, and they will have a chance to know Rick Lazio as the real deal," he said.
The exchanges between the campaigns yesterday suggested that expectations aside, a Lazio-Clinton race could prove to be far harsher than a race between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani, and not necessarily by choice. Mr. Lazio is under pressure to establish himself quickly as a credible and tough challenger to Mrs. Clinton, for the sake of party leaders as well as contributors from across the nation who had financed Mr. Giuliani's challenge to Mrs. Clinton and are in danger of drifting away in the next few days.
And Mr. Lazio, because he is relatively unknown, is likely to find it a lot less complicated to attack Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Giuliani had. The mayor always had to be on guard about being portrayed as unyielding or rash, particularly as Mrs. Clinton sought to suggest that his temperament left him unsuited to serve in the Senate.
For Mrs. Clinton, the question is not whether to attack, but when. That said, her aides acknowledged that Mr. Lazio might prove to be a more elusive target than Mr. Giuliani, both because he is a more obscure candidate and because he makes what many Republicans described as a pleasing first impression.
The immediate struggle is a race to see which side succeeds in defining Mr. Lazio first over the next few weeks.
Even before Mr. Lazio announced, Mrs. Clinton's aides had researched his record and were preparing to paint him as a Republican partisan who would vote against New York interests in Congress.
Mr. Lazio has spent much of the last two weeks talking with New York and national Republicans, and that was apparent yesterday. He dismissed suggestions by Mrs. Clinton's aides that he was too partisan as "laughable," adding: "They're going to be talking about the old failed model of, 'Oh yeah, this guy is too this, or too that.' "
On one issue over which the two candidates have some disagreement -- abortion -- Mr. Lazio described Mrs. Clinton as extreme because she opposes a ban on some forms of late-term abortion. "I'm for a woman's right to choose, but I think it's not unlimited," Mr. Lazio said. "I favor the ban on partial birth. I think Mrs. Clinton takes the position to the extreme. I think I reflect where New Yorkers are and where America is. Not criminalizing abortion, but also not allowing a horrific procedure that even Ed Koch and Senator Moynihan condemn. She is on the fringes of this issue." Mr. Lazio also said yesterday that he opposed any public financing of abortions.
In his speech, Mr. Lazio presented himself as an ideological underdog against a candidate of the left. "This is an important race. It seems as though everyone throughout our great nation is watching us," he said. "And every possible liberal group from outside our state has lined up with our Democratic opponent. Well, I say, bring them on. From Washington, from Hollywood, from Arkansas."
Mr. Lazio's announcement came as his campaign sprang almost overnight into full life. Workers at his headquarters answered the phone "Lazio 2000" early yesterday, and Mr. Lazio's Web site urged voters to contribute money.
Newly hired staff members flew up from Washington, with a notable representation from the presidential campaigns of Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, and Senator John S. McCain of Arizona. Mr. Lazio's media adviser, Michael Murphy, performed the same role for Mr. Alexander in 1996.
The new Lazio campaign staff members struggled through a chaotic morning as they grappled with questions like where was Mr. Lazio's headquarters located (Bay Shore), and what was the area code (631), from an onslaught of news media that abandoned Mr. Giuliani at New York City Hall for Mr. Lazio's headquarters on Long Island with startling speed.
Across New York State, Republican leaders fell in line with Gov. George E. Pataki and the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers, and proclaimed not only their support for Mr. Lazio, but also their belief that he would prove to be an extremely formidable opponent to Mrs. Clinton, notwithstanding the obvious obstacles he faces. (Some Republicans went so far as to suggest privately that he was a better candidate than Mr. Giuliani would have ever been.)
"The race at the end of the day is going to be about who best can serve New York," said Zenia Mucha, the chief political aide to Mr. Pataki, "and based on his record in Congress, it's clearly going to be him." Drawing a contrast between Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton, she said he "understands what it means to be a New Yorker. She's in the process of learning. His basic philosophy is a smaller role of government for the people. Her basic philosophy is that government has all the answers."
Representative Peter F. King of Long Island withdrew from seeking the Republican nomination. He said yesterday morning that he did not want to cause any division within the Republican Party.
Republicans emphasized repeatedly that Mr. Lazio was more closely in tune with Republican positions on issues than Mr. Giuliani was.
"Personally speaking, I am a little more comfortable with Rick Lazio," said Stephen J. Minarik, the Monroe County Republican chairman. "He is more in line with the party."

HEADLINE: THE RACE FOR SENATE: THE CONGRESS;
Fight Already On for a House Seat That Could Prove Decisive

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
As Representative Rick A. Lazio suits up to become the Republican candidate for the United States Senate, politicians back home in his Long Island district are already fighting to succeed him in the House of Representatives.
Both major parties are expected to focus on the Second Congressional District seat that Mr. Lazio is vacating as one that could flip either way in the November election. The outcome there will help decide which side captures the majority in the House for the next two years. 
 "There will be war for this seat, and it will transcend Long Island because control of the House is very much at stake," said Alan Eysen, a political consultant who has worked for Republicans and Democrats.
Two Democrats -- the Suffolk County Legislature's minority leader, David A. Bishop, and the Huntington Town Board's majority leader, Steven J. Israel -- are competing for their party's nomination.
On the Republican side, the party's Suffolk County chairman, Anthony Apollaro, is trying to rally his forces behind the popular supervisor of the town of Islip, Peter McGowan.
Mr. Lazio's decision to run for the Senate makes his Congressional district one of the few open seats in the nation. Although the Second District has a roughly 2-to-1 Republican edge in voter enrollment, for 18 years it elected a Democrat, Thomas Downey, until Mr. Lazio defeated him in 1992.
"Long Islanders are a bunch of ticket splitters, especially in Suffolk," said Michael D. Dawidziak, a political consultant and longtime adviser to Mr. Lazio.
Mr. Lazio's district encompasses the middle-class South Shore communities of Babylon, where Democrats are the strongest, and Islip, which is staunchly Republican. It also includes part of Huntington, which is a swing area, and a small part of Smithtown. About 85 percent of the residents are white, but Hispanics are a growing minority, at 10 percent.
The sudden scramble for the Second District seat was prompted by Rudolph W. Giuliani's withdrawal from the Senate race on Friday. For months, Mr. Lazio had put his own senatorial ambitions on hold as Mr. Giuliani geared up a major campaign and raised millions of dollars.
When Mr. Lazio first explored running for the Senate, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Israel began maneuvering to succeed him. When he deferred to Mr. Giuliani, they pulled back. And now that Mr. Lazio is moving on, they are pouncing.
Mr. Bishop claimed the support of the party's leaders in the towns of Babylon and Islip, which make up most of the district. But Mr. Israel said he was prepared to mount a primary challenge.
Both Democrats are considered strong contenders.
Mr. Bishop, 35, is a lawyer who once was an intern for Senator Charles E. Schumer when he was a United States representative. Since 1993, Mr. Bishop has served in the Suffolk Legislature from the 14th District, a 2-to-1 Republican stronghold that is in the heart of the Congressional district. He points to his record of bipartisan cooperation in the County Legislature and says his main issues are the economy, education and the environment. He has a reputation as a dogged door-to-door campaigner.
Mr. Israel, 42, was an aide to Richard Ottinger, the former congressman. In 1993 he won a seat on the Huntington board and in later elections helped bring on two more Democrats to form a majority. He points to his record of bipartisan cooperation with the Republican town supervisor, Frank P. Petrone, in cutting taxes and rectifying finances. He calls himself a progressive on social issues and stresses child care and the environment. He is considered a gifted speaker and fund-raiser.
Among the Republicans, one stands above the rest. "They've got a 900-pound gorilla, and that's Pete McGowan," Mr. Dawidziak said. As an eight-year incumbent at the helm of a major town in the Congressional district, Mr. McGowan would be the most formidable Republican candidate, most party leaders agree.
But there is no shortage of other names being mentioned. They include two assemblymen, Philip M. Boyle and Thomas F. Barraga; two Islip Town Board members, Pamela Greene and Christopher Bodkin; a county legislator, Angie Carpenter; a Suffolk prosecutor, Pierce Cohalan; and a planning official who once ran against Mr. Downey, Harold Withers.

HEADLINE: CHINESE CONSIDER TRADE BILL IN U.S. VITAL TO REFORM

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL with JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 20

 BODY:
The Clinton administration has argued that Congress should vote for normal trade relations with China because it is in the United States' national security interest, strengthening reformist forces in China. And a huge number of influential Chinese agree.
These Chinese say their country is at a tipping point in its history: A yes vote on normal trade can propel it forward to greater liberalization and engagement with the West. A no vote from Congress will be seen as a slap in the face, throwing China back into conservatism and anti-American hatred. 
 "What's important is not how this vote will affect this or that industry," said Zhou Daichun, a commercial lawyer in Beijing. "What's important is that this is an opportunity to push for reform and reorganization in China and without that impetus, many reforms are impossible."
"If China is refused, it will give encouragement to conservatives here," he said. "And if you think about the reaction to the embassy bombing last year -- and how much the bombing affected Zhu Rongji -- you can imagine how serious that could be," he added, referring to the American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, last year, which reduced the influence of China's Western-leaning prime minister and sparked angry anti-American protests.
For millions of Chinese, the Congressional vote -- which, if positive, would ensure China's full participation in the World Trade Organization -- has taken on a transcendent aura beyond the boundaries of trade or politics.
A broad array of educated Chinese -- top government officials, publishers, bankers, artists, lawyers and pro-democracy advocates -- have come together in extraordinary agreement on the issue, investing their hope for progress in China in a contentious trade vote occurring 10,000 miles away.
Trade experts say that the implementation of agreements in China is likely to be slow and difficult. But Chinese government leaders and economists hope the normalization of trade with America will help close inefficient state enterprises. Authors and artists here are convinced it will reduce censorship. Lawyers suggest it will force China's mercurial judges to follow the law.
"For China, joining W.T.O is not just about trade concessions," said Xu Xiaonian, a general manager at China International Capital Corporation. "There is much, much more at stake."
The people who have the most at stake are some of China's top leaders, -- President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu, the country's chief proponent of the trade deal. Both have long campaigned for closer economic ties with the United States, a position that became much more controversial in China after last year's embassy bombing, which the United States has said was accidental.
These leaders want to open the Chinese market through the World Trade Organization, in part to attract new investment. But also, they are counting on international trading rules and the pressure from increased foreign competition to force forward the government's stalled economic reform plans -- from closing bankrupt factories to breaking up state monopolies and phasing out state housing.
While Mr. Zhu believes that such reforms are essential, they have proved politically difficult and the government is well behind schedule. Local industries have resisted downsizing and giving up state perks. Huge state businesses, like China Telecom, have refused to cede an ounce of power.
Mr. Jiang and Mr. Zhu are personally vulnerable, too, since they have pushed the trade pact despite the misgivings of internal opponents, who remain suspicious of the United States or who worry that competition will cause destabilizing unemployment in China's state industries. And if Congress snubs China, it will seriously weaken both their policies and their standing, injecting new tension into Chinese-American relations.
"If the vote doesn't pass, that will be a disaster for Jiang and Zhu since they are the main architects of the current foreign and economic policies, and these both depend on getting P.N.T.R.," or permanent normal trade relations, said a senior researcher at a government policy institute here.
"If they fail, they will have a tough task persuading ministries, provincial leaders and the military to go along with their reforms -- especially the military, who believe that China has been too soft on the U.S. and on Taiwan."
Senior American officials say that a no vote would have long-term repercussions, forcing a quick end to Mr. Zhu's career, and making it harder for Mr. Jiang to anoint a like-minded successor when he steps down as head of the party in 2002.
But in Beijing, when people sit at Starbucks discussing the American trade bill, it is not the fate of the party -- or even business -- that is the focus of concern. In fact, many people who have never before agreed with China's leaders find themselves similarly invested in China's trade status.
"Of course I support W.T.O, and of course this will be a very, very big thing here," said Zhang Yuan, a successful film director.
Mr. Zhang, whose work includes a current hit and several prior movies that have been banned, said he hoped for "more creative space" and less interference from government censors.
"For one thing, it will open doors to more investment into cinemas and the film industry, and that's good," he said. And he predicted that joining the world trade body would "push the leadership to relax its restrictions on subject matter" so that Chinese films could compete with the influx from Hollywood.
Even those normally at odds with the government appreciate the trade deal, convinced that the American pork, cars and dollars that are expected to flow into China if the trade vote passes will bring with it greater appreciation for liberal ideals.
"W.T.O membership might not serve to invoke a democratic breakthrough immediately, but it will certainly make Chinese people exposed as never before to liberal values and democratic institutions," said Liu Junning, who was recently fired from his job at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences for his reformist political stance. "Opening up is sometimes more important than reform for China."
And in the past 20 years, Chinese have seen how economics can drive vast social change. Most Chinese feel infinitely freer than a decade ago -- to travel, to make work choices, even -- among friends -- to make jokes about the government -- even though the Communist Party has maintained a political monopoly.
"The transformation of the economy that started in the 1980's has had all sorts of political and cultural effects in the last decade, and that's true despite 1989 and the lack of significant political reform," said Mr. Zhang, the director, referring to the year when the government violently suppressed demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
A commitment to the World Trade Organization will set off a new round of social and political changes, experts here say. "The political and social effects will be much more immediate than the economic, said Yan Xuetong, a researcher at the Chinese Institute of Contemporary International Relations.
In state sectors like banking, insurance and telecommunication, which would all have to open up to foreign companies, managers would have to change their practices in order to survive, often with an extended ripple effect.
China's banks would have to come up with better loan programs to assist the poor with college tuition, and factories would have to honor contracts that are now routinely breached. But Mr. Yan said the biggest boon would be less tangible, "changing people's attitudes and their psychology in important and positive ways."
In some areas -- like law -- the link between joining the world trade body and social change is quite direct. Mr. Zhou, the lawyer, said he likes to think of W.T.O. membership as "reformatting" Chinese business and legal culture.
He said that many offices in China, like the trademark bureau, are run according internal rules and regulations that are not publicly available. But, he predicted, if China enters the World Trade Organization, "disputes like this will be solved by the courts, not by bureaucratic means."
"The agreement will affect not just trade law and copyright law, but also civil and criminal procedure laws," he said. "Entry into W.T.O. will help clean up and regularize the legislative and judicial systems."
In other areas, the influence will be more subtle. An Dun, a best-selling author and journalist, welcomes the trade bill for the increased copyright protection it will bring to a country where pirated books and compact discs generally outnumber legitimate ones.
But Ms. An, who has at times clashed with authorities over her frank discussion of teenage pregnancies, infidelity and prostitution, said she also has a larger hope: that joining the world economic community will lead to greater freedom of speech, so that she can write some books she still dares not write today.
"Of course, the structure of publishing can't change quickly because publishers are controlled by the state," she said, sipping tea in a stylish suit, about to fly off on a national book tour. "But the control is a deep thing, partly in people's minds. And, with more intellectual commerce between China and the West, people's thoughts and concepts can change."
She and others predicted that more liberal trade practices might well induce the government to adopt a new publishing law that would permit private publishers, albeit with some restrictions, a proposal that has been circulating in government circles for several years.
Despite their nearly boundless hope for the trade deal, most informed Chinese acknowledge that it will also mean considerable economic pain. Indeed, many people in and out of the government see the trade deal as a kind of tough love that will help the central government make the difficult changes that it is unable or unwilling to make by itself.
"Today there is no leader like Deng Xiaoping, and the leadership must strike a balance between different political groups," said Mr. Xu, the financial analyst. "They lack the power to overcome the resistance of groups who are hurt by reform, and that's why globalization has been slowing down, like a train losing steam.
"The leaders are counting on outside forces, on global competition, to overcome that resistance and push the transformation of the economy. And they are willing to risk higher unemployment and instability in the short term for economic efficiency and growth in the long run, as they see few other ways."
With hopes running so high and a new deal between China and the European Union now sealed, a no vote from Congress would be emotionally devastating, experts say.
"Because this agreement is so good for us, they would not see rejection of this trade measure as just an act of Congress, but as a major restatement of policy -- a declaration that we see them as the enemy," said Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser. "The consequences could be enormous."
The shock will be greatly magnified because the Chinese news media have not said much about the heated debates in America, featuring instead mostly supporters.

HEADLINE: MEDICINE MERCHANTS: A special report.;
Drug Makers and 3rd World: Study in Neglect

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: OMUGO, Uganda

 BODY:
Jabbing, apologizing and then jabbing again, it takes Harriet Ayikoru nearly 20 minutes to find a usable vein beneath the sleeves of the sad old Tweety Bird T-shirt that Sentina Drajiru wears, and when the melarsoprol goes in, Ms. Drajiru winces.
Again and again she lightly touches her arm to show exactly where she feels the sharp tip of the pain as the medicine simmers up it. 
 It is like eating chili peppers, she says, only it is inside her.
"Once you use this drug, the vein is spoiled," says Miss Ayikoru, a nurse in the thatched clinic here. "As it is corrosive, it erodes the inside layer. So the relapses like her are the hardest cases -- the scar tissue is there even six months later."
Melarsoprol, invented almost 70 years ago, is melarsen oxide dissolved in propylene glycol -- literally, arsenic in antifreeze. It kills 5 percent of those treated with it. But it is the only medicine available to treat advanced sleeping sickness, one of the historic scourges of Africa, which was nearly wiped out 50 years ago, but has made a comeback.
The only alternative ran out in July. The manufacturer, which abandoned it as unprofitable when it turned out to be useless against its intended target, cancer, has made one last batch, enough for 1,000 patients. But 300,000 people are infected each year.
Sleeping sickness is perhaps the most vivid example of the disconnection between the world's pharmaceutical giants and the fatal or debilitating diseases of the third world's poor.
These ailments go untreated or badly treated not just because the poor cannot afford the drugs they need, though that is a serious problem, but because the drugs themselves do not exist. The pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invent them. Companies decline to invest the huge sums needed to chase a cure they know their potential customers cannot afford.
According to IMS Health of Westport, Conn., a marketing research firm that studies the industry, Africa accounts for 1 percent of world drug sales, while North America, Japan and Western Europe account for 80 percent. It is for them the companies invent a stream of high-priced, highly profitable drugs.
"The poor have no consumer power, so the market has failed them," said Dr. James Orbinski, international president of Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres, the medical agency whose work in war zones and in the third world won it the Nobel Peace Prize last year. "I'm tired of the logic that says, 'He who can't pay, dies.' "
Pharmaceutical executives reluctantly concur with his assessment. Told that the industry's critics say it would rather find a cure for a bald American than a dying African, Francois Gros, a spokesman for Aventis, the French-German pharmaceutical company that makes three of the four sleeping sickness drugs, ruefully acknowledged: "That's not completely wrong. We know what's happening in the third world, but we don't act."
He continued: "We can't deny that we try to focus on top markets -- cardiovascular, metabolism, anti-infection, etc. But we're an industry in a competitive environment -- we have a commitment to deliver performance for shareholders."
 
Predictable Behavior
Health experts also recognize this reality. "A blockbuster drug makes them $1 billion to $1.5 billion a year," said a senior World Health Organization official. "If you're running the R & D department of one of these companies, you're under a lot of pressure, and they're going to invest in things they see a market for. Their behavior is perfectly predictable."
As a result, many health policy makers now argue that the world's governments must somehow force the world's pharmaceutical manufacturers to turn their attention to diseases like sleeping sickness, malaria, tuberculosis, leishmaniasis and the various burrowing worms that kill or cripple millions each year in Africa, Asia and South America. The last truly new drug for tuberculosis, for example, which kills two million people a year, was invented over 30 years ago.
To do so, they say, rich nations must either pay the manufacturers directly, offer them tax breaks, dangle before them the carrot of longer patents on their most lucrative drugs, or, in acute crises, simply allow poor countries to declare health emergencies and seize the patents to make their own generic versions or buy them from India, Brazil or other countries that ignore Western patent law.
 Earlier this month, five major pharmaceutical companies announced that they were entering negotiations with the W.H.O. to voluntarily lower their prices on their AIDS drugs to Africa by as much as 80 percent. But last week, at a global convention of health ministers at the W.H.O.'s headquarters in Geneva, the ministers of many poor nations said that was not enough. They asked the W.H.O. to create a database of all prices for AIDS drugs, including the cheapest generics from countries that do not honor American or European patents, and to help them change their patent laws so they could buy them.
The pharmaceutical industry invests $27 billion a year in research, but most of that is a hunt for drugs to lengthen or brighten the lives of consumers who are already relatively healthy. Among the biggest sellers are drugs to grow hair, relieve impotence or fight cholesterol, ulcers, depressions, anxiety, allergies, arthritis and high blood pressure.
"Pharmaceutical companies will always aim for maximum profits by marketing a new obesity drug rather than pioneering a novel malaria treatment," said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, who heads the Doctors Without Borders campaign to get affordable drugs into the more than 80 countries where the group works. "When new vaccines or medicines are developed, most of the world's population is left out of the picture."
Market research is now just as important as science in guiding the decisions of drug companies. While executives decline to say publicly how much potential profit a drug must have to interest them, many spoke privately to W.H.O. researchers doing a 1998 study of why new tuberculosis drugs were not being made.
"The major companies are aiming for $1 billion at peak sales," the study concluded. "Targets vary for companies, but many want to generate a minimum of $200 million per annum."
According to a study led by Dr. Pecoul, of the 1,233 new medicines patented between 1975 and 1997, only 13 -- 1 percent -- were for tropical diseases.
Even of those, only 4 came from efforts by pharmaceutical companies to cure humans. The 9 others came from work done by the United States Army for the Vietnam War or from research for livestock or the pet market, which industry representatives say could be a gold mine. Already, Novartis makes a drug to treat separation anxiety in dogs, and Pfizer has one for dog Alzheimer's.
No major company is doing new research on sleeping sickness.
The town of Omugo in northwest Uganda, a strip of crumbly red clay stores and thatched mud houses that resemble chocolates in straw hats, is at the center of the sleeping sickness epidemic that goes deep into both war-torn Congo and war-torn Sudan.
The colonial-era programs that sprayed insecticide, cleared riverine brush, treated patients and moved whole villages away from fly-infested areas are no more than an ancestral memory now. Fifty years of shifting civil wars have rebuilt the two reservoirs of the disease: biting flies and untreated people.
And a new outbreak has begun in Uganda's southeast, said Dr. Dowson S. Mbulamberi, who heads the Ugandan Health Ministry's efforts against vector-borne diseases like sleeping sickness. His is a daunting task. Uganda's health budget amounts to $12 per citizen per year, less than the cost of one tsetse fly trap.
Sleeping sickness is actually far too benign a name for human African trypanosomiasis. It is spread by the bite of tsetse fly, the scissor-winged glossina species found from Senegal to Somalia to South Africa. In its saliva, the small fly injects a protozoan that it picks up from feasting on another infected person.
The symptoms start with low fevers, itchy skin, joint pain and lethargy. But weeks later, when the parasites enter the brain, patients begin hallucinating or acting wildly. They have been known to chase family members with machetes, shout all night, throw themselves into latrines, and pillage other villagers' plots of cassava or bananas to feed ravenous appetites. Their skins get so sensitive that cool water or a gentle touch makes them scream. Only at the end do they lapse into a lassitude so great that they cannot feed themselves. Then they sink into a coma and die.
At one time, British tsetse control reportedly included "fly boys" -- young men who stood shirtless in the bush slapping flies and were paid a bounty for each killed. Because the fly likes dense brush near water, the illness particularly affects women and the babies they carry on their backs as they collect water or wash clothes. If infected, even babies must suffer melarsoprol treatment.
 
Witchcraft Blamed, Too
Villagers fear sleeping sickness so much that some laboratory workers say they are testing for malaria, which is known to be treatable. In the villages, rumors say it is spread by eating pork, by sex and by witchcraft, said Martin Andama, who visits villages to test people for the disease as part of a Doctors Without Borders program.
Jovina Oleru, a woman who was cured and returned to nurse her son, still stubbornly believes that she is sick because her family is angry at her husband.
"My husband only paid three cattle for me when I got married, and I have given him three children," she said. "So my family really got nothing for bride-wealth, and they feel bad about me and perhaps wish me to die."
That, she indicated, made more sense to her than the idea that flies make humans sick.
"Hospitalization" here is cheap; the 60-foot-long ward has a cement floor, brick walls, a straw roof and plastic sheeting for windows. Patients are charged nothing, but each has to bring an "attendant" from home, who sleeps on the floor, collects firewood and cooks over a fire in the brick hut in the field outside.
One day recently Alfred M. Guma, 32, a farmer who grows sorghum and tobacco on his small plot near Omugo, smoothed the rough blanket on his cot in the ward where he was waiting out the 21-day stay required for melarsoprol treatment. He was in Stage 2, meaning the parasites had reached the spinal fluid bathing his brain, which is serious, though the disease had been caught early.
"My brother Steven had a mental breakdown," he said. "He began to see things that others could not see -- wild animals, dead people coming to him at night. He feared having a bath and became aggressive if you touched him, jumping back as if he had touched fire."
For 14-year-old Steven, the family finally improvised an ambulance: they used old clothing to tie him into a box on wheels behind a bicycle and took him to a hospital. That was five years ago; Steven, cured, is now in high school.
Only four drugs are known to work against sleeping sickness and all four are in trouble. Their problems show how the open marketplace that works so well for Americans still fails the world's poor.
One is from Bayer, the German pharmaceutical giant. Three are made by Aventis, whose headquarters are in Strasbourg, France. That is a coincidence; Aventis was formed in mergers of French, German and American companies, three of which just happened to make drugs used against trypanosomiasis.
At $50 for a course of treatment, melarsoprol is relatively inexpensive, and Aventis has promised to keep making it for as long as needed.
"But it's a terrible drug -- you don't feel proud injecting it," said Dr. Christine Genevier, director of the Doctors Without Borders program in Uganda. "It's caustic, it burns them, and you don't know if you are going to save your patient or kill them."
Now a strain of melarsoprol-resistant sleeping sickness is spreading. Up to a quarter of the Omugo patients have it, so even if they survive the painful injections they may die anyway.
"It's a risky product," admitted Alain Aumonier, director of international corporate policy for Aventis. "We won't claim the opposite."
The second drug, Eflornithine, known as DFMO and sold under the name Ornidyl, is the best treatment for melarsoprol-resistant patients. Originally developed as an anticancer drug, its usefulness against sleeping sickness was uncovered by chance in the 1980's; it proved so spectacular at pulling people out of their final comas that it was nicknamed "the Resurrection Drug."
But it is expensive, about $210 per course. Worse, the manufacturer, an American subsidiary of Aventis, abandoned the compound in 1995 when it proved ineffective against cancer.
Last year, pressed by the W.H.O. and Doctors Without Borders, whose supply was running out, the company found 500 pounds of a precursor chemical in Indianapolis and made one last batch of 7,800 vials. The chemical is difficult to work with because it is unstable and corrodes piping; assuring a steady supply would mean building a whole new production line, Mr. Aumonier said, which the company declines to do.
Instead, in December, it signed the patent rights over to the W.H.O., which is seeking a new manufacturer. An Egyptian candidate proved unable to meet quality standards. A Texas company offered to make it at $60 a vial, treble the old price. That is too much; the search goes on.
 
A More Exciting Prospect
Mr. Aumonier said Aventis made the last batch and turned over the patent out of a sense of charity. "And now we feel trapped by what we've done," he said. "We are reproached for not doing enough when we could have done nothing."
Meanwhile, to the disgust of Dr. Pecoul, interest in the precursor chemical has suddenly soared because it might prevent the growth of facial hair in women. Gillette, the razor company, is doing research on it, "because they think it might be a huge market," he said.
The third drug is Pentamidine, which is useful only against Stage 1, when the parasites are confined to the blood. Treatment takes only 10 days. Under the brand name Lomodine, the drug has been around since 1941. But in the AIDS epidemic of the 1980's it was slightly reformulated and renamed Pentacarinat, and its price soared from $1 a vial to $30 when it was found to work against pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, once one of the chief killers of people with AIDS.
Despite the price increase, the manufacturer, a British company that became part of Aventis last year, has been supplying it free to the W.H.O. for use against trypanosomiasis. But last year, Mr. Aumonier and health agency officials said, Aventis told the W.H.O. it wanted to raise the price gradually to market level, probably $14 a vial, by the year 2004. The health agencies protested and the company is reconsidering, Mr. Aumonier said.
Finally, there is Suramin, made by Bayer, which has been used since 1920, also only against Stage 1. It costs less than $50 per course of treatment.
It has no other uses, so, a 1999 W.H.O. report said, "Bayer wished to stop production, but maintained it on the grounds that no other alternatives were available."
Franz-Jozef Bohle, a Bayer spokesman, said the company was trying to be a good corporate citizen, and was discussing the supply of three drugs for tropical diseases with the W.H.O.
Pharmaceutical industry executives say they cannot be expected to shoulder the burden of diseases of the poor alone. "The industry has never been philanthropic," said Mr. Gros, the Aventis spokesman. "It has always produced products with an aim to getting a return on investment."
If rich nations are unwilling to pay for drugs for poor ones, if poor countries continue to spend fortunes on weapons and if their doctors keep leaving to work in the West, he said, it is not the fault of the pharmaceutical industry.
"I like that statement 'Access to medicine is a human right,' " said Mr. Aumonier of Aventis, quoting an aphorism frequently used by health advocates. "But it's a right that should be enforced by the whole community. May I suggest that the pharmaceutical industry is only part of that community? It also includes the health care system, the social system, even the patient.
"What's to be done if the poor are too poor to buy drugs on the free market? Does government act sufficiently? To say to industry, 'You make money, so you must enforce this human right alone' -- this, somewhere, is wrong."
 
The Cause of Chaos
Mr. Bohle made a similar point, saying Bayer was willing to make some drugs available cheaply, but wiping out an epidemic took much more: hospitals, follow-up tests, record-keeping, tsetse fly control and other elements.
Daniel Berman, who works with Dr. Pecoul at Doctors Without Borders, said he was troubled by such industry arguments. "O.K., they didn't actually cause the problem," he said. "But are they an important factor in the drugs not being produced? Absolutely."
"When we're there we can distribute them," he said. "The limiting factor for us is price. But when a company abandons a drug, there's chaos."
Taking account of the trend of the last decade in which many companies have been forced into mergers because their relatively low stock prices made them tempting targets to competition, Mr. Bohle conceded that Bayer did little research on tropical disease.
"You have to relativize this," he said. "A company can support some research without being paid off, but not much. Especially with the pressure on shareholder value. I remember when shareholder value was not important at all, and now it's the main driver. There's always the threat of being taken over."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on May 21 about the lack of research by major drug companies into diseases that affect impoverished Africans referred incorrectly to the discovery that the drug Eflornithine, developed as an anticancer drug, cures African sleeping sickness. It was made through research by several scientists, not by chance. A letter dated July 14 from a researcher pointing out the error was addressed to a vacationing correspondent overseas and received only yesterday.

A Powerful Banker's Other Hat

BYLINE: By DEAN SMITH 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C.

 BODY:
HUGH L. McCOLL Jr., chairman and chief executive of Bank of America, was on the warpath again. "I'll be damned if anyone calls me 'gutless,' " he said as he stalked the newsroom of the local paper, looking for the writer who used that word to describe business leaders like him in a column on downtown revitalization.
With the same determination he has brought to building the nation's largest bank, Mr. McColl, in the home state of Sen. Jesse Helms, has braved the opposition of local politicians and some of his shareholders to pursue civic goals that he frankly describes as liberal. 
 Here he is a power broker both feared and admired, known to allies as Uncle Hugh and to foes as Little Caesar. His thumbs up or down on a big-ticket civic project reveals his philosophy while going a long way to determining its fate.
A children's library and theater complex? "Very important to us," he said, and $27 million in county bonds he supported will set it in motion this year. A publicly funded sports arena? "A $220 million giveaway," he said, and demanded that the Charlotte Hornets N.B.A. team put up "serious money" before the project goes forward.
His willingness to pursue his civil rights and urban renewal goals nationally has helped earn him recognition as Bill Clinton's favorite banker. One minute, Mr. McColl is thundering that Wall Street is undervaluing his bank's stock -- stalled at around $50 from a high above $74 as investors wait for the 1998 merger of Mr. McColl's NationsBank and BankAmerica to pay off. The next, he is cooing about his company's widely admired record of seeking diversity.
Mr. McColl has had Mr. Clinton's ear since they met in 1992. The businessman was happy to find a politician who could discuss the minutiae of interstate banking rules. In "McColl: The Man with America's Money" (Longstreet Press, 1999), Ross Yockey says Mr. McColl helped persuade Mr. Clinton of the wisdom of loosening these rules, helping Mr. McColl to build a 21-state empire with assets of $656 billion.
And the future president was happy to find a banker committed to financing inner-city and minority-owned businesses. Bank of America announced this month that it made $39 billion in such community reinvestment loans last year.
In no way, though, does Mr. McColl, who is married with three children, wear his politics more obviously than in his support of the arts. When a production of "Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia," Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, prompted conservative politicians to eliminate $2.5 million in county arts funds in 1997, Mr. McColl, a champion of gay rights whose bank extends health coverage to same-sex partners, raised money in 1998 to defeat them. Newly elected Democrats restored the money last year.
"I guess, by today's definition, I'm a liberal," he says, looking back on an ugly political fight that he felt blackened the city's eye. "The reason I am is, I believe that a chief guarantee of our country, of citizenship, is the right of freedom of speech, the right to be who we are."
But who elected Mr. McColl, his local adversaries ask. "I was aghast," Hoyle Martin, one of the defeated county commissioners, said of hearing that Mr. McColl was working against him. "We can't let big business run everything."
Mr. McColl's social crusading might seem at odds with his image as a hard-charging ex-Marine known for the hand grenade he kept on his desk. But Mr. McColl, who grew up in the small town of Bennettsville, S.C., was offended when he returned home after training with blacks in boot camp to hear friends using racial epithets. As a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he witnessed a cross-burning.
Watching his mother draw in charcoal and sculpt in clay stimulated his interest in the arts. Mr. McColl's 25-year friendship with the fresco painter Ben Long has inspired him to make Bank of America one of the nation's top arts donors.
Executives who do not share his enthusiasms grumble about the tacitly required donations to the United Way and the local arts council. But Mr. McColl is unapologetic: "I think of it as community development money and marketing money, but mainly community development."
From shareholders, Mr. McColl has run into resistance over the company's political donations and his own pay, valued by experts at more than $70 million last year. At the bank's annual meeting last month, shareholders presented resolutions to end political contributions and restrict the board's executive pay committee to outside directors. Both proposals failed, but the pay resolution received 14.5 percent of the vote -- high for any measure opposed by a corporate board.
But those who do not like Mr. McColl or his politics had better not take too much comfort from his turning 65 next month. While some shareholders expected him to announce his retirement plans at the meeting last month, Mr. McColl said nothing about leaving.

 Bobos In Paradise
 The New Upper Class
 and How They Got There.
 By David Brooks.
 284 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $25. 
 EVEN though in college I played at being a Marxist -- neo-Marxist" being the phrase of choice, just as a few years later I became a "neoliberal" -- my favorite sociology class was a seminar taught by Daniel Bell, whom the New Left punks he was teaching at the time considered a neocon fogy. Exactly 25 years ago, Bell was explaining to us his ideas about the end of ideology, the cultural contradictions of capitalism, the coming of postindustrial society and, finally, the rise of the "new class" -- that emerging elite of language and symbol manipulators, Brie-eating, wine-sipping lawyers and journalists and creative directors, high-end hard-working quasi bohemians, hedonistic meritocrats, people like us. Indeed, Bell's vision suggested that Harvard Square was a prototype for the new age -- that, soon, simulacra of our smug, twee neighborhood would be concocted all over America, and thus the universal signifiers of upscale would be ochre-walled coffeehouses serving labor-intensive European coffees, Marimekkoesque shops selling haute-design everything, huge bookstores with unimaginably vast magazine racks and old brick warehouses-cum-shopping malls patronized by computer-fluent young adults wearing chinos and bluejeans.
Bell's social forecasting was prescient. What's more, that brief period -- 1975 and 1976 -- looks in hindsight like a seminal American moment. It did not seem so then. The spirit of the time was tapped-out, vague and vaguely decadent, a kind of bewildered morning-after slough. But consider the defining events and leading indicators: the Vietnam War ended and Ronald Reagan first ran for president, the oldest baby boomers turned 30 and the youngest baby boomers entered puberty, Jann Wenner moved Rolling Stone from a hippie dump in San Francisco to a fancy building in midtown Manhattan, "Saturday Night Live" went on the air, an underdressed liberal who quoted Bob Dylan and carried his own luggage became president, the Apple II was invented and Microsoft was founded -- all in a single two-year period.
What was germinating, and reached full efflorescence only during the last decade, was the reign of the bourgeois bohemian -- the Bobo, in David Brooks's phrase. He calls "Bobos in Paradise" a work of "comic sociology," and it's hard to imagine any other sort of sociology that could depict this caste so well. What makes the book work, aside from its intelligence and nearly pitch-perfect humor, is the fact that Brooks, who's a political conservative, confesses to being a Bobo himself. "Bobos in Paradise" is not a screed but a mixture of heartfelt fondness and dead-on ridicule, animated by an energetic, glass-half-full ambivalence -- all in all, a very Bobo achievement.
Brooks says the new Bobo hegemony appeared starkly to him when he returned to America after a few years abroad during the 1990's. He found that his hometown, a regular upper-middle-class Pennsylvania suburb, suddenly had half a dozen gourmet coffee shops, a fabulous independent bookseller, a store called the Great Harvest Bread Company ("spare, so you won't think there is any salesmanship going on"), a Santa Monica-style restaurant called Teresa's Cafe and shop after shop selling "hand-painted TV armoires" and "fat smelly candles." He found that the premium parts of white-bread America had become entirely whole-wheat and focaccia. "Hip lawyers were wearing those teeny tiny steel-framed glasses because now it was apparently more prestigious to look like Franz Kafka than Paul Newman. . . . The bohemian and the bourgeois were all mixed up . . . rebel attitudes and social-climbing attitudes all scrambled together." In short, "people seemed to have combined the countercultural 60's and the achieving 80's into one social ethos."
This is a big idea. One of the prime narratives of the postwar era has been the inexorable discrediting of the style and values of the traditional bourgeoisie, first by an avant-garde of intellectuals and beatniks, then by hippies and the youthquake generally and in the end by the merrily capitulating mainstream culture itself. The revolution triumphed, at least in a lite, everyone-can-play home version. Yet, at the same time, the political agendas of the countercultural left were rejected repeatedly, overwhelmingly and, during the 80's and early 90's, definitively. The long economic expansion, our cold war victory and the marvels of digital technology combined to reignite American optimism.
So today we inhabit the 50's redux, with the luckier half of Americans exceptionally fat and happy. But in order to be fat and happy nowadays, the bourgeoisie insists on wearing jeans and sneakers, on watching movies ("American Beauty") and television shows ("The Sopranos") that would have been banned in the 50's. This is a new and improved 50's, in which Dobie Gillis and Maynard G. Krebs have merged. If you've ever been unsure about the meaning of "dialectic" -- thesis (stuffed-shirt squares), antithesis (generation-'68 vagabonds), synthesis (Bobos) -- here it is, precisely and entertainingly rendered.
Brooks nails Bobos' have-it-both-ways slipperiness with a tolerant smile. "Millionaire moviemakers tend to be merciless when depicting millionaire businessmen and lawyers." And: "This is an elite that has been raised to oppose elites. They are affluent yet opposed to materialism. They may spend their lives selling yet worry about selling out. They are by instinct antiestablishmentarian yet somehow sense they have become a new establishment." And again: "They are prosperous without seeming greedy; they have pleased their elders without seeming conformist; they have risen toward the top without too obviously looking down on those below."
Brooks's big-tent bohemianism doesn't run very deep, of course. It is mainly about the things Bobos own. But that doesn't mean it's insignificant in an age when Americans' self-identity is probably most intensely a function of their consumer choices (as opposed to their political and religious choices). "People in this class like to see themselves and their friends as balancing opposites. . . . Selecting music, you need Patsy Cline songs mixed in with the Mendelssohn." Elsewhere he observes: "The companies that sell to us have developed careful marketing strategies for people who disdain marketing. They help make shopping seem a bit like an honors project at Bennington College."
Brooks smartly posits Jane Jacobs's 1961 book, "The Life and Death of Great American Cities," as the key manifesto of modern Bobo-ism, since Jacobs "reconciles the bourgeois love of order with the bohemian love of emancipation." But his history doesn't extend back much beyond the 50's. In fact, Emerson, Thoreau and especially Twain were ur-Bobos. And in its epicurean mixture of democratic and aristocratic values, Bobo-ism was flourishing among American homosexuals and the European middle classes decades before the United States had a single alternative newspaper or Starbucks.
Bohemian style is one thing -- it's not hard to dress and eat and decorate in some buffed-up approximation of Jack Kerouac or Jackson Pollock, even if one is a $400-an-hour knowledge management consultant or a $180,000-a-year vice president of sales. The trickier, more complicated revisionism was making business itself an endeavor worthy of the intelligent and with-it. Bobos "didn't go out hungry for money. But money found them," Brooks says. "The one realm of American life where the language of 1960's radicalism remains strong is the business world." Entrepreneurs have been recast as maverick crusaders lighting out into uncharted territory, risking all to build the future. The business magazine Fast Company, for instance, published out of an exposed-brick loft in Boston and as thick with advertising as it is earnest with exhortations to enlightenment, is a pure expression of Bobo capitalism. "Business is not about making money," Brooks writes, "it's about doing something you love. Life should be an extended hobby." "It's about working for a company as cool as you are."
"Bobos in Paradise" takes a 90-degree but-seriously-folks turn in the last 50 pages. Brooks gives his caste credit for most of the improvements in American life since 1980 or so, and he defends the Bobo moral temperament: "This is a morality . . . that doesn't try to perch atop the high ground of divine revelation." Bobos "like spiritual participation but are cautious of moral crusades and religious enthusiasms. . . . They tolerate a little lifestyle experimentation, so long as it is done safely and moderately. They are offended by concrete wrongs, like cruelty and racial injustice, but are relatively unmoved by lies or transgressions that don't seem to do anyone obvious harm. . . . This is a good morality for building a decent society."
When large majorities share such a pragmatic, live-and-let-live sensibility, politics inevitably withers in importance. Today, national politics matters seriously only to people in Washington and to ideologues -- the latter, in this Bobo age, holding on for dear life to their historical demonologies, the hard-core right still harping on the 60's as the source of America's supposed decline, the hard-core left still bemoaning the Reaganite 80's as the beginning of the end of hope. Bobos pursue a third way: they find plenty to like about the 60's and the 80's. As Brooks notes, paraphrasing the scholar Mark Lilla: "The central disagreement today is not the 60's versus the 80's. It is between those who have fused the 60's and the 80's on one side" -- the hands-off, hang-loose majority of Americans under 55 -- and those who reject the fusion on the other." The electoral result is a style of governance that is "centrist, muddled and if anything, anti-ideological."
Which for now, Brooks seems to agree, is a pretty good public policy M.O. Maybe, however, because he lives inside the Beltway and works for a political journal (The Weekly Standard), Brooks feels obliged to deliver a commencement-speech plea to Bobos to throw themselves into politics. It seems halfhearted and unconvincing. Living in Washington appears to have rendered Brooks oblivious of the entrepreneurial fevers and digital utopianism now raging across Bobo America. "We are not living in an age of transition," he writes, and, "We Bobos don't look to the future for transcendence." Huh? David Brooks needs to catch up on his back issues of Fast Company and Wired. And doesn't having children make Bobos look strictly to the future for transcendence?
The writing is sometimes too cute ("it's genius and geniality that enable you to join the elect"; "we're by now all familiar with modern-day executives who have moved from S.D.S. to C.E.O., from LSD to I.P.O."), and the archness can get one-note and unrelenting. For comedy's sake, Brooks goes over the top in portraying Bobos as Mother Jones lefties. But those are quibbles. The book is a pleasure, simultaneously bracing and comforting, like a sauna. Bracing because it should make hypocritical, self-satisfied Bobos cop to their complicated hypocrisies and self-satisfactions. And comforting (to Bobos) because it says their cultural imperium will endure. "In truth it is hard to see how the rule of the meritocrats could ever come to an end," Brooks says. "The meritocratic Bobo class is rich with the spirit of self-criticism. It is flexible and amorphous enough to co-opt that which it does not already command." As flexible and self-critical -- and, at best, as funny and smart -- as "Bobos in Paradise."

HEADLINE: NEW ECONOMY;
Law firms rushed to raise salaries to stem an exodus to start-ups. Now, the bill is coming due.

BYLINE: By David Leonhardt 

 BODY:
CONSIDER this logic problem: Event A causes Event B. B then causes C, and C causes D. Now assume A had never happened. Would D have ever occurred?
This is the multimillion-dollar hypothetical question that the nation's top corporate lawyers find themselves uncomfortably pondering after a wild five months that have altered the American legal industry. If the answer to the question is no -- and there is some strong evidence to support that conclusion -- then the country's most prestigious law firms appear to have given themselves an unnecessary and expensive headache. 
 In their pain are lessons about the problems that overvalued equity prices can cause even for businesses that seem to have little relation to the stocks in question.
The legal world's chain reaction had its beginnings last year in Silicon Valley. With fast-growing Internet companies desperate for employees, the Bay Area's law firms became prime hunting grounds. Dozens of young, well-educated associates were more than happy to accept the offers, leaving behind legal work that can resemble drudgery to receive stock options that could be worth millions. Turnover at the law firms soon hit new highs.
The young lawyers' bosses began responding just before the new year. Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, a small firm in Menlo Park, Calif., led the way, increasing associates' salary as much as 40 percent. Larger Bay Area firms quickly matched and, to avoid morale problems, extended the raises to lawyers in offices around the country.
That was the key moment, the one that turned a local problem -- the dot-com talent war -- into a national phenomenon. The biggest New York firms, which had always paid the highest salaries in the nation, then had little choice but to match the increases or risk losing their best lawyers to the East Coast branches of their California rivals. By the spring, first-year associates at top firms across the country were earning $125,000 a year, not including annual bonuses that often exceed $15,000.
All the while, however, something ironic was happening. At the very companies stealing the lawyers, stock prices stopped rising. Between Jan. 1 and April 1, the Morgan Stanley Internet index fell 5 percent. In April, as everybody now knows, the real drop came. The index lost an additional 30 percent of its value in the first two weeks.
Dozens of dot-com companies, running through their cash and no longer confident of being able to turn to the capital markets for another infusion, began to conduct business differently. Private companies had to delay their initial public offerings, making them less able to offer rich salary packages. Suddenly, the value of millions of stock options was in question.
It was a rapid change from the two previous years, when many of the lawyers who left behind law firm life for the Internet quickly became millionaires, at least on paper. "It appeared to people for a while that if you reached for the brass ring, you grasped it," said Frederick Muto, a partner who oversees the San Diego office of Cooley Godward, one of the firms with headquarters in Silicon Valley. "That perception has changed already."
The result is predictable: turnover at many California law firms has returned to normal levels. The big raises have surely played some role in the decrease, but both partners and associates say the biggest factor has been the technology slump. After all, notes William F. Lee, the managing partner of Hale & Dorr in Boston, "we could never pay people enough" to match the upside of stock options.
Consider what happened in the San Francisco office of Brobeck Phleger & Harrison, another big California firm. On April 14 -- the same day the Nasdaq hit its low for the year -- the lawyers there held a going-away party for a senior associate who was quitting to join an Internet company. On Saturday, a venture-capital firm backed out of a large investment it had been planning to make in the company. On Sunday, the lawyer called a partner to ask if she could have her job back. On Monday, she was sitting in her office again "as if nothing had ever happened," said Tower C. Snow Jr., the firm's chairman.
Over all, Brobeck's turnover rate for associates is running at an annual pace of about 16 percent this year. Because many fewer lawyers have left the last two months than in January and February, Mr. Snow said he expected the final number to be close to 11 percent, the same as in 1998. Last year, by contrast, nearly one-fourth of all Brobeck associates quit the firm.
So the match that started the brush fire that grew into a forest fire has now been extinguished. The lawyers who run the large firms are reluctant to say they regret giving the raises -- which would be tantamount to saying their own employees are overvalued -- but many partners agree that had the market downturn come sooner, salaries might not be at their current level.
"There's no question the environment would have been different," said Alan S. Jaffe, the chairman of Proskauer Rose in New York.
Mr. Snow added: "A lot of the firms were very, very unhappy to make the adjustments. I'm sure they're even more unhappy now."
One could argue that the firms overreacted in the first place and that the decline of many technology stocks in early 2000 should have suggested that the associate exodus would soon slow. On the other hand, any individual firm that did not give raises risked losing lawyers immediately, as would probably happen if the firms now tried to scale back salaries to their earlier levels.
For the most profitable firms, the raises may do little other than cut the partners' annual pay by a hundred thousand dollars or so. But some firms are already considering steps that include raising their billing rates, cutting back on hiring, using lawyer-for-hire agencies more often and even withdrawing from some areas of the law. The drying up of the market for initial public offerings and the Federal Reserve's recent interest-rate increases could make cost-cutting more urgent if the lawyers' revenue begins to slow, too.
In other words, the nation's biggest law firms are learning a tough lesson about a downside of the new economy. For everybody else, the moral of the story may be more familiar: be wary of accepting investment advice from your lawyer.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Renting Software and the Skills to Go With It

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
For the last year, Rave Sports, a small, privately held maker of inflatable water trampolines that is based in St. Paul, has been scrambling to keep up with its sales.
The last thing its executives wanted was the expense of hiring a computing staff to manage the company's accounting and sales management systems. So as a lot of other small-business executives do these days, Rave's chief financial officer, Pat Golden, decided to "rent" its main business software from one of a growing number of Internet companies known as A.S.P.'s. 
 An A.S.P. -- short for application service provider -- uses the Internet to offer a range of software and technology-related services that would otherwise be performed by internal departments at the customer's company.
Some customers are contracting with application providers to handle a few computing functions, like accounting, while others, including Rave, are finding that it pays to farm out just about everything, including e-mail, human resources management and online travel booking.
By signing up with an application provider, "we've eliminated having to spend a lot of cash upfront," Mr. Golden said.
The trend has caused an explosion of young companies specializing in the service, with the leaders including Rave's provider, Agiliti, as well as Corio, Futurelink and Managed Opportunity. But the demand has also led to hefty investments by big telecommunications carriers, including Sprint and Qwest, which plan to expand into the market. Meanwhile, many of the the nation's Internet service providers, such as the Concentric Network Corporation, are moving into the business to make themselves more competitive.
Last year at this time, there were only a few dozen companies calling themselves A.S.P.'s. By the end of this year, analysts predict, there may be several hundred application providers clamoring for the attention of small and midsize businesses, as well as the information technology departments at bigger corporations.
And the clamor is likely to fall on receptive ears, as businesses seek to let somebody else deal with the headaches of operating a computer network, dealing with frequent software upgrades and running out of data storage space.
Although Rave is now one of only a few thousand small businesses that use an application service provider, the number is expected to rise to 136,000 companies by the end of next year, according to Cahners In-Stat, a market research company. And by the end of 2004, according to Cahners In-Stat's forecast, more than three million small businesses will be using application providers.
"This is fundamentally changing the way information technology is purchased and delivered," said Tom Kieffer, chief executive of Agiliti, based in Minneapolis.
Small businesses typically look at application providers as a way to "take away all the pain," of computing services, Mr. Kieffer said.
Meanwhile, big corporate computing departments are also rushing to strike deals with application providers to shed at least some of their applications. National Airlines, for one, has discovered that it can keep its technology costs down by contracting out not only basic services, like e-mail, but some of its more complex tasks as well, like operating its frequent-flier program.
And it may not be long before the trend touches consumers, too. Instead of buying the latest new calendar software, a customer could simply subscribe to a calendar program, accessing it over the Web so that it would hog memory on a server computer rather than on a PC, Palm hand-held device or, eventually, even a telephone. The only requirement is a device with a Web browser.
Several Web sites already offer consumers scheduling and other basic software. Still missing is the business model that enables companies to offer consumers a full range of software services at a profit.
As a result of all this activity, though, the application provider business is among the fastest-growing information technology categories today -- one whose growth rate will only accelerate, analysts predict. In 1998, revenues for application service providers totaled about $400 million in North America, according to the research firm Dataquest. Last year, that figure rose to just over $1 billion, and it is expected to double this year, to $2.4 billion. And in 2001, revenues will more than double again, to $5.3 billion, Dataquest predicts.
A major force behind the predicted surge is the expected arrival in the market later this year of Sprint, Qwest and other communications carriers. Those companies are investing substantially in systems that will let them supply application services, even as they roll out high-speed networks capable of carrying voice, data and images.
As the carriers enter the market, a rash of partnerships is likely to break out among the various players. By the end of the year, in fact, analysts are predicting that some companies will be offering a package of rented software and high-speed Internet access.
AT&T, for example, has already signed a deal with USinternetworking to deliver application services over AT&T's planned high-speed networks through an AT&T program called Ecosystem. Eventually, analysts predict, buying a business network computing service will be like choosing a telephone calling plan.
"Businesses aren't going to say, 'I want a D.S.L. line,' " said Kneko Burney, director of markets and computing for Cahners In-Stat, referring to a type of high-speed Internet connection. "They'll say, 'We want these business services.' "
Analysts say another factor driving growth is an increasing confidence that businesses have with the security of online communications. Because of that confidence, they are willing to make the offerings of application providers available to more employees.
And businesses say they are reaping substantial savings by renting software remotely rather than buying it and installing it on site. An e-mail system, for example, can cost a company several hundred dollars for each employee to operate internally each month. By contracting with an outsider, some businesses say they can get the cost down to about $100. Other services, like travel booking and expense management, are often priced for each transaction.
Some analysts predict that only the most mundane and basic computing programs, like word processing, are likely to remain on the hard disks of office computers as A.S.P.'s gain momentum.
Rave, with 55 employees, has contracted with Agiliti to provide and maintain the company's e-mail, accounting and order management systems -- all for a monthly per-employee fee.
Mr. Golden, Rave's chief financial officer, says the Agiliti contract has allowed Rave to avoid hiring the additional technical staff the company would have needed to handle those activities. Because of the Agiliti deal, Rave's entire internal computing operations can now be performed by one staff member, working half-time. Rave's information-technology spending is only 2 percent of sales, rather than the 5 percent Mr. Golden had been budgeting before signing with Agiliti.
Contracting with an application provider has also meant that Rave can afford to use the latest accounting software, which would otherwise have been too expensive to buy for each employee, Mr. Golden said.
Among bigger businesses, the construction company Morrison Knudsen decided to farm out management of its e-mail system after its acquisition of another company required adding nearly 6,000 e-mail addresses virtually overnight.
"Imagine how long it would take to do that ourselves," said Brian Bertlin, information services director of Morrison Knudsen, based in Boise, Idaho.
Morrison Knudsen also handed off operation of its online travel booking a few months ago to Unisys and is about to let Unisys take on the company's travel expense accounting system. The aim, Mr. Bertlin said, is to reduce costs in areas that do not directly generate revenues for the company.
In many ways, the application provider business is similar to the network PC business model that concerns like Oracle and Novell tried to have companies embrace a few years ago. Under that plan, stripped-down personal computers were to function as terminals for software resources stored on remote computer servers. But some full-scale PC's became available for only a few hundred dollars, and the network PC model never took hold.
The application provider is also reminiscent of elements of the mainframe era, when companies paid to time share the resources of giant systems owned and run by companies like I.B.M. and Digital Equipment. In the time-sharing systems of the 1970's, small and midsize companies found it more economical to rent the resources of a mainframe computer company rather than invest in multimillion-dollar systems of their own, with all the attendant support and staffing costs.
But in addition to the predominance of desktop PC's at most modern business, as opposed to the few, closely guarded mainframe terminals of yesteryear, there is at least one other key difference: in hiring an application provider, the customer is paying for the knowledge and skill of the supplier, not simply the software and server computers.
"Today, it's not about economies of scale but about economies of skill," Ms. Burney said. "It's all about expertise and the right operating environment."

Vodafone to Consider Sale Of Some Fixed-Line Assets
Vodafone AirTouch, the world's largest wireless telephone operator, is considering selling the fixed-line assets it acquired when it bought Mannesmann and speeding up the sale of Orange, the British cellular operator, to raise $60 billion, executives close to the company said.
The company is considering selling Mannesmann's stake in Arcor of Germany and in Infostrada of Italy, the executives said. Vodafone is hoping those assets will bring at least 15 billion, or $22 billion. Page C10. 

Alteon Websystems in 2 Alliances
Alteon Websystems, a manufacturer of switches for Internet communications, intends to announce this week that it has enlisted two powerful allies: Lucent Technologies and Akamai Technologies.

Optical Network Market Heats Up
Judging by sheer buzz, there is nothing in the technology world hotter these days than "next generation optical networking." And the temperature may increase today, when Mayan Networks, a start-up company in Sunnyvale, Calif., plans to announce its first product. In addition, ONI Systems, previously known as Optical Networks, intends to make an initial public offering tomorrow. C11.
 
A Dot-Com Legal Bill Comes Due
When fast-growing Internet companies began raiding law firms in the Bay Area for employees last year, the firms responded by increasing associates' salary by as much as 40 percent. That set off a chain reaction at other law firms nationwide, which followed suit. But at the companies stealing the lawyers, stock prices stopped rising, bringing the value of millions of stock options into question. Turnover at many California law firms has returned to normal, but the firms are still stuck with the bill for the higher salaries. New Economy. C4.
 
Path to Web Profits Spans Globe
A flood of statistics suggests that to keep their businesses growing, Internet merchants have to look outside the United States. And yet, with investors demanding that Web merchants find a speedier path to profitability, the merchants can hardly justify the expenses associated with rolling out sites aimed at other nations.

Renting a Computer Department
Instead of hiring a computing staff to manage a company's accounting and sales management systems, a lot of small-business executives are deciding to "rent" their main business software from one of a growing number of Internet companies known as application service providers, which use the Internet to offer a range of software and technology-related services. The trend has caused an explosion of companies specializing in the service. C4.
 
Report Calls for Copyright Update
The law meant to protect intellectual property on the Internet needs to be updated, the Progressive Policy Institute, a Democratic research center, will recommend in a report to be released today.

HEADLINE: Fate Unclear For F.T.C.'s Privacy Push

BYLINE: By JERI CLAUSING 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission plans to go to Congress this week to seek tough new privacy rules for Internet businesses. But the nation's consumer protection agency is likely to encounter skepticism from key Republicans and from industry groups about the government's ability to impose regulations without stifling the innovation fueling the new economy.
Indeed, the opposition began mustering its arguments as soon as the F.T.C. reversed its previous policy by voting on Friday to ask Congress for new powers to control the ways Internet companies collect and use information about consumers. 
 "A year ago, when the performance of Web sites was rated less favorably than they are currently being rated, the commission voted against legislation," said Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee that oversees Internet privacy.
"Today with the finding that Web sites have improved dramatically their privacy policies, they are now recommending legislation," he said. "It seems to be a contradiction that needs to be understood."
And yet, while high-technology industry groups continue to insist that any new rules are unwarranted and premature, companies themselves have differing views on whether and what types of new laws might be warranted.
Microsoft insists no legislation is needed. EBay, the auction giant, indicated it could support some sort of minimal regulation if it curtailed states' rights to impose a patchwork of differing rules. Bell Atlantic said baseline rules could be useful.
The only common theme expressed by Internet businesses over the weekend seemed to be that if Congress proceeds with legislation to regulate consumer privacy protections online, that it do so cautiously.
"We are all sensitive to this issue," said Robert Levitan, chief executive of Flooz.com, which deals in online gift certificates. "We know we are in the spotlight and we are going to be held to a higher standard."
DoubleClick, which places advertising on Web sites on behalf of other companies, became a lightning rod for online privacy issues after it disclosed a plan -- since deferred -- to combine consumer information gathered online with personal data gathered offline through direct-mail databases and other means.
"I would like to think that industry could self-regulate, but I think we all have accepted the fact that there will be some regulation," Mr. Levitan said. "We're not jumping up and down complaining about regulation. We're just saying, let's do it wisely."
If caution means slow, companies are likely to get their wish. Given the complexity of both election-year politics and the fast-changing medium involved, most lawmakers agreed that the chances of passing Internet privacy legislation this year were all but nil. But this year's debate could set the stage for action next session.
Although the Internet privacy issue in Congress does not split along party lines, Representative Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who supports strong privacy regulation, predicted on Friday that Republicans would block the consumer protections.
Representative Tom Davis, Republican of Virginia and co-chairman of the House Internet caucus, responded with the implication that the administration was behind the F.T.C. move. "This is an election year, and I think sometimes the direction they get from up high is to stir this up a little bit."
Still, it remained unclear over the weekend whether the White House would back the F.T.C. effort, which comes after the recent completion of a survey by the commission that found that only about 20 percent of major companies on the Internet had adequate standards for protecting the privacy of Internet users. Since 1997, the Clinton administration has pushed a laissez-faire approach to the Internet. And just last week, a top Commerce Department official told a House hearing on privacy that self-regulation appeared to be working.
With both parties trying to attract the support -- and dollars -- of the technology industry, the issue could become a tricky one politically for Vice President Al Gore.
Details of the F.T.C.'s survey findings and its legislative proposal will not be released until the agency conducts briefings around Washington on Monday.
But a government official who has seen the 60-page recommendation said it would suggest only moderate legislation to set baseline rules that could be used in conjunction with self-regulation efforts like the seal programs that are used by some Web sites to certify they follow their stated privacy practices. After three years of monitoring the progress of privacy on the Internet, the official said, the F.T.C. had not seen sufficient protections to avoid regulation.
"This is one step forward, not a massive leap into a highly regulated, draconian bureaucratic structure," said the official, who predicted Mr. Tauzin and others would be less critical after seeing the details of the Web survey and the F.T.C.'s recommendations.
But industry groups began pre-emptive strikes over the weekend.
On Sunday, the Direct Marketing Association released its own survey of Web sites showing that 93 percent of major Web sites posted privacy policies and that most of those gave customers notice of how that information was used and the opportunity to keep that information from being transferred to third parties.
"Clearly, self-regulation has taken hold with lightning speed," said H. Robert Wientzen, president and chief executive of the association.
The Information Technology Association of America issued a statement from its president, Harris Miller, who called the F.T.C. report "a first step down the slippery slope of government regulation of the Internet."
Internet company executives, meanwhile, seemed most concerned about the effect new regulations might have on innovation.
Just hours after the F.T.C. voted on Friday, Microsoft and several other companies were demonstrating technologies that are being developed to protect consumers at a weekend privacy retreat in Leesburg, Va., that was sponsored by the United States Chamber of Commerce's National Chamber Foundation.
Richard Purcell, director of corporate privacy for Microsoft, pointed to efforts to incorporate privacy protection technologies into Web-browsing software. "This is not the proper time to stop or chill that very substantial effort that is being made," Mr. Purcell said.
Another company, the DataTreasury Corporation, showed lawmakers technology that allows consumers and businesses to conduct all of their online transactions through DataTreasury's secure system.
"Whatever regulations are implemented today may not be relevant tomorrow," said Michael Hershman, chairman of Decision Strategies Fairfax International, a security company in Fairfax, Va. "This technology creates an entirely different mode of doing business.
"It's hard to predict how these regulations might be written and how they might be enforced," he added. "Once you start down that road you are never sure where you might end up. I've seen many regulations written that you think say one thing and do another."
Tom Tauke, an executive with Bell Atlantic, said some action might be appropriate.
"There can be steps taken in public policy that can be very helpful in creating a climate in which businesses can flourish and consumers' privacy can be protected," Mr. Tauke said. "I don't think that Congress should slow down in the privacy area. I think Congress should get it right."
Other companies said baseline federal legislation was better than the patchwork of laws being considered by states.
Tod Cohen, public policy director for eBay in Washington, said, "We would work with the F.T.C., Congress and the administration to develop a national standard" -- provided it pre-empted further action by states to regulate Internet privacy.
Mr. Levitan agreed. "We need a uniform code across the country," he said. "We need a standard law on privacy and taxation. But let's do it wisely and make it easy for Internet companies to comply."

HEADLINE: Agent's Role In Music Site May Be ShiftIn Rights War

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
Michael Ovitz, superagent and former Disney president, has made his name -- and a considerable fortune -- aggressively securing hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties and other payments for artists and studios he represents. But his latest endeavor, a pop culture hub on the World Wide Web, has the potential to drain income from some of those same clients by enabling users of the site to copy music, media and other files from one another.
Last year, Mr. Ovitz and a business partner bought 51 percent of Scour.com, an entertainment site and search engine used to find music and movie files. Last month, though, the site added a feature, Scour Exchange, that lets users exchange one another's multimedia files online, including copyrighted material by some of the world's leading artists, some of them clients of Mr. Ovitz's talent management agency, Artists Management Group. 
 The involvement of Mr. Ovitz in Scour.com would seem to be at cross purposes with his role in Artists Management. But his backing of Scour.com also marks a significant shift in the roiling battle over copyright protection in the digital age.
Until now, the arch-nemeses of the recording industry have been 20-something entrepreneurs creating Web sites that make it easy to exchange copyrighted files over the Internet. Mr. Ovitz's backing for Scour.com's file exchange mechanism suggests opposition may be eroding to technology that, by many accounts, will force the development of new business models for the entertainment industry, changing how artists are compensated for their work and how their work is protected.
Mr. Ovitz declined to comment. But James Ellis, general counsel for Artists Management Group and a director of Scour Inc., said it makes more sense to embrace the technology than to fight it. "In the face of a rapidly changing marketplace, Scour had to respond to maintain and grow its audience and give them what they wanted," he said.
Mr. Ellis said that Scour hoped to find ways to make file sharing lucrative for artists. And he said Scour was vigilant about kicking copyright infringers off the site if Scour was informed of the problem.
Dan Rodrigues, 24, co-founder and president of Scour.com, said Scour Exchange could not be held accountable if some people used the service to pirate copyrighted material. "It's impossible for us to screen, censor or review," he said. "It's not our job to know what is, or is not, infringing."
The Scour.com Web site does include a copyright notice, but practically speaking it is simple to obtain copyrighted material by entering the search term for the desired song or movie.
Some Internet music industry analysts say Mr. Ovitz has a potentially serious conflict of interest in holding a stake in Scour.com and managing artists whose music and movies may be traded freely on Scour Exchange. The works of several of the artists represented by Mr. Ovitz's agency are exchanged on Scour Exchange, including music from the group Blues Traveler and the singer Liz Phair.
"There is a significant potential for conflict," said Kevin Hause, an Internet music analyst with IDG, a market research group. "He is someone entrusted to look out for the best interest of artists."
But Mr. Rodrigues said that Mr. Ovitz is actually building a bridge between the old world media companies and the new business models of the Internet. "He understands both sides of the equation," he said. "He understands what entertainment companies need and what's important to copyright holders and what works on the Web." Scour.com was founded in a two-bedroom apartment near the campus of the University of California at Los Angeles. Traffic to the site grew quickly, and the company eventually attracted the interest of Mr. Ovitz, who read about Scour.com in the school newspaper, and the grocery billionaire Ron Burkle. For $4 million, the pair took a majority stake in the business, said Mr. Rodrigues.
The company reached deals with a number of Internet start-ups and media companies to provide content to include with the search function. Scour is now contemplating a variety of business models, including taking advertisements, selling subscriptions and selling multimedia content. It now features movie trailers and music promotions provided legitimately by movie and record companies, along with some items for sale, like music available for download. The site now receives 2 million visitors each month.
As with Napster, the controversial site offering a service that lets users share and trade their music files online, users of Scour download software over the Internet that allows them to store and catalog multimedia files on their own computers. Scour Exchange posts those catalogs, then enables users of the service to visit one another's computers over the Internet and share and download one another's music, movies, and other holdings. The service does not provide the content, but facilitates the exchange.
Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., has been sued by the Recording Industry Association of America for reportedly facilitating music piracy in a pending case that many expect to set a precedent. The association, and the five major record labels it represents, say its artists are losing tens of millions of dollars a year because of rampant music piracy on the Internet, a practice the trade group says threatens to undermine the very economics of the creation of music.
Hilary Rosen, the president of the recording industry association, said the group was aware of Scour Exchange's activities and was considering its options. But she said the organization did not want to rush to file lawsuits against each Napster-like service, hoping the decision in that case case might dissuade copycats. "We don't have any interest in litigating our way through the Internet," she said.
But in reality, the industry association might simply lack the resources to file enough lawsuits given the boom in these services and the complexity of the attendant technology. Most recently, a 23-year-old Irish programmer created Freenet, which would enable people to share files online directly with one another in a way that would make it virtually impossible for copyright holders to find a central database or hub to blame for the interaction.
Therein lies a key argument of Mr. Rodrigues and Scour Exchange. They contend that the free exchange of files online may be inevitable, so media companies might as well get on board. "We're trying to work with entertainment companies to help them use it," Mr. Rodrigues said, adding, "Ovitz has been instrumental to us in leveraging entertainment relationships he has."
Scour has some agreements with other companies aimed at helping users to download multimedia files in a way that protects copyright. For instance, Liquid Audio, a company that makes technology to enable digital distribution of music in a way that protects copyright and that is a partner of some of the major record labels has a deal with Scour to enable it to sell several encrypted songs on the site. Andrea Cook Fleming, vice president of marketing for Liquid Audio, said Liquid Audio is providing an alternative to people who might otherwise pirate music, rather than pay for it.
Another company that has signed a deal with Scour is Nettwerk Productions, an independent record label aiming to promote one of its up-and-coming artists, a musician named Brian Transeau who records as BT, on Scour. Cathy Barrett, director of strategic marketing for Nettwerk, said the deal puts the label in an awkward position because the site is promoting the music of BT, but with a single click of the mouse, users can get pirated versions of BT's songs for free through Scour.
But BT said people will inevitablytrade copyrighted music on the Web, so artists might as well try to figure out how to capitalize on the sites making that possible. "It's an uncontrollable situation," BT said. "You might as well embrace it and make the best of it or you're going to go insane trying to prevent it."
Still, some musicians and their agents disagree. Howard King, a Los Angeles attorney who is representing Metallica and Dr. Dre in lawsuits against Napster, said that Mr. Ovitz and Scour have an obligation to stand up to piracy. "Just because some kid in the Philippines knows how to create a devastating virus, doesn't mean we say, 'oh it'll happen again,' and not do something about it," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The new Land Rover campaign gets personal by highlighting small, everyday acts of courage.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
TO the British, it is a brand of alcoholic beverage. To fans of John F. Kennedy, it is the subject of profiles. To the Cowardly Lion, it is reason to see the Wizard. And to Land Rover North America, it is the centerpiece of a revamped advertising and marketing campaign, the first created by the company's new agency, GSD&M in Austin, Tex.
The subject? Courage, of course. 
 And what, pray tell, could be the rationale for associating a quality like courage with a line of sport utility vehicles? Maybe the owner of a New Beetle driving on a road crowded with luxury off-road vehicles is courageous.
Actually, to the company and the agency, courage is shorthand for a skein of words that begin with "c" and serve to flatter the would-be buyer: character, conviction, creativity and curiosity.
"It's what we call the maverick mindset," said Roy Spence, president at GSD&M. That mindset, he said, is prevalent among "those who in the 21st century will be the builders, the architects, of the next economy."
In interviews last week, Mr. Spence joined executives at GSD&M and Land Rover North America to discuss the campaign, which expands today into television with commercials on local broadcast stations and national cable networks like A&E and Discovery (natch). The initial two spots -- for the Discovery Series II, the best-selling Land Rover model -- portray courage in unconventional ways.
In one commercial, a demurely clad pregnant woman gamely walks on a beach populated by younger women in revealing bikinis. In the other commercial, a couple on the way to the opera stops on a rain-slicked highway to help a stray dog.
"It's not about describing the attributes and benefits of the vehicle on-road or off-road," said Alicia Kriese, senior vice president and group account director for Land Rover at GSD&M. "It's about taking your own road."
The "Courage" theme is continued through the other parts of the campaign: print, radio, billboards and posters. For instance, a radio spot describes how the vehicles "have driven in the harshest conditions known to man, from the blistering Gobi desert to the oxygen-deprived Himalayas."
GSD&M is a creatively focused shop known for campaigns for blue-chip brands like Southwest Airlines and Wal-Mart. This is the agency's first effort for an automotive client.
"We were looking for an agency with a strong culture and ability to build our brand equity," said Jim Selwa, vice president for marketing at Land Rover North America in Lanham, Md. "We picked GSD&M because of a cultural connect."
GSD&M was selected in late March after a review that had lasted almost three months. The incumbent agency of 13 years, Grace & Rothschild in New York, which introduced Land Rover products to American consumers, declined to take part.
GSD&M was one of three finalists in the review along with two other agencies seeking their initial car accounts: Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami and Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York. All three were give an assignment on Discovery to determine which would be awarded the creative duties on the company's account, with billings estimated at $30 million.
"The key insight from GSD&M was that the brand was not being viewed as accessible enough," said Kim McCullough, model manager for Discovery at Land Rover North America. "People thought it cost $50,000, which is what Range Rover costs." That's the more expensive of the two products sold in North America by Land Rover.
"We knew we had to change that price perception," Ms. McCullough said, "and get it in line with where the car is." That's why there are numerous mentions of the Discovery's starting sticker of "$33,975 M.S.R.P.," which several ads cheekily define as "manufacturer's surprising retail price."
The final work from Grace & Rothschild was for Range Rover, Mr. Selwa said, adding: "We're now working with GSD&M on a campaign for the 2001 Range Rover, due in fall 2000. Then in the next 18 months we'll introduce Freelander, which is to be priced around $25,000 to $26,000."
Sales for Land Rover North America last year totaled just under 30,000 vehicles, Mr. Selwa said, fueled by a 50 percent increase for Discovery. The goal for 2000 is 31,000, he added, and then a leap to 45,000 to 47,000 when the lower-priced Freelander becomes part of the lineup.
Media duties for Land Rover are handled by Optimedia International U.S. in New York, part of Publicis S.A. Land Rover is part of BMW A.G., which agreed days before the review ended to sell the brand to the Ford Motor Company.
That could jeopardize the GSD&M hold on the account because the agency is part of the Omnicom Group, which owns shops like BBDO Worldwide and Merkley Newman Harty. They handle brands like Dodge and Mercedes-Benz for a major Ford competitor, DaimlerChrysler. Ford frowns on working with agencies that are part of holding companies owning other agencies handling accounts for DaimlerChrysler or General Motors.
"We see nothing from the creative side of the business" that would warrant concerns over conflicts, Mr. Selwa said. "BMW, a strong rival of Mercedes-Benz, didn't have an issue with GSD&M."
Mr. Spence offered Ford executives some tongue-in-cheek advice based on the new Land Rover credo: "They have to have courage."

HEADLINE: Putin's Move on Governors Would Bolster His Role

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 21

 BODY:
It turns out that the most momentous act of Vladimir V. Putin's first days as Russia's elected president has not been his choice of a cabinet, or the internal debate over a sweeping economic restructuring plan, or even the approval of two nuclear arms treaties.
Rather, it is Mr. Putin's mounting of a swift and stunning crusade last week to gut the power and political influence of Russia's 89 governors -- and not coincidentally, perhaps, to enhance his own. 
 If the campaign succeeds -- and that seemed more than possible this week -- then Mr. Putin will have reoriented Russia's federal system toward the Kremlin. And the governors, arguably the most powerful and rebellious politicians outside the Kremlin walls, will have been relegated to truly provincial status.
The Kremlin says that is what Russia needs to pull itself out of the slough that is its 10-year history as an independent nation, and many experts agree. But it will come at the cost of making Mr. Putin, already endowed with czar-like powers by the Constitution, an even more towering figure in Russian politics and government.
In fact, Moscow's all-powerful mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov, was quick to attack Mr. Putin's plan as arbitrary and potentially illegal. But many political experts here say Mr. Putin is on the right course.
"The general tendency is positive because the major obstacle to reforms is the influence of the oligarchs and the governors, whom I call dictators," said Sergei Markov, one of the country's top political analysts.
Lilia Shevtsova, a top analyst at the Moscow office of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said, "The fact that Mr. Putin wants to crush these authoritarian regimes is a very promising sign." She calls the governors robber barons and says reining them in should be one of the new president's top priorities.
Mr. Putin's proposal comes at the peak of his political power now, while he is blessed with a comparatively prosperous economy and a clutch of powerful alliances with the major factions in Parliament. He took quick advantage of it all last week, in effect declaring war on the governors in two prime-time television speeches.
On Wednesday, he proposed to oust, permanently, all 89 governors and the leaders of their legislatures from their guaranteed seats in Russia's counterpart to the United States Senate, the Federation Council. The move would wipe out the current membership of the 188-seat house, replacing it with lesser regional officials.
More than that, Mr. Putin said on Wednesday that he would seek legal authority to personally suspend or fire any governor who flouts federal law or defies the Russian Constitution.
And that's not all: four days earlier, a Putin decree corralled the governors' 89 provinces into 7 new administrative districts, each overseen by a regional official who is answerable directly to Mr. Putin, and no one else.
On Friday, the semi-official Interfax news service called the proposals "an attack, one may even say storming" of the governors' political bastion. Mr. Putin is said to have sprung the plan on top governors last week in a meeting that ran so long that the president's next appointment -- his new prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov -- cooled his heels for more than an hour.
The governors, still awed by Mr. Putin's popularity, have reacted cautiously. But few Russians expect them to roll over. For taken together, the proposals have the potential not just to end the their long run as regional potentates, but also to wreak vengeance on the most disobedient of their lot.
The seven new administrative districts have been billed as a streamlining of the government, replacing the individual envoys to all 89 provinces who served under President Boris N. Yeltsin.
But they are more than that. Under Mr. Yeltsin, both the envoys and many federal agencies became willing captives of the governors, who supplied them with favors the Kremlin could not or would not provide. Federal officials were dependent on the provinces for everything from office space and telephones to jobs for their families and summer camps for their children.
That will all change under Mr. Putin. The seven new envoys will work from regional capitals with budgets, housing and offices supplied by the Kremlin, as well as the power to bestow perks on federal officials in their districts. The effect, the administration hopes, will be to bring those officials back under the Kremlin's sway, and thus to bring more pressure to bear on the governors to follow federal orders.
The proposed reorganization of the Federation Council is potentially even more far-reaching. While details of the plan were not clear last weekend, Mr. Putin apparently intends to replace the council members with provincial officials elected by their peers, diluting the governors' power to control votes on the council.
The governors, however, stand to lose far more than political power. If they lose their parliamentary seats, they also surrender one of its most coveted benefits: complete immunity from criminal prosecution. And more than a few of them have cause to worry about that.
Russia's governors have lived high for a long time. As a string of crises and Mr. Yeltsin's desultory rule drained Moscow of money and influence, the far-flung provinces have increasingly made their own way, and some leaders have become corrupt, autocratic or both.
On the Pacific coast, 5,000 miles from the Kremlin, the governor of the Primoriye region, Yevgeny Nazdratenko, has taken over private businesses, seized control of the press and judiciary, pumped government budgets dry and, according to Mr. Yeltsin's Kremlin, regularly ignored federal decrees.
Across the country on the Black Sea, Krasnodar Province has been identified by human rights groups as a center of authoritarianism, anti-Semitism and "extreme xenophobia" under Gov. Nikolai Kondratenko. On the nearby Caspian, Kalmikiya has threatened secession, veered toward dictatorship and spent lavishly on a "chess city" under its chess-obsessed president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov.
Some regions have erected trade barriers, treating each other almost like foreign nations. Mr. Putin claims that a fifth of provincial laws run counter to federal legislation. He need not look far: the city of Moscow, a federal district, has paid little attention to warnings that its regulations counter federal law.
In making his argument to clean up the system, Mr. Putin argues, with some justification, that he won election on a platform of bringing a dangerously undisciplined Russia to heel before it does itself fatal damage, and that reining in such behavior is the first step.
"This is not just correct today; it is absolutely necessary," he said on Wednesday. "The looseness of power is very costly for millions of average people. The cost of the lack of discipline in the state is our personal security, the inviolability of property and housing and, finally, our own well-being and the future of our children."
The president stresses that his proposals conform to the Constitution, that they require Parliament's approval, and that he rejects more draconian options, like arrogating to himself the power to appoint governors.
Mr. Putin is making his case directly to the people, on television, which suggests that he wants the sort of public mandate that past leaders, including Mr. Yeltsin, rarely bothered to seek.
His chances of getting what he wants seem good. Although the Federation Council would seem likely to oppose much of the Kremlin's plan, it appears that the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, will overwhelmingly approve it. Both the Duma's Communists and its right-wing party, the Union of Right Forces, have announced their support.
If the Duma gives Mr. Putin 300 of its 450 votes, a constitutional majority, the Federation Council will be unable to derail the bills even if it votes against them.

HEADLINE: U.S. Did Little to Deter Buildup as Ethiopia and Eritrea Prepared for War

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
When President Clinton annointed the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea as princes of an African Renaissance two years ago, he and three of his aides took a special interest in trying to head off one of the continent's biggest and costliest wars.
The behind-the-scenes courting of the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, and the Eritrean President, Isaias Afewerki, ended in bitter disappointment 10 days ago when Ethiopia rolled into Eritrea with tanks and artillery and launched trench warfare reminiscent of World War I. 
 The latest offensive was taken after two years in which both countries, among the poorest on earth, spent more than $1 billion on arms. But in trying to forge a peace settlement, the administration never sought economic or arms sanctions. Nor did it seek to slow down more than $1 billion in World Bank loans in the same period.
Instead, it focused on an intensive and sometimes highly personal diplomatic maneuver. At times, the diplomats involved said, Mr. Clinton himself phoned the two leaders and wrote them letters trying to coax them away from battle and into peace talks that could have been held in the United States.
A last-second maneuver this month by a team of United Nations ambassadors who knew the fighting was imminent because blood plasma had just been shipped to the front also failed.
The weapons pouring into the region -- fighter planes and helicopters, tanks, howitzers, shoulder-to-air missiles, and ammunition from Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, China and North Korea -- were easy for Western intelligence agencies to see as they entered Eritrea by sea and Ethiopia overland from Djibouti, by rail.
But the three Clinton administration diplomats who headed the peace effort -- Anthony Lake, a former National Security Agency adviser to Mr. Clinton; Gayle E. Smith, the director for Africa at the agency; and Susan E. Rice, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs -- acknowledge that they were reluctant to chastise the two African leaders.
Former guerrilla leaders who once fought together, Mr. Zenawi and Mr. Afewerki were seen as friends of the United States, men who had promise as reformers, despite their drive to fight each other. They led countries at the bottom of the economic ladder: it seemed heartless to be too tough. And they were considered useful in the administration's efforts to curb the power of the Islamic leadership in Sudan, a government that Mr. Zenawi and Mr. Afewerki opposed.
Now, as 10 days of fighting have dislodged hundreds of thousands of people from their homes in Eritrea and killed unknown numbers of front-line conscripts, the United Nations Security Council has approved a weapons embargo at the urging of the United States.
As the Ethiopians step up their assault by bombing targets near Eritrean Red Sea ports, the diplomats say they are still talking to both sides. But they are also considering more severe sanctions, like limiting the ability of the Eritreans to collect remittances from friends and relatives in the United States and restricting international flights of Ethiopian Airlines, a major revenue earner.
In an interview, Ms. Rice said "different sanctions" were considered at different points.
But she said, "It was our view given the disposition and the psychology of the two governments and the two peoples that external pressure was more likely to drive them in the opposite direction than the desired direction." It was decided to "resort to those pressures only in extremis."
Last October, as the weapons buildup became impossible to ignore, Mr. Lake said there were suggestions to seek an arms embargo. But Mr. Lake said he remained convinced that an arms embargo would have thrown the two countries into war. Mr. Zenawi and Mr. Afewerki had asserted that an arms embargo would bring about a collapse of the peace talks, making war much more likely, Mr. Lake said.
Critics of the policy say it was much too soft. "We should look them in the eyes and growl," said Chester A. Crocker, a former assistant secretary of state for African affairs. "They would blink if they thought we were going to shut them down with the World Bank. We have the power to come down hard on the leadership. No one laid our glove publicly on either of them."
Given the poverty -- and now the shortage of food that has struck both countries -- the governments have spent staggering amounts of money on weapons in the last two years, according to figures from the Institute for International Strategic Studies in London. Ethiopia, a country of 60 million, spent $480 million on arms in 1999; Eritrea, a nation of 3 million, spent $306 million. They spent slightly smaller amounts in 1998.
This year, Ethiopia's defense budget is set to rise to $533 million. Yet before the first outbreak of war in 1998, Ethiopia's defense budget was a little more than $100 million, the institute said.
In the last four years, Ethiopia received $924.9 million from the World Bank, more than two-thirds of it in 1998 after a first round of fighting, according to the World Bank. Eritrea, a much smaller country, received less.
The World Bank never threatened to stop the money, bank officials said, although Ethiopia lost its program with the International Monetary Fund because of excessive military spending.
As well, the Eritrean leader, Mr. Afewerki has been able to complement the foreign aid money by raising funds from the very loyal Eritrean diaspora in the United States. In early March, Mr. Afewerki addressed more than 10,000 Eritreans at the Equestrian Center in Upper Marlboro, Md., and many of them gave generously to his war machine.
The three negotiators who squared off with the African leaders, who turned out to be less princes of reform than warriors for personal honor, were eclectic, each with a point of view.
Mr. Lake, 61, who specialized in Africa as a university student and wrote his doctoral dissertation on Rhodesia, carried the weight of a professional diplomat. Ms. Smith, 44, once a freelance journalist who was on friendly terms with the two leaders from the 1970's and 1980's when she wrote about them from behind the lines, conveyed intimate knowledge of the region's clans and personalities. Ms. Rice, 35, an African-American who has the confidence of Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, carried the authority of that office.
The current fighting represents the third and most expansive phase of the battle between the two countries. The State Department's best guess is that 50,000 to 60,000 people were killed in the first two rounds in the last two years, officials said. The death toll this time could be even higher, they said.
On the face of it, the dispute is about territory around a border between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Eritrea says it was reclaiming its own land when it marched over the line in May 1998; Ethiopia says it must have the territory back before it will agree to a comprehensive peace agreement.
As both leaders amassed their huge arsenals and conscripted wave upon wave of peasants, teachers, engineers and doctors, they were summoned to negotiations in Algiers earlier this month.
There, the talks were convened under the umbrella of the Organization for African Unity, but atmospherics were sour. The two men walked away, determined to go to war, just as they had been at various points all along, officials said.
When a group of United Nations ambassadors, including the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, heard that the countdown for war was under way, they rushed from central Africa northward to see if they could make a difference.
But the envoys found Mr. Meles and Mr. Afewerki impervious to arguments about how they risked the lives of tens of thousands of their citizens and the viability of their fledgling countries.
As the ambassadors left, war broke out, making clear that Mr. Clinton's speechwriters, who chose to compare Mr. Meles and Mr. Afewerki to Renaissance leaders, may have unwittingly been correct. The Renaissance, several Africa hands noted, ended in bloody wars too.

HEADLINE: President Views Success of China Trade Bill as His Foreign Policy Legacy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
For seven years now, very little has gone as planned in Bill Clinton's effort to shape a new relationship with China. Now, amid increasing confidence among White House officials this weekend that they will prevail in one of the most crucial Congressional votes in a decade, the president who came to office knowing little about China may leave claiming he fundamentally altered Washington's relations with Beijing.
For Mr. Clinton, the problem has not been a lack of vision. Once in office, he quickly cast away his campaign attacks on President Bush for "coddling dictators" in Beijing. And since 1994, he has steadily built on his theme that the Internet and China's growing economic ties to the West would ultimately create pressures for political openness that Beijing will not be able to control. 
 The problem has been one of execution. The Chinese have hardly cooperated, jailing more dissidents even as Mr. Clinton argued that economic freedom would eventually produce political freedom. Nor has there been much help from the president's fellow Democrats, most of whom have fought his trade and China policies at every turn.
But in recent weeks, Mr. Clinton has sworn to close friends and colleagues that he will not let himself repeat the same mistake he now blames himself for making at least twice before -- letting the politics of the moment, or even the prospect of a war within his own political party, pull him back from a step he is convinced is the best hope of keeping China from becoming an adversary.
"He knows he blew it in 1995 and again last year," said one of Mr. Clinton's foreign policy advisers, referring to Mr. Clinton's decision to grant a visa to Taiwan's president in 1995 to visit the United States, and then to walk away last year from a sweeping trade deal with China's reform-minded prime minister, Zhu Rongji.
So with the passion of a convert, Mr. Clinton is spending hours each day arguing the merits of a strategic vision he took years to adopt. In small gatherings in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House residence and even aboard Air Force One as he took New York Democrats to his wife's formal nomination for the Senate race, he has offered lectures about competing scenarios of what America's dealings with China may look like in 2025.
In public, his aides say the vote, scheduled for Wednesday, is still too close to call. "We don't have the 218 to pass it, and the opposition do not have 218 at this point, in my opinion, to stop it," Commerce Secretary William Daley, who is leading the administration's lobbying drive, said today on CBS' "Face the Nation."
In private, however, many of Mr. Clinton's advisers suspect the bill to give China permanent trade status -- thus ending an annual Congressional review -- will pass by a margin of 10 votes or more, chiefly because of the support of Republicans. The Republican whip in the House, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, said today that "we're moving toward that magic number of 218," giving much of the credit to lobbying by the president.
For Mr. Clinton, the vote may be the last hope of making a deep imprint on foreign affairs in his second term. With time running out for a Mideast peace accord or a new arms deal with Russia, the outcome of the vote has taken on huge importance in the president's mind.
"He hates the word, but it's the legacy thing, in a big way," said one cabinet member.
But even if Mr. Clinton wins, the victory may feel incomplete.
Mr. Clinton acknowledges that for all his talk about the benefits for America of economic globalization -- how it opens new markets for American exports and innovation -- fewer Democrats are with him on this than on the1993 passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He told a colleague not long ago, "I'm doing this despite my party, not with it."
Even allies say that is because his commitment to rebuilding the China relationship and pursuing a trade policy for a new era of globalized commerce has waxed and waned.
"As in so many things," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a leading advocate of the trade bill, "he too often let the politics of last month or next month affect decisions toward China that go to half-century strategic issues." Only in recent times, he added, "has the president begun to see this in historic terms."
So far, the White House strategy has been fairly straightforward. Mr. Clinton has largely let others argue the economic benefits, and avoided direct engagement with the labor unions that fear that any gains from an increase in exports to China will be outweighed by the movement of American jobs there.
Instead, the president has focused his arguments on national security, saying the real point of letting China into the World Trade Organization is to further economic engagement to give a boost to China's reformers and prevent the two nations from drifting into adversarial roles.
But with the coalition in Congress so fragile, Mr. Clinton's staff has carefully shielded him from much public engagement about the deal. They canceled a television address to the nation this evening, for fear it would anger undecided Democrats. After lengthy discussions, they declined to make him available for an interview on his seven years of dealings with China, again out of concern he might say something that could cost a few needed votes.
To the enormous frustration of the White House, the Chinese are hardly aiding Mr. Clinton's cause. In past years, when Congress was gearing up for a vote on the annual renewal of trading status, Beijing usually released a few long-imprisoned dissidents.
But this time, as Mr. Daley said recently, "the Chinese certainly aren't making it any easier." While they moderated their reaction to the inauguration this weekend of a new Taiwanese president, Chinese authorities have continued to arrest members of the Falun Gong religious group, and recently sentenced a leader of the fledgling Democracy Party to a long term in prison. Mr. Clinton, curiously, has made no recent public comments about those arrests.
Mr. Clinton and his team have tried to turn China's continued crackdowns to their advantage, arguing that the trade deal, by ushering in Western technology, legal systems and ideas, will ultimately undercut the ability of the Chinese government to repress dissent.
At the United States Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday, the president took this argument further than he ever has before, making the case that "when over 100 million people in China can get on the Net, it will be impossible to maintain a closed political and economic society."
"He's right, but it will take a generation," said Sandra Kristoff, who headed the Asian operations of the National Security Council in Mr. Clinton's first term. President Jiang Zemin of China is taking the other side of that bet, hoping that -- like Singapore -- he can reap the benefits of an open economic system while suppressing, or at least managing, true political opposition.
Mr. Clinton will likely be deep into retirement before historians can assess whether he or Mr. Jiang have guessed right. But it is already clear that Mr. Clinton's journey to his strategic vision of dealing with China was a long road with many unintended detours.
His first 18 months in office were spent digging his way out of his own campaign rhetoric. His comments had inflamed the Chinese, and Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, said, "I remember telling him one day that the first step was that he had to treat China with respect." Mr. Clinton, he said, "seemed surprised."
By the end of 1993, and a disastrous trip to China by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, it was clear that the president's effort to link China's trading rights to its performance on human rights and arms proliferation was collapsing. It was a short intellectual leap to granting permanent trade status.
"There was no evidence that we ever gained any leverage over the Chinese with annual renewal," said Charlene Barshefsky, Mr. Clinton's trade representative. "It was an empty threat. We knew it, and the Chinese knew it."
Mr. Clinton reversed course, saying he could make more progress with China through engagement than with threats -- the conclusion his predecessors had reached.
Then in 1995, with his re-election looming, Mr. Clinton allowed Lee Tung-hui, Taiwan's president, to make a private visit to Cornell University for a college reunion, over the objections of many advisers. Mr. Clinton feared that denying the visa would prompt Congress to rewrite the Taiwan Security Act, worsening relations with Beijing. But he underestimated the outrage in Beijing.
Mr. Clinton now views that as a mistake. "There were two stages to his learning about China," said one former adviser, who dealt with China policy daily. "After the campaign he learned that China was a lot more complex than he believed. And now he's learned the second part -- that dealing with China means putting the security interests first, and not letting politics get in the way."
If that was the lesson, it was forgotten again in April 1999. By that time Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang had exchanged visits to China and the United States, and gotten to the final stages of the 13-year-long negotiations for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Mr. Zhu, the prime minister who has come to personify China's economic reform movement, arrived in Washington ready to end the wrangling with an offer of a huge range of openings.
Many advised Mr. Clinton to take it; but he listened to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Gene Sperling, the head of the National Economic Council, who feared that if a deal were struck, Congress was in no mood to pass it.
Mr. Clinton realized almost immediately he had made a mistake, but it was too late. Once the United States accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the air war over Kosovo just a few weeks later, talks froze. They were not resumed until marathon negotiations in November, and then some of the terms had changed -- for better, and for worse.
"The previous deal couldn't have passed,"' Mr. Sperling said recently, referring both to the details of the pact and the Congressional climate. "This one can."

HEADLINE: Rise in City Pensions Might Kill Tax Cut

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
The city's efforts to cut local taxes are being threatened by the State Legislature's proposal to increase pension benefits for city government workers, the Giuliani administration and City Council leaders say.
City leaders also say the proposed changes jeopardize their ability to keep the city financially stable and settle contracts with city workers. 
 The proposed state legislation would give automatic cost-of-living increases to retired city employees, cut veteran city employees' contributions toward their pensions, and create a new retirement-incentive program. The battle over the legislation is the latest in an escalating tug of war over who should control how New York City raises and spends its money.
Last year, over the objection of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council, the Legislature repealed the city's commuter tax, costing New York City about $400 million a year. As a result, tax cuts planned for city residents and businesses were abandoned.
This year, the city has an even larger tax cut plan on the table. But administration officials and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, are warning that the pension legislation, as well as measures already incorporated in the state budget plan, like a cap on state aid to the homeless in the city, could cost the city as much as $1.2 billion.
That could again force the city to reduce or scale back its own tax cuts, while also perhaps requiring it to spend money it has in reserve just to balance the $37.34 billion budget for the 2001 fiscal year, city budget officials said.
It would also reduce the amount available for the city to earmark for settlements with about 300,000 city workers whose contracts expire in the coming year, the officials said.
"What they are considering doing is absolutely irresponsible," said Adam L. Barsky, the director of Mr. Giuliani's Office of Management and Budget.
Mr. Vallone, who said he intended to join the Giuliani administration in lobbying against the measures, added, "It is not only arrogant, but it is absolutely wrong."
Union leaders defend the proposed pension changes, saying they would give retirees a better standard of living and make their benefits competitive with those approved recently for transit workers and other government employees.
"When inflation goes up, a retiree's pension should go up," said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers and of the Municipal Labor Committee. "Retired city employees should not have to make a decision between paying their rent or their medical expenses." Nearly 40 states have made similar modifications to their pension plans, she said.
City officials said they were not opposed to considering increased pension benefits for more than 100,000 retirees, but wanted to make their own decisions about what the city could afford and how quickly it could afford it. If the state wants to pay for pension changes with state funds, city officials would have no objection.
"They are taking away our ability to make choices we think will be best for the city, while at the same time threatening our financial stability," Mr. Barsky said, maintaining that the cost-of-living increase for retirees could cost the city $1 billion in the 2001 fiscal year. The city is urging that the program be scaled back so that it would cost no more than $300 million to $500 million.
State officials and legislative leaders acknowledged yesterday that the cost-of-living plan -- which has been backed at least in concept by Gov. George E. Pataki, Comptroller H. Carl McCall and key members of the Legislature -- is expensive, but they said details that could affect the ultimate price tag are still being worked out.
"There is no specific agreement that has been reached, so any projection of a fiscal impact would be purely speculative," said Joseph E. Conway, a spokesman for Governor Pataki's budget office.
Mr. Conway; a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver; and Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., who is chairman of the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee; said yesterday that they were prepared to meet with city officials to discuss their concerns.
The city's financial picture, at least for now, remains extremely healthy, with budget officials projecting another record surplus of about $3 billion when the current fiscal year ends on June 30. Even if state officials enact many of the measures the Giuliani administration is opposing, city budget officials said they were confident they could get through the coming fiscal year without major spending cuts.
But several of the city's planned tax cuts for 2001, including halving the 14 percent surcharge on the personal income tax and eliminating the commercial rent tax, might need to be curtailed or abandoned, city officials said.
"That would be terrible and incredibly unfair to the city," said City Councilman Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee.
Negotiations over the tax cuts and other aspects of the city's 2001 fiscal budget are to begin in earnest this week, but the uncertainty associated with the pension-related costs will complicate that effort.
The real trouble for the city would come in the next fiscal year, 2002. The current projected deficit for 2002 is $1.8 billion, but if the pension changes are approved, that could grow to between $3.5 billion and $4.4 billion, city budget officials said, a dangerously high level.
The deficit could also grow because of contract negotiations with all of the city workers' unions. Each 1 percent raise offered to employees would cost the city about $160 million a year.
A final major budget risk for the city is the $835 million windfall the city could lose over the next two years if the Giuliani administration and labor unions cannot agree to a so-called restart of the pension fund by the end of next month.
The restart would lower the city's contributions because it would revalue the pension assets after taking into consideration unusually high investment profits in the last three years. The Giuliani administration wants to use those savings to pay for general city services and tax cuts, while the unions want the savings to help pay for raises, as previous pension restarts indirectly did in 1991 and 1995.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Most States Lack System for Monitoring Asthma

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS 

 BODY:
As the number of asthma cases in the United States rises sharply and researchers scramble to find the cause, newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that most states have no system to track the number of people with asthma or monitor what happens to them, and only a few states have any recent reports on the illness in their jurisdictions.
The data was reported in a study by Health Track, a new public health group based at Georgetown University in Washington and financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The study, to be made public today, says 27 states have no asthma monitoring program, 30 states have no up-to-date information on asthma within their borders, and more than 40 states have no "ready access" to information on how many people get emergency care or whether patients have access to good treatment. 
 The recent rise in the number of asthma cases is a mystery. It appears to be occurring in many spots around the world, and while the number of cases had been rising slowly over many decades the figures have shot up dramatically since about 1980, said Dr. Lynn Goldman, a pediatrician with the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.
"The explosive growth has come recently, and it is very unusual," Dr. Goldman said. "There are not many things in medicine that rise suddenly like that." The increase -- from 75 percent to 160 percent in different age groups, with the biggest jump among children -- has occurred in less than 20 years.
Asthma is now the most common chronic disease among children, the most common medical reason for school absence and the most frequent cause of trips to hospital emergency rooms, according to statistics from the National Institutes of Health. The last statistic is important, doctors say, because treating asthma in the emergency room is an expensive and inefficient approach that health insurers would like to reduce.
Various studies have shown that certain factors -- including the presence of cockroaches, higher levels of ozone and diesel pollution, and increased smoking among young women -- are associated with asthma, but it is uncertain why. Dust mites, viral infections and breast-feeding have also been linked to the disease.
But in looking for the cause of the epidemic, said James O'Hara, executive director of Health Track, "We have blindfolded ourselves, because most states don't have access to one of the least expensive and most effective tools for preventing the spread of the disease: information."
Dr. Goldman said additional information was essential. "To prevent and treat the disease, we have to know where to look and what to look for," she said.
For example, knowing in what parts of the country and among what groups the disease is hitting hardest can help public health officials target prevention and treatment programs. More important in the long run is the way information on an epidemic can be used to spot its cause.
Researchers have estimated that a national tracking and monitoring program for asthma would cost about $25 million annually, Mr. O'Hara said. He said the cost of asthma to the national economy was about $14.5 billion a year and rising.
The Centers for Disease Control began to watch the rise in cases a few years ago, and in 1998 noted that the increase had reached epidemic proportions. The agency began to survey states, cities and territories about their ability to monitor the epidemic, and finished analyzing the survey results this year.
Health Track, which specializes in environmental issues, combined the data with reports from the National Institutes of Health and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to produce the current report.

HEADLINE: On AIDS Drugs, a Mixed Blessing

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Cheaper Drugs to Combat AIDS" (editorial, May 15):
The AIDS epidemic in Africa needs to be fought in the same way that the AIDS epidemic in poor communities here should be fought. The primary health concern of a poor person with AIDS in New York City is not AIDS; it is the ability to obtain housing, nutritious food, education, gainful work opportunities and social services. In the case of Africans with AIDS and H.I.V., the problems are, among other things, lack of education, stigma and misinformation. 
 I applaud drug manufacturers in their humanitarian efforts, but we should be mindful that AIDS in Africa cannot be contained, controlled or managed simply by making cheaper drugs available. It must be addressed from the perspective of poverty, not simply the virus.

HEADLINE: Protesting Sweatshops: Who Is Right?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Good Propaganda, Bad Economics," by Jaime Sneider (Op-Ed, May 16), misses the point behind anti-sweatshop protests at my campus and elsewhere in this country. While it may be true that Nike's factories in Vietnam provide ample wages relative to other opportunities, the university community is not satisfied with relative fairness.
As major consumers of college-logoed products, the protesters are saying they are willing to support higher prices for these goods, provided they are produced according to fair labor principles. 
 These protests do not harm factory workers. While transnational corporations often move factories when individual countries impose labor standards, university apparel producers cannot evade these rules by shifting production locations because the university will revoke licensing rights to those who do not follow the labor guidelines.

HEADLINE: A Silicon Alley Street Fair, Until a Virtual One Comes Along

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
It was a typical New York street fair in so many ways: cotton candy, silly balloon hats, rock band, stock option raffle.
O.K., it was a little different. With 60-odd Internet companies hawking their wares at the Silicon Alley Street Fair, creativity ruled the day. And the 30-somethings at Asktherobot.com, a job-recruitment company, perhaps best captured the spirit of the day by raffling 500 shares of their soon-to-be-public stock to the winners of a basketball toss. 
 "This is the Internet," explained Michael Vogel, the chief executive of the company, which started nearly four months ago and plans to go public in a year or so. "The big calling card to the world is stock options. This is what the Internet is about."
Mr. Vogel estimated the potential value of the stock at $25,000, depending on the selling price at the initial public offering.
Yes, hyperbole ruled the day, as well.
The fair, after all, was intended in large part to promote Silicon Alley, the concentration of technology and Internet-related companies that have cropped up in and around Manhattan, said Janet Stites, the publisher of the Alleycat News, which organized the fair at Union Square Park with the marketing firm MarketMatch Inc. "People read about Silicon Alley, they hear about it, but they don't come face to face with it," Ms. Stites said. "It's an economic development issue and a curiosity issue."
Curiosity seemed to be winning. Droves of people, despite a chilly drizzle, massed under white tents for demonstrations of all manner of Web sites, brought through a T-1 high-capacity telephone line set up just for the event. And of course, they filled plastic bags with all manner of freebies: T-shirts, flying disks, caps and, of course, software.
Elaine Kimmel, 59, who lives nearby, toted a bag filled with goodies, a powerful lure for her. But she also recently bought an Internet-only computer after months of surfing the Web at a library, so anything "dot-com" would have brought her out. "I'm very obsessed with the Internet now," she said. "I'm just thrilled with it. I have so much clutter and thousands of pieces of paper, so I can get rid of it all because all the information is on the Internet."
J. C. Cohen of Brooklyn picked up a CD-ROM for a financial services Web site, infogate.com, and walked around in wonder at the variety of companies. Many of them were start-up firms like Asktherobot.com, but mainstays like I.B.M. and U.P.S. also got in on the action, as did out-of-towners like mall.com, a retail site based in Austin, Tex.
"It's a wider range of companies than I thought," Mr. Cohen said.
Internet service providers, or portals, and companies offering online shopping, though, seemed most abundant. Or at least made the most noise.
"Come on, lonely Matt here is waiting for somebody to e-mail him!" cried a worker for juno.com, an Internet service provider, as another employee, Matt Daly, sat checking his empty in-box.
Workers at cyberrate.com, a retailing site, beckoned passers-by by flashing a strobe light and throwing T-shirts.
Mariolene Jeanbaptiste, dressed as a big red bean, passed out temporary tattoos for beenz.com, an electronic commerce site.
"They'll try anything," said Marion Rodgers, turning away from the big bean with a handful of tattoos. "It's like when you go to the mall and all these people come up to you. I don't know why I would be surprised that Internet companies would be any different. Maybe because you never see real people on the Internet."
Certainly the paradox at hand -- that everybody there had left his home to visit a fair whose companies promise you won't have to because of the Internet -- was not lost on some people.
"It would be interesting to see if they can have a virtual street fair some day," said Adrian Marsh, a sophomore at New York University majoring in English who is thinking of majoring in computer science. "At least that way they would not have to worry about the weather."
Maybe next year, though organizers have more modest goals like using wireless modems next time, and, of course, drawing more companies. Laura Sabia of MarketMatch said she is working on creating similar fairs for other cities, like Boston and Washington.
New York's fair was enough for Alan Barnes, 33, of Park Slope, Brooklyn. "This place was as crowded and jumbled as the Internet," he said as he left empty-handed and walked into that century-old portal, the subway.

HEADLINE: Mayor Says He Wants to Reach Out to Dorismond Family

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who upon ending his campaign for the Senate intimated that he would work to improve his relationship with minority residents, said in an interview broadcast yesterday that he had "sympathy, concern and compassion" for the family of a Haitian-American man killed by the police in March.
The mayor made the remarks on Saturday in an intensely personal interview with Tim Russert for broadcast yesterday on NBC's "Meet the Press." Mr. Giuliani also said he had no regrets about his decision to drop out of the Senate race, given that he now realized that politics was "not the most important thing in life." 
 The half-hour interview touched on a broad range of topics, from Mr. Giuliani's thoughts about his political future to his prostate cancer and what he acknowledged might have been bad advice his father once offered him, suggesting that it is more important to be respected than to be loved.
"You know, fathers make mistakes and fathers are human beings, and I tend to think now that love is more important than I thought," the mayor said.
Mr. Giuliani first acknowledged on Thursday that he did not respond properly to the fatal shooting in March of Patrick M. Dorismond, the Haitian-American man, by a plainclothes police officer who had tried to solicit marijuana from him. Mr. Dorismond, a security guard who was standing outside a Midtown bar, was unarmed and was not carrying drugs.
The mayor said in the "Meet the Press" interview that he intended "to find a way" to let Mr. Dorismond's family know about his regrets, including possibly a visit with his parents. But the mayor again defended his decision on the day of Mr. Dorismond's shooting to release his juvenile arrest record.
"What I should have done is to do a lot more to express sympathy, concern, help, assistance, compassion for a situation where, whether justified or unjustified, whatever it turns out, was still a tragic situation," the mayor said. "I think that is where I made a mistake."
Mr. Giuliani also spoke at length with Mr. Russert about his desire, first expressed on Friday, to try to extend the benefits of New York City's current economic boom to more disaffected communities in the city. The mayor said he had not yet decided how he would do that, but he said he was committed to finding a way "to break down the barriers that I've created" as a result of his own sometimes abrasive personality.
"There are people in the city who feel that they haven't been reached" by the progress in the city in recent years, the mayor said. "There are people that feel that I don't care about them, there are people who feel that I don't take them into equal consideration."
Outside predominantly black churches in Harlem and Queens yesterday, city residents said they would be watching the mayor to see if he lived up to his vows. Many said they were skeptical that the mayor, who has been criticized for increasing tension between the city authorities and New York's ethnic neighborhoods, would succeed.
"You know, it is like a leopard changing his spots," said Douglas K. Henderson, 65, outside the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. "It has got to be some sort of a miracle."
Many said they wanted to see him talk with black leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton and visit in black neighborhoods, and then to act on what he has heard.
"He needs to lend people of color an ear," said Sharon McClarty, 44, a computer technician from Jamaica, Queens. "He has been talking, but he doesn't listen."
Andrea Summers, a mother of two who said she was cut from the welfare rolls as part of the mayor's workfare program, said the mayor needed to soften his harsh stance on welfare. She said she worked at two jobs but could not earn enough to pay the rising rents in Harlem.
She dismissed the mayor's comments about breaking down barriers. "He never comes to our parades, never comes meet the people," she said. "He is never here."
As the mayor's remarks were televised yesterday, founders of the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care challenged him to compensate the Dorismond family by settling a lawsuit it has filed against the city.
Attempts to reach Mr. Dorismond's parents, Marie and Andre Dorismond, through their lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., were unsuccessful yesterday. But on Saturday, Andre Dorismond dismissed the mayor's recent offers of sympathy. "Now it doesn't make sense for him to apologize," he said. "It's been two months since my son died. It's too late."
During the "Meet the Press" interview, the mayor, who said he was still struggling to decide on which cancer treatment to choose, appeared relaxed, laughing and joking with Mr. Russert at times, even offering him one of his trademark Godfather impersonations.
He called the decision to drop out of the Senate race the most difficult of his life, a choice he said he made entirely because of his cancer and not because of the controversy surrounding his relationship with an East Side woman, Judith Nathan, and his decision earlier this month to separate from his wife.
"But for the cancer and the timing of the cancer, I would have gone ahead and done it," Mr. Giuliani said.
Mr. Giuliani, 55, who has 18 months left in office, deferred questions about his own political future, not indicating if he might make a run for governor or accept an appointment to the cabinet of George W. Bush, if Mr. Bush wins his bid for president.
"I love politics," the mayor said. "The thing I felt good about as I made the decision" to leave the Senate race is: "I finally figured out that politics in not my life. My life is about things that are closer to you and deeper than that."
And Mr. Giuliani said he had not yet decided what he would do with the approximately $9 million in unspent campaign contributions he had amassed, noting only that he intended to do as much as he could to support Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island.
"I am going to try to do everything I can to help" Mr. Lazio, the mayor said, "if it is advertising, if it's an appearance, if it's figuring out how to make sure they're able to raise money."

HEADLINE: E-COMMERCE REPORT;
Internet businesses may find the global village dauntingly native.

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
FALLING stock prices are not the only numbers giving e-commerce executives heartburn these days. Equally unsettling to some Internet merchants is the flood of statistics suggesting that to keep their businesses growing, they have to look outside the United States.
A report to be released today by IDC, an Internet research firm, predicts that two-thirds of all e-commerce spending will take place outside the country by 2003. In that year, IDC says, consumer spending on Web sites in the United States will reach $119 billion, but overseas sites will garner $209 billion of business. 
 And yet, with the investment community demanding that Web merchants find a speedier path to profitability, the merchants can hardly justify the expenses associated with rolling out sites aimed at other nations.
Those expenses can be substantial. According to Eric Schmitt, an analyst with the Forrester Research consulting firm, retailers can spend "a couple million dollars in the first year of international efforts."
"And this is a treadmill," he said. "You don't just build the Spanish version and walk away. It's a beast that needs to be fed."
Just last week, Boo.com, a British fashion e-tailer, went out of business a mere six months after its public stock offering. Boo.com had quickly become insolvent -- in large part because of the strain of trying to start up in 18 different countries simultaneously.
Barry Parr, author of the IDC report, said that even when e-commerce companies have the money to devote to overseas expansion, "these markets can be very difficult to address." In addition to the obvious language hurdles, he said e-tailers faced regulatory challenges with import and export rules, taxation and technology issues, and wrinkles in each country's customer service and fulfillment approaches.
Industry executives said that any of these items could, if mishandled, torpedo a company's international efforts. But fulfillment issues are particularly problematic. When the e-commerce trend took off two years ago, some analysts predicted that Web merchants would overturn traditional retailing, which tended to be based on customers who shop within 10 miles of their homes.
Indeed, that revolutionary sentiment partly fueled investors' enthusiasm for companies like Amazon.com and CDNow, which quickly found customers throughout the world who were willing to shop on their sites. But the last year consumers and businesses have acknowledged that many customers prefer to do business with retailers that can serve them both on the Web and in a local store if they want to return items.
At the very least, analysts said, consumers want to shop with an Internet retailer that can handle customer service problems and returns from the same continent.
For Web merchants with global aspirations, that frequently means building and staffing customer service centers on different continents -- as Amazon did when it set up a phone center in the Netherlands this year -- as well as working with local distributors or manufacturers.
Despite such a daunting list of investment and cultural challenges, Mr. Parr of IDC said globalization plans were imperative for Internet retailers.
"I tell companies that before they leap into wireless initiatives, they should figure out their international strategy. It has to be part of the plan."
In devising that strategy, analysts say one crucial decision is how a company manages its foreign Web sites. On one hand, if a company chooses to manage the global operations from the United States, its foreign sites are far more prone to make linguistic and merchandising mistakes -- for instance, selling goods that might be offensive in certain cultures, or offering product instructions that are delivered with the wrong tone.
"In Japan, you wouldn't say 'Don't turn the left knob,' because that's too direct," said Charles Baxter, chief executive of eTranslate, a consulting company. "You'd say something like 'It would be much better to turn the right knob.' "
Such mistakes are less likely if companies hire a team in each foreign market to handle the Web site, analysts said. But that, too, can lead to problems for companies trying to convey a consistent brand message.
"Customers can spot inconsistencies," Forrester's Mr. Schmitt said. "If you have to deal in multiple countries, you don't want 10 sites with a different look and feel at every one, and companies don't want to have 10 different backend systems."
One of the earliest successes in e-commerce globalization was Dell Computer, which began selling on the Web in 1996 and now has sites aimed at 85 different countries and territories. According to Frank Muehleman, senior vice president of Dell's worldwide division, the company uses a decentralized approach with its international sites.
Dell created a common technology platform for each of its global sites, including a template for ordering and product information, which ensures a consistent user experience across the sites. In addition several hundred specialists give advice and training to the local managers. "Then we let the local team handle the rollout," Mr. Muehleman said.
Just as important, Mr. Muehleman said, Dell built manufacturing plants in each of the regions it serves, including Brazil, Ireland, China and Malaysia. And because the company employs local customer service staff, he said, "every time a customer picks up the phone, they're dealing with someone local."
The Internet companies that have been the most active on the global front are the so-called portals, like Yahoo, Alta Vista and Lycos -- last week Lycos agreed to be acquired by Terra Networks, the Internet arm of the Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica de Espana. The portals' expansion into other nations, while not easy, has been a relative snap compared with the travails of companies that must actually move goods across borders.
And even e-commerce companies that do not sell goods on the Web, like financial firms, have encountered plenty of obstacles in other countries. When the online broker Schwab.com started a site for clients in Britain in 1998, for instance, many customers there balked at online trading because they were accustomed to exchanging paper stock certificates in each transaction. Chiefly because Schwab.com refused to give paper certificates to its online customers, the site generated just 15,000 new accounts between June 1998 and June 1999, according to Russ Shaw, senior vice president of marketing for Charles Schwab Europe.
The site then offered 30 days of commission-free trading to new customers last summer, and generated nearly 30,000 new customers in about two months. For both the customers and Schwab, Mr. Shaw said, "it's been an education process."
Analysts say that most e-commerce companies are reluctant to begin that process, given the already steep learning curve they have encountered in the domestic market. But some alternatives may emerge.
American e-tailers, for example, could form partnerships with retailers in other nations that want e-commerce sites of their own but lack the expertise to build them. Mr. Parr, the IDC analyst, said that under such an approach, an American e-tailer could lend its technology, and perhaps its name, to a foreign counterpart, which in turn would offer its local distribution and customer service systems and expertise. The companies would then share the revenues.
Martin McClanan, chief executive of Red Envelope, a gift site, said he had been approached several times with similar offers, but so far he had demurred. "Our plan is to bring this business to scale in the U.S. first," he said. "Then, when we can dedicate a 20-person team to another country, we'll do that." The company might consider global expansion plans after this holiday season, he added.
"It's so easy to want to boil the ocean and do everything," he said. "But in retail it's all about execution. And getting this business to profitability is still first and foremost."

HEADLINE: Ruins Alter Ideas of How Civilization Spread

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
In the northeastern corner of Syria, near the Iraqi border and within sight of southern Turkey's Taurus Mountains, archaeologists have begun excavations of an ancient settlement that lay on a major trade route from Nineveh to Aleppo. The ruins from more than 5,500 years ago are telling them that previous ideas about the spread of early civilization were more than likely wrong.
The first trenches cut into the large 500-acre site, Tell Hamoukar, have yielded strong evidence that centrally administered complex societies in northern regions of the Middle East apparently arose simultaneously but independently of the more celebrated city-states of southern Mesopotamia, in what is now southern Iraq. In the conventional view, civilization was thought to begin solely in the south and then move north through trade and colonization. 
 In an announcement of the new finds, Dr. McGuire Gibson, an archaeologist at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, said, "We need to reconsider our ideas about the beginnings of civilization, pushing the time further back."
Other archaeologists familiar with the research agreed in interviews last week that the Tell Hamoukar excavations confirmed and should elaborate on a consensus that has emerged among scholars in the last decade about the role of northern settlements in Syria and Iraq and in southeastern Turkey in the development of civilization. These settlements exhibited many of the attributes of civilization -- monumental architecture, division of labor, social stratification -- apparently before they had any significant contact with people in the lower valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
"It's a very important excavation," said Dr. Gil J. Stein, an archaeologist at Northwestern University. "It fits in really nicely with a picture that's been emerging, based on several other excavation sites."
Even Dr. Guillermo Algaze, an archaeologist at the University of California at San Diego, who had argued for a south-to-north transplantation of early civilization, said that he now generally agreed with the new interpretation. "I've been eating a lot of crow lately," he said.
Excavations at Tell Hamoukar were started last summer by a joint expedition of the Oriental Institute and the Syrian Directorate General of Antiquities. Work will resume next month and will probably continue for many years. The site promises an abundance of artifacts, archaeologists said, not only because of its large size but also because most of the material seems to be close to the surface.
Digging into the oldest layer of ruins uncovered so far, archaeologists found traces of people living in villages at the site as early as 4000 B.C. Within 300 years, the settlement had grown into a prosperous town of at least 32 acres with ample evidence of a well-organized society of the kind associated with the early stages of civilization.
For one thing, Dr. Gibson said, the town appeared to be enclosed by a defensive wall 10 feet high and 13 feet wide. Such walls came with civilization.
Inside the walls the archaeologists dug up the remains of fine pottery and several large ovens, shaped like igloos, evidence of food preparation on an institutional scale. The same areas held pieces of large cooking pots and animal bones and traces of wheat, barley and oats for what must have been a bakery and also probably a brewery.
"Preparing bread and food on such a scale is evidence of a society in which somebody is organizing people and resources," Dr. Gibson said. "You are building up a hierarchy, a social structure that's a mark of civilization."
Some of the most telling evidence for an organized, stratified society, archaeologists said, were the seals the people probably used to mark containers of food and other goods. Some of the seals are small, with only simple incisions or cross-hatching. Others are larger, presumably for higher officials to stamp more valuable goods. One of these stamping seals was in the form of a leopard with 13 spots, and others were in the shape of deer, bears and ducks.
"We would propose that the larger, more elaborate seals with figurative scenes were held only by the few people who had greater authority, while the smaller, simply incised seals were used by many more people with less authority," Dr. Gibson said. "The difference would be something like the signature of the regional director of customs of Chicago compared to the rubber stamps that say only 'U.S. Customs.' "
In southern Mesopotamia at this time, an expanding population and increased food production from irrigation were changing the social landscape even more drastically. Economies were being run by increasingly centralized leadership. Agricultural villages grew into urban centers, some of which were in time ruled by local kings. This became known to scholars as the Uruk period, after one of the more prominent of these southern city-states, more than 400 miles south of Tell Hamoukar, and it was the period that established Mesopotamia as "the cradle of civilization."
The Chicago archaeologists said they had found no pottery or other evidence of Uruk influences on the Tell Hamoukar settlement in the 3700-3500 B.C. period. Some Uruk-type pottery shows up around 3200, by which time there was perhaps a substantial southern Mesopotamian presence at the site.
Other excavations at Tell Brak, also in northeast Syria, and Hacinebi and Arslantepe, in southeast Turkey, have also revealed that complex societies had developed before any significant contact with the Uruk people, Dr. Stein said.
So when southern Mesopotamians did expand into the north in the middle to late fourth millennium, Dr. Stein concluded, they "came into contact with northern polities that were already quite advanced chiefdoms, even though they were not as large in scale as the urbanized states of the south."
Although he now agrees with this view, Dr. Algaze cautioned that it would be a mistake to allow "the pendulum of thinking to swing too far in the other direction" and conclude that the northern societies were comparable in their scale of development with those in the south. Since the first writing presumably developed to handle record-keeping for a centralized economy, he said, the fact that writing originated in Sumer, in southern Mesopotamia, indicated a more advanced society there.
In a publication of the Oriental Institute, Dr. Gibson noted that a few scholars were even suggesting that perhaps civilization began not in southern Mesopotamia, but in the north, and that it gradually made its way south.
"Before we start revising our textbooks, however, we should remember that there was an even earlier contact with people who had come from southern Mesopotamia," he wrote, referring to a southern culture in the Ubaid period, extending from 5500 to about 4000 B.C. Some Ubaid pottery and other artifacts have been found scattered throughout the Middle East.
Dr. Richard Zettler, a University of Pennsylvania archaeologist with extensive experience in Syria, said: "I'm convinced that our real focus now should not be on the Uruk period, but the Ubaid. It's not a terribly well-known period."
For one reason, he said, remains from the Ubaid period are hard to find in southern Mesopotamia. They are presumably buried deep beneath Uruk sites or covered by river silt. Archaeologists may have more luck looking for an earlier transition to complex societies at sites in the north, perhaps including Tell Hamoukar.
Dr. Gibson would make no promises. "It's a very big site and it's going to take a lot of digging," he said.

HEADLINE: Proud Russia Keeps Mir Aloft

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

 BODY:
By some plans, it should have been long dead. With most of its structure disintegrated by a fiery re-entry through Earth's atmosphere, the remains of the giant spacecraft should be resting on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
Instead, the Russian Mir space station remains in orbit. Even as astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis were preparing the nascent International Space Station for future occupancy, a pair of astronauts aboard Mir were busily repairing worn components and readying it for future visits. Previously abandoned, battered and showing all the effects of its sometimes troubled 14 years in space, the Mir just keeps going on and on. 
 Long the subject of premature obituaries, Mir, the pride of the cash-starved Russian space program, is now operating because of last-minute money from Western investors. With the help of more than $20 million in outside money and spacecraft supplied by Russian partners, it appears life of the 130-ton space station may extend past its 15th anniversary in orbit next February.
"I am not surprised that the Russians found a way to keep Mir up," said Marcia Smith, a space analyst with the Library of Congress's Congressional Research Service. "It is a source of great national pride and they are very resourceful."
While Mir's continued operation delights Russia and some space enthusiasts worldwide, the United States and other partners in the next-generation International Space Station see it as a potential threat to the new project. How can Russia, they ask, with its limited resources, both support Mir and keep its commitments as a major partner in the new station?
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which is leading the international project, notes that Russia is a sovereign nation with the right to do what it wants with Mir and the rest of its space program. But NASA officials express chagrin that the international project is more than two years behind schedule, mainly because of Russian delays in completing critical components because of inadequate financing.
NASA's administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, told a Congressional subcommittee last month that he was highly frustrated that Russia would agree to a venture to extend Mir operations after saying that it would abandon the station and concentrate its resources on the new project. "They always seem to have a little extra money around for Mir but not the International Space Station," he said.
Mr. Goldin said earlier that Russia must keep its agreement to concentrate its resources on the new project. "The Russians have got to focus, and the primary focus is meeting their commitment to the International Space Station," he said, "If Mir saps their strength in meeting their commitments, then we have serious problems."
The first two modules of the $60 billion international station, one American and one Russian, have been in orbit since the fall of 1998 awaiting the arrival of a crucial third component, a Russian-made service module that is to provide initial living quarters and laboratory space for the growing station. Program officials say the Russian segment, which must be in place before more parts are added to the station, is ready and set to be launched in July.
Meanwhile, the Russian astronauts Sergei Zalyotin and Aleksandr Kalery continue their 60-day mission of putting Mir back into working order and assessing the orbiting outpost for future renovations and commercial applications. The crew arrived at Mir on April 6 and concentrated on making the station habitable again before starting a program of scientific research. The astronauts found and patched what they believe was the source of a persistent air leak, and used supplies brought up by an unmanned Progress cargo craft to repair and restock the station.
On May 12, the astronauts conducted a five-hour spacewalk outside Mir to inspect its outer hull and retrieve experimental packages left out by previous crews. They discovered that a solar power panel that stopped working in March apparently suffered a short circuit that charred external wiring and tested a new glue designed to seal cracks in aging spacecraft. The glue, which its developers said could be used to fill small cracks and leaks in any spacecraft, was applied to a special test panel and left outside Mir to be retrieved later.
All of this activity comes just nine months after Mir was supposedly abandoned in preparation for nudging it out of orbit with rockets and letting it burn up in the upper atmosphere. The Russian government pledged to put no more money into the station and let it die, unless private financing was found to keep it in orbit. Several groups proposed schemes to save Mir, but none could come up with the estimated $100 million to $200 million a year needed to operate the station.
This situation changed at the beginning of the year when a group of Western investors formed a company called MirCorp and began raising money. MirCorp, chartered in Bermuda and based in Amsterdam, received initial financing of about $20 million from Gold & Appel Transfer S.A., a Caribbean-based venture capital holding company. In February, MirCorp signed an agreement with RSC Energia, the privatized Russian company that built and operates Mir, for commercial use of the station for the remainder of its life. Energia, which is 38 percent owned by the Russian government, became the majority stockholder in MirCorp and retains ownership of Mir.
MirCorp announced sweeping plans for the station, including turning it into a space hotel for wealthy tourists willing to pay $20 million for a unique vacation, leasing space to pharmaceutical and materials companies wanting to do proprietary research, and establishing Internet and entertainment businesses in space.
Jeffrey Manber, an American who is president of MirCorp, said in an interview that the company had raised $40 million so far and was trying to drum up another $100 million before a possible public stock offering next year. Mr. Manber said the company had almost raised enough money for its next announced mission to Mir, sending up a crew this fall with equipment to start Internet services from orbit and beginning renovations of the station.
"We have not promised things that we have not delivered," Mr. Manber said. "We have hit our technical milestones and have hit the basics of our business model, and are very optimistic about our chances. With each success we have, we think we can raise more money on the good news."
Mr. Manber said that, according to the accounting and investment firms the company is consulting about a stock offering, MirCorp could raise between $300 million and $500 million by going public. If this happens, he said, the Russians could come away with up to $200 million to revitalize their space industry and the company would have more money to upgrade the station and perhaps even build a new central module for it.
"Only the core module of Mir is 14 years old," Mr. Manber said. "If you build a new core and add the newer modules of the current station, then you have a much younger station in space available for commercial uses for a long time."
James E. Oberg, a former NASA engineer and Houston-based expert on the Russian space program, said MirCorp was not assured success, "but I admire them for giving it a try."
"They have taken a risky, innovative approach and the basis of opportunity is taking chances," Mr. Oberg said, "A lot of the things they are proposing are off-the-wall ideas, but some have merits."
Charles P. Vick, a space analyst with the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, said he did not believe there was enough private interest and money available to finance expansive Mir plans. "I don't think the capital is there, unless it is put in by governments. It just seems like a limited program that won't go very far."
John E. Pike, another federation analyst, said the changing political climate in Russia might be shifting in Mir's favor. Russia's new president, Vladimir V. Putin, pledged last month to fulfill his country's commitments to the international station, but also voiced strong support for Mir and the Russian space industry. "The space sector is not only a prestigious sector which makes our country a great power," Mr. Putin said, "but it is also linked to economic and scientific development."
During this commemoration of the nation's annual Astronaut Day, Russian news agencies reported that Mr. Putin said he would include money for Mir in next year's space budget.
"This suggests a continuation of Mir that the previous administration of Boris N. Yeltsin said it didn't support," Mr. Pike said. "Is this part of a larger re-evaluation of Russia's relationship with the United States, a signal of a new Russian independence?"

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Madison Avenue decides it's time to make a concerted push to advertise advertising.

BYLINE: By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
THE brain drain is becoming a serious problem for Madison Avenue, top executives say, as talented professionals are lured away by other industries, particularly those involving the Internet, and talented students eschew advertising for dot-coms, Wall Street, consulting companies and even Hollywood.
Whether it's low salaries for entry-level positions, the lack of training programs, the notion that advertising is part of the old economy or misperceptions about what advertising is, agencies and trade organizations say they realize it's time to advertise advertising. 
 "One thing we know how to do is market," said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive at the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, known as the Four A's.
"The need for more and better talent coming into the business has been around for two to three years now," he added. "It's not a shortage of people interested in advertising; we just want to be sure we're getting the best-qualified people."
Toward that end, the Advertising Educational Foundation in New York has put up a Web site at www.AEF.com to answer questions from prospective industry employees. The site, which was built by two employees at Advanced Media Concepts in New York, Richard Goldstein and Todd Rengel, is updated regularly. The two have since opened their own Web agency, Animus Rex.
"As the ad industry clients embrace the new economy, so does the industry itself," said David Bell, chairman of the foundation, who is also chairman and chief executive at True North Communications.
The site has been organized into different channels based on recommendations from participants in the foundation's ambassador program -- professionals who visit campuses to meet informally with students studying or interested in studying advertising.
"We can harness the power of the Web to be ubiquitous," said Paula Alex, managing director at the foundation.
One channel focuses specifically on college students, offering detailed information about how agencies are organized, how to prepare for a job interview and how to develop a portfolio of work for those interested in becoming copywriters or art directors.
That channel has links to other resources, like the online job board at www.AAAAdvertisingJobs.com, set up by the Four A's by an agency known as Little Tornadoes in New York. Job seekers can search the directory of posted positions by agency, location or job function and apply online. There were 463 jobs posted from 378 agency offices as of last Thursday.
Other channels at www.AEF.com offer more general information about advertising's relationship to society and the economy. They include a reference library with news articles on advertising and advertising-related topics, an academic journal and a schedule of coming events. There is also a channel offering "interactive dialogues" with participants in the ambassador program, for online question-and-answer sessions.
"I wish I was an advertising student about a year from now when this puppy's really humming," Mr. Bell said.
Ron Mason, executive vice president and human resources director at BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, described Web sites like the foundation's as helpful because they were representative of how students now obtain information.
But when it comes to another industry problem -- retaining employees who are pondering an exit -- Web sites are "not the best or only vehicle," he added.
"Try to have discussions and tell them how well they're doing, and when they can move ahead," Mr. Mason said. "Keep a person from sitting there wondering what's happening with their career."
Mr. Mason said he found it more difficult to retain employees with about two years' experience than to find talented entry-level employees.
"For those who see the dollar signs, we can't compete; we're not going to even try," he added. "Find out what else a person is missing."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Unexpectedly Files Another Brief

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Microsoft filed an unexpected brief with a federal judge today that quoted from a five-year-old government legal document in which the Justice Department argued that breaking up Microsoft would be "against the public interest" and "dangerous to the economy's welfare."
The document was part of the public record from an older antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department's first suit against the company. The nine-page brief gives Microsoft the final word before a hearing on Wednesday but risks irritating the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who did not ask for another filing from Microsoft when he laid out the schedule for the remedy phase of the case. 
 Under the schedule set by Judge Jackson in April, the Justice Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28 asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial. Then, 12 days later, Microsoft responded with its own proposal, a short list of narrow restrictions on its behavior, while denouncing the government's plan.
Last Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a reply to Microsoft's brief, saying the company's proposal was "a cosmetic remedy" of no real worth. That was to have been the last filing. But a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said the company "believes it is appropriate for the company to have a reply to focus on a few issues raised in the government's last brief."
While citing the old Justice Department documents, Microsoft also repeated several legal arguments it had made previously. Among them, the company stated that the courts have never broken up a company for antitrust violations; all previous breakups have been a result of settlements of antitrust suits. "For all its sophistry in discussing the case law, the government fails to identify a single precedent for its radical breakup proposal," Microsoft wrote.
The Justice Department did not respond to Microsoft's filing, but a lawyer who is close to the government's current case said it "relies on statements made before Microsoft had engaged in the numerous illegal acts found in the current case."
The legal document quoted in the Microsoft brief came from the Justice Department's first antitrust suit against Microsoft, which was resolved in 1995. That case was settled when Microsoft accepted several behavioral restrictions.
Under a law known as the Tunney Act, any settlement of an antitrust suit must be put up for public comment before the judge can decide whether to approve it. And much of the industry comment then was disparaging; executives called the proposed settlement inadequate and argued that Microsoft ought to be broken up instead.
Responding to those public comments, the Justice Department filed the brief Microsoft quoted today. In it the government's economist then, Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, wrote that breakup remedies "designed to return the market to equilibrium" are "likely to be of the form of penalizing whatever firm happens to be leading, Microsoft in this case."
Today, the lawyer who is close to the government's case said, "That Microsoft repeatedly violated the law after the previous proceeding demonstrates why structural relief is necessary now."

HEADLINE: G.M. in Deal On Fuel Cells

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 22

 BODY:
General Motors said today that it had formed an alliance with Giner Inc. to refine fuel-cell technology to power cars and trucks. The financial terms were not disclosed.
The companies said they would work to speed development of commercially viable fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to make electricity. One significant hurdle is lowering the cost for mass production of fuel-cell vehicles. 
 Automakers are under pressure from government regulators to cut emissions and bolster fuel economy. Fuel cells burn cleaner than other types of power technology.
Giner, based in Waltham, Mass., has developed battery technologies used in United States space missions.

HEADLINE: Groups Fear Exclusion From the U.N.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 22

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan, hoping to dissuade the disparate forces of anti-globalization from demonstrating against a United Nations millennium assembly in September, told a gathering of independent groups today that the solution to global inequalities is not confrontation but cooperation with international organizations.
Not all members of the United Nations are hearing that message, the leaders of some private organizations say. They see doors closing, not opening, to them as they try to play a larger part in United Nations work. 
 "Whatever cause you champion, the cure does not lie in protesting against globalization itself," Mr. Annan said on the opening day of a weeklong Millennium Forum of independent groups -- some of which had supported attacks on the World Trade Organization in Seattle and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington. "The poor are poor not because of globalization, but because of too little, because they are not part of it, because they are excluded."
But as Mr. Annan praised private agencies and advocacy groups for their successful work on social issues and urged them to join hands with him and with business leaders to rectify economic wrongs, several independent groups were reporting that they are feeling a backlash at the United Nations, as countries try to limit their access and activities.
In recent years nongovernmental organizations -- known around the world as N.G.O.'s -- have been increasingly active in and around the United Nations in fields as diverse as international criminal law, the environment, arms control and women's rights. They have often framed issues succinctly and done the most successful lobbying for world attention to them.
The organizations gain access to the United Nations and its meetings through a committee of the Economic and Social Council, which has the power to deny them accreditation. Most at risk are human rights and democracy groups, which come under close scrutiny from countries like China, India, Cuba and Russia.
Last week, the 19-member accrediting committee did not approve a number of groups until more discussions could be held. Among those in danger of losing access to United Nations events is Freedom House, the New York-based research organization that measures democracy and press freedom worldwide.
The accusation against Freedom House, made by China with backing from Cuba and Sudan, is on a technicality: that the organization tricked the United Nations into providing unauthorized interpreter services during the Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva to translate for Chinese-speaking members of their delegation.
The Chinese included members of Falun Gong and the China Democracy Party, but they were not speaking for their own organizations, which do not have access, but for Freedom House, said Michael Goldfarb, spokesman for the organization. Translation was provided freely by the United Nations, he added. "We work by the book," he said.
Adrian Karatnycky, president of Freedom House, called the move against his organization "an attempt by closed societies to muzzle free comment and the open discussion of human rights violations at the United Nations." The case will be taken up again in June by the committee, whose members are Algeria, Bolivia, Chile, China, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, France, Germany, India, Lebanon, Pakistan, Romania, Russia, Senegal, Sudan, Turkey, Tunisia and the United States.
Cora Weiss, president of The Hague Appeal for Peace Foundation, said groups interested in publicizing human rights abuses in Chechnya are coming under similar pressure from Russia. She said the current committee, which was elected in January to a four-year term, appears to have a majority weighted against rights organizations. The extent of this trend will be apparent next month, when final decisions on access will be announced for a number of groups.
"The U.N. and governments can't survive without the partnership of organized civil society," Ms. Weiss said, echoing Mr. Annan's remarks. "We should be embraced, not feared."

HEADLINE: Joining the Club: Like Others, China Will Try to Protect Its Own Industries

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 22

 BODY:
Sun Guomin, a poor farmer in a village west of here, represents an example of why American business executives and government officials may be disappointed once China enters the World Trade Organization.
While American businesses have been dreaming of the vast potential markets for their goods and services in China, the government is unlikely to allow the West the kind of access those dreams are made of. For if Beijing immediately did everything the trade organization requires, Mr. Sun and millions like him could be driven out of business. 
 And with droves of laid-off workers already mounting sporadic protests across the country, giving foreign competition a hand in wiping out whole industries could amount to political suicide for China's governing Communist Party.
Agriculture is one of the most vulnerable areas.
Mr. Sun, 68, is struggling to get by on his six and a half acres of land in the village of Nansong, west of Shanghai, where he lives in a mud house on a dirt path with his wife, Chen Baonan.
He has already stopped growing barley, once a major crop in this part of the flat Yangtze River delta, because it does not pay. He and his neighbors still grow rapeseed, the source of canola oil, and the plant's brilliant yellow flowers carpet the delta with color each spring.
But the price the government pays for rapeseed has fallen so low, Mr. Sun says, that he is better off pressing the seeds himself and using the cooking oil at home. He would gladly lease his field to a factory, but the government will not let him, citing a need to preserve farmland. He and his wife have opened a small store in the front of their house, where they make about five cents a day selling cigarettes and beer.
Joining the W.T.O. threatens to make China's agricultural economics even worse.
Last year China imported record quantities of rapeseed and soybeans, because foreign oilseed production is cheaper and the quality often higher than that of domestically grown crops. But to enter the trade group, China has agreed to lift quotas that it now uses to restrict the import of edible oils. A surge in imports would further dampen demand for seeds from people like Mr. Sun.
The problem exists pretty much across the board.
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government research institute in Beijing, recently estimated that prices for Chinese grain and other agricultural products would continue to exceed those of the global market for the next 20 years.
Thanks to huge mechanized farms, the American cost of production is often lower than that in China, where farming employs as many as 600 million people, fields are fragmented and transportation is slow.
And many other labor-intensive industries are in the same boat.
Many of the country's 100-plus automobile assembly plants face extinction if imports surge as tariffs fall, and chemical plants could be crippled by foreign competition. The Chinese government wants to reform the economy, but it favors a cautious, go-slow approach rather than risk widespread unrest that could undermine its rule.
"It's important to think about stability," said Zhou Hanming, a lawyer who advises the government about the W.T.O.
Mr. Zhou says that the two to five years in which the organization requires members to put most of its mandated measures into effect is too short a time, and that China will do what it must to shelter industries until they are ready to face global competition.
"We're working very hard on a large number of new laws and regulations that will offer protection of national industries, vulnerable industries, infant industries," he said.
Mr. Zhou, one of dozens of experts Beijing has enlisted to prepare the country to defend its industries, is studying ways to use anti-dumping rules. Under China's trade deal with the United States, Washington insisted that it be allowed to levy punitive duties against imports that it deems to be sold below cost. Washington wanted the clause to protect the American textile industry from cheap Chinese imports, but China has seized on the provision to protect its own threatened industries.
"We're going to learn how to use the same weapon," Mr. Zhou said.
The country will also use other means to give threatened industries an edge, including preferential bank loans and tax breaks. And Beijing may end longstanding tax breaks for foreign companies that were intended to encourage investment.
But China does hope to use its membership in the trade group as a lever to move moribund state industries toward real reform.
Take the pharmaceutical industry, which still relies largely on copies, often illegal, of Western compounds. China will come under pressure from the group to enforce the intellectual property rights of foreign drug makers. To survive, Chinese pharmaceutical firms will have to invest in research and development and begin producing original drugs.
"The pressure will help force us to depend on ourselves," said Wang Li, general manager of the Shanghai Joy Biopharm Company, a state-owned drug laboratory started five years ago to develop commercially viable pharmaceuticals for the domestic industry.
And China hopes that membership in the group will spur foreign investment, which fell last year for the first time since investors withdrew after the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
Multinational corporations have already begun signaling their willingness to pump more money into China after it joins. Nonetheless, protection is high on Beijing's agenda.
China is not known for its strict adherence to trade agreements. In 1995, Trade Minister Wu Yi signed a deal with the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, that promised to protect American intellectual property rights. But counterfeiting of computer software and movies on compact disks is now more common than ever. Street hawkers sell the latest Hollywood blockbusters in most Chinese cities, and the police ignore the activity.
Nor has China proven a progressive member of another trade club. As a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, it has resisted moves to speed the liberalization of financial services.
The opening of China's market is more likely to mirror that of Japan's. Tokyo agreed to open its tightly closed rice market starting in 1995 with a so-called minimum access program. But thanks to various protectionist measures, imports still account for less than 7 percent of the rice consumed in Japan.
China may take its cue from other members of the trade group as well. Despite pressure from the group, for example, the European Union continues to protect its farmers from imported bananas and hormone-treated beef.
And even if China does follow the organization's rules, there is plenty of room for interpretation. As a member, the country has agreed to import 20 foreign-made films a year. But it can reduce the competitive impact on its own film industry by picking films from, say, other Asian countries instead of Hollywood.
"Behind the promise there are related mechanisms and measures to restrict what is promised," one of China's trade negotiators told Hua Sheng Monthly, a state-owned newspaper. For example, China promised to let foreign insurance companies operate in 15 cities in two years' time, up from the 3 cities to which they are now limited. "But 'allow' does not necessarily mean that companies can enter the market," the official was quoted as saying. "They will still need approval."

HEADLINE: Union Welcomes Gore, Despite China Views

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore voiced perfunctory support today for the China trade agreement, reading a statement in front of a labor group that opposes the China bill and is rallying in Washington against it.
Mr. Gore's appearance before about 175 members of the United Food and Commercial Workers was preceded by a videotape of his acceptance speech last fall after winning the endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. He began his speech today by mentioning a few of the issues on which they agreed, like raising the minimum wage, instituting new standards for workplace safety and passing a patients' bill of rights. 
 "On all these issues and on many many more, some of which I'm going to discuss here today, we agree," Mr. Gore said. "But in candor, I do have to begin here by saying something about an issue where we differ.
"I know that one of your legislative priorities is to urge members of Congress not to support permanent normal trade relations with China," he went on, referring to the vote scheduled for Wednesday. "I respect your view. You know that I do not share that view. I strongly support normal trade relations with China, because I believe it is right for America's economy and right for the cause of reform in China," he said.
After another sentence or two, he eased back into the many points of agreement between himself and labor, and the audience appeared to be as forgiving of his pro-China position as they were relieved that he did not make much of an issue of it. Still, the food workers union, which represents numerous service workers, has less at stake in the trade issue than the industrial unions have.
The workers gave him a standing ovation when he pledged to ban the use of permanent striker replacements and applauded him at several other points.
"We're not naive," David Mertz, 32, a political worker for the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is affiliated with the food workers, said after the speech. "But on the vast majority of issues, we'll stand with him and he'll stand with us."
Labor's endorsement of Mr. Gore and opposition to the China bill has tied one hand behind Mr. Gore's back as he has stood with the Clinton administration on urging passage of the bill.
Still, the degree to which he has pressed for passage is unclear. He did attend and speak at a White House pep rally on the bill recently, but his comments were overshadowed by those of former presidents and other notables. He has said that he has personally lobbied some members of Congress, but he would not name them.
The Republicans have been quick to say that Mr. Gore's support has been tepid, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival, has suggested that he has been more enthused about the matter than has Mr. Clinton's own vice president.
"So far, Al Gore has only paid lip service to his position" on permanent normal trade relations for China, Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, said in a statement today. "He may offer tepid support for China P.N.T.R. in a room full of former secretaries of state and ambassadors, but before union audiences, his support disappears."
But others, like George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America, have said that Mr. Gore has been lobbying hard for the measure and would suffer for that in November because labor would not work hard for him.
"We are not going to be forgiving on this," Mr. Becker said earlier this month.
Two of the biggest unions in the labor federation -- the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers -- withheld their endorsements of the vice president because of the China deal.
Mr. Gore began his day with breakfast with Thabo Mbeki, president of South Africa, and concluded his evening by attending a state dinner at the White House for him.
But Gore aides were circumspect about their discussions. Mr. Gore has come under continuing protest from AIDS activists -- as recently as last week -- for administration policy that had the effect of blocking cheaper anti-AIDS drugs to South Africa.
A Gore spokesman said today only that Mr. Gore and Mr. Mbeki discussed the matter of AIDS in Africa. An administration official said Mr. Mbeki discussed the matter with President Clinton but was uncertain of Mr. Gore's involvement.

HEADLINE: Justices Sidestep Constitutionality in Rulings in Federal Arson and False Claims Cases

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The Supreme Court took a step back today from its continuing confrontation with Congress over the boundaries of federal authority, interpreting two federal laws in a manner that avoided the need to rule on challenges to the statutes' constitutionality.
The court unanimously interpreted the federal arson law as not applying to arson of a house used solely as a private residence. A man sentenced to 35 years in federal prison for throwing a Molotov cocktail into a cousin's house had challenged his conviction on the ground that Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce did not extend to making such an act a federal crime. The justices today vacated the conviction on the narrower, purely statutory ground that the law "does not reach an owner-occupied residence that is not used for any commercial purpose." 
 In a second case, the court ruled that Congress did not intend to make the states liable to suit by private plaintiffs under the False Claims Act, a federal law that allows individuals to sue on the government's behalf for claims of fraud in government contracting.
This 7-to-2 decision avoided the deeper constitutional issue of whether states are immune from such suits under the 11th Amendment, which the court has invoked several times recently to shield state governments from the application of federal law.
However, in a sign that the justices are by no means finished with their examination of the limits of congressional authority, the court accepted a new and potentially far-reaching case about federal authority for decision in its next term.
The new case is a challenge to federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act over isolated wetlands, including seasonal ponds and small lakes that are not connected to navigable interstate waterways but serve as habitats for migratory birds. A regional solid waste agency in Cook County, Ill., which was denied a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to fill in such a wetland for use as a waste disposal site, is arguing that Congress lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate such areas.
According to a brief filed in the case by the National Association of Homebuilders, there are 8.3 million isolated wetlands in the country. Under its regulations, the Army Corps of Engineers, which has the authority to issue permits under the Clean Water Act, broadly defines the waters under its jurisdiction to include "intrastate lakes, rivers, streams," as well as prairie potholes, wet meadows, and ponds, and including waters used by migratory birds that cross state lines.
In denying the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County permission to fill 17.6 acres, which included seasonally wet depressions left from a former strip mining operation, the Army Corps of Engineers said there were numerous migratory birds nesting at or using the site, including a large colony of great blue herons.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, upheld the corps's position in a ruling last year that noted the cumulative effect on the economy of the "millions of people" who hunt, trap, or observe migratory birds. Even if there is no effect on commerce from the destruction of a particular isolated habitat, the court said, "the aggregate effect is clear, and that is all the Commerce Clause requires."
However, the soundness of that analysis is in fact far from clear following the Supreme Court's decision last week that struck down the civil remedy provision of the Violence Against Women Act on the ground that violence against women lacked a sufficient connection with commerce. The justices received appeal in the new case, Solid Waste Agency v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, No. 99-1178, in January but deferred acting on it until after deciding the Violence Against Women Act case.
Of the two federalism cases the court decided today, the result in the False Claims Act case was the more surprising because the court itself, in an unexpected order on the eve of argument in November, had greatly raised the constitutional stakes. The court asked the lawyers to address the question of whether a private individual has standing to pursue a False Claims Act suit on behalf of the government. Had the answer been no, the heart of a law that Congress first passed in 1863 to curb fraud against the government by Civil War contractors would have been eliminated.
But having opened the door to that prospect, the court shut it firmly today. The court was unanimous in ruling that private plaintiffs do have standing, both because of the long historic pedigree of what are known as "qui tam" actions and because the plaintiff is standing in the shoes of the government, which has suffered an actual injury.
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the court's opinion in this case, Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. Stevens, No. 98-1828. A former employee of the Vermont state agency had brought a False Claims Act suit charging that the agency had mishandled a federal grant. In response, Vermont argued that under the 11th Amendment, which the court has interpreted as barring suits in federal court against states, the state was immune from suit. Both the Federal District Court in Vermont and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, rejected the state's position.
The court today avoided the 11th Amendment issue, ruling instead that the act's reference to the liability of "any person" who commits fraud against the government does not refer to states, at least when the plaintiff is a private individual. The government has the authority to take over the prosecuting role in a False Claims Act case, and the decision today left open the prospect that the government itself could still sue a state. The decision also raised the possibility that the False Claims Act could be open to other constitutional challenges based on the separation of powers.
In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justice David H. Souter, said the law's text "makes it perfectly clear" that Congress intended the word "person" to include states.
Both in this case and in the arson case, Jones v. United States, No. 99-5739, the court applied a longstanding rule that laws of dubious constitutionality should be interpreted, if possible, in a way that avoids the constitutional issue.
In applying that rule in the arson case, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's unanimous opinion said that "arson is a paradigmatic common-law state crime" that Congress could not casually have meant to federalize without saying so explicitly. The law "is not soundly read to make virtually every arson in the country a federal offense," Justice Ginsburg said.
The Clinton administration defended the law's broad application on the ground that private homes were connected to interstate commerce through their receipt of natural gas through interstate lines as well as through the interstate mortgage and insurance markets. The Seventh Circuit accepted this analysis when it upheld Dewey J. Jones's conviction. But Justice Ginsburg said the analysis defied the "common perception" of what it means to "use" something in interstate commerce. Here, the owner simply "used the property as his home, the center of his family life," she said.

HEADLINE: New Rival, Easier Decision, Voters Say

SERIES: UNDECIDED: The New Candidate

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
With a new candidate in the race for the United States Senate seat from New York, the undecided voters being followed by The New York Times now expect a traditional contest between Democrat and Republican that will make their decisions simpler and more predictable.
Only one of them, Thomas Beck, a Long Island educator, declared himself unequivocally committed to the newcomer, Representative Rick A. Lazio of Suffolk County, the young Republican who is sprinting to broaden his name recognition. 
 The rest of the group was in watch-and-wait mode yesterday after Rudolph W. Giuliani's withdrawal and a weekend of hectic campaigning by his replacement.
"I'm open," said Doug Taggart, an independent voter from Westchester County and vice president of a financial services firm. "The good thing is, it will now be an issue-centric campaign. And there are clearer differences between the candidates."
Karl Schwartz, a computer consultant from Staten Island and another independent, also celebrated the more conventional choice. "The advantage to this is it's less about personalities," he said.
None of these voters, who were culled from respondents to New York Times/CBS News polls when only a sliver of the electorate was undecided, were impressed by the war of words over the weekend, when the Lazio camp criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton as a carpetbagger and the Clinton camp suggested that her foe was a Newt Gingrich clone. On the carpetbagger charge, all agreed with Bob Harrison, a history teacher from Amsterdam, west of Albany, who said Mrs. Clinton had shed that albatross with months of dogged campaigning in every corner of the state. "She has shown she cares," said Mr. Harrison, who generally votes Republican.
Mr. Harrison also spoke for the larger group when he dismissed the notion that Mr. Lazio had walked in lock step with Mr. Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. "I don't think he's as conservative as they're making him out to be," Mr. Harrison said. "He was a young guy learning the ropes. Sticking close to the people in charge is just on-the-job training."
Mr. Beck, a quick convert to Representative Lazio, was most familiar with his record and said the candidate was "not locked into traditional Republican ideas." Defeating Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Democratic fixture on Long Island, required coalition building, Mr. Beck said, and energetic campaigning. And in the years since Mr. Lazio's upset victory over Mr. Downey in 1992, "I've seen him grow as a politician; he's not averse to looking at other people's ideas," Mr. Beck added.
If the labels of "carpetbagger" and "conservative" do not sway these voters, what will? The candidates' positions, the voters said, especially on issues that speak to their concerns, in detail, with price tags attached.
"Let's see some nitty-gritty," Mr. Harrison said.
Mr. Taggart said he wanted to learn more about Mr. Lazio's voting record on gun control, which Mr. Taggart supports, and his stand on tax cuts, which Mr. Taggart opposes.
Mr. Harrison and his wife, Cathy, a nurse and also a Republican, worry about the flagging upstate economy.
Dave Temkin, a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers from Queens who works for a telecommunications company, will be looking for concern for "working people's issues, particularly labor."
Mr. Schwartz, whose wife has cancer, cares most about medical research and environmental perils.
All of these voters say they assume that these issues are more likely to be debated with Mr. Giuliani out of the picture. The mayor, they said, had behaved as if he thought he could run on his performance in New York City and dismiss campaigning.
Mr. Temkin is one of 11 undecided voters from around the state who began sharing their thoughts on this extraordinary election in January. Two dropped out of the project a few weeks back. One could not be reached for comment for this article. Of the eight remaining, seven say they are as up in the air as they had been, although for different reasons.
No longer do they feel themselves between the rock and the hard place of two candidates they despise, which is how most described themselves four months ago. On the Democratic side, their antipathy for the first lady has mellowed as a result of her campaign style. On the Republican side, the voters now have to educate themselves about an unfamiliar candidate, but one who they say seems likable.
Mr. Temkin said he assumed that once undecided voters had a chance to study Mr. Lazio's record and performance on the stump, they would pretty quickly sort themselves out along party lines. "I'll look, but I'm not sure I'll bite," he said.
On the Republican side, Mrs. Harrison seemed likely to make a quick choice once she was better informed. "I had to ask my husband, 'Where does he come from?' " she said of Mr. Lazio. "But he sounds good. It would be nice to have a strong Republican candidate."
Independent voters like Mr. Taggart and Mr. Schwartz, and those who switch parties often despite their enrollment, like Tom and Barbara Smith of Saugerties, say they remain open-minded but certain that Mr. Lazio must make a mark quickly or drift from contention.
"He's going to have to do some serious catching up," said Mr. Smith, who works at Wal-Mart.
The Smiths, generally well informed, were behind the curve on the recent flurry of events because of many overtime shifts. "I knew Giuliani was out but I didn't know who was in," Mrs. Smith said.
Mr. Smith noted that Saugerties lacked the news coverage of cities like New York or Albany, which had front-page stories about Mr. Lazio's first campaign swing. The Times Herald-Record of Middletown did not mention the new candidate until Page 11, after reports on a fishing derby in Kingston, N.Y., and the death of Barbara Cartland, the romance novelist.
But Mr. Smith, a curious man, hunted until he found the article. Its headline: "Lazio Overcomes Obscurity With Whirlwind Tour."
 
Undecided
 This is the fifth article in a series following a group of New York State voters from diverse backgrounds as they make up their minds on which candidate to support for the United States Senate.
The previous articles were about their reaction to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's separation from his wife and his announcement that he had prostate cancer, how these voters were gathering information about the candidates, and their first impressions about the race.

HEADLINE: White House and Agency Split on Internet Privacy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Clinton administration officials today threw cold water on a proposal by the Federal Trade Commission for legislation to protect consumer privacy on the Internet. But the commission chairman said failure to put new federal privacy-protection standards in place would undermine consumer confidence and significantly retard the development of commerce in cyberspace.
The jockeying between the administration and the chairman, Robert Pitofsky, came as the agency gave its annual report to Congress on online privacy and sought new authority to impose privacy rules to protect consumers. 
 The report, approved by the commission on Friday, advises Congress to continue to allow the industry to regulate itself but to allow the commission to establish federal standards and to intervene when industry organizations are unable to resolve a case.
Mr. Pitofsky said such an approach already works well in the advertising and funeral businesses.
"Consumers should not have to forfeit their privacy online in exchange for the rich benefits of e-commerce," Mr. Pitofsky said. "A well-crafted approach, in fact, will benefit the growth of e-commerce and provide important protections to consumers. Legislation is now needed to ensure consumers' online privacy is adequately protected."
The commission is seeking to establish standards in four areas: notification about the use of personal data; consumers' choices about the use of such information; the right of individuals to review data about them; and security measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
While legislation has been introduced by Democrats in both the House and the Senate, there is no expectation that Congress will act any time soon.
Industry groups and Republican lawmakers have strongly opposed the agency's proposal, saying it would amount to a costly and unwarranted intrusion on a nascent marketplace that has been making progress on its own.
Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, said the industry had made "extraordinary progress" in carrying out privacy rules. He said his primary concern was to head off efforts by the states to create rules piecemeal.
"We need to proceed cautiously," he said. "Internet companies understand that they need to protect the privacy of their customers as a matter of good business practice, and that's why they are doing it."
The Republican lawmakers found themselves in an odd alliance with officials from the White House and the Commerce Department.
Administration officials were decidedly lukewarm about the commission's proposal. They said that the government should continue to rely on the industry to police itself and that the White House had a deeper interest in promoting privacy laws in other areas, including health care and financial services.
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said today that if the industry could show that it was effectively policing itself, "legislation would not be necessary."
"If we do not see such progress," he said, "then we may eventually need to consider whether legislation would provide companies with the right incentives to have good policies and participate in an effective self-regulatory program."
While the administration's view was that the Internet needs more time to develop, the commission's report, based on the results of a recent study of Web sites, suggested that the industry had already made some progress but far from enough.
The study found that 88 percent of 335 randomly selected Web sites had some kind of privacy disclosure, varying from a perfunctory notice that says "this is a secure order form" to something more detailed.
But the study also found that only 20 percent of Web sites that collect personal information met the existing government guidelines. And only 8 percent of the most heavily visited Web sites displayed a seal of approval from one of the programs established by the industry.
"Because self-regulatory initiatives to date fall far short of broad-based implementation of self-regulatory programs, the commission has concluded that such efforts alone cannot ensure that the online marketplace as a whole will follow the standards adopted by industry leaders," the report said.
As a result of the shortcomings in protecting privacy, the report concluded that many consumers appear leery about making purchases on the Internet. The report cited studies estimating that online companies had already suffered significantly from a common perception among consumers that they should not buy items online because the information they provide may be misused.
One study cited in the agency's report found that consumer privacy concerns resulted in as much as $2.8 billion in lost online retail sales last year, while another suggested a potential loss of as much as $18 billion by 2002, compared with a projected total of $40 billion.
"Internet commerce will not develop to the ultimate extent because people just will continue to not have confidence that their private information will be protected to the maximum," Mr. Pitofsky said.
The two Republicans on the commission disagreed with the majority.
One of the Republicans, Orson Swindle, issued a strongly worded dissent that criticized the majority for not doing a precise analysis that weighed the costs and benefits of any new regulations. Mr. Swindle called the privacy report "embarrassingly flawed" and said its recommendations "would constitute a troubling devolution of power from our elected officials to unelected bureaucrats."
The commission's other Republican, Thomas B. Leary, concurred in part and dissented in part. Mr. Leary said that some legislation was appropriate, but that the majority had asked too much and that a law on appropriate notice should suffice. He also said the majority's opinion was too narrow because any legislation should apply to offline commerce as well as online commerce.

HEADLINE: LAST-DITCH EFFORT BY 2 SIDES TO WIN CHINA TRADE VOTE

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
With just two days to go before Congress decides whether to upgrade economic ties with China, corporate supporters opened a $1 million advertising blitz today and labor opponents stormed Capitol Hill as both camps struggled to recruit a handful of undecided lawmakers who hold the key to victory or defeat.
The Clinton administration, which considers the vote on permanent normal trade relations its top remaining legislative priority, now expects a narrow win. But administration officials say they still need six to eight undecided Democrats and a similar number of uncommitted Republicans to vote their way if the measure is to pass the House, where a vote is scheduled for Wednesday. 
 Business groups have filled the airwaves as their $8 million advertising campaign -- corporate America's costliest legislative campaign ever -- ends this week. The United States Chamber of Commerce assigned a lobbyist to each undecided lawmaker on its target list, while President Clinton has set aside several hours each day this week for telephone calls and face-to-face meetings with wavering Democrats, White House officials said.
Labor unions, insisting that they still have a chance to defeat the measure that they call a threat to America's working class, are turning up the heat on a small group of Democrats who need union support in the fall elections. Union officials planned a Capitol Hill vigil for tomorrow and are flying in shop-floor leaders to apply pressure to lawmakers in the hours before the vote.
Last-minute horse-trading with several undecided members also continued today. Two Texas Congressmen wanted help with a gas pipeline, while a Minnesota lawmaker urged the Clinton administration to protect iron ore workers, Congressional aides and administration officials said.
The final lobbying flurry underscored how the China trade vote has become a test of political strength for both business and labor. Business executives boasted that they had run their most effective vote-getting effort in recent years by taking a page from labor's political playbook, organizing grass-roots, home-district lobbying efforts as well as national and regional advertising.
"We are sending so many people at these members that they can go home each night and tell their children they're famous," said Thomas Donohue, president of the chamber.
Union officials said they had mobilized members nationwide and honed their political message not just on trade, but also for the fall elections, when they hope to make Democrats the majority party in Congress. John Sweeney, president of the A.F.L-C.I.O; James Hoffa, president of the Teamsters; and George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America, planned to spend the remaining two days visiting a handful of Democrats and Republicans whom union officials feel might still vote no on the trade issue.
Supporters and opponents largely agreed on the vote count in the House, where the matter is likely to be decided. White House officials said they had about 65 Democratic votes and wanted 7 more; Republicans had 145 committed yes votes and hoped to recruit another 10. If both achieve their goals, that would give a comfortable cushion over the 218 needed, but White House officials acknowledged that they had to fight for every new supporter. Approval by the Senate appears more certain.
President Clinton has argued that Congress should grant China permanent trade status for both economic and national security reasons. Ending the annual Congressional review of China's trading rights would guarantee American companies the full benefits of China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the administration says. A negative vote, it says, could lead to a diplomatic standoff with Beijing and instability in Asia.
Opponents, led by labor unions as well as environmental, human rights and consumer groups, argue that China does not deserve higher trade status because it does not adhere to Western labor or environmental standards. Unions also say they fear that more open trade with China would encourage companies to move good industrial jobs there.
One of the truly undecided members of Congress being cajoled and warned by both camps is Eva M. Clayton, a North Carolina Democrat. Because her district has a heavily agricultural base, the Clinton administration and farm groups have pressured her to help North Carolina farms export more to China. But teachers and communications workers in the district have made her a prime target as well, and Mr. Sweeney has called on her repeatedly as the vote approaches, union officials said.
"I think her fondest wish is to be left alone," one lobbyist said today.
On many other trade issues in recent years, unions have proven more politically effective than big business, defeating many of the administration's trade goals including its efforts to win "fast track" trade negotiating authority.
But business groups, including the Business Roundtable and the chamber, determined late last year that the China vote was too important to lose.
The 200-member Business Roundtable took the lead in advertising in 27 Congressional districts, including a barrage of ads during the Easter Congressional recess and another blitz during the last week.
Some individual corporations have also run ads supporting upgraded trade relations. Motorola has been among the most active, spending more than $1 million on newspaper and television ads during news shows.
The Illinois-based telecommunication company has invested more than $1 billion in China and fears that European competitors will benefit at its expense if Congress denies China the new trading rights.
Looking to neutralize labor's vaunted local organization on the ground, where it can deliver votes for members in tight races, business groups have also mobilized employees to write letters and visit Congressmen, as labor unions have done for years. Intel alone had employees write 5,000 such letters, company officials said.
"Unions have been superbly successful on trade issues and we have really learned from them," said Robert N. Burt, chairman and chief executive of FMC Corporation, a chemicals and machinery manufacturer, and head of the Business Roundtable.
Mr. Burt said businesses had also become more savvy about how to leverage their soft-money donations to persuade members of Congress to support important business measures, including the China trade bill.
Financially, the business lobbying effort has swamped labor. But labor and its supporters, including the Family Research Council, a family values association, have spent about $2 million on ads opposing the trade bill. Union officials said it is easily their largest financial commitment to a single legislative issue.
Union officials have also bluntly warned lawmakers that local support for their re-election campaign hinges on voting no on the trade matter, members of Congress said. But some members said they believed that labor's goal of helping Democrats win back the House is ultimately more important than punishing members for voting in favor of the bill.

HEADLINE: Former G.M. Executive Indicted On Charges of Taking Secrets

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 22

 BODY:
A former senior executive at General Motors has been indicted on charges of defrauding the company by taking boxes of its confidential documents with him when he jumped to a top job at Volkswagen in 1993, reviving one of the most celebrated cases in recent years involving accusations of industrial espionage.
The six-count indictment by a federal grand jury here accuses Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, G.M.'s former vice president for worldwide purchasing, of wire fraud and the interstate transportation of stolen property. The Justice Department asserted that Mr. Lopez copied extensive G.M. computer files on auto parts costs and future car models and took them to VW when he took the top purchasing job at the German automaker. 
 Mr. Lopez's longtime lawyer, Plato Cacheris, said that Mr. Lopez denied breaking any American laws but would not come to the United States to defend himself. Mr. Lopez lives in Spain.
And while the Justice Department said today that it would seek Mr. Lopez's extradition, Mr. Cacheris said that Spain's extradition treaty with the United States does not allow Spanish citizens like Mr. Lopez to be extradited against their will.
"This is a case that is a waste of time and money -- he will never be tried," Mr. Cacheris said.
The State Department and the Spanish Embassy had no comment this evening on how or whether the two countries' extradition treaty might apply to Mr. Lopez. Many such treaties limit the extradition of a country's own citizens to stand trial, particularly on charges of nonviolent crimes, for which countries' laws may differ considerably.
The United States on rare occasions has been able to persuade foreign governments to extradite individuals even if their cases are not clearly covered by an extradition treaty. But such a move would be politically difficult for Spain.
Mr. Lopez left Volkswagen in 1996 and has been working ever since as an auto consultant in Bilbao, the industrial center of Spain's economically depressed Basque region. Mr. Lopez has tried with little success to start his own auto company in his Basque hometown of Amorebieta, partly as a way to reduce unemployment there.
Soon after Mr. Lopez's surprise resignation and departure to Volkswagen on March 15, 1993, G.M. executives became concerned about the large volume of confidential documents which he and his assistants had requested in the four preceding months. G.M. ended up suing VW, accusing it of having used the documents. VW settled the civil case in January 1997, agreeing to pay G.M. $100 million, but not admitting any wrongdoing; Mr. Lopez had resigned from VW two months earlier.
German prosecutors had also filed charges against Mr. Lopez accusing him of having stolen G.M. documents, but dropped the charges in July 1998 after he agreed to make charitable contributions totaling 400,000 marks, or $224,000.
G.M. cautiously welcomed today's announcement of the indictment, which came after a prolonged investigation. "Obviously, these are decisions with which we agree and we will continue, as we have in the past, to provide support to the Justice Department in connection with their handling of this matter," G.M. said in a statement. VW officials did not return calls for comment.
In today's announcement, the Justice Department revealed that the grand jury had actually returned the indictment last October under seal. The Justice Department did not reveal why the indictment was unsealed today, other than to note the planned extradition request.
Mr. Lopez now faces up to five years in jail on each of 4 wire-fraud counts and up to 10 years on the two interstate transportation counts.
Mr. Lopez's exertions to cut costs were legendary in Detroit. When G.M. was teetering at the edge of financial disaster in the early 1990's, he and his aides, and even their spouses, made a point of wearing their wristwatches on their right wrists and vowing not to move them back to their left until G.M. was once again earning record profits. In a city that still reveres red meat and junk food, Mr. Lopez turned heads by requiring that his aides live on a "warrior's diet" of fruit, whole-grain products, as little meat as possible and no alcohol except an occasional glass of wine.
Mr. Lopez wrung somewhat lower prices from the companies worldwide that sell the auto parts from which G.M. assembles its cars. The legal wrangling has centered on whether he took G.M.'s prices to VW, which would have allowed VW to compare what it was paying the same suppliers for the same or similar parts, and then demand lower prices in every case in which G.M. had negotiated a better deal.
Mr. Lopez tried to persuade G.M. to build a low-cost factory in the Basque region at which suppliers would play an unusually large role, sometimes sending their employees to help install parts at the assembly line. He went to VW when G.M. rejected the idea, but VW ended up not building a factory in the region either. VW has since opened an experimental factory on Mr. Lopez's model in Brazil, while G.M. and Ford are also building such factories in Brazil.
Only adding to Mr. Lopez's mystery has been the car accident in which he was involved two years ago. Mr. Cacheris said that his client had suffered brain damage and significant memory loss in the accident and would be unable to assist his counsel. But Mr. Lopez has continued to promote his dream of a Basque auto factory over the last two years.
In an interview last autumn, Mr. Lopez voiced regret that he had ever left G.M., given that VW never built his dream factory. "If I had known that, I wouldn't have changed" jobs, he said. "It was my error."

HEADLINE: GOLF;
Twin Prodigies

BYLINE: By TOM SPOUSTA 

 BODY:
Aree and Naree Song Wongluekiet, twin sisters from Thailand, pause from hitting range balls and stand before a full-length mirror, applying sunscreen and casting reflections on their amazingly bright futures. Even at practice, absurdly premature expectations and questions seem to surround these 14-year-old golf prodigies.
How soon will they turn pro? Will they challenge the Ladies Professional Golf Association's age requirement and petition for membership before age 18? Will they remain amateurs and go to college? With their substantial talent and millions of dollars in prize money waiting for them, why would they consider college? 
 "If they do, if they're not good enough to turn pro at 18, they're going backward," said Gary Gilchrist, director of golf at the David Leadbetter Golf Academy, in Bradenton, Fla., where Aree and Naree have trained for almost three years.
The Wongluekiet girls hit the fast-forward button in March after receiving special exemptions to compete in the Nabisco Championship, one of the tour's four major championships. Aree played her way into Sunday's final group with Karrie Webb and finished 10th, becoming the youngest player to enter, make the cut and finish that high in an L.P.G.A. major. Naree shot 74-82 and missed the cut.
They are next scheduled to appear on the LPGA Tour at the Wegmans Rochester International June 8-11 at Locust Hill Country Club in Pittsford, N.Y. On June 13, the Wongluekiets will try to earn spots in the United States Women's Open in qualifying at Eagles Landing Country Club in Atlanta.
Beyond that, even the sisters aren't sure what is ahead for their young careers. Under L.P.G.A. rules, they can enter a maximum of four events through sponsor's exemptions or qualifying. The Rochester tournament will be their third, following the Nabisco and the Subaru Memorial of Naples in Florida in February. The Women's Open would not count toward that total because it is a United States Golf Association event.
"Our dream is to compete on the L.P.G.A. Tour and be one of the best players out there," Aree said before a practice at the Leadbetter Academy range.
Naree added, "We just need more time and experience."
The twins were clearly in no rush to grow up after a recent school day ended at Bradenton Academy, where they are the sophomore stars of the golf team. They are full-time students, too. They wake up at 6:45 a.m., and at 8 a.m. they begin their schedule of five classes: English, math, Spanish, history and science. They attend one study hall, eat a quick lunch and practice for four hours.
"The family has been focused for many years," Gilchrist said. "Their dad has sown the seed in their hearts that they can be something special, that they can be No. 1 in the world."
The Wongluekiets quickly climbed the national junior girls' ranking; Aree is now at No. 2 and Naree at No. 3. Last summer, they dominated the American Junior Golf Association circuit in their first year of eligibility, combining for eight victories (Aree 6, Naree 2) in 11 tournaments. They also finished second a combined five times.
At the Nabisco, they received praise from Webb and Annika Sorenstam, the tour's top two players. Sorenstam called them incredible; Webb predicted that Aree and Naree will immediately shoot to the top of the LPGA Tour money list once they turn pro.
"Sometimes, it can be tough," Aree said of the expectations. "You just try to focus, block it out and try your best."
The twins' interest in the game began at 7 as a way to spend more time with their father, In Jong Song, and brother, Chan, at the golf club. In Jong was a member at each of the four courses in Chiangmai, the largest city in Thailand after Bangkok. Aree and Naree simply followed In Jong around and begged him to let them play.
"They say, 'Father, why only the brother play golf, and we are not?' " In Jong recalled. "They really want to play golf, so I say, 'If you are going to play, you promise me you work hard and try to be No. 1 in the world, and then I will support it.' "
In Jong smiles and laughs at the memory. At the time, it seemed like an easy way to appease his daughters. As their talent blossomed, the need for world-class instruction became apparent, and In Jong made plans for the girls to attend the Leadbetter Academy, where Chan had enrolled one year earlier.
In Jong sold his 11-story hotel, beating by three months the economic downturn that sent the Thai currency to record lows, and eventually he and his wife, Vanee, joined their children in Florida.
Like others, he worries about burnout and pushing his daughters too hard.
"From the beginning, I don't wish this," In Jong said. "It's very important that they do this for themselves."
Any decision by the Wongluekiets to turn pro early could result in a legal battle. According to L.P.G.A. rules, players who are 16 can petition to waive the 18-year-old membership requirement, although no one has ever tried to do so.
"We are not in a hurry," In Jong said. "Everything is following naturally with no problems. I don't think they are good enough. They are not very good players yet. They are still young. They still need more experience."
The latest player to graduate from high school and turn pro is Dorothy Delasin of Daly City, Calif., who earned her L.P.G.A. Tour card with a fourth-place finish at qualifying school. Christie Kerr in 1997 and Michelle McGann in 1989 also turned pro after graduating from high school.
"They are too young to think about that now," In Jong said. "If they go to college, they will go together. If they go to college, it will be to study, not just play golf."
Meanwhile, Aree and Naree continue to improve at a rapid rate. According to Chan, his sisters' games are as similar as their looks.
Aree is considered the more aggressive player and longer by 5 yards off the tee. Both possess splendid, fearless short games. "Naree is more technical," Chan said. "Aree is just grip it and rip it. Otherwise, they are the same. Whoever happens to be playing better that week usually wins."
Aree is slightly taller and about two pounds heavier. Naree is older by nine minutes. Both have benefited from having an older brother who plays at a high level.
"It's like tennis," said Gilchrist, who predicts one of the twins will win an L.P.G.A. major championship before they turn 16. "All the top girls, they don't practice with other girls. They practice with men."
Yet In Jong said: "Success and a strong mind does not come immediately. It takes time. I always remind them of that."

HEADLINE: Chancellor's Political Ability Balances His Outsider Status

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS and ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Last week, as Harold O. Levy pulled off the improbable feat of becoming chancellor of the New York City schools, he announced at a cabinet meeting that 30 volumes of chancellor's regulations -- accumulating since 1958 -- had been slashed to 9 volumes. Gone were vestiges like how to help students deal with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Yes, a staff member fretted in a reporter's presence, but shouldn't he run the changes past the 43 district and other superintendents first? "No," Mr. Levy replied. "Just do it. If we have to restore some, we can do that later." 
 "Just do it" could be Mr. Levy's motto. As much as anything, his pragmatic approach to management explains how a high-level corporate lawyer with no experience running a single school became the chancellor of the country's largest school system. In his first 125 days, he has surprised even the savviest insiders by going from dark horse for interim chancellor -- with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani opposing him -- to unanimous choice for the permanent job, with the mayor instructing his appointees to support him.
From his earliest days as student government president at the Bronx High School of Science to his ascension to international trouble-shooter for Sanford I. Weill, the chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, Mr. Levy is remembered by friends and colleagues as a consummate politician with a shrewd strategic intelligence, honed by his experience as a courtroom litigator.
With knowledge acquired from three years on the State Board of Regents, he has a passionate sense of how to improve the schools, and has promised to hire better teachers, crack down on superintendents and principals whose students perform poorly and lobby aggressively for more state and city aid. As the father of young schoolchildren, albeit children attending private school, he has a sense of what parents want, and has moved quickly to reach out to groups that have felt shut out.
But there may be a flip side to Mr. Levy's cunning, charm and admitted love of the limelight. He has a tendency, associates say, to assume that he knows the answers, even when he may not. And he can be as imperious as he is seductive, sometimes letting his drive to get things done blind him to the distress or disagreement of those around him.
"He could be a chancellor to reckon with," said one longtime superintendent, "if he learns to listen."
Mr. Levy's background as a corporate lawyer with no formal credentials in education, and his skill in making quick decisions, may give him the fresh perspective and brashness needed to make radical changes. But his outsider status could also be a liability. He is the first white full-time chancellor since 1983, in a system that is 84 percent black, Hispanic and Asian, and only 16 percent white.
Indeed, race was in the air as he attended a forum led by the Rev. Al Sharpton in Harlem two Saturdays ago.
"The schools are killing fields," a woman in a turquoise satin turban, calling herself Mother Franklin, boomed into the microphone as Mr. Levy sat on a platform in the storefront auditorium, decorated with paintings of Malcolm X and James Brown. "The school system is nothing but an industry." Another likened Mr. Levy's going to Harlem to talk about public schools to Hitler's defending the Holocaust, a particularly raw remark given Mr. Levy's background as the son of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany.
But what may have been more telling about Mr. Levy's management style was simply that he was there to visit Mr. Sharpton's headquarters, something, as Mr. Sharpton noted, that the previous chancellor, Rudy Crew, had never done.
Mr. Levy, 47, is the self-made son of a hardware store owner in the Bronx. His father, Hugo, a textile merchant, and mother, Alice, fled Germany in 1939, settling in Washington Heights, then a middle-class neighborhood of German-Jewish immigrants. His grandparents were killed in concentration camps. A sister, Marion, died of kidney disease at age 12 before he was born, but her photo was always prominent in the Levy home and the family visited her grave throughout Mr. Levy's childhood.
Despite his modest roots, Mr. Levy is the product of Cornell and Oxford Universities and has worked his way into New York's corporate and cultural elite. Six feet and 200 pounds, in pinstriped suits, gold cuff links, tasseled loafers and eggheady wire-rim glasses, he works to project a down-to-earth image with a conversational style that is breezy and direct, free of pandering in public, rife with expletives in private.
He works hard to dispel the image of a patrician dabbling in public service out of noblesse oblige. "I have tried to be sensitive," he said. "My way of dealing with it is to say I am going to do the best job I can. I am not going to change my race."
Derided as a Henry Higgins for sending poetry to board members and arranging violin lessons for superintendents, Mr. Levy said he was trying to build teamwork and boost morale, standard practice in business.
"I believe that education is an opportunity for social mobility, me included," he said. "That was a way out, a way up. Children in public school have an absolute right to experience the finer things in life, just as much as everybody else. That's not elitism. That's being a democrat, small d."
As for his pursuit of the chancellorship, he said: "It's not a lark. We've come to the point in our society where unless you explain why you're doing something on a monetary, mock-rational basis, you can't be serious. Our society has lost the ability to encourage people to be altruistic, adventuresome, to submerge themselves at least for a moment in the greater good."
Unlike the last two chancellors, Mr. Levy is a confirmed New Yorker, living with his wife, Patricia Sapinsley, and two children, Noah, 6, and Hannah, 9, on Riverside Drive near Columbia University. Ms. Sapinsley, whose mother, Lila, is a prominent Republican in Rhode Island, gave up her architecture practice when her son was born.
Mr. Levy has drafted two Upper West Side friends and neighbors to be his top deputies: Jonathan Levi, a novelist, and David Klasfeld, a former mid-level City Hall cabinet member.
As a father, the new chancellor tells poignant stories of wrestling with phonics and the ache of a bad fit between child and teacher. He talks about schools in a jargon-free way that every New Yorker can understand. But while he is proud of his own public school education, Mr. Levy sends his children to Dalton, one of the city's most selective and expensive private schools.
He and his wife looked at public and private schools, but chose Dalton because it was the best fit, he said. (Reminded that most New Yorkers of his means reject public school on the assumption, right or wrong, that private schools are simply better, he said their decision was more complicated than that.)
Some say Mr. Levy's lack of on-the-job experience in education could hurt him. At a recent teachers' union convention, Mr. Levy offended guidance counselors by suggesting that historically, their job had been a hiding place for inept teachers.
"It's going to be important for Harold to understand what he knows well and what he still needs to learn," said Ann Marcus, dean of New York University's education school.
Mr. Levy is working hard to woo skeptics. When Diane Ravitch, the acerbic historian of New York City schools, wrote an Op-Ed page article in March attacking Mr. Levy's summer-school program, he called her at 8 the same morning to invite her over, and they talked for an hour about religion, books and education. By contrast, Chancellor Crew refused to shake her hand after she criticized him. "I found his lack of defensiveness impressive," she said of Mr. Levy.
He has also used his candor to cultivate reporters and editors. (He admits to two hours of media training.)
As for his relationship with Mayor Giuliani, Mr. Levy, who so far has tried hard to be conciliatory, would not make any predictions. "I'll make judgments as we go," he said. "There are a lot of things we agree on and a lot of things I can work with him on, but I can't change who I am."
Being chancellor is a dream job for Mr. Levy, friends say. As Citigroup's director of global compliance, he was in charge of ensuring that employees in 100 countries followed proper policies and laws. But in the banking industry, deal makers rule the roost. Lawyers -- no matter how highly paid (his financial disclosure form says more than $500,000 a year, far more than his chancellor's pay of $245,000) -- are on the margins of power. Though he had risen to the top, he was restless.
Mr. Weill, recognizing his political skills, assigned him to special projects like negotiating between the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition and Wall Street over investment in the inner city and in hardscrabble rural areas.
His prowess as chancellor has amazed and tickled some former colleagues, but others see a pattern. While his college classmates organized antiwar protests, Mr. Levy, at 20, won a seat on Cornell's board of trustees. Three years after being appointed to the board of the University Settlement Society, a social service agency on the Lower East Side, he became chairman.
Over the years, working with chancellors like Ramon C. Cortines, Mr. Levy said he fantasized about what he would do if he were chancellor, but never imagined such a thing could come true. But friends and associates have no doubt that when Mr. Levy put his name forward as interim chancellor in January, he was already angling for the permanent job. "It was like letting the fox into the henhouse," Meryl Tisch, who served with him on the Board of Regents, said affectionately.
Mr. Levy's drive was evident early on. Growing up in Washington Heights, he attended Public School 189, Junior High School 52 and Bronx Science, one of the city's most selective high schools. He got his undergraduate and law degrees at Cornell, and a master's in politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford.
Hired by the civil rights division of the Justice Department, he left in 11 months, he said, because he disapproved of Reagan-era policies. He moved on to some of the city's most competitive legal and investment banking firms: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Philipp Brothers; Salomon Brothers, the Travelers Group and then Citigroup.
At Philipp Brothers, Mr. Levy tracked down thousands of tons of coffee that had disappeared from Mexican warehouses; wrested back Pizza Hut franchises that the company had lost in Taiwan, and cracked down on lawyers who were spending too much and taking too long to settle a huge international case.
"Harold is used to cleaning things up and getting things back under control," said Donald Feuerstein, the chief legal officer at Salomon at the time. "He is good at going into unknown territory, identifying the problem and fixing it without delay."
He was a playground monitor in elementary school, supervising his classmates with a whistle in his mouth.
"Harold was always more controlled and adult than the rest of us," said Ilene Guralnick, who was Mr. Levy's classmate from elementary through high school.
As a high school student in the 60's, he was antiwar, but not an activist. "He was never the guy with the bullhorn or the one who would get into a confrontation with the principal," said Arthur Schwartz, another high school classmate. "He wanted to work through the proper channels to get something accomplished."
As one of 220 associates at Skadden, Arps, as a litigator working on mergers and acquisitions, Mr. Levy got into the habit of rising at 4:30 a.m., a practice he said he maintains to this day. Nearly 20 years later, after becoming interim chancellor, he was introduced to Lewis E. Lehrman, a founder of the Rite Aid Corporation. "Nice to meet you," Mr. Lehrman said, according to witnesses. "I've been with you many times," Mr. Levy replied. "I used to go to the Brasserie at 4:30 in the morning to do paperwork. You came in at 5:15 to read the papers."
Mr. Levy inherited what he calls a familial tremor from his father, which sometimes causes his hands to shake, and is worsened, he said, by fatigue and caffeine. To combat the tremor during grueling exams at Oxford, he began using fountain pens, which require less hand pressure.
Mr. Levy has cultivated powerful mentors.
As chairman of a commission to investigate the city's crumbling school buildings, he forged ties with Jack Rudin, the builder, James S. Tisch, chief executive and co-president of Loews, and Sheldon Silver, speaker of the State Assembly. Two years later, those connections helped him become a regent, where he became close to Richard Mills, the state education commissioner, and Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers' union. Ms. Weingarten lobbied for him as chancellor, but Mr. Levy denies Mr. Giuliani's accusations that he is too cozy with the union and he has pushed for changes in the union, like letting principals demand lesson plans.
Mr. Levy is not given to self-reflection. But in a visit to Bronx Science in April, he indulged in a rare meditation on his life, describing his 25th reunion in 1995. Looking at his middle-aged classmates, he was struck at how many of them had become doctors, lawyers and accountants, professionals like him. Beware of losing your passion, he warned, or "you wind up being disappointed in yourself in later life."
Now he will never be just another lawyer, doctor or accountant again.

Clinton and Speaker Reach Antipoverty Deal

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
President Clinton struck a deal today with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert that merges their antipoverty initiatives by expanding the number of empowerment zones and enacting a Republican redevelopment program, officials said.
Mr. Clinton is expected to announce the agreement at the White House on Tuesday with Mr. Hastert. 
 The agreement, which Congress must approve, would expand the number of empowerment zones to 40 from 31 and increase the tax credits, capital gains relief and other incentives offered to investors in poor areas. In addition, it would set up a redevelopment program for 40 so-called renewal communities, which would have no capital gains tax and a variety of other tax incentives.
Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser, said the programs would cost $15 billion to $20 billion over the next decade.

HEADLINE: After 20 Years, Iranian Caviar Returns to America

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
CAVIAR from Iran will be sold here for the first time in 20 years. Trade barriers were lifted two months ago, and the first shipment of 440 pounds is expected to arrive in Boston today. 
 Whether Iranian caviar is the finest in the world, as some connoisseurs contend, remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: it is the most expensive. In America, prices will be about 30 percent more than for Russian imports. The Browne Trading Company in Portland, Me., plans to sell a 500-gram tin (a little more than a pound) of Iranian beluga for $1,150. The same amount of sevruga will be $600, golden osetra will be $800. About an ounce of osetra (30 grams), will be $90. FLORENCE FABRICANT

HEADLINE: EATING WELL;
Is Salmon Organic? Not Yet

BYLINE: By Marian Burros 

 BODY:
SENATOR TED STEVENS of Alaska says the wild salmon that swim around the waters of his state are so pure and clean they are entitled to wear the organic label.
As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he added $75,000 to the Agriculture Department's budget to cover the cost of public hearings to ensure that the salmon are included in the federal organic standards expected to go into effect at the end of the year. The proposed standards will cover everything except aquatic animals and honeybees, but the Alaska salmon industry is pushing for the change in the rules because the organic label generally adds 25 to 35 percent to the value of a product. 
 Since Senator Stevens, a Republican, holds the purse strings for the Agriculture Department and could easily derail the new organic labeling regulation, his request is making the department uneasy. According to documents of the National Organic Standards Board, organic certification standards should not be developed for wild animals, including fish, because the issue is controversial. Organic farming as it has been defined for 30 years is a managed system tracking everything that goes into production, but salmon migrate thousands of miles across oceans and their habitats cannot be carefully monitored.
Instead of the organic label, the department is suggesting labeling to indicate the products were harvested and handled according to certain standards. The Marine Stewardship Council, an accreditation body founded by Unilever and the World Wildlife Fund that has developed ecolabel guidelines, would certify that such fish had come from healthy fisheries and that fishing for them had not hurt the environment.
Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association, said: "We are not willing to come up with a set of standards for organic fish. There is very little control of the system."
Calling Alaskan salmon organic, she said, has nothing to do with the philosophy of organic agriculture and improving the environment, but everything to do with money. "We feel we shouldn't be pressured by an interest group who wants the organic label for marketing purposes," she said. "That's the very wrong reason to ask us to change our 30 years of work. In fact, it cheapens the organic label."
The largest natural foods supermarket chain, Whole Foods, says it will not sell organic fish. "Under no circumstances," said Margaret Wittenberg, the chain's vice president of governmental and public affairs. "Wild is organic by neglect and it's not the same. Wild does need more recognition, but allowing wild fish to piggyback on organic is going to water down organic."
For those who have watched organic grow from a much mocked description of the weeds and seeds sold in grungy stores and eaten by hippies in Birkenstocks in the 1970's to one that confers a premium price, this triumphal moment, when federal organic standards will become a reality, is bringing a new set of problems. Alaska is not the only entity that wants to cash in on the organic cachet. Large food companies are increasingly buying up small organic companies, not to improve the environment but to improve their bottom lines. Organic sales have increased about 20 percent annually for the last 10 years.
"Organic is a useful marketing tool," said Kate Troll, the fisheries specialist at the Alaska Department of Commerce and Economic Development. "This is a way to sell at a better price."
Our salmon "is beyond organic," said Doug Mecum, director of commercial fisheries in the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. "It's totally natural and wild. It's a healthy product, free of pollutants."
In the past, the state has promoted its wild salmon as superior to farmed in flavor and quality. But few people know the difference between wild and farmed salmon and have no idea which kind they are eating. Farmed salmon now account for 60 percent of the world's market and have seriously depressed the price of wild salmon.
Like commercial chickens, farmed fish live in not particularly sanitary conditions. They are fed dye pellets to give them the pink color that occurs naturally in free-swimming salmon. They eat manufactured food that may contain genetically modified ingredients. They are treated with antibiotics because of fish lice.
Ironically, because the farmed fish live their entire lives in controlled waters, they could be certified organic if changes were made in their environment and food. Certified organic farmed fish are already being sold in Britain.
That label for farmed salmon is seen as an additional threat to wild Alaskan salmon. "We saw that the door was going to be opened to farm-raised salmon," Ms. Troll said, "and we thought we needed a level playing field."
Two Pacific Northwest fish processors are now certified organic by two independent organic certifying agencies. Prime Select Seafood in Cordova, Alaska, is selling certified organic Copper River salmon and eventually may sell organic halibut as well. But Susan Laird, its vice president, said she had no idea if the label would be worth the added expenses of certification.
Wild sockeye salmon processed by Capalino Pacific in Bellingham, Wash., has also been certified organic, but the company decided not to use the label after consulting with some leading chefs. The chefs said that organic salmon suggested farmed and that wild salmon was far superior.
"Organic is a lot sexier," said Jon Saarheim, a partner in Capalino Pacific, "but it seems more accurate to say the salmon is wild and that it is sustainable. So we label it 'certified sustainably wild and organically processed,' " the wording approved by the Marine Stewardship Council.
"We're taking the high road by giving up organic," Mr. Saarheim said. "In the long term, it's confusing."
Could Senator Stevens be coming to the same conclusion? "Labeling something organic could be a first step toward wild salmon," he said in an interview, "but organic could also cover farm-raised." And the problem with that, he said, is: "There is a great deal of difference between salmon that spend a great portion of their lives in deep cold waters and those raised on a farm. They are not subject to any kind of runoff from farmlands, pesticides, to the growth of viruses in tanks or ponds. They really are disease free. Wild salmon or 'saumon sauvage,' which we consider superior, comes from the cold deep ocean waters. There may be another classification that will do the same thing."
Now there is an even greater threat to wild salmon lurking in some of those ponds where salmon are farmed: a genetically engineered version that grows quickly. Should those fish escape from their ponds, they could cause havoc to the ecosystem and might signal the end of a truly wild variety. Even an organic label would not help the industry then.

Fill It Up, and Check the Olive Oil

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
UMBERTO'S CLAM HOUSE is reopening. I welcome this piece of news, not so much for the food as for the name, which is mercifully straightforward. Umberto's tells me it is an Italian restaurant. Clam House tells me I can get clams there. Both these statements are true, which tells me a third thing, that Umberto's is out of the loop.
These days, Manhattan restaurants no longer sound like restaurants at all. They all have one-syllable or two-syllable names that suggest just about anything but food. Icon, Torch, Coup and Rain come to mind. So do Atlas, Commune, Local, Vox, Pop and Avra. Isla and Rain hover in the vicinity of actual meaning. Isla is Spanish for "island," and the restaurant serves Cuban-influenced food. The two Rain restaurants offer pan-Asian cuisine. There's a lot of rain in Southeast Asia. But what about March? Or Quake? My current favorite is Tocqueville, because, rolling the name around on my tongue, I suddenly realized what the new-wave restaurant names suggest more than anything else: cars. 
 To test my theory, I pitched it to Detroit. I knew you could eat at these places, but could you drive them off the lot?
"Atlas is something we looked at before, for trucks," said Joe Pierucci, the marketing strategy manager for Ford's global products marketing department. "It has the right associations of strength." Beacon, the Midtown restaurant that specializes in wood-grilled dishes, also seems to have potential in Detroit. "That's probably a more economical car, or else it could be something that is just very huge," Mr. Pierucci said. "You think of a beacon as something you can see 10 miles away." Jim Hall, an analyst at the consulting firm AutoPacific Group, likes Beacon too, but he sees a different vehicle. "It would be a sensible car," he said, "just a little bit out of the ordinary, enough to give it character, but essentially a middle-of-the-road car."
And Torch? "After the Pinto, that's not a good car name," Mr. Hall said. "But it would have been viable in the 1960's, perfect for one of those muscle cars with 9,000 horsepower and brakes that wouldn't stop a Plymouth Valiant." Mr. Hall also saw a few possibilities in Avra, the Greek seafood restaurant. "It's not a bad name," Mr. Hall said. "Unfortunately, it would probably be picked up by Hyundai or Daewoo."
Icon is already taken. In India, Ford markets its Fiesta as an Ikon.
The Detroit lens has brought the Manhattan dining scene into focus for me. I couldn't imagine what sort of food Tocqueville might serve, but I could definitely see myself behind the wheel of a 1962 Cadillac Tocqueville, cream with turquoise interior. There's talk that Volkswagen might bring back the old VW bus. I propose Commune as the perfect name for it. Lex 303, a Murray Hill newcomer, sounds ready to drive right off the lot, a high-performance European import with a base price of $38,995. And I almost believe that I once owned a Plymouth Revel.
It doesn't take a genius to figure out why a restaurant owner might go for a name like Icon. It's punchy, easy to read and easier to remember. It seems cool, in a vague way. Brand names in general have been getting less specific and more suggestive, as marketers chase after the elusive, highly profitable conglomeration of ideas, sensations and associations that add up to an image. The same thinking that has given the world companies like Unisys and Verizon was bound to creep into the restaurant business sooner or later.
I sometimes riffle through the pages of "Dining in New York," a guide to the city's restaurants printed in 1930. Back then, diners knew where they stood. The Chalet Suisse served Swiss food. Janssen's Midtown Hofbrau served German. Maison Louis was French. The Chilli Villa was Mexican. Ye Olde English Tea Room was English. Giolito's Venetian Garden was owned by a man named Giolito, featured Venetian food and had a garden.
Life was simple. The food may have been terrible, but at least you knew what to expect when you walked through the door.
Now, the intent is a lot more complicated. Then again, so is the food. Fusion cooking and the new internationalized American cuisine make the naming process doubly difficult. "It's harder than naming a child," said Waldy Malouf, the executive chef at Beacon. His six-month naming odyssey had a starting point: the restaurant's open-fire cooking. He and his partners also wanted their name to communicate New York sophistication, friendliness, informality, accessibility and individuality -- in one word.
Somewhere along the way, Mr. Malouf learned that in the 15th century, the English used to light fires along the coast to guide ships. Bonfire became Beacon.
Explanations for the new names tend to raise more questions than they answer. "Coup is French for 'hit,' " said Davida Dambrosi, an owner of Coup. "So it's like you get surprised when you're hit." Vox comes from the Latin expression vox populi. Fair enough. But why exactly?
Tocqueville pleases the ear, but I can't say that I've cracked the code. An initial conversation with the restaurant's press agent yielded the following: "Just as de Tocqueville wrote the definitive work on American democracy, so the owners wanted to create the definitive restaurant." This sounded like the kind of answer that students the world over come up with when facing a tough essay question on a book they never quite got around to reading.
Marco Moreira, the chef and a part owner of Tocqueville, took a swing at it in a recent interview with The New York Observer, explaining that Tocqueville found Americans to be innovative and progressive, even though their background was European and conservative. "So our cooking is European," he said, "but American in that it's progressive." See?
There's a lesson in this. Don't ask, just eat.

The Good News Bears

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
When I was around 8 years old, I had an occasional playmate who was incapable of having a simple good time. If he was having fun, he would overdo it, getting more and more wound up -- until, inevitably, he would burst into tears and throw a tantrum.
Maybe he grew up to become a market analyst. 
 By rights, last week's half-point increase in interest rates should have been a non-event. A rational financial market supposedly reacts only to news -- and last week's move, which had been all but pre-announced by Fed officials and which newsletters had been predicting for a month, came as no surprise to anyone. And indeed on the day of the increase, markets took it calmly. But then the commentary began to take its toll: Inflation is back, we're headed for a hard landing, there's a 50-50 chance of recession. To listen to some of what's being said you would imagine either that Alan Greenspan had suddenly revealed himself as a financial sadist or that the mighty U.S. economy had suddenly been revealed to have feet of clay. So maybe it's time to re-establish some perspective.
The real news -- the background to the rate hike -- came not last week but over the couple of months previous, as it gradually became obvious that the U.S. economy had finally reached the limits of its much-expanded ability to produce. Everybody who wasn't living in a complete fantasy world knew this was going to happen eventually; the amazing thing is that it took so long. And the signs that we have reached our limits, though clear enough, are also fairly subtle: a modest increase in inflation, mainly due to oil but with some uptick in the "core" rate that supposedly excludes transitory factors, an acceleration of wage increases to a rate a bit more than productivity growth. Clearly it's time for the Fed to tap the brakes, to reduce the growth of demand enough to bring it into line with the growth in supply. But what now passes for a slowdown -- reducing growth to, say, 3 percent for a while until the inflationary pressure eases -- would have looked like a boom only a few years ago.
Could we be talking about something much worse than that sort of benign slowdown? Bad things do happen when the Fed is in inflation-fighting mode: the monetary contraction that began in 1979 eventually drove the unemployment rate into double digits. But back then the Fed was dealing with an economy in which inflation had been out of control for years, long enough that expectations of continuing inflation were deeply embedded in the national psyche; the Fed needed to take drastic measures in order to restore price stability. Those drastic measures, and the bad times they caused, wouldn't have happened if the Fed had moved quickly to control inflation before it had time to get established -- if, in other words, the Fed of the 70's had done what Mr. Greenspan is doing now.
True, there are other dangers. Attempts to nip inflation in the bud sometimes lead to the unpleasant discovery that your financial system is weaker than you thought, with nasty consequences for the real economy. That's what happened to Japan a decade ago, and it still hasn't recovered (and won't, if Mr. Greenspan's counterpart at the Bank of Japan -- who apparently is a financial sadist -- follows through on his plan to raise interest rates despite falling prices). But recent events in the U.S. actually suggest that we aren't as vulnerable as some, myself included, have feared. After all, the Nasdaq -- which is where the irrationally exuberant presumably put their money -- has fallen by more than a third, yet stories of sudden bankruptcy, of failed investors jumping from windows or shooting up brokers' offices, have been reassuringly scarce. In a way the bad news -- or rather the financial system's ability to take it in stride -- has been good news: I at least am becoming steadily less worried about a Japanese-style implosion.
This does not abridge the right of investors to bear qualms. If you think that stock prices in general are still too high -- a defensible position, though not quite as compelling now that some of the air has gone out of the tech bubble -- go ahead and sell. But don't blame the Fed.

ASIA
 
JAPAN: DYNASTIC POLITICS -- The youngest daughter of the late prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, announced that she would seek her father's parliamentary seat in elections scheduled for June 25. Mr. Obuchi died on May 14, after suffering a stroke six weeks earlier. The candidacy of his daughter, Yukio Obuchi, 28, a former broadcaster, has revived a debate about the prevalence of inherited parliamentary seats in Japan. Howard W. French (NYT) 

PHILIPPINES: REBELS TALK -- Declaring that they wanted peace, about 100 Islamic rebels holding 21 hostages since April 23 emerged from their mountain lair in the southern Philippines for talks. The unexpected meeting between the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas and the provincial governor, Abdusakur Tan, revived hopes of a breakthrough in the stalled negotiations for the hostages' release. Mr. Tan said that the rebels repeated their demand for an Islamic state -- a demand consistently rejected by Manila -- and that the next meeting would take place at the earliest on Thursday. (Reuters)
 
THAILAND: ROYAL RECORD -- King Bhumibol Adulyadej was declared the country's longest-living monarch, surpassing King Rama I, who died in 1809. King Bhumibol, 72, is also the world's longest-reigning monarch. He was only 18 when his older brother died and he assumed the throne in 1946. (Agence France-Presse)
 
AMERICAS
 
PERU: ELECTION MONITORS QUIT -- Transparencia, a Peruvian election observer group largely funded by the United States government, said it had so little confidence in presidential elections scheduled for Sunday that it was withdrawing its monitors from voting stations as a protest. The announcement came as the head of an Organization of American States observation team was trying to persuade aides of President Alberto K. Fujimori to put the election day off for a few weeks to fix any vote tabulation flaws in government computer software. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
MEXICO: GAIN FOR MAYORAL CONTENDER -- A Mexico City court turned down a challenge to the election credentials of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the leftist candidate who has built a wide lead in opinion surveys in the city's mayoral race. President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party and two others had sued to block Mr. Lopez Obrador's candidacy, arguing he did not meet residency requirements. A five-magistrate tribunal disagreed, leaving Mr. Lopez Obrador's challengers four days to appeal the ruling to a federal court. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
CUBA: DISSIDENT LAWYER FREED -- The government freed Rene Gomez Manzano, a dissident lawyer, from prison in the third early release of a prominent anti-government activist in the last two weeks. The early release of Mr. Gomez, 56, who was serving a four-year sentence for anti-government activities, followed the freeing over the last two weeks of two of his close dissident colleagues, Felix Bonne, 60, an academic, and Marta Beatriz Roque, 55, an economist. (Reuters)
 
EUROPE
 
NETHERLANDS: LOCKERBIE TRIAL DELAYED AGAIN -- Resumption of the trial of two Libyans in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, was delayed again by computer problems in the high-tech courtroom in Camp Zeist. The trial had been adjourned since May 11 to reschedule witnesses. Donald G. McNeil Jr. (NYT)
 
SPAIN: AGREEMENT ON TERRORISM -- Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain and President Jacques Chirac of France agreed to step up cooperation against terrorism at a one-day summit meeting in the northern city of Santander. Although Madrid and Paris have long worked together against Basque militants, officials are now concerned at signs that Spanish Basque rebels are collaborating with radical French Breton nationalists. Benjamin Jones (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
CONGO: TROOP WITHDRAWAL -- Rwanda, Uganda and the main rebel force operating in the Congolese diamond center of Kisangani have all agreed to pull troops out of the city, allowing the United Nations to establish the first neutral center for peacekeeping in Congo. The organization hopes to send South African troops. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
ETHIOPIA: VICTORY CLAIMS -- Ethiopia began a major attack on the central front of its disputed border with Eritrea, claiming by nightfall to have made significant advances. Eritrea, however, said it had repulsed the attack, and reported shooting down three Ethiopian fighter planes. Ethiopia said all its planes returned safely. Military analysts say this battle could be decisive: if Ethiopia dislodges the Eritreans from the town of Zalembessa, it will have forced Eritrea from the most important piece of land in dispute in the two-year war between the nations. Ian Fisher (NYT)
 
NIGERIA: NEW VIOLENCE -- Authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew and heavily armed troops patrolled the northern city of Kaduna after two days of clashes that filled hospital morgues and littered the streets with bodies. The fighting is the worst outbreak in Kaduna since riots in February between Christians and Muslims in which more than 1,000 people died. The cause of the latest violence is not clear. (Agence France-Presse)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: PAPER CLOSED -- Hard-line judicial officials, stung by the victory of reform candidates, shut down a newspaper allied with the reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, a day after it began printing. It was the 19th publication closed in a crackdown that began last month. In the Feb. 18 voting, allies of President Khatami won about three-quarters of the 290 seats, depriving the hard-liners of control of Parliament, which they have had since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

HEADLINE: U.S. Farm Groups Join Move to Ease Cuba Embargo

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Under pressure from farmers to open new markets, Congress is considering softening the United States trade embargo against Cuba to permit the export of food, medicine and medical products.
Powerful farm groups, sensing a swing in momentum this election year, are pushing lawmakers to reconsider the 38-year-old embargo, arguing that it does more harm than good. Business groups and pharmaceutical companies are also rallying for change. The effort even got unexpected support this year from the Elian Gonzalez saga as some Americans, deluged with stories about Cuba and Cuban-Americans, began to re-evaluate whether the United States' cold war strategy toward the Communist island nation still made sense. 
 Economically, the proposed measure is largely symbolic: It specifically rules out purchase of food using United States government credit, making it unlikely that cash-starved Cuba would be able to buy much from American farmers. And it does little to expand a current provision on exporting medicine and medical products to Cuba.
The measure's true significance is political, in its newfound popularity on the Hill among both conservatives and liberals. That marks an important shift in Congress, indicating a growing impatience with the embargo's failure and a desire to explore different approaches to dealing with the government of Fidel Castro.
"I think Castro has used this scapegoat argument against the United States for years," said Representative George R. Nethercutt Jr., a Washington Republican who faces a tough re-election battle this year. "If we take this argument away from him, we export not only food and medicine but also democracy. He can't then say that America is inhumane. It works to our advantage. We can't do any worse."
The measure, tucked inside a mammoth agriculture spending bill, was approved by the Appropriations Committee this month. It has attracted so many allies that it withstood an attempt by the majority whip, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, to strip the measure from the larger bill.
Last year, Mr. DeLay killed the measure before it could be voted on in the House.
The provision has also cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee, and faces little opposition there, although Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican and Castro foe, has expressed his displeasure. Last year, the Senate approved a similar measure in a 70-to-30 vote.
Although the measure stands its best chance ever this year, it faces a few hurdles in the House, where Republican leaders could still defeat the provision by preventing an up-or-down vote on it. One hurdle, in the Rules Committee, could come as early as this week.
Supporters say killing the language will be more difficult this year. "A fundamental shift has occurred," said Senator Byron Dorgan, the North Dakota Republican who wrote the Senate bill.
The measure would permit the United States to export food, medicine and medical products to Cuba, under certain stringent conditions, which were written into the bill to draw support.
In addition to the prohibition on use of government credit, the bill also specifies that companies wanting to sell to Cuba would have to obtain yearly licenses to export their products and would have to wait six months after the law is enacted to conduct business.
Medicine and medical products are already exported to Cuba under slightly tougher regulations. Last year, the Commerce Department approved 63 licenses to export medicine and medical products.
Although some opponents say the language is written so loosely that it could permit bartering and private financing, many critics say the bill, if passed, would be a hollow victory for farmers.
"It would really be a symbolic gesture," said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican and Cuban-American who is fighting the language in the bill. "I have no problem with symbolic gestures, if that makes them happy enough, as long as they are trying not to give more money to Fidel Castro."
Farm state lawmakers argue that the measure would provide at least some help to constituents who have been hit hard by falling commodity prices and a 1996 bill that revamped agriculture rules. And it would allow farmers to position themselves in Cuba, which trades with a host of other American allies, including Canada.
Audrae Erickson, an international trade specialist for the American Farm Bureau, said analysts believe that the Cuban market could be worth up to $1 billion a year.
And because the provision would do little to steer money to Fidel Castro, even some members who fiercely oppose any softening of the embargo view this measure as a relatively harmless way to appease farm belt politicians.
"It's all driven by the farm lobby," said a senior Republican Senate aide. "These people are running around looking for any panacea. They've convinced themselves the solution lies in Havana."
In the House, the measure received extra support this year from the Elian Gonzalez story. The Elian story put Cuba back in the news and painted Cuban-Americans in Miami as extreme, creating a backlash that prompted some lawmakers to re-think American foreign policy toward Cuba.

Wearing a New Hat
It was a bit like a coming-out party. On Thursday, the day after HAROLD O. LEVY was formally pronounced chancellor of New York City schools, the City University of New York held a reception for him at the Lotos Club. The timing was fortuitous; the event had been planned two months earlier. The reception drew about 150 people, including seven state regents, CUNY trustees and MATTHEW GOLDSTEIN, CUNY's chancellor.
Dr. Goldstein and Mr. Levy were introduced to each other last fall. At the time, Mr. Levy was a regent and Dr. Goldstein was seeking his vote for CUNY's hotly debated remedial policy, which bars students who cannot pass placement tests from its bachelor's degree programs. (Mr. Levy voted for the policy.) Now, they are like blood brothers. 
 So at the party, they talked about their interconnectedness and exchanged caps. Mr. Levy gave Dr. Goldstein a khaki cap with his name on the back and a Board of Education logo on the front. Dr. Goldstein gave Mr. Levy a black cap with his name on the back and the CUNY logo on the front. Then, in honor of Mr. Levy's appointment -- and his affinity for poetry -- Dr. Goldstein read "To Be of Use," a poem by Marge Piercy. One stanza, in particular, seemed to be a metaphor for the job of heading the city schools:
 
I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,
who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,
who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,
who do what has to be done, again and again.
 
How to Feed a Caterpillar
On Monday and Tuesday, the little caterpillar ate his way through one apple and two pears, but today, ERIC CARLE will take the techniques behind his children's classic "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" to Public School 84 in Queens. About 150 teachers are expected to participate in a workshop led by Mr. Carle, who is also the book's illustrator, with an additional 120 teachers from P.S. 149, also in Queens, participating via video conferencing. Mr. Carle's workshop is sponsored by Studio in a School, an organization that brings painters and sculptors to teach in schools.
Help With Online Education Columbia University and New York University are both turning to outside companies for help with developing and promoting their continuing-education programs online.
Columbia said yesterday that it would work with Cognitive Arts, a company that designs technology for online education and corporate training, to offer courses in computer technology and English as a second language. It also plans to develop basic courses in economics and psychology. New York University recently announced that McGraw-Hill, the publishing company, would market and distribute some of the courses it offers through NYUonline, its for-profit digital venture. The courses will be aimed at corporate clients McGraw-Hill reaches through its Lifetime Learning division. GORDON MACOMBER, NYUonline's president and chief executive, said his group had about 100 hours of courses up and running, in areas like conflict management and communications skills for managers.
 
A Tarantella on Livingston Street
As the choreographer ELIOT FELD stage-whispered "Good boy!" and "Ignore me!" from his front-row folding chair, and classical music descended from the rafters, 23 young dancers from Ballet Tech's New York City Public School for Dance pirouetted their way across a portable linoleum floor last week at 110 Livingston Street. It was the start of Arts Monday, a program to showcase arts in city schools, and a good-size crowd turned out, attracted by the spectacle of toe shoes and leotards in the normally grim hall of the Board of Education. After performing Balanchine's "Tarantella," EMANUEL ROBINSON, 15, confessed that he had no idea who the balding man leading the standing ovation might be. But when you have performed at Jacob's Pillow and the Kennedy Center, a New York City schools chancellor is just another curtain call.

HEADLINE: R.T. MacDonald, 69; Led International Herald Tribune

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Robert T. MacDonald, a former publisher of The International Herald Tribune, died on Friday in Sarasota, Fla. He was 69 and lived in Sarasota.
The cause was cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. MacDonald, a former executive vice president of The New York Herald Tribune, was named publisher of The Herald Tribune in Paris in 1966, after The Washington Post acquired a substantial interest in the paper's Paris edition.
In 1967 the Paris-based International Edition of The New York Times was merged with The Herald Tribune's Paris edition to create a three-way joint venture named The International Herald Tribune. Now appearing six days a week, it is owned jointly by The New York Times and The Washington Post; Whitney Communications, the partner representing the old Herald Tribune ownership, sold out in 1991.
With Mr. MacDonald as publisher, the renamed newspaper sought readers everywhere who wanted to follow news from the United States, and the number of advertisers grew.
Mr. Macdonald resigned as publisher in 1977 and for a decade served as chairman of Hudson Research Europe Ltd., an organization based in Paris doing political and economic analyses. From 1980 to 1997 he was also the managing director of MacDonald & Company, an investment firm with headquarters in Stamford, Conn.
Born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., Robert Taylor McDonald graduated in 1952 from Yale, served in the Navy and received a master's degree in business administration in 1958 from the University of Pennsylvania. His 1960 marriage to Christiana Barbara Besch ended in divorce in 1977.
Surviving are his wife, the former Gillian S. Tripier, whom he married in 1978; three children from his first marriage, a daughter, Jennifer L. MacDonald, and two sons, Gregory C. and Michael S.; a sister, Mary E. MacDonald, and a grandchild.

HEADLINE: Russia Opens Doors to Lab That Created Deadly Germs

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: OBOLENSK, Russia, May 23

 BODY:
The once top-secret research complex where the Soviet Union perfected dozens of strains of deadly bacteria threw open its doors this week to scientists from around the world.
The director of the State Research Center for Applied Microbiology, which is a two-hour drive from Moscow, invited 200 scientists from 10 countries, Western officials and even an American reporter to what was once a crown jewel of the Soviet germ warfare empire, so hidden that it was not listed on Soviet maps. 
 In the Soviet era, 3,000 scientists and technicians worked for more than 20 years to develop weapons from anthrax, glanders, plague, tularemia and other lethal or debilitating diseases.
Now the center is inviting scrutiny to demonstrate its determination to conduct just peaceful work such as preventing bioterrorism and curing disease. Scientists at the three-day conference here discussed the new research and were given an extensive tour of several of the 90 buildings.
The meeting is to close on Wednesday with a conference for the Russian and Western press, another first for Obolensk, and the announcement of $1.6 million in additional American assistance to help the institute chart a peaceful course.
American officials said the United States initiative included $935,000 from the Pentagon to upgrade security at this sprawling complex to prevent the theft or diversion to hostile states of the hundreds of strains of deadly germs that are stored here.
At the opening session, the director of the center, Gen. Nikolai N. Urakov, pledged to open the "curtain of secrecy" that enshrouded the 25-year-old complex and to dispel the "lack of trust" in its conversion from military to peaceful research.
General Urakov said he wanted to expand cooperation with the United States, European nations and other countries that have forsworn germ weapons.
He said although the institute had shrunk by half, to 1,125 employees, and the lab had not overcome the economic crisis caused by the Soviet Union's collapse a decade ago, the staff was stabilizing, and some scientists had even returned after working abroad or in business.
Western officials said international aid to Obolensk provided the means to employ more than half the scientists here.
The United States assistance and other foreign aid, which is administered through an international group that audits grants to insure that they are spent on designated research, has given more than $3.4 million to Obolensk.
Only Vector, the country's other leading former germ warfare center, has received more assistance from the international group, the International Science and Technology Center. Vector once specialized in turning viruses into weapons.
Today, conference participants were given a tour of the complex and its infamous Building No. 1, an austere nine-story glass and metal structure where the most top secret weapons research was once conducted.
Roaming through the labs and chatting informally with their Russian counterparts in areas that were once off limits to anyone not wearing special suits, the scientists discussed the research into peaceful goals, including tuberculosis, anthrax vaccines and molecular genetics.
Floyd P. Horn, director of the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service, called the quality of the presentations superb.
Scientific cooperation between Russian and American scientists would "clearly benefit both parties," he said.
Dr. Horn's agency is providing $325,000 this year for research into pig diseases, along with computer equipment that will give this remote center access to the American National Agricultural Library.
A Defense Department official said the meetings, the tour and the growing American and international access "dispels the suspicion that Obolensk is still conducting offensive germ research."
Several conservative legislators and intelligence experts contend that Moscow is continuing to pursue such research. But a recent report by the General Accounting Office found no evidence of such research here or at Vector.
In interviews this week, Russian scientists said that they were determined to relegate the past work in such areas to history.
"We still are not permitted to discuss the past," a scientist said. "But we know our future lies in fighting the terrorism and diseases that threaten all mankind."
Several scientists said privately they were delighted by their growing contacts with Western counterparts and the end of the isolation that they had once endured as germ warriors.
Life remains difficult in Obolensk, where many top scientists, paid less than $100 a month, are required to have second jobs to make ends meet.
But many scientists said they were encouraged to remain in science not only by the prestige that such employment still brings in this society, but also by new exchanges with American colleagues.
Last month, two senior Obolensk scientists delivered two rare anthrax strains to centers in Atlanta and Fort Detrick, Md., as part of an exchange program negotiated this year.

HEADLINE: Help China And Help Chinatown

BYLINE: By Henry Wong; Henry Wong just completed his junior year at Yale University.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
In their fight against granting China permanent normal trade relations, labor unions say they are trying to protect Americans from having to compete with foreign workers who are paid barely a living wage to work in inhumane conditions. But keeping China out of the global economy will actually hurt American factory workers more than it helps them.
Consider my mother, who has been a garment worker in New York City for more than 20 years. Despite being a union member, she is paid the minimum wage or sometimes less. The factory she works in has little ventilation and dirty toilets. My father, who was a restaurant worker, is now 70 and unable to work, and my mother's income is essential. Fluctuating demand for American textiles has threatened to put my family in the streets. Already, several factory closings in Chinatown have forced her into dirtier and hotter factories. 
 Yet my mother encourages me to buy goods made by companies accused of using sweatshops in third world countries. For years, I could not understand why she would do this instead of fighting the global market forces that could put her out of work. But the unfortunate paradox, I began to realize, is this: The products made in factories in developing countries are the only kind factory workers in this country can afford to buy.
My parents and other Chinese immigrants constantly remind me how much more my generation has, living in the United States. "When I was growing up in China, we ate roast pig once a year during Chinese New Year," my father tells me. "Now, we can eat roast pig every day."
Internet-ready computers, video games, Chinese candies, clothes, food, and woks are all made available and affordable by this country's open markets. Lower prices and imported goods may seem like frivolous benefits to many Americans, but to poor immigrant families, they mean a lot.
Moreover, Chinese immigrants like my parents know all too well the consequences of living in an isolated society and closed economy. When I asked my mother why she left China for Hong Kong before coming to the United States, she said: "Everybody was running to Hong Kong then. China was poor. China was Communist." As Hong Kong prospered and grew as a trading hub, China, closed off from the outside, continued to suffer from poverty, famine and political oppression.
Opening China to the global market can only help reduce these conditions, which continue today. While an international labor standard would be useful, it is too idealistic and impractical, and mandated living wages would rob countries with cheap labor of the competitive advantage they need to lift their people out of poverty.
The labor movement has done too little to improve my mother's workplace, and its current international fight seems misplaced. Squeezing globalization with the vise of protectionism helps neither American nor Chinese workers. If the labor movement wins its battle against so-called free trade, it will find the American working class suffering most.

HEADLINE: THE CHINA TRADE WRANGLE: VICE PRESIDENT;
An Embarrassed Suitor: Gore's Courtship of Big Labor Grows Less Ardent

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
On the eve of the China trade vote, while the Clinton Administration was still nailing down support for the bill's passage, Vice President Al Gore flew off to Pittsburgh. The Steel City, one of the nation's last redoubts of big labor, was host to a conference of the service employees union, the home base of the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has devoted itself to killing the legislation.
Heading for union turf at such a juncture is one more sign of Mr. Gore's ambivalence, if not toward the bill, then toward his public association with the bill. 
 Even as the administration is trying to round up last-minute votes, the vice president was engaged with labor out of town rather than working against it on Capitol Hill.
"Which side is the vice president on?" Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat, said in an interview. "He doesn't want to offend anybody." Mr. Rangel said that Mr. Gore had called him about the bill but that he was already supporting it and that there was not much point to the conversation.
The service workers' union and its former chief, John Sweeney, who is now president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., have essentially given Mr. Gore a pass on the China bill, but not everyone in the labor movement is feeling so generous.
The president of the United Auto Workers today offered one of the most blistering assessments of Mr. Gore's actions on behalf of the bill. Mr. Gore has been two-faced, the union president said, and is driving the auto workers into the arms of one of the auto industry's enduring nemesis, Ralph Nader, who is also running for president.
"He has tried to have it both ways on China," an outraged Stephen P. Yokich, president of the 1.3-million-strong auto workers union, said of Mr. Gore in a statement today.
"One moment, presidential candidate Gore is telling the labor movement that he believes human rights, workers' rights, and environmental protections should be included in core trade agreements; the next, Vice President Gore is holding hands with the profiteers of the world and singing the praises" of the trade agreement and "lobbying" for it.
Mr. Gore, speaking to reporters in Pittsburgh, brushed aside the attack, saying the election was a long time away and that he would not entertain hypothetical questions.
Still, criticism from a putative ally goes a long way toward explaining Mr. Gore's reluctance to take a more visible role in promoting the trade agreement. The Gore campaign has hoped that the vice president could use the issue to convey that he is not beholden to labor and that he is willing to break with an important constituency over principle.
"I just want to tell you forthrightly I don't share your views on this particular issue," Mr. Gore said to several thousand service workers today.
Mr. Gore has said numerous times that he supports the trade agreement, and he took part in a White House pep rally to advance it. He also has said that he has called members of Congress to lobby on behalf of the bill.
But as he runs with labor's endorsement and seeks to energize union workers behind his candidacy, the degree of Mr. Gore's support has been questioned.
He caused consternation at the White House in February after labor leaders said he had indicated that he would negotiate a tougher pact than Mr. Clinton negotiated. Administration officials were worried that Mr. Gore's stance could give political cover to Democrats who opposed the bill. Mr. Gore then wrote to the nation's chief business lobbying group, the National Association of Manufacturers, to reassure it of his support.
Congressional Democrats who oppose the measure said that many among their number had no sign that the vice president was actively working for passage. And one business lobbyist, who did not want to be identified, put it this way: "The vice president's enthusiasm has been spectacularly underwhelming."
Unlike Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Gore's Republican rival for the presidency, Mr. Gore has not devoted a speech to the single topic of the China bill. When Mr. Bush addressed it last week at a Boeing factory in Everett, Washington, his impassioned remarks gave the appearance that he was more closely allied with President Clinton on this matter than Mr. Gore.
Today, Mr. Bush met with Republicans privately on Capitol Hill and reiterated his support for the bill. Members said afterward that he asked those who plan to vote against it to reconsider their vote.
It is not clear whether Mr. Gore's lower-key approach will advance either his beliefs in economic globalization or his political aspirations.
Stephen P. Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, a liberal research organization, said that Mr. Gore's blurry approach raised legitimate questions. But he also suggested that Mr. Gore's posture over the bill has reinforced an impression that the vice president is overly cautious and calculating. "You feel that Gore really is an internationalist, but for heaven's sake, why doesn't he come out and say it?" Mr. Hess said. "Everything has become so calculated."
Mr. Clinton, too, has shown some calculation. He had planned a national television address Sunday night on the trade bill, one of his most important foreign policy objectives. But he canceled it when it was clear that the bill was dividing Democrats and would have raised the awkward specter of Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader from Missouri, who opposes the bill, giving the official response to the president of his own party.
Democrats say the unions have riven the party, in part by running commercials against some members who oppose the bill while they have essentially given Mr. Gore the kid-glove treatment.
"A lot of people are concerned just how committed the unions are to hurting members of Congress and how they use a different standard for the vice president," Mr. Rangel said. "We don't want them to be cruel to the vice president, but we're running for re-election too."

HEADLINE: A Family Dynasty Turns Against Itself

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The urbane, soft-spoken Seymour Milstein and his blustery, cigar-waving brother, Paul, used their good cop, bad cop approach to deal-making over the last five decades to turn their father's Bronx flooring company into a vast empire worth an estimated $5 billion.
They made multiple fortunes in real estate, banking and the food industry, fought city officials and preservationists to a standstill and amassed holdings from the Upper East Side to Battery Park City. 
 But now, the seemingly unbreakable ties between the two men are fraying in an ugly rift over control of the empire and succession. It has spawned lawsuits, severed longstanding partnerships and pitted brother against brother, cousin against cousin.
At stake is control of millions of square feet of office space, tens of thousands of Manhattan apartments and the family's crown jewel: Emigrant Savings Bank, one of New York's oldest financial institutions.
One of the sharpest battles is taking place over a parking lot at Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street, whose value has soared with the resurgence of Times Square to more than $100 million in the 16 years since the brothers and their partners bought it for $5 million.
Seymour Milstein and the partners recently blocked Paul's son Howard, 49, from developing the parcel on his own by abruptly dissolving the partnership and putting the land up for sale. Howard counterattacked by suing Emigrant over the role of Seymour's son, Philip, 50, the bank's chief executive.
"They're fighting over the very things they built together," said Stephen B. Siegel, president of the Insignia/ESG brokerage firm and one of the few people who knows the family who was willing to speak for the record, no matter how briefly. "I always find these family battles distressing."
Not one of the combatants was willing to talk publicly about the dispute. But a picture of the infighting between the billionaires emerged from court records and from friends and supporters of the factions who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
The real estate dynasties that rule New York have certainly had their share of blood-curdling feuds. The family of Sol Goldman, the land speculator, waged a bitter seven-year battle over his billion-dollar estate. And more than one family has seen a son chafe under the bridle of his father's oversized personality and flee the business. But never have the internecine rifts been so deep and over so big a prize.
The fighting has ensnared another large real estate family, that of the late Jack D. Weiler, as well as John E. Zuccotti, the lawyer and former city official who is a confidant to real estate titans, from Mortimer B. Zuckerman to Paul Milstein. Many on the sidelines have reacted with sadness over the squabbling between the once inseparable brothers as they enter their 80's and with amusement as a wealthy family with a reputation for litigious, bare-knuckled tactics turns on itself.
"The Milstein family has a long history of tough and often controversial dealings dating back to the 1960's," said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society. "They were respected for their business acumen, but never confused with saints or sweethearts."
Paul and Seymour Milstein went to work for their father, Morris, after World War II. Until recently, the two brothers had a lifelong division of labor, according to friends and real estate executives.
Paul, now 78, was a hard-charging Runyonesque character from the old school of New York real estate who wore pinkie rings on both hands and punctuated his profane talk with a large cigar. He was a builder, a bricks-and-mortar man. An executive recalled how Paul cursed and screamed at Samuel J. Lefrak, an equally voluble builder, for 30 minutes before the conversation wound down; the two men then asked about each other's wives and hung up.
Seymour, who will be 80 in July and has a demeanor more like that of a secretary of state or a corporate executive, handled the economic terms of the projects and the family's critical financial relationships with various banks. Both men were tough, friends said, and neither took a step without consulting the other.
"They seemed to be a perfect combination," said William J. Stern, a former chairman of the state's Urban Development Corporation. "Paul, who commanded attention, was funnier, gruffer and more outspoken. But he had a great deference to Seymour. When Seymour spoke, Paul listened."
They worked with their father at the Circle Floor Company, which later won contracts to make floor tile for Sears and to install flooring at many New York landmarks, like Rockefeller Center, the United Nations, the World Trade Center and Madison Square Garden.
In the 1960's, Paul built the family's first apartment house, the 35-story Dorchester Tower at Broadway and 68th Street, followed by a 42-story building east of Lincoln Center.
The projects established a pattern of conflict with city officials. In 1981, the Milsteins outraged city officials and preservationists by demolishing the landmark Palm Court lounge and gilded clock at the Biltmore Hotel on Madison Avenue, after promising to restore them as part of what is now Bank of America Plaza.
In the 1970's, the family took control of United Brands, the food company, and Starrett Housing Corporation, a real estate company. They later sold the companies for a profit, and in 1986, took over the failing Emigrant Savings Bank. They poured $90 million into the bank, which Bert Ely, a bank analyst, said is worth $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
During the 1980's, the Milsteins built Normandie Court and Windsor Court on the Upper East Side and the Liberty buildings at Battery Park City, but have been quiet in the current real estate boom.
Now the two brothers, who live in apartments high atop the family's Bristol Plaza complex on Third Avenue and still go into work at the family's Midtown offices, are at odds over the question of succession. Friends said Seymour, the older brother, wants out of the real estate business and would rather liquidate the family's holdings than allow his nephew Howard to take control.
Paul's son has adopted his father's bombastic mien to much less effect while working in real estate and pursuing membership, unsuccessfully, in the elite club of National Football League team owners. He is an intensely smart, ambitious man who friends conceded is also arrogant to a fault. Seymour and his son rarely get along with him.
Although Howard was never able to get out from under his father's shadow as a builder, his friends and supporters credit him with devising the marketing plan for the Bristol Court complex on the Upper East Side that enabled the family to double their rental revenue, and reviving the Milford Plaza Hotel on Eighth Avenue. He also created Liberty Cable, a challenger to Time Warner's dominance of cable television in Manhattan, and rebuilt the Douglas Elliman realty company, later sold for an estimated $80 million profit.
Along the way, Howard engaged in public feuds with Time Warner, the developer Peter Malkin and the N.F.L., which rejected his bids to acquire the Cleveland Browns and the Washington Redskins. His highly publicized plan to revive Niagara Falls went nowhere. Meetings with Howard were described as "audiences," and even his friends attribute his imperial style to a difficult relationship with his domineering father.
A real estate executive who considers Howard to be the family's natural heir said: "Howard is the brightest one in the family. Out of insecurity, he has to tell people how smart he is. People think he's too brash, too arrogant, too confrontational. He learned that from his father. The difference is that Howard doesn't know when to back off."
People on both sides of the conflict said Howard's father had been less focused and often forgetful since heart surgery a couple of years ago. After the Milsteins began pouring the foundation for a large apartment tower at First Avenue and 61st Street, Seymour realized that his brother could not handle building another project and sold the property last year for $45 million to Daniel Brodsky, a developer. At the time, Howard and his brother, Edward, were preoccupied with trying to buy the Redskins for $800 million.
"Seymour didn't think Paul was up to it, and he was right," said an executive who has worked closely with the family. "Paul was screaming, 'I'll build it; I'll never sell!' But he's never really said no to his older brother. At the end of the day, Paul knew his older brother had his interests at heart."
With his father less active in the family business, Howard has tried to assert his leadership. That has brought him into conflict with his uncle and his cousin.
The simmering rivalry spilled into court last year after Howard sold Douglas Elliman for a total of about $85 million to Insignia Financial and refused to give Seymour's son a share of the proceeds.
His cousin, Philip, filed suit in Delaware, claiming he had not been notified of the pending sale despite his position as a shareholder and director of the company. He demanded a look at the company's books, raising suspicions that Howard may have used the company's resources to fuel his unsuccessful bid for the Redskins, which friends say Howard denies doing.
At the same time, Howard moved to develop the last open parcel in the Times Square redevelopment area, a 40,000-square-foot parking lot on 42nd Street. But each time he talked to Ernst & Young, the developer Jerry I. Speyer or The New York Times about building a 1.1-million-square-foot tower on the site, Seymour Milstein or Alan Weiler, whose family owned half the parcel, would send an embarrassing letter to the companies stating that Howard did not represent the owners. (The Times is now negotiating over a different site nearby.)
In 1994, the partners worked cooperatively but unsuccessfully to develop a hotel, movie complex and studio for Home Box Office on the site. Claiming that Howard had violated the traditional consensus that governed the parking lot, Mr. Weiler, a lawyer who worked for the Milsteins for more than 20 years, and Seymour Milstein, whose wing of the family had a 20 percent share in the parcel, dissolved the partnership in April and moved to sell the land.
Howard responded by filing court papers claiming that his father had designated him, his brother and Mr. Zuccotti as the developers of the site. "Even though Paul likes to beat up on Howard," said a person who knows Paul well, "he was hoping his son could've done that one on his own."
In a slap at his uncle, Howard described him in an affidavit as a "passive partner in Paul Milstein's real estate ventures," a claim that even Howard's biggest boosters said was inaccurate and unfair. Both sides have now agreed to sell the parking lot, which has attracted nearly every developer in the city.
Last month, the fighting intensified when Howard also filed a suit seeking to oust Philip as chief executive of Emigrant Savings Bank. He accused his cousin of engaging in a "campaign of corporate misconduct" to keep his hold on the bank and reneging on a longstanding promise to make him co-chief executive.
The suit said that Philip had failed to maximize the bank's profits and exposed the company to unnecessary tax burdens. Philip has retained the support of 11 of the 17 bank directors who are not named Milstein, but the gulf between the two wings of the family remains wide open.
"This never would have happened if Paul didn't have some problems," said a person who has known the family for decades. "He was always able to keep the lid on the explosive generational issues."
So far, Philip and his father have rejected a suggestion by Howard and his father that they split the bank into two parts, or hire professional managers. Some people who know the elder Milsteins predicted that the family might start selling property, which would have been unthinkable five years ago.
"They don't really want to be in business with each other," one said. "That's why Seymour wants to liquidate."

HEADLINE: Swell of Minority Students Is Predicted at Colleges

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
College enrollment will swell by some two million students -- to 19 million -- over the next 15 years, with black, Hispanic and Asian-American students accounting for 80 percent of the growth, according to a study scheduled for release today by the Educational Testing Service.
The proportion of white students on campuses nationwide will drop from 71 percent in 1995 to 63 percent in 2015, the study predicts. Over that same 20-year stretch, Hispanic-Americans will increase their presence to 15 percent from 11 percent, and Asian-Americans to 8 percent from 5 percent, while African-American enrollment will remain steady at about 13 percent. Whites will be a minority on campuses by then in California, the District of Columbia, Hawaii and New Mexico, and, soon afterward, in Texas. 
 "The fact that so many more minority students are opting for college is great news and underscores minority families' dedication to educating their children," Sonia Hernandez of the California Department of Education said in a statement accompanying the report. But Ms. Hernandez said colleges are unprepared to meet the demand and shifting demographics, both in terms of financial aid and academic programs. "Celebrations are premature," she said. "I am very worried that we could fail these children."
The surge in enrollment follows a steady climb over a half-century -- from 2.3 million students in 1947, to 10.2 million in 1974, to 14.3 million in 1997 and a predicted 19 million in 2015 -- and reflects the rise in births in the United States, increased immigration, and a growing sense that a college degree is a prerequisite for a decent job.
Five states with large Hispanic populations -- Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas -- will account for more than half the overall increase in undergraduates over the next 15 years. California and Florida are each planning to build a new state university campus.
But while minority college enrollment is skyrocketing, it is not growing as fast as the black and Hispanic populations ages 18 to 24. The study says that participation by blacks and Hispanics in higher education will actually decrease in proportion to their populations between 1995 and 2015.
"We need to be careful that the growing numbers of minority students ready for college don't give us a false sense that we have achieved our diversity goals," said Richard A. Fry, a testing service economist and co-author of the report. Mr. Fry said that if black and Hispanic students attended college at the same rate as whites, the national economy would grow by $231 billion annually.
Education experts said that they had been expecting the demographic shift, but that colleges and universities -- and the governments that supported them -- were unprepared. Among the challenges, they said, would be addressing the persistent "achievement gap" between white and Asian students and their black and Hispanic counterparts in high school; helping minority families, which are disproportionately poor, afford tuition; and fostering a climate of racial tolerance at historically white institutions.
"There needs to be a fundamental shift in perspective about what educating students of color means," said Jamie Merisotis, director of the Institute for Higher Education Policy in Washington. "We need to treat this as part of the mainstream, and not as an add-on."
Stanley O. Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, said his 3,500 member campuses have "been working for a decade" to diversify their student bodies and faculties and "try to make themselves more comfortable places for students who have been underrepresented."
Anthony Lising Antonio, a professor of education at Stanford University who has studied the impact of diversity on college students, said that colleges would risk repeating the racial tensions of the late 1980's and early 1990's if they did not adjust their curriculums and programs to reflect their new students.
"Whether they change their admissions practices or not, there's going to be these floods of students, and it's going to be a much more diverse place," Professor Antonio said. "If we do nothing about it, you're not going to garner the benefits a diverse student body provides you."
Bruce Walker, director of admissions at the University of Texas at Austin, said that the burden was on the state's elementary and high schools to adequately prepare the newcomers for college. But he and others noted that the trend in recent years toward using tax credits and loans to help families finance higher education would need to be replaced with increased grant support.
Scott Miller, the author of a recent College Board report documenting the achievement gaps among the races, said his analysis of test scores over the past decade showed that "our capacity to integrate our most selective universities is not going to enhance very much over the next generation."
"Will more go to college? Yes. Will more graduate? Yes," Mr. Miller said.
"Will we close in a dramatic way, in the next generation, the college graduation rate gaps, and the achievement gaps when people get degrees?" he continued. "It may be that the only gains that will be made will be made through the sheer numbers."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Falls To Its Lowest Level of Year

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index plunged to its lowest level in six months yesterday as the broad stock market declined for a fifth consecutive day.
Concerns about the economy's strength have left investors jittery, and Wall Street strategists say stocks may have a difficult time taking off again until investors are convinced that the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates to ward off inflation. 
 The Nasdaq composite dropped 199.66, or 5.9 percent, to 3,164.55, its 10th-biggest decline ever in percentage terms. It fell below its previous low for the year, 3,321 reached on April 14, a Friday that had capped a terrible week and a record 25.3 percent decline. At its new low, the technology-heavy index is down 22.2 percent for the year and 37.3 percent from its peak in March.
On Monday, stocks rallied late and regained most of what had been steep losses earlier in the day, but yesterday the major indexes took the opposite tack, swooning as the close approached and finishing at their lows for the day.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 120.28, or 1.1 percent, to 10,422.27, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 26.86, or 1.9 percent, to 1,373.86. Those two indexes remained above their April 14 closing levels. The Dow is down 9.4 percent for the year, while the S.& P. 500 is off 6.5 percent.
Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equities strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, sees more declines ahead. After visiting money managers across the country for the last six weeks, he has concluded that most of their portfolios are still too vulnerable to higher interest rates. "People own too many tech stocks still, and they probably own too many financial stocks," he said. "We will be wrestling with how high interest rates are going till Labor Day."
In the bond market, prices rose slightly, as yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. Even with a threat of higher interest rates, bonds often rally when stocks fall sharply as investors move out of stocks. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note slipped to 6.42 percent, from 6.44 percent on Monday, while the price rose 3/32 to 100 17/32. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.16 percent from 6.19 percent.
Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Intel led the technology group down yesterday, but industrial stocks also declined. General Motors has lost 13.8 percent of its value in two days after announcing it was limiting how many shares of its stock it would swap for shares in its Hughes Electronics subsidiary. Other decliners were International Paper and United Technologies. Drug stocks, including Merck and Schering-Plough, rose after the two companies announced a joint venture. Some financial stocks also gained, including American Express.
Several factors are hurting the stock market now, analysts say. One is the belated realization by many investors that the Federal Reserve is determined to continue raising its target for short-term interest rates until the economy slows.
Before the Fed raised its target rate a half a percentage point to 6.5 percent a week ago, many investors had apparently expected the Fed to act cautiously. The cautious approach -- five quarter-point rate increases since June -- had failed to slow economic growth significantly and left investors feeling relatively positive. But last week's bigger rate increase and the accompanying statement that pointed to more increases ahead "dashed whatever remaining hopes there were that the Fed was close to on hold," Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States equities strategist at Lehman Brothers, told his clients this week. "Until there is an end in sight for Fed tightening, we expect that the stock market will continue to churn with little direction and volume."
Lehman Brothers' economists predict another half-point increase by the Fed in June and a final quarter-point increase in August. Stocks will only rally, Mr. Applegate said, when investors are convinced that the economy has slowed enough for the Fed to stop raising rates.
The Fed is now expected to slow economic growth from the current 5 percent pace to 3 percent or 3.5 percent, and as it does, earnings forecasts will fall a bit. Some analysts are already lowering their predictions of earnings growth for the companies in the S.& P. 500.
In addition, investors are grappling with the prospect that the technology sector is not immune to rising rates.
If higher rates dampen stock prices, those companies will find it harder to raise cash in the equity market and to use their stock to buy other companies. And their earnings could also be lowered as old-economy companies trim spending plans in light of a slowing economy.
One question for investors and Federal Reserve officials is whether the lackluster performance of the stock market over the last 12 months is beginning to have an impact on consumer spending. Since a year ago, the Dow has lost 3.8 percent, the S.& P. 500 has gained 3.3 percent and the Nasdaq index, which soared 85.6 percent in 1999, has retained a 25.6 percent gain.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, and other Fed members have said that five consecutive years of double-digit returns in the stock market have been the main force behind the consumer spending boom that has propelled the economy to its longest expansion ever. And while Fed officials have gone to great lengths to claim that they are not aiming to drive the stock market lower, they have acknowledged that this wealth effect is making it difficult to rein in economic growth.

HEADLINE: AIRLINE DEAL: THE UNIONS;
Labor Issues Could Thwart Airlines' Plans

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 23

 BODY:
For years, labor unions have been a thorn in the side of the UAL Corporation and the US Airways Group, and now that the two airlines are planning to combine, experts wonder if the unions have enough power to squash the deal.
"The unions that were around at the beginning of this industry still have a hammerlock," said Sam Peltzman, an economist who specializes in airlines and regulatory issues at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. "The industry is completely unionized." 
 Airline unions are so powerful, experts say, that they could pose huge problems not only in voting to approve UAL's proposed $4.3 billion takeover of US Airways, but in determining how and whether two major airlines can unite. That stumbling block, they say, even more than antitrust questions could be the airlines' No. 1 challenge.
United Airlines employees control more than 50 percent of the airline, and most of its employees are members of one of several unions, like the Air Line Pilots Association.
Last week, United's employee stock-option plan expired. The plan, some experts said, gave pilots de facto control of the airline and made it difficult for the company to dilute the pilots' ownership. Now that the plan has expired, experts say the company may have been granted the freedom to make a deal.
Even so, employee ownership should not prove to be an obstacle to such a deal. The employee shareholders will each vote independently unless a movement develops to organize employees as a group or under the umbrella of the unions, according to the experts.
Spokesmen for the major unions were unavailable to comment.
 The companies have each had labor problems. Most recently UAL had to cancel hundreds of flights this month after pilots refused to work overtime because of a lack of progress in contract talks. And US Airways averted a labor standoff this month when a union representing flight attendants voted to adopt a new contract.
"As bad as labor relations are at United, it's worse at US Airways," said Aaron J. Gellman, director of the transportation center at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
To combine operations, the experts say that the unions that represent pilots, machinists, attendants and others will have to agree on everything from work rules and seniority lists to which hub should dominate a region.
Indeed, these issues are so complicated that several experts say they have their doubts whether two major airlines can be successfully integrated. Airline mergers, they say, have typically involved larger airlines buying regional outfits, making a combination easier to achieve.
"The problems are very formidable," Professor Peltzman said. "The first issue you decide if you put two together is who's the senior pilot. They get at each other's throats over issues like this."
Professor Gellman said he had doubts about whether two major airlines could be merged successfully. The reaction of the pilots will be important, he said.
"Do they see themselves as losing power or gaining in stockholder value?" he asked.

HEADLINE: AIRLINE DEAL: THE OVERVIEW;
Some Big Airports in Northeast Face Changes if Merger Occurs

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN and DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The world's largest airline, United, plans to announce today that it will acquire the biggest carrier in the Northeast, US Airways, for $4.3 billion in cash, creating a carrier with by far the largest share of passengers from Boston to New York to Washington.
If the acquisition is approved by shareholders and government regulators, United will carry almost 500,000 passengers a day, have hubs in seven American cities from Baltimore to San Francisco, and employ 145,000 people. The acquisition represents the first merger of two large American airlines since a wave of consolidation in the 1980's, and analysts said United's new strength would force other airlines to consider deals as well. 
 The UAL Corporation, the parent of United, said the combination would allow millions of travelers in the Northeast -- long the company's weak spot in the United States -- to tap into its vast network of flights to the Midwest and West Coast and, on partner airlines, to Europe and Asia. The company also pledged not to raise fares on some domestic routes for at least two years except for price increases needed to cover inflation and higher fuel costs.
In addition, UAL said it would shed many of US Airways' routes at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington and sell them to Robert L. Johnson, a member of the US Airways board and the founder of Black Entertainment Television. Mr. Johnson plans to operate a new airline with those planes, employees and routes.
The step, which will not include the lucrative shuttle service between Washington, New York and Boston, is intended to satisfy regulators who might become concerned about market concentration in the Washington area, where United is the largest carrier at Washington Dulles International Airport and US Airways is in a similar position at Reagan Airport.
Even after selling some routes to Mr. Johnson, United would dominate many markets in the East, from Charlotte, N.C. -- where US Airways has a hub -- to Boston. At Dulles, one of the nation's fastest-growing airports, United would fly about 62 percent of all passengers, according to 1999 airline traffic data published by Aviation Daily, an industry newsletter. At La Guardia Airport, United would jump over Delta to become the largest carrier with a 32 percent market share. In Baltimore, it would surpass Southwest and fly more than a third of travelers.
United agreed to pay $60 a share for US Airways, a rich premium over the $25.9375 that the stock closed at yesterday. United will not lay off any of its new employees, the company said, and will instead profit from the deal by winning more of the coast-to-coast and overseas business of the passengers who now fly US Airways.
The merger would complete a flirtation that continued on and off in the mid-1990's, much of it overseen by Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of US Airways, who was United's chief executive in the early 1990's. United executives have long hoped to gain a better foothold in the East, the busiest region in the United States. United backed away from a deal in 1995 after its powerful pilots' union expressed concerns about combining seniority lists.
Executives involved in the negotiations said objections from UAL's pilots might prove difficult again.
The pilots union, which is represented on UAL's board, is likely to announce today that it opposes the transaction.
"The pilots will not be fully on board," one executive said. "Integration of seniority lists is a particularly difficult issue for the unions, and the issue exists now, as it did in 1995."
UAL employees, which own 55 percent of the company, have three representatives on its board, two of which are representatives from the pilots' and machinists' unions. According to the corporate bylaws, approval of this sort of transaction is required from at least one of the two union representatives.
US Airways, the sixth-largest airline in the United States, has struggled in recent years even as the industry has enjoyed its most profitable years ever. With maintenance, labor and computer-related difficulties, the carrier has reported three straight quarterly losses. Airline analysts expect it to return to profitability this year.
Since January 1999, its stock has fallen to its current level from $62.25, leaving the company vulnerable to a takeover.
As a hodgepodge of the original airline and a group of companies it acquired in the 1980's, including Allegheny Air Lines and Piedmont Airlines, US Airways suffers from high costs that come with different fleets and complicated work rules.
US Airways also flies relatively short routes in the crowded Eastern corridor, where flights are often late and planes spend more time waiting on runways than they do elsewhere in the country. And in recent years it began to face more competition from Southwest Airlines, the profitable low-cost carrier that has started flying out of Baltimore, Providence, R.I., and other northeastern cities, driving down many fares.
United's executives now face the difficult task of merging US Airways' fleet and its 45,000-person work force with its own at the same time that is in the midst of increasingly contentious labor talks with its pilots' and machinists' unions. In 1995, United became the nation's largest company in which the employees owned a majority stake after the pilots and machinists agreed to concessions in exchange for stock. That agreement expires this year, and US Airways employees are not expected to receive shares as part of the merger
Wall Street analysts said they expected both investors and regulators to approve it. Other deals could then follow, the analysts said.
"The moral to the story is that the dance commences," Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said. "This is the beginning of consolidation in the United States and around the world. It won't stop here."
The biggest American airlines have already paired up in alliances over the last three years, agreeing to combine their frequent-flier programs and, in the case of Continental and Northwest, sell seats on each others' flights. Northwest owns a stake in Continental as part of their agreement, but the two continue to operate separately.
The rationale behind the agreements is similar to United's interest in US Airways: the carriers want to be able to feed passengers from anywhere on to their more lucrative, long-haul flights.
The merger would effectively end the frequent-flier partnership between US Airways and American Airlines because United and American, the world's two largest airlines by revenue, would have little incentive to be partners. It also calls into question United's and Delta's frequent-flier alliance, which United signed largely to gain access to Delta's many passengers on the East Coast. If the US Airways acquisition becomes final, United and Delta will become much more direct rivals.
The deal will also complicate United's long effort to improve its credit to "investment grade" and then be able to decrease the cost it pays to borrow money. One of the two largest credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's, still ranks United just below investment grade. Now, by acquiring US Airways, United is taking on $7.3 billion of the carrier's debt and buying an airline with a credit rating that has dropped significantly since 1990.
"Among the large airlines, they're the weakest other than T.W.A.," said Philip Baggaley, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
American and Delta, the two biggest airlines after United, both have a stronger credit rating already, Mr. Baggaley said.
A representative of the companies offered news of the merger yesterday to The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, on the condition that reporters not post it on the Internet until after midnight or speak to outsiders about the pending deal.
Early yesterday evening, The Financial Times of London reported the merger on its Web site, citing sources in Chicago, where United has its headquarters. That story quickly led to television and news service reports.

HEADLINE: Hecklers, and Guides Too, Confuse Tour Bus Riders

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

 BODY:
The hecklers stepped up to the curb along Eighth Avenue yesterday as a distinctive red double-decker bus from New York Apple Tours rolled past.
"Killers! Killers!" yelled a neatly dressed man in a black T-shirt and black leather jacket, standing on the corner of 58th Street. 
 "You know this finger?" bellowed back the tour guide in his distinctive yellow sweatshirt, making an obscene gesture with his right hand from atop the bus.
Minutes earlier, at 47th Street, about two blocks from where a similar Apple Tours bus driven by a man without the proper license had struck and killed a man on Monday, another pedestrian also accosted the bus.
"They killed a neighbor!" he yelled. "Ask to see his driver's license. It should be posted. Make sure he has a license!"
"Get a job!" an Apple Tours employee retorted.
The dozen or so tourists on board looked somewhat bewildered, unsure why their bus was attracting such ire. Things on the bus were also a little confusing. First a guide said the bus was headed downtown, to Battery Park and the Statue of Liberty ferry. Then a new guide got on, and after the bus was moving announced it was going uptown, through Harlem. Then it went downtown.
The tours, which depart every 20 minutes, offer a singular -- not to say skewed -- view of the city to riders who spend a minimum of $26 per tour and are pressed to spend $40 for the two-day version the minute they step forward.
The guide's presentation was heavy on things like celebrity residents, expensive stores and famous corporate headquarters, along with a light smattering of history.
At Grand Army Plaza, for example, the tour guide pointed out that the statue depicting General Sherman was covered in 22-karat gold. Those who did not know that it was Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, the Union general, were out of luck. Riders did learn, though, that the singer Janet Jackson has an apartment on the same street and that the Indian restaurant Nirvana atop one building has really good views of Central Park.
At Rockefeller Center, the guide said all the flags around the skating rink represented the members of the United Nations. They are, in fact, the flags of the 50 states.
The guide even worked in opinions about politics. He said New York's sharp drop in crime had more to do with things like panhandlers getting jobs in the strong economy than with anything Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had done. The exception was the mayor's relationship with the police, he said, adding, "If you watched the news, you would hear about many cases of police brutality."
It took about two hours for the bus to wend its way from Times Square to Battery Park, by which time the heavy exposure to exhaust made for red eyes and a burning throat. The tourists swiveled their heads from side to side but rarely spoke.
Some said they really liked the tours, becauseit was convenient to jump on and off all day. Riders can spend 30 minutes at Rockefeller Center, for example, and then hop on the next bus that comes along for the Empire State Building or the World Trade Center, among other stops.
"You can cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time," said Frank Glasson, a musician from San Diego visiting with his wife, Robyn. It was hit and miss with the guides, though. The Glassons said they had one who stayed silent for long periods and spoke in impenetrable English.

HEADLINE: THE CHINA TRADE WRANGLE;
Four Voices From the Debate in the House on the Trade Bill

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the House debate today on the trade bill that would grant permanent normal trading relations with Beijing, as transcribed by The New York Times.
 
NANCY PELOSI, DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA -- We have been told over the last decade that human rights in China would improve if we had unconditional trade benefits for China. Not so. More people are imprisoned for their beliefs in China today than at any time since the Cultural Revolution. 
 We were told that unconditional trade benefits for China would stop China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to rogue states. Again, not so. Not only does China continue to proliferate chemical, biological and nuclear technology and the delivery systems for them to rogue states, they have added Libya as one of their customers as recently as this March 2000.
But even if we could ignore the serious repression and the dangerous proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, there is serious reason to reject this proposal on the basis of trade alone. China has never honored any of its trade agreements with the United States, including its agreements for market access over the last 20 years -- over and over again -- agreements on stopping the violation of intellectual property and the piracy continues and stopping prison labor exports from coming into the United States. Indeed, the International Trade Commission said that in their own analysis projecting the China deal will result in the loss of 872,000 American jobs over the next decade.
 
JIM KOLBE, REPUBLICAN OF ARIZONA -- I believe as important as the issues about trade and about human rights and economic advantages are, this issue is not really about China. It's about America. . . . International trade has connected our world's economies as never before, has made our people more dependent upon each other. This interconnectedness gives every nation a giant incentive to keep the peace. It's worked in the past. Just look at how far we've come. And it will work in the future, if the United States continues to lead.
America cannot maintain its leadership role by refusing to trade with the world's largest economy. P.N.T.R. is in our economic self-interest. There can be no doubt about that. But it is also vital for peace and freedom throughout the world. If we choose to abdicate our leadership, consequences are dire. Will America continue to show, through the power of its example, that representative government and freed trade lead to stability, peace and prosperity?
 
FRANK R. WOLF, REPUBLICAN OF VIRGINIA -- I'm a free-trader. I voted for Nafta. I was one of the 30 Republicans that voted to bomb Kosovo. So I'm kind of tired of the argument with regard to isolationist. What about the eight Catholic bishops? And now we know from the C.I.A. briefing there are more. What about the 50 evangelical pastors that are in jail? What about the over 400 Buddhist monks and nuns that have been persecuted and are suffering in that dirty jail in Lhasa? . . .What about the missiles directed against the United States? . . . If this Congress, a Republican Congress, votes to give M.F.N., we will be on the wrong side of the American people and we will be on the wrong side of history.
 
SANDER M. LEVIN, DEMOCRAT OF MICHIGAN -- China's integration into the world trading system inevitably presents both opportunities and challenges. . . . But I want to focus right now on the challenges, because there are challenges as well as opportunities. One of them is the issue of compliance. There is weak rule of law today in China. How are we going to make sure that China complies with its agreements? Mr. Doug Bereuter Republican of Nebraska and I have put together legislation to address this challenge, as well as others. And there are some meaningful compliance provisions in our proposal. One relates to the U.S.T.R. review, an annual review within our own ranks. . . . The second one relates to the potential surges in products from China. . . . The third relates to human rights, including international core labor standards in the rule of law. First of all, in the legislation that Mr. Bereuter and I have proposed and will be before us tomorrow, what we do is to set up a task force, and a meaningful one, to pull together the agencies of the U.S. government to work with Customs to make sure that our law on forced imprisoned labor products from China, that that law is implemented. And then the commission that we have proposed, high-level, at the executive Congressional level, full time, fully staffed, patterned after the Helsinki Commission . . .
Rejecting P.N.T.R. now that it's been combined with the proposals in our legislation would likely be a catalyst not for change, but for chaos in the relationships between the U.S. and China.
