HEADLINE: Beautiful Minds | Extra Credit

BYLINE: KATHRYN BRANCH and EDWARD BARSAMIAN


HIGHLIGHT: Model students take fall's collegiate classics from runway to reality.

 BODY:
Meet the model students - the hard-working women wearing the best of fall's back-to-school-inspired looks in the photographer Angelo Pennetta's portfolio "Beautiful Minds." Here, they tell T about life on campus, hitting the sales racks versus the stacks, and how to prep for everything from costume parties to pop quizzes. The first of a two-part series.
Jane Randall
On ''America's Next Top Model'' often relegates the aspiring mannequin to the dustbin of catalogs. But Randall, 20, is hardly a typical contestant: while filming the show, she did the unthinkable and read a book! Soon after, the Princeton history major was informed that outside reading was forbidden by the show's producers. Now that she's a real model, she ''always keeps a book'' with her when going to castings. Better to follow the work of her favorite professor, Anthony Grafton, a renaissance expert.
THE GENERAL STORE
Princeton's University Store, or U-store as we call it, is absolutely cool and has everything from computer software to groceries to Clinique makeup. They also sell the Vera Bradley accessories that all the girls use to carry their student ID's.
CAMPUS REQUIREMENT
A sense of humor - Princeton prides itself on quirky traditions and loyal alumni.
GO TIGERS!
I played on the varsity women's lacrosse team, and I'm a member of the University Cottage Club.
DINE AND DASH
I eat most of my meals at Cottage, but the egg sandwiches at Olive's are the best I've ever had.
SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS
The fall and spring lawn parties bring the best bands - last year B.O.B and Wiz performed, but my favorite was seeing the Spin Doctors.
Sonia Dara
At age 21, Dara recently interned for Tyra Banks, whose trailblazing strides for minority models she is already emulating. She is the first model of South Asian descent to be in Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue, and like banks she hopes one day to shift from model to mogul. ''i really enjoyed the exposure to the business side of fashion,'' says the third year economics major at Harvard of her internship. ''not to mention learning the ropes from someone that i really look up to.''
WHERE TO SHOP.COM
When there's time, I shop on Newbury Street, but more often I resort to ASOS and Gilt. They deliver to my dorm! Here's a tip: the vintage stores between Harvard and M.I.T. are good, but Oona's on Massachusetts Avenue is the best for costume parties.
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
I do tutoring in Boston at the Mission Hill After School Program, and I've been involved in the Undergraduate Council, too.
TEAM SPIRIT
The biggest football event of the year is the Harvard-Yale game in November. Crew is also popular, and people get really into the Head of the Charles, a regatta on the Charles River.
SCHOOL UNIFORM
It seems to me that the New England look includes at least one of the following: a Barbour jacket, Tory Burch flats, Hunter boots or a Longchamp bag.
MIDNIGHT SNACK
Nothing beats Pinocchio's Pizza, which has the best Sicilian slice ever, and Zoe's is great for breakfast food cravings at random hours.
Cameron Russell
By her third day as a professional model, Russell booked jobs for Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs. Now a 24-year-old economics and political science major at Columbia University, she quickly realized that sexed-up models can sell more than just clothing. Inspired by the Benetton aids awareness ads of the 1990s, Russell recruited fellow models Crystal Renn and Heidi Mount to disrobe with her for a film against global warming (get it? Cool your bodies, cool the planet) that she made in 2009 for 350.org.
BOOKWORM
Westsider Books on Broadway and 81st Street has a sweet little selection, but of course it's hard to beat the Strand.
PAPER CHASER
I love wandering the stacks in Butler Library, but the computer lounge in Havemeyer Hall lets you print without limits!
DAILY DOSE
A big cup of green tea from Oren's Daily Roast.
TRANSIT TALK
You'd be crazy to drive a car here - the subway is so much faster. But when the weather is nice, I'll bike up the West Side Highway to class.
CAMERON SAYS
Have fun, do all the reading and learn how to work in groups.

HEADLINE: 'The Descendants,' With George Clooney, Will Close New York Film Festival

BYLINE: DAVE ITZKOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Directed by Alexander Payne ("Sideways," "Election"), "The Descendants" stars Mr. Clooney as the heir of a Hawaiian land-owning family who learns to be a better father to his daughters. 

 BODY:
"The Descendants,"Alexander Payne's first feature since his 2004 film "Sideways," will be the closing night selection of the New York Film Festival, the Film Society of Lincoln Center announced on Wednesday along with the roster of 27 films that will be presented in the festival's main slate.
Adapted from the Kaui Hart Hemmings novel, "The Descendants" tells the story of Matt King, a character played by George Clooney, who is the heir of a land-owning family in Hawaii who must learn to parent his two daughters after his wife is injured in a boating accident. The film, whose cast also includes Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller as King's daughters, will be presented at the festival on Oct. 16 at Alice Tully Hall, and is scheduled for theatrical release on Nov. 23.
Among the films on the festival's main slate are Abel Ferrara's "4:44: Last Day on Earth," starring Willem Dafoe and Shanyn Leigh as a couple preparing for a possible apocalypse; the Martin Scorsese documentary "George Harrison: Living in the Material World"; Sean Durkin's debut feature, "Martha Marcy May Marlene," starring Elizabeth Olsen; Lars von Trier's "Melancholia"; the Wim Wenders 3-D film "Pina," a tribute to the choreographer Pina Bausch and her Tanztheater Wuppertal; Steve McQueen's "Shame"; and "This Is Not a Film," by the Iranian directors Jafar Panahi and Mojtaba Mirtahmasb.
Descriptions of all the features being presented at the New York Film Festival and provided by the Film Society of Lincoln Center appear below. 
4:44: LAST DAY ON EARTH
Abel Ferrara, 2011, USA, 82min
How would we spend our final hours on Earth? And what does how we choose to die say about how we have chosen to live? In the hands of the inimitable Abel Ferrara (Go Go Tales, NYFF '07), this thought experiment takes on a visceral immediacy. With the planet on the verge of extinction, a New York couple (Willem Dafoe and Shanyn Leigh) cycle through moments of anxiety, ecstacy, and torpor. As they sink into the havens of sex and art, and Skype last goodbyes in a Lower East Side apartment filled with screens bearing tidings of doom and salvation, the film becomes one of Ferrara's most potent and intimate expressions of spiritual crisis. An apocalyptic trance film, 4:44 is also a mournful valentine to Ferrara's beloved New York: the director's first fiction feature to be filmed entirely in the city in over a decade, and coming 10 years after the September 11 attacks, a haunting vision of doom in the lower Manhattan skyline.
THE ARTIST
Michel Hazanavicius, 2011, France, 90min
An honest-to-goodness black-and-white silent picture made by modern French filmmakers in Hollywood, USA, "The Artist" is a spirited, hilarious and moving delight. A sensation in Cannes, Michel Hazanavicius' playful love letter to the movies' early days spins on a variation on an "A Star Is Born"-like relationship between a dashing Douglas Fairbanks-style star (Jean Dujardin, who won the best actor prize in Cannes) whose career wanes with the coming of sound and a dazzling young actress (Berenice Bejo) whose popularity skyrockets at the same time. Meticulously made in the 1.33 aspect ratio with intertitles and a superb score, "The Artist" has great fun with silent film conventions just as it rigorously adheres to them, turning its abundant love for the look and ethos of the 1920s into a treat that will be warmly embraced by movie lovers of every persuasion. With James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller and John Goodman as a definitive cigar-chomping studio boss.
CARNAGE
Roman Polanski, 2011, France/Germany/Poland
Summoning up the sinister from beneath the veneer of normalcy has always been Roman Polanski's specialty, so it's no surprise that the great director does such a smashing job of putting Yasmina Reza's 2009 Tony-winning play "God of Carnage" on the screen. With the expert cast of Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christopher Waltz and John C. Reilly, Reza's explosively comic X-ray of the anger and venality lying just under the surface of the outwardly civilized behavior of two New York City couples has been fully realized. Returning to the New York Film Festival with a feature for the first time since he presented his debut work, Knife in the Water, at the very first festival in 1963, Polanski pries open the true nature of these characters in something of a companion piece to his previous New York-set film, "Rosemary's Baby." Although it was filmed in Paris, the Brooklyn locale is as convincingly rendered as are the alternately uproarious and devastating revelations of human nature.
CORPO CELESTE
Alice Rohrwacher, 2011, Italy/Switzerland/France, 100min
"Seeing the Spirit is like wearing really cool sunglasses," according to the instructor of 13-year old Marta's (Yle Vianello) catechism class. Such observations introduce Marta to the religious climate in the small seaside Calabrian town to which she, her mother and older sister have just moved from Switzerland. Marta is sent to the local church to prepare for her Catholic confirmation and (hopefully) make some new friends. But the religion she finds there is mainly strange: the way it dominates people's lives is unlike anything she's ever experienced. Alice Rohrwacher's extraordinarily impressive debut feature chronicles Martha's private duel with the Church, carried out under the shadow of the physical changes coursing through her. Rohrwacher is not interested in pointing out heroes and villains, but instead in offering a perceptive look at how the once all-powerful Church has dealt with its waning influence.
A DANGEROUS METHOD
David Cronenberg, 2011, France/Ireland/UK/Germany/Canada, 99min
David Cronenberg, a filmmaker with a peerless grasp on the mysteries of the mind and the body, turns his attention to a seminal chapter in the founding of psychoanalysis. Adapted from Christopher Hampton's play A Talking Cure, A Dangerous Method charts the relationship between Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and his protege turned dissenter Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender), as it was shaped by the case of Sabine Spielrein (Keira Knightley), a young Russian Jewish patient of Jung's. Cronenberg brilliantly dramatizes not just the rivalry and rupture between two pioneers who defined a field but also the birth of their groundbreaking theories of the unconscious and the forces of Eros and Thanatos. Featuring an electrifying trio of lead actors, who turn near-mythic figures into flesh and blood, this is a film of tremendous vigor and ambition, a historical drama that brings ideas to life.
THE DESCENDANTS
Alexander Payne, 2011, USA, 115min
In his first film since the Oscar-winning Sideways, writer-director Alexander Payne once again proves himself a master of the kind of smart, sharp, deeply felt comedy that was once the hallmark of Billy Wilder and Jean Renoir. Based on the bestselling novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, The Descendants stars George Clooney as Matt King, the heir of a prominent Hawaiian land-owning family whose life is turned upside-down when his wife is critically injured in a boating accident. Accustomed to being "the back-up parent," King suddenly finds himself center stage in the lives of his two young daughters (excellent newcomers Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller), while at the same time being forced to decide the fate of a vast plot of unspoiled land his family has owned since the 1860s. Rooted in Clooney's beautifully understated performance, Payne's film is an uncommonly perceptive portrait of marriage, family and community, suffused with humor and tragedy and wrapped in a warm human glow. A Fox Searchlight release.
FOOTNOTE
Joseph Cedar, 2011, Israel, 106min
Thanks to a clerical error, Eliezer Shkolnik, a respected if little-known Talmudic scholar, is informed that he's won the coveted Israel Prize; in truth, the prize was meant for his son, Uziel, a much more flamboyant, widely-read Talmudist. The authorities ask Uziel to help them rectify the situation, but Uziel argues the case for his father's deserving the honor; meanwhile, Eliezer plans to use the occasion as an opportunity to intellectually take down his son and the whole generation of a la mode Talmudists. Winner of the prize for Best Screenplay at Cannes, New York born-and-trained Israeli filmmaker Joseph Cedar has here created the wryest of Jewish comedies, an emotional competition that pits father against son, built around the understanding of sacred texts. Rarely has the weight of a culture's intellectual past been depicted so forecefully, nor shown to be as vibrant. A Sony Pictures Classic release.
GEORGE HARRISON: LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD
Martin Scorsese, 2011, USA, 208min
Rich in mesmerizing archival footage, Martin Scorsese's expansive documentary on the Beatles' lead guitarist-and of one of the greatest musicians of the 1960s and '70s-traces in detail all aspects of Harrison's professional and personal life. Friends (Eric Clapton, Eric Idle), family (wives Patti Boyd and Olivia Harrison), and band mates (Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr) reflect on Harrison's mid-'60s embrace of Indian mysticism and music, which forever changed the sound of the Fab Four. Harrison's spirituality also defines his masterful solo work, especially the 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass, produced by Phil Spector, another subject interviewed in depth. Until his untimely death in 2001, Harrison remained fiercely committed to his music and other passions (including film producing), earning the admiration of all who were lucky enough to work with him.
GOODBYE FIRST LOVE
Mia Hansen-Løve, 2011, France/Germany, 108min
In her exceptional third feature, writer-director Mia Hansen-Løve (The Father of My Children, ND/NF 2010) shows once again her talent for capturing the agony and the ecstasy of adolescence. Besotted teenagers Sullivan (Sebastian Urzendowsky) and Camille (Lola Creton) struggle, as all couples must, with a painful push-pull dynamic, heightened by the young man's decision to leave Paris and travel through South America. Over the course of eight years, we watch Camille, initially devastated by her boyfriend's departure, emerge with new passions, intellectual and otherwise. Touchingly illuminating the indelible imprint that first romance leaves, Hansen-Løve's film also explores the hard-won satisfaction of leaving the past behind. A Sundance Selects release.
THE KID WITH A BIKE
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, 2011, Belgium/France, 87min
Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival, the latest film by Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne centers on Cyril, a restless 11-year-old boy (terrific newcomer Thomas Doret) placed in a children's home after being abandoned by his father. Unwilling to face the fact that parents are imperfect people, Cyril runs away to his former apartment block in search of both dad and his abandoned bicycle. Instead, he meets Samantha (the excellent Cecile de France), a kind hairdresser who helps to retrieve his bike and eventually agrees to become his weekend guardian. But literally and figuratively, Cyril isn't out of the woods just yet. Shooting once more in the Belgian seaport town of Seraing, the Dardennes have created another poetic, universally resonant drama about parents, children and moral responsibility. A Sundance Selects release.
LE HAVRE
Aki Kaurismaki, 2011, Finland/France/Germany, 103min
The latest deadpan treat from Aki Kaurismaki (The Man Without a Past, NYFF '02) was inspired, the director has said, by his desire to have been born a generation earlier, so that he could have witnessed the Resistance during World War II. Thus Le Havre abounds with sly references to classic Resistance dramas from Port of Shadows to Casablanca as it tells the whimsical tale of Marcel Marx (Andre Wilms), a noted Parisian author now living in self-imposed exile in the titular port city. Dividing most of his time between his neighborhood bar and caring for his bedridden wife (longtime Kaurismaki muse Kati Outinen), Marcel finds himself alive with a new sense of purpose when he comes to the aid of a young African on the run from immigration police and trying to reunite with his mother in London. Beautifully shot in Kaurismaki's signature shades of muted blue, brown and green, with scene-stealing appearances by French New Wave icon Jean-Pierre Leaud and a dog named Laika, Le Havre is a gentle yet profound comedy of friendship, random acts of kindness and small acts of revolution. A Janus Films release.
THE LONELIEST PLANET
Julia Loktev, 2011, USA/Germany, 113min
This staggeringly acute examination of the fissures that develop between couples from Julia Loktev (Day Night Day Night, ND/NF 2007) proves that even the most wide-open spaces can feel suffocating during romantic discord. Nica (Hani Furstenberg) and Alex (Gael Garcia Bernal), a few months away from their wedding, take a hiking trip in the Caucasus in Georgia, led by tour guide Dato (Bidzina Gujabidze). Nica and Alex appear to be completely in-sync partners, wildly attracted to each other and sharing the same interests. But a split-second decision by Alex proves horrifying to Nica and sets off impenetrable, stony silences. In a film in which so much is communicated nonverbally, Furstenberg and Bernal astoundingly uncover the toxic, erosive effects of disappointment and resentment.
MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE
Sean Durkin, 2011, USA, 101min
Sean Durkin's haunting first feature, about a young woman's halting attempts to undo the psychic terror of the cult she's just escaped, heralds the arrival of a remarkable new talent. Fleeing a Manson-like Catskills compound at dawn, Martha (Elizabeth Olsen, leading an excellent cast) reconnects with her older sister, Lucy (Sarah Paulson), a bourgeois New Yorker who takes in her sibling at the Connecticut country house she shares with her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy). Lucy remains unaware of exactly what happened to Martha over the past few years-details that Durkin slowly but powerfully unveils in uncanny, disorienting flashbacks. The film's gorgeous, painterly compositions have the chilling effect of suggesting that even our worst nightmares still retain a seductive allure. A Fox Searchlight release.
MELANCHOLIA
Lars von Trier, 2011, Denmark/Sweden/France/Germany/Italy, 135min
The end of the world-and the collapse of the spirit-has never been depicted as beautifully and wrenchingly as in Melancholia, the latest provocation from Lars von Trier (Antichrist, NYFF '09). The title refers both to a destructive planet "that has been hiding behind the sun" and the crippling depression of new bride Justine (a revelatory Kirsten Dunst, rightful winner of the Best Actress award at Cannes this year), whose mental illness is so severe that she drives away her groom during their disastrous wedding reception. As the extinction of the planet looms ever larger, Justine is desperately tended to by her sister, Claire (an equally magnificent Charlotte Gainsbourg), herself gripped by anxiety over the impending doomsday. Melancholia's premise may be science fiction, but the feelings of despair it plumbs are the most heart-felt human drama. A Magnolia Pictures release.
MISS BALA
Gerardo Naranjo, 2011, Mexico, 113min
One of the most exciting young talents around, the Mexican director Gerardo Naranjo (I'm Gonna Explode, NYFF '08) approaches the hot-button topic of drug violence through the perspective of an unlikely, unwitting heroine: a Tijuana beauty pageant contestant (Stephanie Sigman) who stumbles into the path of ruthless cartel operatives and corrupt officials. Although inspired by a true story, Miss Bala avoids docudrama cliches and tabloid sensationalism, and instead evokes the pervasive climate of fear and confusion that has enveloped daily life in some increasingly lawless pockets of northern Mexico. Using long takes and fluid, precise camera work, Naranjo fashions a highly original thriller: an anguished and harrowing mood piece with an undertow of bleakly absurdist humor and moments of heart-stopping action.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN
Simon Curtis, 2011, UK
One of the most exciting actresses working today, Michelle Williams accomplishes the near-impossible-portraying Marilyn Monroe as an actual person, not just an easily caricatured icon-in this charming bio-pic centering around the production of Laurence Olivier's film The Prince and the Showgirl. Based on two memoirs by Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), who worked as an assistant on Olivier's film, My Week With Marilyn depicts Monroe's numerous clashes with her imperious, classically trained director (played with great relish by Kenneth Branagh), maddened by his star's method acting and her ever-present drama coach, Paula Strasberg (Zoe Wanamaker). Williams captures not only Monroe's notorious fragility, both on-screen and off-, but also her magical, unclassifiable charisma. A Weinstein Company release.
ONCE UPON A TIME IN ANATOLIA
Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2011, Turkey, 150min
Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes, Nuri Bilge Ceylan's latest begins as a small caravan of cars snakes its way through the nocturnal countryside, looking for where a murdered man was buried. Yet every time the confessed killer points out the grave, the gravediggers come up empty; much of the landscape looks alike, it's dark out, and anyway the killer claims he was drunk. As the increasingly frustrating investigation wears on, far more is revealed than where the body is buried; through quick looks, furtive gestures and offhand bits of dialogue, Ceylan (Climates, NYFF 2006) reveals in this seemingly pacific Turkish outback a festering world of jealousies and resentments, as the story behind the murder gradually emerges. Impeccably photographed (by Gokhan Tiryaki) and with a stand-out performance by Taner Birsel as a police inspector, this is Ceylan's most impressive film yet.
PINA
Wim Wenders, 2011, Germany/France/UK, 106min
Here revolutionizing the dance film just as he did the music documentary in Buena Vista Social Club, Wim Wenders began planning this project with legendary choreographer Pina Bausch in the months before her untimely death, selecting the pieces to be filmed and discussing the filmmaking strategy. Impressed by recent innovations in 3D, Wenders decided to experiment with the format for this tribute to Bausch and her Tanztheater Wuppertal; the result sets the standard against which all future uses of 3D to record performance will be measured. Not only are the beauty and sheer exhilaration of the dances and dancers powerfully rendered, but the film also captures the sense of the world that Bausch so brilliantly expressed in all her pieces. Longtime members of the Tanztheater recreate many of their original roles in such seminal works as "Cafe Muller," "Le Sacred du Printemps," and "Kontakthof." A Sundance Selects release.
PLAY
Ruben Ostlund, 2011, Sweden/Rance/Denmark, 124min
A deliberately provoked racial incident, based on numerous similar real-life transgressions, is played for all it's worth in "Play." Swedish writer-director Ruben Ostlund has developed mesmerizing visual strategies based on long takes and fixed camera positions to relate a disturbing tale of how five savvy African immigrant boys in Gothenberg take advantage of the liberal guilt and placating temperament of three local kids to rob them and take them for a ride to unknown destinations. Social, racial and political credos are twisted, pulled inside out and stood on their head by this bracing and confronting work, which will challenge the assumptions of many a viewer. Dazzlingly shot on the new Red 4K camera, "Play" is a considerable achievement both formally and dramatically that poses more questions than it answers as it lays bare attitudes lurking beneath the surface tranquility of Scandinavian life-a peacefulness that, as we have seen of late, can sometimes be tragically shattered.
POLICEMAN
Nadav Lapid, 2011, Israel/France, 100min
A boldly conceived drama pivoting on the initially unrelated activities of an elite anti-terrorist police unit and some wealthy young anarchists, "Policeman" is a striking first feature from writer-director Nadav Lapid. Provocatively timely in light of recent unrest tied to social and economic inequities in Israel, this is a powerfully physical film in its depiction of the muscular, borderline sensual way the macho cops relate to one another, as well as for the emphatic style with which the opposing societal forces are contrasted and finally pitted against one another. Although the youthful revolutionaries come off as petulant and spoiled, their point about the growing gap between the Israeli haves and have-nots cannot be ignored, even by the policemen sent on a rare mission to engage fellow countrymen rather than Palestinians. A winner of three prizes at the Jerusalem Film Festival and a special jury prize at Locarno.
A SEPARATION
Asghar Farhadi, 2011, Iran, 123min
A critical and audience favorite at this year's Berlin Film Festival, where it won the Golden Bear as well as acting prizes for all four lead performers, A Separation is an Iranian Rashomon of searing family drama that turns into an unexpectedly gripping legal thriller. The film, directed by Asghar Farhadi, begins with married couple Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moadi) obtaining coveted visas to leave Iran for the United States, where Simin hopes to offer a better future to their 11-year-old daughter. But Nader doesn't feel comfortable abandoning his elderly, Alzheimer's-stricken father, and so the couple embark on a trial separation. To help care for the old man, Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a pregnant, deeply religious woman who takes the job unbeknownst to her husband (Shahab Hosseini), an out-of-work cobbler. Almost immediately there are complications, culminating in a sudden burst of violence that constantly challenges our own perceptions of who (if anyone) is to blame and what really happened. A Sony Pictures Classics release.
SHAME
Steve McQueen, 2011, UK, 99min
In his much-anticipated encore to his superb first feature, "Hunger," British artist Steve McQueen reunites with the extraordinary Michael Fassbender in the ferociously sexual drama "Shame." An explosive portrait of a sex addict walking a tightrope between presentable respectability and the wild side, this incendiary drama captures the anger and the ecstasy of its anti-hero's incessant drive for conquest in contemporary New York, where any woman he meets he believes is ripe for the taking. Madly attractive but with cruelly cold eyes, this compulsive Casanova finds his style cramped by the abrupt arrival of his unstable sister (Cary Mulligan), whose insecurities crack open issues of his own. Daring, stylistically brilliant and erotically charged, McQueen's heady, beautiful and disturbing film seems as determined to leave the viewer unsettled as it will surely serve to further propel Fassbender into the front ranks of contemporary screen actors.
SLEEPING SICKNESS
Ulrich Kohler, 2011, Germany/France/Netherlands, 91min
This remarkably assured third feature by the young German director Ulrich Kohler-winner of Best Director at this year's Berlin Film Festival-transports us to Cameroon, where German doctor Ebbo (Pierre Bokma) and his wife have spent two decades combating an epidemic of sleeping sickness in the local villages. Soon, they will return to Europe and to lives long ago put on hold, and this has created a crisis for Ebbo, who, like Joseph Conrad's Kurtz, has spent too much time up river to ever come back down. Meanwhile, a young black doctor-a Frenchman born to Congolese parents-travels to Africa to evaluate the efficiency of Ebbo's program. But when he arrives, nothing goes according to plan, and despite his heritage, he feels very much a stranger in a strange land. Finally, the two subjects of this haunting meditation on Africa's past and future dovetail-effortlessly, seamlessly-and the cumulative impact is stunning.
THE SKIN I LIVE IN
Pedro Almodovar, 2011, Spain, 113min
At "The Cinema Inside Me" program at the 2009 NYFF, Pedro Almodovar surprised many when he spoke of his great love for American horror and science fiction films-a clue, it turns out, to what he was then just planning. With his new film, Almodovar ventures headlong into those very genres. Dr. Robert Ledgard (a welcome return for Antonio Banderas) is a world famous plastic surgeon who argues for the development of new, tougher human skin; unbeknownst to others, Dr. Ledgard has been trying to put his theory into practice, keeping a young woman, Vera (Elena Anaya), imprisoned in his mansion while subjecting her to an increasingly bizarre regime of treatments. Fascinated by the thin layer of appearance that stands between our perception of someone and that person's inner essence, Almodovar here addresses that continuing theme in his work in a bold, unsettling exploration of identity. A Sony Pictures Classic release.
THE STUDENT
Santiago Mitre, 2011, Argentina, 110min
Politics is a game, a seduction, and a vicious cycle in Santiago Mitre's gripping, fine-tuned debut, the story of Roque (Esteban Lamothe), a university student who falls for a radicalized teacher and organizer (Romina Paula) and soon finds himself entangled with Buenos Aires campus activists, in a world as heated and byzantine as the one inhabited by the student revolutionaries of the mythic 1960s. Anchored by Lamothe's nuanced, charismatic performance, The Student complicates the classic bildungsroman narrative of education and disillusionment, emphasizing the endless adaptability-or malleability-of its protagonist. An urgent attempt to grapple with the legacy of Peronism in present-day Argentina, the film abounds with telling details and rich local color. But it's also a truly universal political thriller, one that illuminates the conspiratorial pleasure, the ruthless hustle, and the moral fog of politics as it is practiced.
THIS IS NOT A FILM
Jafar Panahi and Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, 2011, Iran, 75min
Accused of collusion against the Iranian regime and currently appealing a prison sentence and a ban from filmmaking, Jafar Panahi (a four-time NYFF veteran with films like Offside and Crimson Gold) collaborated with the documentarian Mojtaba Mirtahmasb on a remarkable day-in-the-life chronicle that, as with many great Iranian films, finds a rich middle ground between fiction and reality. Shot with a digital camera and an iPhone, the movie is almost entirely confined to the director's apartment, where he discusses his films and an unrealized script, while the outside world imposes itself through phone calls, television news, a few comic interruptions, and the sound of New Year's fireworks. Far more than the modest home movie it initially seems to be, This Is Not a Film is an act of courage and a statement of political and moral conviction: surprising, radical, and enormously moving.
THE TURIN HORSE
Bela Tarr and Agnes Hranitzky, 2011, Hungary/France/Germany/Switzerland/USA, 146min
After witnessing a carriage driver whipping his horse, the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche ran to the scene, threw his arms around the horse and then collapsed; he would spend the next, final ten years of his life in almost total silence. Focusing not on Nietzsche but on the driver and his family, Bela Tarr (Satantango, NYFF 1994) and his longtime collaborator Agnes Hranitzky, working from a screenplay by Tarr and novelist Laszlo Krasznhorkai, create a mesmerizing, provocative meditation on the unsettling connectedness of things, in which the resonance of actions and gestures continues long after their actual occurrence. Beautifully photographed (by Fred Kelemen) on the austere, unforgiving Hungarian plain lands, The Turin Horse challenges us to enter into a world just beyond the one we experience daily. Winner of the Silver Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival. A Cinema Guild release.

HEADLINE: A Deal to Get Cheaper and Safer Drugs

 BODY:
Federal regulators and the generic drug industry are putting the final touches on an agreement that would help speed the approval of generic drugs in this country and increase inspections at foreign plants that export generic drugs and drug ingredients to the United States. 
The agreement calls for generic drug manufacturers to collectively pay $299 million in annual fees (adjusted for inflation in succeeding years) under a program that would have to be approved by Congress. The fees would allow the Food and Drug Administration to hire more reviewers to speed up the processing of applications to market new generics and reduce a large current backlog. That would help lower health care costs by giving patients and doctors quicker access to inexpensive generics.
The money would also allow the F.D.A. to inspect foreign manufacturing plants that produce generic drugs or the ingredients for them every two years, the same rate at which American plants are inspected. At the current pace, government investigators estimated three years ago that it would take more than 13 years to inspect all foreign plants that export drugs or drug ingredients to this country, whether for brand-name or generic use. Many foreign plants have never been inspected.
Lawmakers ought to welcome this carefully negotiated agreement and quickly approve the fee legislation when it is introduced next year. It would lower consumer costs and increase consumer safety -- and industry would rightly foot much of the bill.

HEADLINE: Offering Funds, U.S. Agency Dreams of Sending Humans to Stars

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE

 BODY:
Alpha Centauri or bust.
The government agency that helped invent the Internet now wants to do the same for travel to the stars.
In what is perhaps the ultimate startup opportunity, Darpa, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, plans to award some lucky, ambitious and star-struck organization roughly $500,000 in seed money to begin studying what it would take -- organizationally, technically, sociologically and ethically -- to send humans to another star, a challenge of such magnitude that the study alone could take a hundred years.
The awarding of that grant, on Nov. 11 -- 11/11/11 -- is planned as the culmination of a yearlong Darpa-NASA effort called the 100-Year Starship Study, which started quietly last winter and will include a three-day public symposium in Orlando, Fla., on Sept. 30 on the whys and wherefores of interstellar travel. The agenda ranges far beyond rocket technology to include such topics as legal, social and economic considerations of interstellar migration, philosophical and religious concerns, where to go and -- perhaps most important -- how to inspire the public to support this very expensive vision. 
The Darpa plan has generated buzz as well as befuddlement in the labs, pubs, diners and Web sites that ring NASA centers both physically and virtually, where the dream of space travel has never died and where a few stubborn bands of scientists and engineers, fueled by science fiction dreams and prophecies, are designing spacecraft that could cross interstellar space, incubating a technology and preserving it for the day when it will be used.
''If you want to have a hobby, why can't it be designing an interstellar spacecraft?'' said Andreas Tziolas, who teaches at the University of Alaska and directs Project Icarus, a worldwide volunteer effort to design a spacecraft that could carry a scientific probe to a nearby star -- perhaps Alpha Centauri, 4.4 light-years from here -- in a trip that would take less than 100 years.
''This is what we do,'' said Louis Friedman, former executive director of the Planetary Society, in Pasadena, Calif., which bills itself as the world's largest public space organization.
Many scientists wonder if life, especially intelligent life, exists beyond Earth. Some day, the interstellar dreamers vow, the life out there will be us.
People like Dr. Tziolas say the technology already exists or will soon exist to send instruments and perhaps even people to nearby stars, although a human flight could cost hundred of trillions of dollars. The half-million dollars Darpa will award is not enough to build a starship or even to buy a modest office in which to imagine one -- but it is enough to start serious fund-raising and, perhaps to invite ridicule from critics of government spending.
An actual human launching is at least a couple of centuries away and, barring the invention of Star Trek-like warp drives, could take additional centuries to complete. Whoever goes on such a journey will not be coming back.
But there are plenty of reasons that humans will eventually summon the political will to make the trip, scientists say, if not for human restlessness that has taken us out of the caves and across the oceans, then to escape being wiped out when the killer asteroid appears or the Sun boils the oceans, which it will do in a couple of billion years.
Another lure could be the discovery of a habitable planet elsewhere, something that could happen in the next few years through the efforts of NASA's Kepler satellite and related astronomical efforts, according to Jill Tarter, an astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who has devoted her life to the search for extraterrestrials. ''This will get real when we have an Earth analogue as a destination,'' she said.
David Neyland, Darpa's director of tactical technology, is at pains to point out that the goal of his project is not an interstellar spacecraft, only a business plan for designing one. The search, he explained, is for an organization, presumably private, that can develop the interstellar vision without government help, carrying the load for the next 100 years, developing valuable technological offshoots the way investing in computer protocols enabled the Internet. (The time frame was inspired by Jules Verne, whose novel ''From the Earth to the Moon'' was published in 1865, 104 years before it came true.)
After this November, whoever it is will be on their own. ''We don't intend to carry it forward,'' Mr. Neyland added. ''Darpa hands the keys over to this entity, and we wish them well.''
Interstellar travel is a tall order. It would take Voyager 1, humanity's fastest artifact, now traveling 38,000 miles an hour relative to the Sun, more than 70,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri, if it were headed in that direction.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a group of physicists led by Theodore Taylor of General Atomics and Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study proposed propelling a ship by the pressure waves from atomic bombs dropped one after another out of the back, every three seconds. Such a spacecraft, they calculated, could reach Jupiter in a year but would take hundreds of years to reach Alpha Centauri.
The British Interplanetary Society used a more benign form for this propulsion idea in its interstellar spaceship study, Project Daedalus, in the 1970s. Their spacecraft would be powered by tiny thermonuclear explosions caused by compressing pellets of deuterium and helium-3 with laser blasts. It would carry a 500-ton scientific probe to Barnard's Star, 5.9 light-years away, in about 50 years, reaching a top speed of 12 percent of the speed of light along the way.
Dr. Tziolas said, ''That was the very first study that proved it's possible with knowledge we have now to travel to another star.''
In recent years, other virtual collaborations have joined the party. The Tau Zero Foundation, based in Cleveland, was founded by Marc G. Millis, who directed propulsion research at the NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, to encourage work on ''practical interstellar flight.'' Last year Mr. Millis calculated that it would be at least 200 years before society had the energy resources to send 500 people out of the solar system.
A variety of propulsion schemes have their fans and might prevail the long span between now and launch day -- a problem that Mr. Millis terms ''incessant obsolescence.'' Among them are gigantic sails pushed by sunlight or by powerful microwave beams and ion drives in which beams of high energy particles do the propelling.
Scientific probes could go sooner and cheaper. Professor Dyson recently pointed out that soon all the genetic information needed to reconstruct Earth's biosphere could be packed into something the size of an egg. Dispersed through space to different planets, such eggs could create homes-away-from-home waiting for us. ''The new technology will be biological,'' he said. ''It will make everything else obsolete.''
In January, Mr. Neyland and Pete Worden, director of NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, quietly invited about 30 scientists, entrepreneurs and science fiction writers to a two-day brainstorming session in northern California. Mr. Neyland described the first meeting as an attempt to get past ''the giggle factor'' associated with the subject. Participants included scientists like J. Craig Venter of the J. Craig Venter Institute, who was one of the first to sequence the human genome, and writers like Joe Haldeman, author of the award-winning novel, ''The Forever War.'' One participant said, ''There were a few people on the other side of reality.''
Then again, nobody is smart enough now to know what could come of the starship effort, Mr. Neyland pointed out. It would be naive to think we even know the right questions to ask.
''If you had asked Einstein and Marconi in 1910 to define a worldwide communication system for the common man,'' Mr. Neyland asked, ''would he have come up with the iPhone?''
A call for ideas for the Orlando meeting drew hundreds of responses, which are being sorted to decide who will get to speak. Dr. Tarter, the astronomer at SETI, will coordinate talks on where to go. She has received 50 or 60 proposals, which she called a ''mixed bag,'' some of which read like U.F.O. reports. ''Maybe,'' she said, ''you have to be a little bit crazy to think about this seriously.'' She added, ''We've all read enough science fiction to be fundamentally optimistic about the possible outcome.''
Kelvin Long, a physics graduate student at Warwick University and member of Project Icarus, said he had already thought about the floor plans, an organization chart and even a Japanese garden in the backyard for a pyramidal Interstellar Institute, where the research for an interstellar trip could eventually be centered.
''A lot of us are quite young. We grew up hearing about the Apollo program,'' he said. ''We want to be part of a significant journey. We personally think we may be doing something important, driving humanity out to the stars.'' He quoted Arthur C. Clarke, the late writer of science fact and fiction who invented the idea of communications satellites and helped found the British Interplanetary Society: ''If you believe something is possible, you can make it happen.''
Life Out There: Articles in this series are examining the search for new forms of life in the universe.

HEADLINE: Head of Net's Address System to Leave

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
Rod Beckstrom, chief executive of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees the Internet address system, plans to leave the organization next July.
Mr. Beckstrom plans to complete his three-year contract with Icann, a term that has been marked by moves to expand and internationalize the Internet address system. But these efforts have also brought the organization, and Mr. Beckstrom, into conflict with governments, brand owners and others. 
Mr. Beckstrom announced the news himself late Tuesday via Twitter. Later, in a news release, he said: ''I am incredibly proud of Icann's achievements throughout my tenure. In two short years we have advanced this organization to a new level of professionalism and productivity, and turned it into a genuinely multinational organization that will serve the world community long after my time here.''
The announcement of Mr. Beckstrom's departure could set off a new round of international wrangling over control of Icann and Internet governance. Set up by the United States government, the organization gained greater autonomy in 2009, around the time Mr. Beckstrom took over.
But some governments, including those of Russia and China, are said to want to exercise greater control over Internet governance, perhaps through an organization like the International Telecommunications Union, which operates under the auspices of the United Nations.
During Mr. Beckstrom's term, Icann has moved to reflect the increasingly international nature of the Internet, adding the ability to render addresses in non-Latin alphabets, for example.
Other changes have brought objections. A number of governments, for example, were opposed to Icann's move this year to add a ''.xxx'' address suffix for pornographic Web sites.
Also this year, Icann approved a plan for a vast expansion of so-called generic top-level domains -- the letters that follow the last ''dot'' in an Internet address. Some governments say they were not properly consulted, while brand owners and others continue to oppose the plan.
''Icann's potentially momentous change seems to have been made in a top-down star chamber,'' Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the United States Interactive Advertising Bureau, said in a letter to Icann this week. ''There appears to have been no economic impact research, no full and open stakeholder discussions, and little concern for the delicate balance of the Internet ecosystem. This could be disastrous for the media brand owners we represent and the brand owners with which they work. We hope that Icann will reconsider both this ill-considered decision and the process by which it was reached.''
Icann gave no indications on the hunt for a successor to Mr. Beckstrom, who said that in the meantime he remained ''committed to leading this critical organization with the utmost dedication, and to living up to our common vision: One world, one Internet.''

HEADLINE: International Demand Lifts Deere's Profit

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Deere & Company, the farm equipment maker, reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by international demand for large machines and a weaker United States dollar, but shares slipped amid disappointment over margins. 
''With farmers doing well, expectations were high,'' an industry analyst, Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Company, said. ''When your biggest business has margins down because of raw materials prices, it's not a surprise but it doesn't make stocks go up.''
Deere also lowered its outlook for farm profits in Brazil, a crucial indicator for future equipment demand in a huge food exporting market even as it raised its full-year profit forecast.
Net earnings rose 15 percent to $712 million, or $1.69 a share, from $617 million, or $1.44 a share, a year earlier. Profit beat analysts' average estimates by 2 cents a share.
Sales in the period, which ended July 31 and was the third quarter of Deere's fiscal year, rose 22 percent, to $8.37 billion from $6.84 billion. Equipment sales were up 24 percent to $7.72 billion, also beating forecasts, with the weak dollar adding six percentage points to the revenue growth.
Deere said in its conference call that costs of raw materials like steel, as well as tires and freight costs, were running ahead of its earlier expectations. It forecast input costs rising by around $700 million this fiscal year from its 2010 fiscal year.
International sales grew nearly five times faster than those in the United States and Canada. International equipment sales accounted for about 43 percent of total equipment sales in the quarter.
Deere said sales of high-horsepower farm machinery were lifting its results and sales of construction equipment were improving despite weak North American construction markets. It forecast full-year net income of $2.7 billion. In May, it forecast $2.65 billion and analysts are expecting $2.71 billion.
Long-term global demand for food, shelter and infrastructure will drive sales of Deere products, the company said. However, in the short-term, the outlook has grown more uncertain because of worries about the health of the economy and turmoil in financial markets.
Shares of Deere, which is based in Moline, Ill., fell 90 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $74.26.

HEADLINE: Angst Before High School

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Thinking Cap is about work in progress in the world of ideas. 'EXAM HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT: EVIDENCE FROM NEW YORK CITY' a working paper by Roland G. Fryer Jr., professor of economics and faculty director of the Education Innovation Laboratory at Harvard University, and Will Dobbie, a predoctoral research fellow at the laboratory. 
THE QUESTION Each year millions of middle-school students nationwide spend angst-filled months waiting to hear if they scored high enough on an entrance exam to attend a selective public high school. In New York City alone more than 27,000 students apply for precious spots in the three best-known schools: Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Technical and Bronx High School of Science. What Mr. Dobbie and Mr. Fryer wanted to know was just how much of a difference attending one of these high schools makes in the long run for students with similar equal admissions test scores. Some proponents say the benefits of an environment of high achievers, more advanced coursework and higher expectations are obvious. Skeptics counter that these gifted and motivated teenagers would have done well no matter where they went. Students in these schools with low class ranks may even be less competitive when it comes to college admissions. They might be better off in less competitive environments or in schools with a wider range of student abilities. Because there are so many applicants of similar ability and achievement who are not accepted to these New York institutions, the authors were able to compare the average outcomes of students who graduated from different high schools. ''We provide the first causal estimate of the impact of attending an exam-high school in the United States on later outcomes,'' they write.
THE FINDINGS Mr. Fryer and Mr. Dobbie were surprised by their results: ''The impact of attending an exam school on college enrollment or graduation is, if anything, negative. There is also little impact of attending an exam school on SAT reading and writing scores, and, at best, a modest positive impact on SAT math scores.'' The results were the same for both boys and girls, and for those who came from different types of middle schools. ''Our analysis of exam schools suggests that students are encouraged or pushed to take harder course work, but that their actual human capital essentially remains unchanged.''
The one exception, Mr. Dobbie and Mr. Fryer wrote, was borderline students: ''Attending an exam school increases rigor of the marginal student's high school course work, and makes the marginal student more likely to graduate from high school with an advanced diploma.'' The authors pointed out that the only measures they looked at were SAT scores, college enrollment and graduation. ''Without longer-term measures such as income, health, or life satisfaction,'' they note, ''it is difficult to fully interpret our results.''
WHAT DO YOU THINK? Does attending a selective high school make a significant difference? Are parents and children needlessly stressed? Post a comment below or e-mail me at pcohen@nytimes.com; follow me on Twitter at PatcohenNYT.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Threadbare American Justice: Severe budget cuts are gutting the effectiveness of the state court systems

 BODY:
It is an American article of faith that the path to justice runs through the courts. State courts, which handle a vast majority of civil and criminal cases, are in a state of crisis. Across the country, deep budget cuts and increased caseloads have created long delays and a denial of basic access to justice. 
More than 48 million cases, excluding traffic cases, were filed in state courts in 2008. Since then, courts have been flooded with thousands of new foreclosures, credit card cases and other lawsuits driven by economic hardship. At the same time, the recession and the deepening budget crunch have led states to lay off judges, law clerks and other courthouse personnel, which means longer waits for trials and delays even for recording judgments so that cases can be resolved.
Swamped by this huge docket, no state court system now delivers justice as it needs to. In Massachusetts, budget cuts have drastically reduced the number of court-appointed guardians for children who need to have their legal interests represented. In Oregon, cuts have reduced critical support staff, slowing the processing of cases. And these are two of the best-run systems in the country.
An American Bar Association task force led by David Boies and Theodore Olson, the former solicitor general, took on this issue in a valuable report issued last week, called ''Crisis in the Courts: Defining the Problem.''
The report rightly says that ''even the most eloquent constitution is worthless with no one to enforce it.'' As they cut spending on the courts, state legislatures are degrading public safety by delaying the resolution of criminal cases; hurting vulnerable populations like children and the elderly, who need the courts' protection; and damaging our system of government by weakening the judiciary, a separate and co-equal branch.
The courts in Georgia, the report says, have seen their financing shrink by 25 percent the last two years, so their budget (which also pays for prosecutors) now constitutes less than 1 percent of the state's overall budget. Most state systems have had significant cuts in the past three years.
The report offers some worthy recommendations that could help provide adequate budgets and increase alternative ways to resolve conflicts. For instance, it calls on states to adopt judicial financing formulas that recognize changes in caseloads. Without these and other reforms, access to justice will continue to contract.
Even this sober report barely begins to convey to national and state policy makers how much cuts to the judiciary have harmed individuals and democracy. As budget-starved courts become more dysfunctional, they lose the confidence of the public, which counts on them for relief, adding to the institutional crisis.
These courts may continue to process cases, but they will be less and less able to deliver justice.

HEADLINE: Medco May Clear Antitrust Hurdle

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and QUENTIN WEBB

 BODY:
The market now seems to think that Express Scripts' $29 billion agreement to buy Medco Health Solutions, another pharmacy benefits manager, has zero chance of success. Investors are right to take antitrust concerns about the industry seriously, but their doubts look overdone.
Medco stock closed on Wednesday at about $53 a share. That's lower than it was before Express Scripts showed up almost a month ago. Based on Wednesday afternoon's values, the cash-and-stock takeover bid is worth more than $67 a share to Medco holders. 
What's more, previous mergers in the sector have created large savings, one reason Express Scripts' shares gained 5 percent the day the deal was announced. Since the transaction contains stock, that means if the combination gets regulatory approval, the upside should be even greater than the yawning 26 percent gap between the offer and where Medco shares currently trade.
There's still a large danger the government says no, or demands divestitures large enough to sink the deal. Together, Express Scripts and Medco would have a startling 35 percent share of the market. The two sides have implicitly acknowledged this risk by taking the unusual step of waiving any breakup fee.
But there remains a reasonable chance the merger will go through. If watchdogs are assured some of the cost savings will be passed on to consumers, then they should be sympathetic toward approving the deal, especially given the state of the American economy and the cost of health care. Any potential consumer benefits should be weighed alongside concerns about harm from reduced competition.
Of course, if the deal collapses, Medco shares could fall further still. The company has been losing clients. UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest health insurers in the United States, recently declined to renew a contract that accounts for more than 15 percent of Medco's revenue.
But this loss of customers should in theory reduce the risk of regulators blocking the deal. UnitedHealth set up, essentially, as a competitor. Further, the more business Medco loses, the smaller its market share -- and thus the harder it is to argue the Express Scripts deal is anticompetitive. There's enough to suggest that winning trustbuster approval has a chance, meaning skeptical investors have made the option a cheap one to buy.
Australian Beer Fight
SABMiller has made a bold move. The beer producer, which is listed in Britain, has taken its offer for Foster's Group of Australia directly to shareholders, three months after its $10 billion offer was spurned. There's no counter-bidder in sight, and going hostile now means that Foster's will have to unveil results next week from a defensive position. But peace may yet break out. Hostile takeovers are hard in Australia, and a small sweetener could bring both sides together.
Foster's shares spiked after SAB's initial approach, but when alternatives failed to materialize, they fell back. Now just a few cents above the 4.90 Australian dollars a share bid price, the market seems to expect at best a slightly improved bid. Full-year earnings on Aug. 23, which is the first report since Foster's sold its wine business in May, may not help much as recent updates from smaller rivals Lion Nathan and Owens-Illinois both attest to continued weakness in the Australian beer market.
SAB looks disciplined by leaving its offer unchanged. With no other bid on the table, doing otherwise might look reckless. Moreover, SAB, whose brands include Grolsch and Peroni, has walked away from two sizable deals in South America in as many years. That will soothe the nerves of shareholders, who sent SAB stock down when its initial approach was announced for fear it might overpay.
But an agreed deal would still have value, which explains why SAB's tone remains civil. A friendly deal would grant full access to Foster's books. Moreover, Asian dealmakers complain it's hard to get hostile deals completed in Australia, and that investors there have less leverage over boards than their American or British counterparts.
Small offer increases have proved sufficient in other big beer battles: an increase of less than 8 percent clinched the merger that created Anheuser-Busch InBev. Adding a similar kicker here would imply a deal at about 5.30 Australian dollars a share. At that price, SAB could still cover its cost of capital in five years, on a Breakingviews analysis. A little sweetener might be enough to take away the bitterness.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Costs Increased More Than Expected in July

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Wholesale costs in the United States rose more than forecast in July, led by higher prices for tobacco, trucks and pharmaceuticals, the Labor Department said Wednesday.
The 0.2 percent advance in the producer price index followed a 0.4 percent decline in June, the figures showed. Economists forecast a 0.1 percent increase, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The so-called core measure, which excludes the sometimes volatile prices of food and energy, climbed 0.4 percent, the most since January. 
The report showed the cost of crude goods fell in July for a third consecutive month, led by declining petroleum and food prices. Slowing sales and a decline in raw materials mean companies will be less likely to raise prices, which may give Federal Reserve policy makers more room to act to spur growth after the nation's economy almost stalled.
Compared with July 2010, companies paid 7.2 percent more for goods last month after a 7 percent rise in June.
Excluding volatile food and energy costs, wholesale prices were projected to rise 0.2 percent from the previous month, the Bloomberg survey showed. Core wholesale prices climbed 2.5 percent in the 12 months ended in July, the biggest year-to-year increase since June 2009.
Fuel costs fell 0.6 percent as gasoline prices dropped 2.8 percent, the report showed. The cost of finished consumer foods increased 0.6 percent, led by potatoes and cheese.
Expenses for intermediate goods increased 0.2 percent from the previous month, while prices of crude goods dropped 1.2 percent.
Companies were charged 1 percent more for light motor trucks, while pharmaceutical prices climbed 0.4 percent. The cost of tobacco products rose 2.8 percent, the most since March 2009.

HEADLINE: Court Ruling Offers Path To Challenge Dodd-Frank

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS. 
David Pogue, whose State of the Art column normally appears on this page, is off.

 BODY:
A new front has opened in the behind-the-scenes battle over financial regulation.
Industry groups have been examining legal challenges to the Securities and Exchange Commission's new corporate whistle-blower program and a provision surrounding the extraction of oil and natural gas from foreign countries, people briefed on the talks said. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's plan to curb speculative trading is also under fire.
The catalyst has been a federal appeals court decision in July striking down an S.E.C. rule that would have made it easier for shareholders to nominate company directors. The so-called proxy access rule stemmed from the Dodd-Frank act, the sweeping regulatory overhaul enacted in the wake of the financial crisis.
In recent weeks, lawyers and Wall Street trade groups have gathered in Washington to ponder the next big case. Lawyers branded one meeting, held by the United States Chamber of Commerce, as ''Dodd-Frank Excesses,'' according to two people who were notified of the meeting. 
Until now, Wall Street relied largely on an army of lobbyists to chisel away at 300 new rules flowing from the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, among other agencies. But while lobbying might yield the occasional loophole, judicial rulings can halt new rules altogether.
''I would hope the agencies are taking to heart the potential consequences for Dodd-Frank rules,'' said Eugene Scalia, the lawyer who won the proxy case on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce.
Hal S. Scott, a professor at Harvard Law School and a director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a research group that has been a critic of Dodd-Frank, said, ''I do see lots of challenges coming down the pike.''
Regulators, reluctant to give in to industry pressure, are rushing to safeguard their rules from legal action. The commodity commission, having already delayed several Dodd-Frank rules for six months, is now studying the proxy case and considering adjustments to some proposed regulations, according to a person close to the agency. Earlier this month, the agency dispatched several staff members to meet with S.E.C. officials about the recent court decision.
For its part, the S.E.C. is weighing an appeal of the proxy ruling. The S.E.C. is also adding economists, planning to hire eight over the next two years, after the appeals court rebuked the agency for not fully evaluating the proxy rule's economic effects.
The legal challenges are rooted in a 1996 law that requires the S.E.C. to promote ''efficiency, competition and capital formation.'' The law enabled the financial industry to build lawsuits around the economic costs of a rule, regardless of its merits.
In 2005, the Chamber of Commerce was the first business group to invoke the law, using it to successfully challenge certain S.E.C. rules for the mutual fund industry. The chamber later gained momentum with a string of similar victories in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Altogether, the appeals court has tossed out three financial regulations in the last six years, including the proxy rule.
Mr. Scalia, a partner at the law firm Gibson Dunn and the son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, was on the winning end of each case.
Banks and corporations, rather than challenging the rules directly at the risk of alienating regulators, turn to seasoned litigators like Mr. Scalia and influential trade groups like the Chamber of Commerce to lead the fight. For more than 30 years, the chamber has had a separate litigation center, which operates as its own law firm in Washington.
''It is usually not in the interest of a single business to mount a claim,'' said Brian G. Cartwright, the S.E.C.'s former general counsel who now works at the law firm Latham & Watkins. ''You need some cut-out man or organization that speaks for broad groups.''
The industry has shied from mounting a broader challenge to Dodd-Frank itself, finding it cheaper and easier to gradually chip away at the law's fiercest provisions. Lawyers say a single lawsuit contesting the constitutionality of Dodd-Frank could take years - and millions of dollars - to wind through the courts, with little chance of succeeding.
''Dodd-Frank is not one thing but many,'' said Margaret E. Tahyar, a partner at the law firm Davis Polk. ''There is no reasonable constitutional or statutory challenge on the whole - only on the bits and pieces.''
By some measures, the proxy rule was an unlikely choice to challenge on economic grounds. The S.E.C. produced 60 pages on a cost-benefit analysis of the rule and spent 21,000 staff hours drafting it over two years, Mary L. Schapiro, the agency's chairwoman, said in a recent letter to Congress.
That the proxy regulation still did not pass muster does not bode well for several other Dodd-Frank rules that received considerably less explication, sometimes only 25 pages, on their economic effects.
''The proxy case makes all the rules open target to challenge,'' Mr. Scott of Harvard said.
Financial trade groups, according to several lawyers, are now considering suits against the S.E.C.'s corporate whistle-blower office, which opened last week. The chamber, at least, argues that the whistle-blower program allows tipsters to undermine internal compliance departments.
Industry groups are also looking at claims against a few more obscure Dodd-Frank provisions. One S.E.C. regulation requires companies to disclose whether they manufacture goods using so-called conflict minerals like gold from Congo.
Tiffany & Company argued in a letter to the S.E.C. that the proposed rules ''would violate the First Amendment,'' laying the groundwork for business groups to mount a constitutional challenge.
Some letters are even blunter, as groups invoke the proxy case as a cautionary tale.
Royal Dutch Shell wrote the S.E.C. this month about ''our expected costs'' stemming from a proposal about oil extraction. Shell filed the letter, it said, ''in light of the recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals.''
The commodity commission has received a barrage of hostile letters, too, some foreshadowing legal action. In March, the Futures Industry Association urged the commission to scrap its plan for reining in speculative commodities trading, saying it ''may be legally infirm.''
Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner at the agency who has championed tough position limits on oil, corn and the like, sought feedback on the plan from the CME Group, the nation's largest futures exchange. But at CME's Chicago headquarters last fall, executives declined to discuss the proposal with Mr. Chilton, saying the Commodity Futures Trading Commission lacked the legal authority to impose trading limits.
With the industry firing such warning shots, regulators have spent months shielding their rules from litigation.
In May, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's general counsel and chief economist issued a memo spelling out guidelines for cost-benefit analyses. The memo and other efforts to slow down the Dodd-Frank rules later drew rare praise from the agency's internal watchdog, which said the commission ''has taken proactive steps to address concerns.''
Scott O'Malia, a Republican commissioner at the futures trading commission, also called for the agency to re-examine every cost-benefit analysis drawn up for Dodd-Frank. ''The commission does not have the final word, as the S.E.C. has recently learned,'' Mr. O'Malia warned this month.
Still, most regulators are hesitant to strike the panic button.
''We hear about potential lawsuits with some frequency,'' Mr. Chilton said in an interview. ''There's an old saying in Washington that, if you're not part of the solution, there's plenty of money to be made being part of the problem.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Citing Debt and Benefits, Fitch Lowers Bond Rating for New Jersey

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Despite its efforts to cut spending, New Jersey is a riskier investment, one of the leading ratings agencies said on Wednesday as it lowered the state's credit rating, citing heavy debt and benefits obligations. 
Fitch Ratings lowered its assessment of New Jersey's general obligation bonds one notch, to AA from AA. Fitch's ratings for Kentucky and Michigan are also AA ; only California and Illinois have worse ratings.
In June, Gov. Chris Christie and the Legislature agreed on health care and pension changes for public workers that will save New Jersey billions of dollars. That deal added to other large budget cuts Mr. Christie had passed since taking office in January 2010, as well as savings he hopes to get in continuing contract talks with public-employee unions.
But Fitch called the benefits package a mixed blessing. In the long run, it will improve the condition of New Jersey's pension funds, whose problems stem largely from the state's failure to make most of its contributions to the funds over the past decade. But in the short run, Fitch said the deal could make the state's finances worse. It included a requirement that New Jersey increase its pension contributions gradually over the next few years, moving toward making its annual pension payments fully; the amount it contributes will rise to $5 billion for 2018.
''We feel it will be challenging to absorb that payment,'' Kenneth T. Weinstein, a senior director at Fitch, said, adding, ''The pension reform will serve to slow the growth in the liability.''
Last year, New Jersey became the first state ever to be charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, for trying to conceal the extent of its pension problems. The state settled the case with a promise to change its practices.
But even with the recent overhaul, the pension system remains far short of the assets it needs. Fitch estimated that before the law changed, the system had 56 percent of the money it needed to meet its long-term obligations, and that the changes raised that to 65 percent.
In lowering the state's rating, Fitch also cited the weak economy and a state Supreme Court order in May that forced New Jersey to increase spending on low-income school districts. Mr. Weinstein noted that with the state deeply in debt, it is interested in paying cash for capital projects, which would further strain the budget.
The governor's office referred questions to the state Treasury Department. A department spokesman released a statement noting Fitch's praise for some of Mr. Christie's actions. ''New Jersey is struggling, like nearly every other state, to rebound from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression,'' the statement said. ''It's also hampered by past administrations' mismanagement of state finances, which left New Jersey with a weaker economy than its neighbors', huge debts and billions of dollars of underfunding in the pension plans and for future retiree medical benefits.''
Fitch now gives New Jersey the same rating as another major agency, Standard & Poor's. The third agency, Moody's, which uses a different system, rates the state equivalently, at Aa3.

HEADLINE: Russia Is Better Prepared for a Possible Global Downturn

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- During previous bouts of financial volatility, Russia could be reliably found on the edge of the violent extremes. In 2008, for example, the Russian stock market was the worst performing of any major stock exchange in the world. The ruble collapsed. And the rich industrialists known as the oligarchs suffered $230 billion in paper losses.
This time is different. 
While the Russian economy is still vulnerable to the vicissitudes of global capital and commodity moves, it is in a far better position to weather the effects of a fresh recession in Europe or the United States.
Russia is not immune, of course. The European sovereign debt crisis, exacerbated by Standard & Poor's downgrade of the debt of the United States, caused a sell-off in the Russian stock market, but it hardly went into its typical free fall. The Micex index fell 17 percent from Aug. 1 until Aug. 10.
While drastic, it was about the same as the peak-to-trough decline of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the last month, and Russian stocks have recovered somewhat over the last few trading sessions.
The ruble declined 7.5 percent against the dollar in 11 trading days, but then rebounded Monday, the most it has climbed in any single day in more than a year and a half.
One reason for the new resilience is that Russian private sector debt is only a fraction of what it was in 2008, after the oligarchs had quietly bulked up on Western loans collateralized against their companies' shares.
This buildup of debt set off a cascade of margin-call selling in Russia, accelerating the collapse of the market. These debt levels are no longer widespread here.
Also, Russian banks have gone from being net debtors to net creditors.
''The situation with debt has changed dramatically,'' Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at Otkritie, one of Russia's largest financial firms, said in a telephone interview.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, $80 billion in corporate and bank debt came due to foreign lenders, he said. Since then companies have paid down and extended the maturities of debt. In the fourth quarter of this year, only $35 billion will come due, giving companies a good deal more leeway to handle a downturn.
One sign of this change came from Oleg V. Deripaska, the metals and automobile tycoon whose hugely leveraged business came to symbolize the oligarchs' debt binge and its aftermath in the recession. He announced without fanfare on Tuesday that he had restructured a $4.5 billion loan from the Russian bank Sberbank, extending its repayment period.
To be sure, Russia is hardly a haven, and never will be, as long as it continues its reliance on volatile commodity exports.
In the 20 years since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Russian stock market has been either in the top five performing markets in the world or the bottom five in every year except one, according to estimates by Renaissance, an investment bank in Moscow.
''Russia has always been a big cyclical market,'' Kingsmill Bond, the chief Russia strategist for Citigroup, said in a telephone interview from London. And despite its stronger starting position now, it is still vulnerable to a drop in the price of oil.
''If the situation in Europe worsens, and we get major recessions materializing, that would impact the oil price, and Russia would be damaged,'' he said.
Mr. Bond has estimated that for each $10 drop in the average annual price of a barrel of oil, Russia loses 1 percent of its gross domestic product.
Russia can ill afford a sharp decline in the price of oil because, though the oligarchs and their businesses are carrying less debt, government spending has increased well beyond current tax receipts from oil export tariffs and mineral extraction fees.
In 2008, the Russian budget was intended to run a surplus at oil prices above $60 a barrel. But now, the Russian government estimates it will need to collect taxes on oil at prices above $120 a barrel to balance the budget. As they are already below that level, the finance ministry is borrowing from domestic and foreign investors.

HEADLINE: A Block Abuzz With the Business of Gold

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
On Tuesday morning, Arnie and Laura Goldstein, a retired couple from Rego Park, Queens, took some gold jewelry they had been saving for years to the incredible trinket bazaar that is the diamond district in Midtown Manhattan.
''Things I don't wear anymore,'' Mrs. Goldstein said, folding a stick of chewing gum into her mouth and eyeing a daunting array of hawkers on the block of West 47th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas.
Mr. Goldstein, a retired New York City schoolteacher, said they hoped to get about $7,500 for the pieces. ''We've been holding on to them for years,'' he said. 
''Years,'' Mrs. Goldstein added.
''And now that the gold price is up,'' Mr. Goldstein said, ''we figured we'd come in and see what we could get.''
The price of gold is indeed up. It soared to an all-time high last week, not adjusted for inflation: over $1,800 an ounce for pure 24-karat gold. The spike has set off a flurry of sales in the diamond district, which has become flooded with people like the Goldsteins looking to sell high.
''This is a gold rush,'' said Ernie Velez, 48, a jeweler and an owner of Universal Refinery, a glass-counter booth in one of the many mini-mall exchanges on the block where jewelry is bought and sold. Mr. Velez, an immigrant from Ecuador, said things could get even busier.
''A lot of folks are selling, but also a lot of people think the price will keep going up,'' he said as jewelers brought small piles of gold jewelry to his counter for estimates. Mr. Velez's men rasped the pieces on smooth test stones and then dabbed nitric acid on the rubbed-off gold to determine its purity.
Outside, Ramon Barrenechea, 59, of Staten Island, was capitalizing on the rush in his own way. Mr. Barrenechea, an immigrant from Peru, makes his own flat test stones by hand and was selling them for more than $50.
The diamond district does not particularly need a gold rush to invigorate its sidewalks. The block always percolates with business and energy.
About $24 billion is exchanged each year in sales in and around the district, among roughly 3,000 businesses, said Michael Toback, an executive board member of the 47th Street Business Improvement District and an owner of Myron Toback, a jewelry supply and refinery business on the block.
Amid all this industry, the district can be one of the strangest places in the city. Near Fifth Avenue on Tuesday, a scruffy bear of a man with no shirt on was scooping up rainwater and giving himself a cat bath as passers-by stared.
Hawkers from kosher delis handed out menus. One could hear New York accents, as well as Russian and also Yiddish, spoken by the many Hasidic men who work here, in black hats and coats.
Some of the most colorful characters were the hawkers: street-savvy men hired by jewelry dealers to spot potential customers on the block and coax them into their shops. The surging price of gold has cranked up the metabolism of these figures: the swaggering, smooth-talking sidewalk representatives for the many businesses.
''We've had a lot more action the past couple weeks,'' said a 51-year-old hawker named Al, who wore a ''We Buy Gold'' sign around his neck and courted customers by showing a piece of paper listing the latest prices for 24-karat and lesser gold. ''Business has been good.''
Al would not give his last name (''I got grandkids -- I don't want them to know I do this'') but said he tells customers that gold prices were so high that he was selling rings off his fingers.
''I tell people, 'I had a ring I bought for $40 back in the day, and I just sold it for $200,' '' he said.
Not all hawkers were as cheerful, complaining that sales were not brisk enough, even as they still quoted prices as high as $1,790 an ounce on Wednesday morning.
''A lot of people know what they have, and they're waiting to see if they can sit on it longer, for a better offer,'' said Denis Garasimov, who said he was hawking for Diamond District Gold Buyers. ''It's a straight-out gamble right now.''
Victor Velez, 38, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who held a laminated ''We Buy Gold'' sign, nodded as he handed out cards for the Royal Gems Corporation.
''A lot of people are holding on to it because they are seeing how high it can go,'' Mr. Velez said.
When the Goldsteins first set foot on the block, they were approached by a hawker named Anthony Palmer, 47, of Springfield Gardens, Queens. Mr. Palmer, who works a small patch of sidewalk near Avenue of the Americas, said he earns $100 a day from the company he works for, and sometimes receives tips from customers happy with the price they get for their gold.
''You see there's no other hawkers in this spot but me -- this is my fiefdom,'' he said. ''That's how it works. We respect each other's space. When you get rogue hawkers cutting in, sometimes you got to be forceful.''
The surge in gold prices is attracting more traffic, he said, but when it comes to selling gold, personal needs often trump market price.
''It really ebbs and flows on people's own economics,'' he said. ''You get desperate people at the beginning and the end of the month, when they're facing their bills.''

HEADLINE: Justice Inquiry Is Said to Focus On S.&P. Ratings

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
The Justice Department is investigating whether the nation's largest credit ratings agency, Standard & Poor's, improperly rated dozens of mortgage securities in the years leading up to the financial crisis, according to two people interviewed by the government and another briefed on such interviews.
The investigation began before Standard & Poor's cut the United States' AAA credit rating this month, but it is likely to add fuel to the political firestorm that has surrounded that action. Lawmakers and some administration officials have since questioned the agency's secretive process, its credibility and the competence of its analysts, claiming to have found an error in its debt calculations.
In the mortgage inquiry, the Justice Department has been asking about instances in which the company's analysts wanted to award lower ratings on mortgage bonds but may have been overruled by other S.& P. business managers, according to the people with knowledge of the interviews. If the government finds enough evidence to support such a case, which is likely to be a civil case, it could undercut S.& P.'s longstanding claim that its analysts act independently from business concerns.
It is unclear if the Justice Department investigation involves the other two ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, or only S.& P. 
During the boom years, S.& P. and other ratings agencies reaped record profits as they bestowed their highest ratings on bundles of troubled mortgage loans, which made the mortgages appear less risky and thus more valuable. They failed to anticipate the deterioration that would come in the housing market and devastate the financial system.
Since the crisis, the agencies' business practices and models have been criticized from many corners, including in Congressional hearings and reports that have raised questions about whether independent analysis was corrupted by the drive for profits.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has also been investigating possible wrongdoing at S.& P., according to a person interviewed on that matter, and may be looking at the other two major agencies, Moody's and Fitch Ratings.
Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for S.& P., said in an e-mail: ''S.& P. has received several requests from different government agencies over the last few years. We continue to cooperate with these requests. We do not prevent such agencies from speaking with current or former employees.'' S.& P. is a unit of the McGraw-Hill Companies, which is under pressure from some investors and has been considering whether to spin off businesses or make other strategic changes this summer.
The people with knowledge of the investigation said it had picked up steam early this summer, well before the debt rating issue reached a high pitch in Washington. Now members of Congress are investigating why S.& P. removed the nation's AAA rating, which is highly important to financial markets.
Representatives of the Justice Department and the S.E.C. declined to comment, as is customary for those departments, on whether they are investigating the ratings agencies.
Even though the Justice Department has the power to bring criminal charges, witnesses who have been interviewed have been told by investigators that they are pursuing a civil case.
The government has brought relatively few cases against large financial concerns for their roles in the housing blowup, and it has closed investigations into Washington Mutual and Countrywide, among others, without taking action.
The cases that have been brought are mainly civil matters. In the spring, the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Deutsche Bank and one of its units, which the government said had misrepresented the quality of mortgage loans to obtain government insurance on them. Another common thread -- in that case and several others -- is that no bank executives were named.
Despite the public scrutiny and outcry over the ratings agencies' failures in the financial crisis, many investors still rely heavily on ratings from the three main agencies for their purchases of sovereign and corporate debt, as well as other complex financial products.
Companies and some countries -- but not the United States -- pay the agencies to receive a rating, the financial market's version of a seal of approval. For decades, the government issued rules that banks, mutual funds and others could rely on a AAA stamp for investing decisions -- which bolstered the agencies' power.
A successful case or settlement against a giant like S.& P. could accelerate the shift away from the traditional ratings system. The financial reform overhaul known as Dodd-Frank sought to decrease the emphasis on ratings in the way banks and mutual funds invest their assets. But bank regulators have been slow to spell out how that would work. A government case that showed problems beyond ineptitude might spur greater reforms, financial historians said.
''I think it would have a major impact if there was a successful fraud case that would suggest there would be momentum for legislation that would force them to change their business model,'' said Richard Sylla, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business who has studied the history of ratings firms.
In particular, Professor Sylla said that the ratings agencies could be forced to stop making their money off the entities they rate and instead charge investors who use the ratings. The current business model, critics say, is riddled with conflicts of interest, since ratings agencies might make their grades more positive to please their customers.
Before the financial crisis, banks shopped around to make sure rating agencies would award favorable ratings before agreeing to work with them. These banks paid upward of $100,000 for ratings on mortgage bond deals, according to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, and several hundreds of thousands of dollars for the more complex structures known as collateralized debt obligations.
Ratings experts also said that a successful case could hamper the agencies' ability to argue that they were not liable for ratings that turned out to be wrong.
''Their story is that they should be protected by full First Amendment protections, and that would be harder to make in the public arena, in Congress and in the courts,'' said Lawrence J. White, another professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, who has testified alongside ratings executives before Congress. ''If they mixed business and the ratings, it would certainly make their story harder to tell.''
The ratings agencies lost a bit of ground on their First Amendment protections in the recent financial reform bill, which put the ratings firms on the same legal liability level as accounting firms, Professor White said. But that has yet to be tested in court.
People with knowledge of the Justice Department investigation of S.& P. said investigators had made references to several individuals, though it was unclear if anyone would be named in any potential case. Investigators have been asking about a remark supposedly made by David Tesher about mortgage security ratings, two people said. The investigators have asked witnesses if they heard Mr. Tesher say: ''Don't kill the golden goose,'' in reference to mortgage securities.
S.& P. declined to provide a comment for Mr. Tesher.
Several of the people who oversaw S.& P.'s mortgage-related ratings went on to different jobs at McGraw-Hill, including Joanne Rose, the former head of structured finance; Vickie Tillman, the former head of ratings; and Susan Barnes, former head of residential mortgage bond ratings. Investigators have told witnesses that they are looking for former employees and that has proved difficult because so many crucial people still work at the company.
One former executive who has been mentioned in investigators' interviews is Richard Gugliada, who helped oversee ratings of collateralized debt obligations. Calls to his home were not returned.

HEADLINE: Transit Agency Study Finds Fares Up and Service Down

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The fare for Atlanta's trains and buses will jump to $2.50 in October, giving the city one of the more expensive transit systems in the country. In Salt Lake City, rides to Temple Square on the popular light-rail system rose a quarter in May to $2.25, and are scheduled to hit $2.50 in two years. Even San Francisco's iconic cable cars went up a dollar last month, to $6.
The economic downturn is playing havoc with the nation's public transit systems even as ridership remains near record levels: since 2010, 71 percent of the nation's large systems have cut service, and half have raised fares, according to a survey released Wednesday by the American Public Transportation Association, a transit advocacy group. 
And in many cases, those fare increases and service cuts -- made necessary by flat or reduced state and local aid -- are being implemented on top of similar moves earlier in the downturn.
''It's compounding,'' Art Guzzetti, the vice president for policy at the transportation association, said of the repeated years of service cuts and fare increases. ''I've been in the business 32 years. We've had a lot of ups and downs along the way. That's been the nature of the business. But notwithstanding that, this is the worst it's been in my time.''
Since 2006, transit systems have been carrying passengers on more than 10 billion trips a year, a level not seen since the 1950s, the association has found. But on average, they get around a third of their operating money from fares. Most of the money comes from state and local governments, and with tax collections still struggling to get back to pre-recession levels, 83 percent of the transit agencies surveyed reported receiving flat or reduced state aid.
Many riders -- who are often low-wage workers trying to get to their jobs -- are getting hit at the farebox, or are being forced to wait longer for more crowded, dirtier trains and buses as transit agencies cut schedules. .
In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority cut service and raised fares last year: the price of a 30-day pass for subways and buses went up $15 to $104, and while most rides cost $2.25, a single-ticket ride went up to $2.50. Now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is proposing to raise the fares on its PATH trains to $2.75 from $1.75.
Chicago's commuter rail line, Metra, recently told its riders that it may have to raise fares by up to 20 percent while cutting two to four trains a day from almost every line.
It explained its bind in a note to riders, which said that the downturn has caused the regional transportation sales tax it relies on to ''plummet,'' and that it was now on track to take in $350 million less than expected through 2013. The rising cost of diesel fuel, meanwhile, will cost the agency $18.3 million more than expected this year. And the agency warned that it would be dangerous to continue taking money out of its capital budget, which is needed to pay for a much-needed backlog of repairs and improvements, in order to keep its trains running.
''Further depleting the capital budget to pay for operations will only make the problem worse and eventually result in impacts on our service and service delays,'' it warned.
The survey by the transportation association, based on data collected in March, was released as many transit advocates are worried that Republicans in Congress are planning to cut federal aid for building highways and transit systems.
The Federal Transit Administration estimated last year that it would take $77.7 billion just to bring the nation's aging transit systems into ''a state of good repair.'' But the survey released this week said that many systems are falling further behind.
Three in 10 in the survey said they had put off buying new vehicles. Two in 10 said they had delayed construction projects, and another two in 10 said they delayed maintenance.

HEADLINE: A Mixed Day as Investors Assess Quarterly Results

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The stock market wavered on Wednesday and ended mixed, weighed down by corporate results related to the technology and consumer sectors.
The markets opened higher but then sank. While crucial sectors like energy and financial stocks recovered on Wednesday, after leading the overall market decline on Tuesday, technology shares were dragged lower as Dell dropped more than 10 percent.
On Tuesday, Dell said that a weaker economy had lowered demand, flattening its sales in the quarter that ended July 29, and that it had pared low-margin products. Its net income rose 63 percent in the quarter, but it lowered its revenue forecast for the rest of the year. 
The technology sector was down about 1 percent at the market close. The consumer discretionary index dipped 0.38 percent. Abercrombie & Fitch, the retailer, was down more than 8 percent and led the list of leading decliners among the 10 most actively traded shares during most of the session. In reporting its results, Mike Jeffries, the chief executive, said the company faced greater uncertainty this year.
''Costing pressures will be greater in the second half of the year, and macroeconomic uncertainty has increased,'' Mr. Jeffries said. ''However, our strong top-line momentum and overall performance for the past several quarters give us confidence that we are well positioned to navigate through this environment.''
A range of stocks gained on Wednesday, including those in telecommunications, utilities and consumer staples. Investors took guidance on the economy and consumer spending from results.
Seasonal factors appeared to help Target, which logged a higher profit aided by school-related sales. Its shares rose more than 2 percent. Staples closed slightly lower and raised its outlook, and earnings exceeded expectations.
But the technology sector, after the Dell results, ''cast a pall over consumer spending and business spending,'' said Mark D. Luschini, the chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. ''Everybody is looking for any kind of signal or litmus test as to which way this is going to break.''
If consumers pull back because of political, economic or equity-related uncertainties, he said, that leaves little ''horsepower to drive our economic activity,'' increasing ''the risk of a recession.''
Over all, the declines in the equities market were slight -- less than 1 percent in each of the three main indexes -- but a reversal from the trend in early trading.
The market is recovering from volatility last week, and fell on Tuesday in the aftermath of a meeting between leaders of the euro zone's two largest economies, France and Germany.
While many say the equities markets will remain unsteady for some time, bargain-hunters are benefiting from the recent lows.
''I think that the market is still reacting to a pretty oversold condition technically,'' said Tom Samuels, of Palantir Capital Management. He said that through early September it might continue to be ''a little bullish.'' At the close, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.09 percent at 1,193.89. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.04 percent at 11,410.21 and the Nasdaq was down 0.47 percent to 2,511.48. The price on the 10-year Treasury note rose 16/32 to 99 20/32, and the yield fell to 2.17 percent, compared to 2.23 percent Tuesday.
On Wednesday, there appeared to be an early rally leading the riskier side of the market, and some strength in the commodity sector after a relatively benign reading in an important indicator of producer prices, Mr. Samuels noted.
The broadest indicator of wholesale prices edged up 0.2 percent in July, according to the Labor Department. Not counting food and energy, the indicator, the Producer Price Index, was up 0.4 percent, the most rapid increase in six months.

HEADLINE: Prognosis on Jobs Turns Cloudy

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON and KATIE THOMAS; Tom Torok contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Even during months of stubborn unemployment, the health care industry has provided a solid underpinning, reliably adding jobs in an otherwise dismal environment.
For example, hospitals, nursing homes and the like added about 430,000 jobs during the recession, as the country shed 7.5 million jobs. With the latest government reports showing a meager overall gain of 117,000 jobs in July, health care remained a significant contributor with an additional 31,000 jobs for the month, a tad higher than an average monthly addition of 25,000 health jobs in the last year. Hospitals, which had a slight decline in June, added 14,000 jobs in July.
While few experts can predict how the stock market's gyrations and government cutbacks this month will affect the health industry, several health industry analysts warn that the sector is showing signs of economic sluggishness that has long kept other business sectors beleaguered. 
The situation has led many in the health industry to caution that it cannot be relied upon to keep hiring workers. ''It's not realistic to believe that we're going to continue to generate job growth when you're speaking about Medicare and Medicaid reductions in the hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few years,'' said Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York, which represents the state's hospitals and health systems.
Companies that rely on government spending have been bracing for deeper reductions, and President Obama recently alluded to another round of belt-tightening from one of the industry's bedrock payers -- Medicare.
Signs of a gloomier outlook have been surfacing in various spots, from a slowing in new construction plans to falling share prices of nursing home companies to announced layoffs among hospital support staff.''Nobody is sure what will happen,'' said Alan M. Garber, a physician and health policy expert at Stanford. The cuts in government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and pressure to reduce costs, are thwarting health care employers in trying to meet the rising demand for their services.
''The health care industry is facing greater uncertainty than in any time in memory,'' Dr. Garber said.
Yet even though economists and other experts still predict increasing demand for health care as the population ages, with an accompanying demand for job growth, health care officials and executives cite a daunting cascade of recent events as reasons to reassess any expansions.
They point to Congress' intent to reduce spending, economically depressed states struggling to deal with a rash of cuts in Medicaid programs and the continued uncertainty of financial costs that will be imposed by the federal health care law, including contradictory lower court decisions about the constitutionality of various provisions.
A survey by the Conference Board, a business research group, found that help-wanted ads for health care providers and technicians fell by 61,200 listings in July.
In Florida, for example, health care led the state in job gains during the recession -- it was the only industry that did not lose jobs during that time. But since September of last year, the leisure and hospitality industry has been adding more jobs, according to a state economist.
The Palo Alto Medical Foundation, a large physician group in Northern California that employs 5,500 people, including 1,000 doctors, says it has no plans to add many more people in the near future. ''Really our focus these days is to do more with the assets we have,'' said Cecilia Montalvo, the vice president for strategic development for the medical group.
Hospitals also appear to be slowing the pace of building, as projects begun before the recession started are now being completed. The volume of tax-exempt debt for hospitals in the first half of the year has fallen by nearly half from a year ago, said David Johnson, a managing director at BMO Capital Markets. ''We're overinvested in hospitals and hospital beds,'' he said.
The University of Michigan Health System, for example, is adding some 560 jobs as a result of new children's and women's hospitals it plans to open soon and an expansion of its emergency department. But Doug Strong, who heads the system's hospitals, said his overall goal is to shrink his work force in future years as he tries to make the system more efficient, though their are no current plans to reduce the system's staff.
While he expects the demand for health care services to rise, he believes he needs to deliver that care with fewer people at less cost. ''I think that is what the nation is asking of all of us,'' he said.
The impact of state cuts in Medicaid are already being felt in doctor's offices, hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies around the country. Hospitals experienced reductions in Medicaid reimbursement in 37 states for next year's budgets, according to Lisa Goldstein, an analyst at Moody's, who predicts further cuts.
At the Elliot Health System in Manchester, N.H., the seemingly abrupt decision by state lawmakers to sharply reduce hospital reimbursements led the hospital to recently lay off 182 people.
''For the last 10 years, we've been pretty stable and we've been able to grow,'' said Elliot's chief executive, Doug Dean. But faced with the loss of millions of dollars in Medicaid revenue that would wreak havoc on the coming hospital budget, Mr. Dean said he had no choice but to cut jobs. ''It was simply because of the economics of Medicaid,'' he said. Elliot is among a group of hospitals filing a lawsuit to stop the cuts.
Health care employers are also confronting cuts to the federal Medicare program. In July, nursing home operators learned their reimbursements would be cut by 11 percent in October, and hospitals expect further reductions in what they are paid under the new health care law as well as in future efforts to reduce the federal deficit.
Still, these continue to be boom times in many corners of the industry. Partners in Care, a New York nonprofit provider of home health care services, is hiring so many home health aides that it recently opened a second training center to handle the flood of new employees.
Its staff of aides has grown from close to 5,800 in 2006 to about 9,200 today. In June, the group, which is part of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, hired 374 new people, the second-biggest month in its history.
Jay Conolly, vice president of human resources at Partners in Care, said his group is benefiting, not just from the growing elderly population, but also from the consolidation of nursing homes and hospitals in the New York area and a heightened interest in low-cost alternatives to inpatient care. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has predicted that jobs will grow faster in the home health care area than in any other section of the health care industry.
''There's never been enough home health aides, and there never will be,'' Mr. Conolly said.
And many expect that when the economy finally does rebound, hiring will, again, take off, especially when more people are expected to be insured under the federal health care law. Geraldine Bednash, chief executive of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, expects there is pent-up demand for their services, especially for nurse practitioners and nurse midwives, who would work in primary care. ''We are going to see this huge onslaught of need for nurses,'' she said. ''So we're in a blip, that's all.''
There are some who wonder whether the country should continue to rely on health care as a stalwart supplier of new jobs. If spending on health care continues at its current pace, it will choke out other vital sectors and end up hurting the rest of the economy, said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc. ''I think the path that we're on now is clearly unsustainable,'' he said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Thursday with an article about the effect of government cutbacks on job creation in the health care industry misstated staffing plans at the University of Michigan Health System. While the system's chief said his goal was to shrink the work force in future years, there are no current plans to reduce the system's staff.

HEADLINE: Obama to Press Committee on Jobs

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Atkinson, Ill.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will deliver a major address soon after Labor Day seeking to pressure a special Congressional committee to propose new measures to promote job creation as well as larger long-term deficit cuts than mandated, aides said Wednesday.
Much more than he has in past months, Mr. Obama has spent this week combining his pitch for deficit reduction with a renewed emphasis on the need for further temporary spending and tax cuts to encourage businesses to hire and consumers to spend, going beyond proposals like continued payroll-tax relief. 
Until the economy showed fresh signs of weakening lately, Mr. Obama had all but shelved additional stimulus proposals, given Republicans' opposition. But even before he has disclosed details of his proposals -- including new tax incentives for hiring, public works measures and state aid for teachers -- Mr. Obama has essentially dared Republicans to try to block them, suggesting the onus is on Republicans to prevent a recovery-threatening impasse.
''My basic argument to them is this: We should not have to choose between getting our fiscal house in order, and jobs and growth,'' Mr. Obama told an audience Wednesday in Atkinson, Ill., on the final day of his three-day bus tour through Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois.
As for deficit reduction, Mr. Obama suggested that he would call in his speech for the bipartisan 12-member Congressional committee that was created by his debt-reduction deal with Republicans this month to be more ambitious about deficit-reduction than its formal charge requires -- including tax increases on the wealthy, which Republicans oppose.
''I'm going to make a presentation that has more deficit reduction than the $1.5 trillion that they've been assigned,'' he said.
He said the ultimate goal should be $4 trillion in savings over 10 years. Counting the $1 trillion in cuts already agreed to in the debt-limit deal, that would suggest that the committee -- and Mr. Obama -- would have find $3 trillion more. But he will not seek that much.
''We'll have more spending cuts than we have revenue,'' he said, after expressing concern that Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio had named Republicans to the panel who oppose any tax increases. ''But we're going to have to take a balanced approach,'' Mr. Obama said, without ''drastic cuts'' in Medicare and Medicaid -- though he made clear that changes to those fast-growing programs must be on the table.
The president's plans for a speech with a broad economic agenda comes after months in which Republicans have ridiculed him as not having a detailed debt-reduction plan, and many supporters have urged him to show more leadership -- and more fight -- in the battle over the size and role of government.
Yet Republican leaders served notice that they would oppose stimulus measures now or higher tax revenues later. That signals another contentious budget battle this fall, after the summer-long chain of events that ended with the relatively modest deficit-reduction deal, which cleared the way for a needed increase in the nation's debt limit but also provoked Standard & Poor's to downgrade the United States credit rating and contributed to days of market turbulence.
In a memorandum to House Republicans on Wednesday, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, said their agenda must include ''stopping the discussions of new stimulus spending with money that we simply do not have.'' He accused the president of waging ''class warfare'' -- Republican code for Mr. Obama's proposed tax increases on high incomes.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, criticized ''job-killing tax increases'' and said, ''Continuing the spending spree on failed stimulus programs won't shrink the deficit.''
Many economists argue that while temporary spending and tax cuts add to deficits initially, such measures can increase tax collections, reduce costs for safety-net programs and ultimately keep deficits smaller than otherwise by spurring business activity and lowering unemployment. How economists would judge Mr. Obama's proposals will depend on their details; contrary to Republicans' claims, economists generally judged his 2009-10 stimulus program to have helped, but to have been insufficient to overcome the deep downturn.
While the details, date and venue of Mr. Obama's speech remain to be finalized, the president throughout his bus tour hinted at his approach for simultaneously stimulating the economy while reducing projected deficits through spending cuts and revenue increases to take effect once the economy recovers.
In Minnesota on Monday, Mr. Obama said he would propose ''a very specific plan to boost the economy, to create jobs, and to control our deficit.
''And my attitude is, get it done,'' he contined. ''And if they don't get it done, then we'll be running against a Congress that's not doing anything for the American people, and the choice will be very stark and will be very clear.''
To sustain the wobbly recovery, Mr. Obama has called for extending for another year a cut in employees' payroll tax and unemployment compensation for those out of work longer than six months. He has also proposed an infrastructure bank to leverage public and private money for roads, bridges, schools and other public projects, renewed tax write-offs for businesses' capital investments, an overhaul of patent law to spur innovation and approval of trade pacts to promote jobs in export industries.
This week, Mr. Obama suggested he also would ask Congress to provide aid to financially struggling states and cities to keep teachers on the job -- a move many Democrats and local officials have been pleading for.
''I personally believe that one of the most effective ways that we could help the economy is making sure that we're not seeing more teacher layoffs,'' he said, to applause.
Aides say Mr. Obama is also considering expanding payroll-tax relief to employers and a tax credit for new hires. Since an infrastructure bank would take time to start up, he also will propose other ways to encourage construction more quickly, an aide said.
''When interest rates are low, contractors are begging for work, construction workers are lining up to find jobs, let's rebuild America,'' he said this week.

HEADLINE: Plenty of Time Left to Regret Rodriguez's Contract

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
Moosic, Pa.
The swollen ice wrap around Alex Rodriguez's right knee looked as if it might burst and spray popcorn around the room in all directions. He sat down and kept his leg erect, but he couldn't keep a straight face when someone asked if he felt 100 percent physically.
''A hundred percent?'' he said, laughing. ''No, I'm about 15 years from being 100 percent.'' 
Well, maybe give or take. It was only 13 years ago that Rodriguez posted career highs in at-bats (686) and stolen bases (46) and also had 213 hits as a sleek yet powerful young shortstop in Seattle. The 2011 model, coming off arthroscopic surgery last month for a torn meniscus, has the unmistakable look of an American League elder, a 36-year-old designated-hitter-in-waiting.
As a reminder of what appears to be a fast-approaching Jurassic period, or because seldom does the publicity machine known as A-Rod plan anything without broadcasting it on all available channels, he dropped a couple of foul flies Tuesday night in a six-inning rehabilitation stint for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in a 2-0 loss to the Durham Bulls.
Under the minor league circumstances and the lights for the first time in weeks, it was all in good fun for Rodriguez -- ''a little entertainment value'' for the fans at PNC Field, home of the Yankees' AAA affiliate. The next stop is expected to be in Minnesota with the Yankees, but it is unlikely that he will play Thursday. Rodriguez went 1 for 2 with a run batted in and two walks with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Wednesday.
Once back, Rodriguez will reclaim third base, remember how to catch a pop-up and try to avoid finishing a season with fewer than 20 home runs (he currently has 13) for the first time since he became an everyday major leaguer.
''Hopefully I can come in and give them a shot in the arm and take it to the house the rest of the year,'' he said, while noting that the Yankees haven't exactly had to pray away a run-scoring (and victory) drought without him.
There is no more doubting that Rodriguez's days as the prototypical five-tool player and even the most feared bat in the Yankees' lineup -- not with Robinson Cano around -- are over. Age and mileage and possibly the chemical spikes he admittedly added to his spinach have taken their toll.
Assuming his knee is fixed and he is able to drive the ball, Rodriguez can still do damage. He is only one season removed from 125 runs batted in. October is coming, and with the likes of Texas, Detroit and Boston in mind, the Yankees will be a more dangerous team with Rodriguez for the next two months.
Increasingly and alarmingly, the larger question looming is: How will they manage to coexist for the next six years?
If you think Yankee Nation has been in deep distress and debate lately over the investment return from pitcher A. J. Burnett, imagine what awaits Rodriguez all the way through 2017 if his physical decline continues at the rate it has been going.
There was hip surgery in 2009, a visit to the disabled list last season for a calf injury and this year's breakdown to go along with eye-opening drop-offs in power numbers. Is it a stretch to imagine a day when Rodriguez's 10-year deal, which could earn him more than $300 million -- including bonus money for breaking the career home run record -- will be considered the most ill-advised player contract in the history of the game?
Come to think of it, that very characterization might be the most fitting punctuation to an era bloated by illusion and greed.
Because of the headlines Rodriguez has generated, with more possibly to come, he will ultimately bear the brunt of the contract abuse. He, of course, didn't give it to himself, no more than he made the former owner in Texas, Tom Hicks, hand him a $252 million deal a full decade ago.
Remember how Rodriguez opted out of that contract in 2007 and the Goldman Sachs people acted as intermediaries between player and team after negotiations collapsed and both sides announced they were moving on?
With the heavy hitters reaching out in his behalf, establishing another proud Wall Street legacy, Rodriguez called Hank Steinbrenner and had him at hello.
''Trust me, he would have gotten probably more,'' Steinbrenner said in 2007, referring to a market that did not exist. ''He is making a sacrifice to be a Yankee.''
Not long after, Steinbrenner was sent to his room by the family and replaced on public display by his more rational brother, Hal. Then came the steroid revelations that forever changed the A-Rod equation, and especially the economic value of his pursuit of Barry Bonds's home run record.
Now, that achievement is no sure thing, though becoming the designated hitter -- a wise move for Rodriguez and the Yankees, considering their lack of range on the left side of the infield -- should help. But can Rodriguez hit 137 home runs before his body cries no mas? Can he avoid more sordid revelations that might force baseball to suspend him?
In many ways, he remains the last vestige of the George Steinbrenner Yankees, a spectacle bought, overpaid for and impossible to ignore. On Tuesday night, a horde of wide-eyed fans pressed their faces against the windows of the room as Rodriguez told reporters how much he was enjoying his visit to Moosic and how playing with the wannabe Yankees ''kind of reconnects you to when I was back in the minor leagues, 18 years old.''
Oh, to be so young and innocent again.

HEADLINE: As Perry Sets Out on the Campaign Trail

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Perry Stands By Remarks on Fed Policy and Treason'' (news article, Aug. 17):
Gov. Rick Perry said of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, that ''printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost treacherous -- or treasonous in my opinion.'' He added, ''I don't know what y'all would do to him in Iowa, but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas.''
It's one thing to have serious disagreements with political opponents. It's a whole other thing to speak in ways that could suggest to others that your opponent is a traitor to our country and that violent acts against said person might well be appropriate. 
I was disappointed by Governor Perry's remarks, but not totally surprised by them. More and more, we are seeing too many of those holding extreme views both from the left and the right focusing not on issues, but on the people with whom they disagree.
Yesterday, it was George W. Bush who was equated with Hitler. Today, too many on the other side say it is President Obama who may not be a true American.
I am still hoping that the love I have for America that I know is shared by the vast majority of Americans will finally overcome the cruel rhetoric from the extreme edges of our political world, and that our elected leaders will finally get down to work to find common ground that can return us to a better road for our future.
IAN WACHSTEIN Collingswood, N.J., Aug. 17, 2011
To the Editor:
I know a lot of Texans, and not one of them I know would treat Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, ''ugly'' if he should ever visit the Lone Star state.
Texans pride themselves on their graciousness -- and tolerance of others' ideas and ideals.
ROGER WIDMEYER Houston, Aug. 17, 2011
The writerhas served in senior communications positions in Houston and Harris County, Texas.
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (''The Texas Unmiracle,'' column, Aug. 15) construes that ''Perrynomics amounts to ... a fallacy of composition: every state can't lure jobs away from every other state.''
Maybe so, but what every state can do, by reducing regulations and lowering wages, is lure jobs away from other countries, if for no other reason than to encourage American companies to maintain production (jobs) in this country.
JOHN MASTERS Cincinnati, Aug. 15, 2011
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman doesn't mention two important points.
First, in addition to the many incentives to relocate in Texas, the absence of a state income tax is right at the top of the list.
Second, and even more important, Gov. Rick Perry's task, if he should become president, will not be to lure population and business from one state to another. His challenge will be to transform the United States into the ''Texas'' of the global economy.
JOSEPH MELODY Los Angeles, Aug. 15, 2011
To the Editor:
Regarding Paul Krugman's point that almost 10 percent of Texan workers earn minimum wage or less, I have a suggestion: Gov. Rick Perry's jobs plan should be called ''Would You Like Fries With That?''

HEADLINE: New York Film Festival to Close With George Clooney Movie

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
''The Descendants,''Alexander Payne's first feature since his 2004 film ''Sideways,'' will be the closing night selection of the New York Film Festival, the Film Society of Lincoln Center announced on Wednesday along with the roster of 27 films that will be presented in the festival's main slate.
Adapted from the Kaui Hart Hemmings novel, ''The Descendants'' tells the story of Matt King, a character played by George Clooney, who is the heir of a land-owning family in Hawaii who must learn to parent his two daughters after his wife is injured in a boating accident. The film, whose cast also includes Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller as King's daughters, will be presented at the festival on Oct. 16 at Alice Tully Hall, and is scheduled for theatrical release on Nov. 23. 
Among the films on the festival's main slate are Abel Ferrara's ''4:44: Last Day on Earth,'' starring Willem Dafoe and Shanyn Leigh as a couple preparing for a possible apocalypse; the Martin Scorsese documentary ''George Harrison: Living in the Material World''; Sean Durkin's debut feature, ''Martha Marcy May Marlene,'' starring Elizabeth Olsen; Lars von Trier's ''Melancholia''; the Wim Wenders 3-D film ''Pina,'' a tribute to the choreographer Pina Bausch and her Tanztheater Wuppertal; Steve McQueen's ''Shame''; and ''This Is Not a Film,'' by the Iranian directors Jafar Panahi and Mojtaba Mirtahmasb.
Descriptions of all the features being presented at the New York Film Festival and provided by the Film Society of Lincoln Center appear below.
4:44: LAST DAY ON EARTH Abel Ferrara, 2011, USA, 82min How would we spend our final hours on Earth? And what does how we choose to die say about how we have chosen to live? In the hands of the inimitable Abel Ferrara (Go Go Tales, NYFF '07), this thought experiment takes on a visceral immediacy. With the planet on the verge of extinction, a New York couple (Willem Dafoe and Shanyn Leigh) cycle through moments of anxiety, ecstacy, and torpor. As they sink into the havens of sex and art, and Skype last goodbyes in a Lower East Side apartment filled with screens bearing tidings of doom and salvation, the film becomes one of Ferrara's most potent and intimate expressions of spiritual crisis. An apocalyptic trance film, 4:44 is also a mournful valentine to Ferrara's beloved New York: the director's first fiction feature to be filmed entirely in the city in over a decade, and coming 10 years after the September 11 attacks, a haunting vision of doom in the lower Manhattan skyline.
THE ARTIST Michel Hazanavicius, 2011, France, 90min An honest-to-goodness black-and-white silent picture made by modern French filmmakers in Hollywood, USA, ''The Artist'' is a spirited, hilarious and moving delight. A sensation in Cannes, Michel Hazanavicius' playful love letter to the movies' early days spins on a variation on an ''A Star Is Born''-like relationship between a dashing Douglas Fairbanks-style star (Jean Dujardin, who won the best actor prize in Cannes) whose career wanes with the coming of sound and a dazzling young actress (Berenice Bejo) whose popularity skyrockets at the same time. Meticulously made in the 1.33 aspect ratio with intertitles and a superb score, ''The Artist'' has great fun with silent film conventions just as it rigorously adheres to them, turning its abundant love for the look and ethos of the 1920s into a treat that will be warmly embraced by movie lovers of every persuasion. With James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller and John Goodman as a definitive cigar-chomping studio boss.
CARNAGE Roman Polanski, 2011, France/Germany/Poland Summoning up the sinister from beneath the veneer of normalcy has always been Roman Polanski's specialty, so it's no surprise that the great director does such a smashing job of putting Yasmina Reza's 2009 Tony-winning play ''God of Carnage'' on the screen. With the expert cast of Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christopher Waltz and John C. Reilly, Reza's explosively comic X-ray of the anger and venality lying just under the surface of the outwardly civilized behavior of two New York City couples has been fully realized. Returning to the New York Film Festival with a feature for the first time since he presented his debut work, Knife in the Water, at the very first festival in 1963, Polanski pries open the true nature of these characters in something of a companion piece to his previous New York-set film, ''Rosemary's Baby.'' Although it was filmed in Paris, the Brooklyn locale is as convincingly rendered as are the alternately uproarious and devastating revelations of human nature.
CORPO CELESTE Alice Rohrwacher, 2011, Italy/Switzerland/France, 100min ''Seeing the Spirit is like wearing really cool sunglasses,'' according to the instructor of 13-year old Marta's (Yle Vianello) catechism class. Such observations introduce Marta to the religious climate in the small seaside Calabrian town to which she, her mother and older sister have just moved from Switzerland. Marta is sent to the local church to prepare for her Catholic confirmation and (hopefully) make some new friends. But the religion she finds there is mainly strange: the way it dominates people's lives is unlike anything she's ever experienced. Alice Rohrwacher's extraordinarily impressive debut feature chronicles Martha's private duel with the Church, carried out under the shadow of the physical changes coursing through her. Rohrwacher is not interested in pointing out heroes and villains, but instead in offering a perceptive look at how the once all-powerful Church has dealt with its waning influence.
A DANGEROUS METHOD David Cronenberg, 2011, France/Ireland/UK/Germany/Canada, 99min David Cronenberg, a filmmaker with a peerless grasp on the mysteries of the mind and the body, turns his attention to a seminal chapter in the founding of psychoanalysis. Adapted from Christopher Hampton's play A Talking Cure, A Dangerous Method charts the relationship between Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and his protege turned dissenter Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender), as it was shaped by the case of Sabine Spielrein (Keira Knightley), a young Russian Jewish patient of Jung's. Cronenberg brilliantly dramatizes not just the rivalry and rupture between two pioneers who defined a field but also the birth of their groundbreaking theories of the unconscious and the forces of Eros and Thanatos. Featuring an electrifying trio of lead actors, who turn near-mythic figures into flesh and blood, this is a film of tremendous vigor and ambition, a historical drama that brings ideas to life.
THE DESCENDANTS Alexander Payne, 2011, USA, 115min In his first film since the Oscar-winning Sideways, writer-director Alexander Payne once again proves himself a master of the kind of smart, sharp, deeply felt comedy that was once the hallmark of Billy Wilder and Jean Renoir. Based on the bestselling novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, The Descendants stars George Clooney as Matt King, the heir of a prominent Hawaiian land-owning family whose life is turned upside-down when his wife is critically injured in a boating accident. Accustomed to being ''the back-up parent,'' King suddenly finds himself center stage in the lives of his two young daughters (excellent newcomers Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller), while at the same time being forced to decide the fate of a vast plot of unspoiled land his family has owned since the 1860s. Rooted in Clooney's beautifully understated performance, Payne's film is an uncommonly perceptive portrait of marriage, family and community, suffused with humor and tragedy and wrapped in a warm human glow. A Fox Searchlight release.
FOOTNOTE Joseph Cedar, 2011, Israel, 106min Thanks to a clerical error, Eliezer Shkolnik, a respected if little-known Talmudic scholar, is informed that he's won the coveted Israel Prize; in truth, the prize was meant for his son, Uziel, a much more flamboyant, widely-read Talmudist. The authorities ask Uziel to help them rectify the situation, but Uziel argues the case for his father's deserving the honor; meanwhile, Eliezer plans to use the occasion as an opportunity to intellectually take down his son and the whole generation of a la mode Talmudists. Winner of the prize for Best Screenplay at Cannes, New York born-and-trained Israeli filmmaker Joseph Cedar has here created the wryest of Jewish comedies, an emotional competition that pits father against son, built around the understanding of sacred texts. Rarely has the weight of a culture's intellectual past been depicted so forecefully, nor shown to be as vibrant. A Sony Pictures Classic release.
GEORGE HARRISON: LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD Martin Scorsese, 2011, USA, 208min Rich in mesmerizing archival footage, Martin Scorsese's expansive documentary on the Beatles' lead guitarist-and of one of the greatest musicians of the 1960s and '70s-traces in detail all aspects of Harrison's professional and personal life. Friends (Eric Clapton, Eric Idle), family (wives Patti Boyd and Olivia Harrison), and band mates (Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr) reflect on Harrison's mid-'60s embrace of Indian mysticism and music, which forever changed the sound of the Fab Four. Harrison's spirituality also defines his masterful solo work, especially the 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass, produced by Phil Spector, another subject interviewed in depth. Until his untimely death in 2001, Harrison remained fiercely committed to his music and other passions (including film producing), earning the admiration of all who were lucky enough to work with him.
GOODBYE FIRST LOVE Mia Hansen-Lve, 2011, France/Germany, 108min In her exceptional third feature, writer-director Mia Hansen-Lve (The Father of My Children, ND/NF 2010) shows once again her talent for capturing the agony and the ecstasy of adolescence. Besotted teenagers Sullivan (Sebastian Urzendowsky) and Camille (Lola Creton) struggle, as all couples must, with a painful push-pull dynamic, heightened by the young man's decision to leave Paris and travel through South America. Over the course of eight years, we watch Camille, initially devastated by her boyfriend's departure, emerge with new passions, intellectual and otherwise. Touchingly illuminating the indelible imprint that first romance leaves, Hansen-Lve's film also explores the hard-won satisfaction of leaving the past behind. A Sundance Selects release.
THE KID WITH A BIKE Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, 2011, Belgium/France, 87min Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival, the latest film by Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne centers on Cyril, a restless 11-year-old boy (terrific newcomer Thomas Doret) placed in a children's home after being abandoned by his father. Unwilling to face the fact that parents are imperfect people, Cyril runs away to his former apartment block in search of both dad and his abandoned bicycle. Instead, he meets Samantha (the excellent Cecile de France), a kind hairdresser who helps to retrieve his bike and eventually agrees to become his weekend guardian. But literally and figuratively, Cyril isn't out of the woods just yet. Shooting once more in the Belgian seaport town of Seraing, the Dardennes have created another poetic, universally resonant drama about parents, children and moral responsibility. A Sundance Selects release.
LE HAVRE Aki Kaurismaki, 2011, Finland/France/Germany, 103min The latest deadpan treat from Aki Kaurismaki (The Man Without a Past, NYFF '02) was inspired, the director has said, by his desire to have been born a generation earlier, so that he could have witnessed the Resistance during World War II. Thus Le Havre abounds with sly references to classic Resistance dramas from Port of Shadows to Casablanca as it tells the whimsical tale of Marcel Marx (Andre Wilms), a noted Parisian author now living in self-imposed exile in the titular port city. Dividing most of his time between his neighborhood bar and caring for his bedridden wife (longtime Kaurismaki muse Kati Outinen), Marcel finds himself alive with a new sense of purpose when he comes to the aid of a young African on the run from immigration police and trying to reunite with his mother in London. Beautifully shot in Kaurismaki's signature shades of muted blue, brown and green, with scene-stealing appearances by French New Wave icon Jean-Pierre Leaud and a dog named Laika, Le Havre is a gentle yet profound comedy of friendship, random acts of kindness and small acts of revolution. A Janus Films release.
THE LONELIEST PLANET Julia Loktev, 2011, USA/Germany, 113min This staggeringly acute examination of the fissures that develop between couples from Julia Loktev (Day Night Day Night, ND/NF 2007) proves that even the most wide-open spaces can feel suffocating during romantic discord. Nica (Hani Furstenberg) and Alex (Gael Garcia Bernal), a few months away from their wedding, take a hiking trip in the Caucasus in Georgia, led by tour guide Dato (Bidzina Gujabidze). Nica and Alex appear to be completely in-sync partners, wildly attracted to each other and sharing the same interests. But a split-second decision by Alex proves horrifying to Nica and sets off impenetrable, stony silences. In a film in which so much is communicated nonverbally, Furstenberg and Bernal astoundingly uncover the toxic, erosive effects of disappointment and resentment.
MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE Sean Durkin, 2011, USA, 101min Sean Durkin's haunting first feature, about a young woman's halting attempts to undo the psychic terror of the cult she's just escaped, heralds the arrival of a remarkable new talent. Fleeing a Manson-like Catskills compound at dawn, Martha (Elizabeth Olsen, leading an excellent cast) reconnects with her older sister, Lucy (Sarah Paulson), a bourgeois New Yorker who takes in her sibling at the Connecticut country house she shares with her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy). Lucy remains unaware of exactly what happened to Martha over the past few years-details that Durkin slowly but powerfully unveils in uncanny, disorienting flashbacks. The film's gorgeous, painterly compositions have the chilling effect of suggesting that even our worst nightmares still retain a seductive allure. A Fox Searchlight release.
MELANCHOLIA Lars von Trier, 2011, Denmark/Sweden/France/Germany/Italy, 135min The end of the world-and the collapse of the spirit-has never been depicted as beautifully and wrenchingly as in Melancholia, the latest provocation from Lars von Trier (Antichrist, NYFF '09). The title refers both to a destructive planet ''that has been hiding behind the sun'' and the crippling depression of new bride Justine (a revelatory Kirsten Dunst, rightful winner of the Best Actress award at Cannes this year), whose mental illness is so severe that she drives away her groom during their disastrous wedding reception. As the extinction of the planet looms ever larger, Justine is desperately tended to by her sister, Claire (an equally magnificent Charlotte Gainsbourg), herself gripped by anxiety over the impending doomsday. Melancholia's premise may be science fiction, but the feelings of despair it plumbs are the most heart-felt human drama. A Magnolia Pictures release.
MISS BALA Gerardo Naranjo, 2011, Mexico, 113min One of the most exciting young talents around, the Mexican director Gerardo Naranjo (I'm Gonna Explode, NYFF '08) approaches the hot-button topic of drug violence through the perspective of an unlikely, unwitting heroine: a Tijuana beauty pageant contestant (Stephanie Sigman) who stumbles into the path of ruthless cartel operatives and corrupt officials. Although inspired by a true story, Miss Bala avoids docudrama cliches and tabloid sensationalism, and instead evokes the pervasive climate of fear and confusion that has enveloped daily life in some increasingly lawless pockets of northern Mexico. Using long takes and fluid, precise camera work, Naranjo fashions a highly original thriller: an anguished and harrowing mood piece with an undertow of bleakly absurdist humor and moments of heart-stopping action.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN Simon Curtis, 2011, UK One of the most exciting actresses working today, Michelle Williams accomplishes the near-impossible-portraying Marilyn Monroe as an actual person, not just an easily caricatured icon-in this charming bio-pic centering around the production of Laurence Olivier's film The Prince and the Showgirl. Based on two memoirs by Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), who worked as an assistant on Olivier's film, My Week With Marilyn depicts Monroe's numerous clashes with her imperious, classically trained director (played with great relish by Kenneth Branagh), maddened by his star's method acting and her ever-present drama coach, Paula Strasberg (Zoe Wanamaker). Williams captures not only Monroe's notorious fragility, both on-screen and off-, but also her magical, unclassifiable charisma. A Weinstein Company release.
ONCE UPON A TIME IN ANATOLIA Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2011, Turkey, 150min Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes, Nuri Bilge Ceylan's latest begins as a small caravan of cars snakes its way through the nocturnal countryside, looking for where a murdered man was buried. Yet every time the confessed killer points out the grave, the gravediggers come up empty; much of the landscape looks alike, it's dark out, and anyway the killer claims he was drunk. As the increasingly frustrating investigation wears on, far more is revealed than where the body is buried; through quick looks, furtive gestures and offhand bits of dialogue, Ceylan (Climates, NYFF 2006) reveals in this seemingly pacific Turkish outback a festering world of jealousies and resentments, as the story behind the murder gradually emerges. Impeccably photographed (by Gokhan Tiryaki) and with a stand-out performance by Taner Birsel as a police inspector, this is Ceylan's most impressive film yet.
PINA Wim Wenders, 2011, Germany/France/UK, 106min Here revolutionizing the dance film just as he did the music documentary in Buena Vista Social Club, Wim Wenders began planning this project with legendary choreographer Pina Bausch in the months before her untimely death, selecting the pieces to be filmed and discussing the filmmaking strategy. Impressed by recent innovations in 3D, Wenders decided to experiment with the format for this tribute to Bausch and her Tanztheater Wuppertal; the result sets the standard against which all future uses of 3D to record performance will be measured. Not only are the beauty and sheer exhilaration of the dances and dancers powerfully rendered, but the film also captures the sense of the world that Bausch so brilliantly expressed in all her pieces. Longtime members of the Tanztheater recreate many of their original roles in such seminal works as ''Cafe Muller,'' ''Le Sacred du Printemps,'' and ''Kontakthof.'' A Sundance Selects release.
PLAY Ruben Ostlund, 2011, Sweden/Rance/Denmark, 124min A deliberately provoked racial incident, based on numerous similar real-life transgressions, is played for all it's worth in ''Play.'' Swedish writer-director Ruben Ostlund has developed mesmerizing visual strategies based on long takes and fixed camera positions to relate a disturbing tale of how five savvy African immigrant boys in Gothenberg take advantage of the liberal guilt and placating temperament of three local kids to rob them and take them for a ride to unknown destinations. Social, racial and political credos are twisted, pulled inside out and stood on their head by this bracing and confronting work, which will challenge the assumptions of many a viewer. Dazzlingly shot on the new Red 4K camera, ''Play'' is a considerable achievement both formally and dramatically that poses more questions than it answers as it lays bare attitudes lurking beneath the surface tranquility of Scandinavian life-a peacefulness that, as we have seen of late, can sometimes be tragically shattered.
POLICEMAN Nadav Lapid, 2011, Israel/France, 100min A boldly conceived drama pivoting on the initially unrelated activities of an elite anti-terrorist police unit and some wealthy young anarchists, ''Policeman'' is a striking first feature from writer-director Nadav Lapid. Provocatively timely in light of recent unrest tied to social and economic inequities in Israel, this is a powerfully physical film in its depiction of the muscular, borderline sensual way the macho cops relate to one another, as well as for the emphatic style with which the opposing societal forces are contrasted and finally pitted against one another. Although the youthful revolutionaries come off as petulant and spoiled, their point about the growing gap between the Israeli haves and have-nots cannot be ignored, even by the policemen sent on a rare mission to engage fellow countrymen rather than Palestinians. A winner of three prizes at the Jerusalem Film Festival and a special jury prize at Locarno.
A SEPARATION Asghar Farhadi, 2011, Iran, 123min A critical and audience favorite at this year's Berlin Film Festival, where it won the Golden Bear as well as acting prizes for all four lead performers, A Separation is an Iranian Rashomon of searing family drama that turns into an unexpectedly gripping legal thriller. The film, directed by Asghar Farhadi, begins with married couple Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moadi) obtaining coveted visas to leave Iran for the United States, where Simin hopes to offer a better future to their 11-year-old daughter. But Nader doesn't feel comfortable abandoning his elderly, Alzheimer's-stricken father, and so the couple embark on a trial separation. To help care for the old man, Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a pregnant, deeply religious woman who takes the job unbeknownst to her husband (Shahab Hosseini), an out-of-work cobbler. Almost immediately there are complications, culminating in a sudden burst of violence that constantly challenges our own perceptions of who (if anyone) is to blame and what really happened. A Sony Pictures Classics release.
SHAME Steve McQueen, 2011, UK, 99min In his much-anticipated encore to his superb first feature, ''Hunger,'' British artist Steve McQueen reunites with the extraordinary Michael Fassbender in the ferociously sexual drama ''Shame.'' An explosive portrait of a sex addict walking a tightrope between presentable respectability and the wild side, this incendiary drama captures the anger and the ecstasy of its anti-hero's incessant drive for conquest in contemporary New York, where any woman he meets he believes is ripe for the taking. Madly attractive but with cruelly cold eyes, this compulsive Casanova finds his style cramped by the abrupt arrival of his unstable sister (Cary Mulligan), whose insecurities crack open issues of his own. Daring, stylistically brilliant and erotically charged, McQueen's heady, beautiful and disturbing film seems as determined to leave the viewer unsettled as it will surely serve to further propel Fassbender into the front ranks of contemporary screen actors.
SLEEPING SICKNESS Ulrich Kohler, 2011, Germany/France/Netherlands, 91min This remarkably assured third feature by the young German director Ulrich Kohler-winner of Best Director at this year's Berlin Film Festival-transports us to Cameroon, where German doctor Ebbo (Pierre Bokma) and his wife have spent two decades combating an epidemic of sleeping sickness in the local villages. Soon, they will return to Europe and to lives long ago put on hold, and this has created a crisis for Ebbo, who, like Joseph Conrad's Kurtz, has spent too much time up river to ever come back down. Meanwhile, a young black doctor-a Frenchman born to Congolese parents-travels to Africa to evaluate the efficiency of Ebbo's program. But when he arrives, nothing goes according to plan, and despite his heritage, he feels very much a stranger in a strange land. Finally, the two subjects of this haunting meditation on Africa's past and future dovetail-effortlessly, seamlessly-and the cumulative impact is stunning.
THE SKIN I LIVE IN Pedro Almodovar, 2011, Spain, 113min At ''The Cinema Inside Me'' program at the 2009 NYFF, Pedro Almodovar surprised many when he spoke of his great love for American horror and science fiction films-a clue, it turns out, to what he was then just planning. With his new film, Almodovar ventures headlong into those very genres. Dr. Robert Ledgard (a welcome return for Antonio Banderas) is a world famous plastic surgeon who argues for the development of new, tougher human skin; unbeknownst to others, Dr. Ledgard has been trying to put his theory into practice, keeping a young woman, Vera (Elena Anaya), imprisoned in his mansion while subjecting her to an increasingly bizarre regime of treatments. Fascinated by the thin layer of appearance that stands between our perception of someone and that person's inner essence, Almodovar here addresses that continuing theme in his work in a bold, unsettling exploration of identity. A Sony Pictures Classic release.
THE STUDENT Santiago Mitre, 2011, Argentina, 110min Politics is a game, a seduction, and a vicious cycle in Santiago Mitre's gripping, fine-tuned debut, the story of Roque (Esteban Lamothe), a university student who falls for a radicalized teacher and organizer (Romina Paula) and soon finds himself entangled with Buenos Aires campus activists, in a world as heated and byzantine as the one inhabited by the student revolutionaries of the mythic 1960s. Anchored by Lamothe's nuanced, charismatic performance, The Student complicates the classic bildungsroman narrative of education and disillusionment, emphasizing the endless adaptability-or malleability-of its protagonist. An urgent attempt to grapple with the legacy of Peronism in present-day Argentina, the film abounds with telling details and rich local color. But it's also a truly universal political thriller, one that illuminates the conspiratorial pleasure, the ruthless hustle, and the moral fog of politics as it is practiced.
THIS IS NOT A FILM Jafar Panahi and Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, 2011, Iran, 75min Accused of collusion against the Iranian regime and currently appealing a prison sentence and a ban from filmmaking, Jafar Panahi (a four-time NYFF veteran with films like Offside and Crimson Gold) collaborated with the documentarian Mojtaba Mirtahmasb on a remarkable day-in-the-life chronicle that, as with many great Iranian films, finds a rich middle ground between fiction and reality. Shot with a digital camera and an iPhone, the movie is almost entirely confined to the director's apartment, where he discusses his films and an unrealized script, while the outside world imposes itself through phone calls, television news, a few comic interruptions, and the sound of New Year's fireworks. Far more than the modest home movie it initially seems to be, This Is Not a Film is an act of courage and a statement of political and moral conviction: surprising, radical, and enormously moving.
THE TURIN HORSE Bela Tarr and Agnes Hranitzky, 2011, Hungary/France/Germany/Switzerland/USA, 146min After witnessing a carriage driver whipping his horse, the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche ran to the scene, threw his arms around the horse and then collapsed; he would spend the next, final ten years of his life in almost total silence. Focusing not on Nietzsche but on the driver and his family, Bela Tarr (Satantango, NYFF 1994) and his longtime collaborator Agnes Hranitzky, working from a screenplay by Tarr and novelist Laszlo Krasznhorkai, create a mesmerizing, provocative meditation on the unsettling connectedness of things, in which the resonance of actions and gestures continues long after their actual occurrence. Beautifully photographed (by Fred Kelemen) on the austere, unforgiving Hungarian plain lands, The Turin Horse challenges us to enter into a world just beyond the one we experience daily. Winner of the Silver Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival. A Cinema Guild release.

HEADLINE: Bashing E.P.A. Is New Theme In G.O.P. Race

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency is emerging as a favorite target of the Republican presidential candidates, who portray it as the very symbol of a heavy-handed regulatory agenda imposed by the Obama administration that they say is strangling the economy.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota wants to padlock the E.P.A.'s doors, as does former Speaker Newt Gingrich. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas wants to impose an immediate moratorium on environmental regulation.
Representative Ron Paul of Texas wants environmental disputes settled by the states or the courts. Herman Cain, a businessman, wants to put many environmental regulations in the hands of an independent commission that includes oil and gas executives. Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, thinks most new environmental regulations should be shelved until the economy improves.
Only Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, has a kind word for the E.P.A., and that is qualified by his opposition to proposed regulation of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming. 
Opposition to regulation and skepticism about climate change have become tenets of Republican orthodoxy, but they are embraced with extraordinary intensity this year because of the faltering economy, high fuel prices, the Tea Party passion for smaller government and an activist Republican base that insists on strict adherence to the party's central agenda.
But while attacks on the E.P.A., climate-change science and environmental regulation more broadly are surefire applause lines with many Republican primary audiences, these views may prove a liability in the general election, pollsters and analysts say. The American people, by substantial majorities, are concerned about air and water pollution, and largely trust the E.P.A., national surveys say.
''Not only are these positions irresponsible, they're politically problematic,'' said David Jenkins of Republicans for Environmental Protection, a group that believes that conservation should be a core value of the party. ''The whole idea that you have to bash the E.P.A. and run away from climate change to win a Republican primary has never been borne out. Where's the evidence?''
But the leading Republican candidates are all linking environmental regulation to jobs and the economy, suggesting that the nation cannot afford measures that impose greater costs on businesses and consumers. Mrs. Bachmann drew loud applause 10 days ago at a rally in Iowa when she declared: ''I guarantee you the E.P.A. will have doors locked and lights turned off, and they will only be about conservation. It will be a new day and a new sheriff in Washington, D.C.''
In an earlier debate she said the agency should be renamed the ''job-killing organization of America.'' She has called global-warming science a hoax.
The White House disputes the accusation that it is burdening the economy with regulations. It says that it issued fewer new rules in its first two years than the George W. Bush administration issued in its final two years.
''This administration has shown a clear commitment to taking steps to protect our families from dangerous pollution, while at the same time ensuring those steps are implemented in a way that minimizes costs, maximizes flexibility and does not impede our economic recovery,'' said Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman.
Mr. Perry has been at war with the E.P.A. almost since the day he took office as governor. He is leading a group of states in a lawsuit seeking to block the agency from putting in place rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, refineries and other large sources.
On Monday, Mr. Perry called on Mr. Obama to halt all regulations because, Mr. Perry said, ''his E.P.A. regulations are killing jobs all across America.''
In his book, ''Fed Up, Our Fight to Save America from Washington,'' Mr. Perry described global-warming science as ''one contrived phony mess that is falling apart under its own weight'' and a ''secular carbon cult'' led by false prophets like Al Gore.
Such regulatory and financial sentiments are shared by many Republicans in Congress and are encouraged by industries that are reliable financial supporters of Republican candidates -- the petroleum industry, utilities, coal companies, heavy manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Republican presidential candidates cross these interests at their peril.
''It remains to be seen of course, but my guess is that in order to get the nomination you're going to have to be pretty solid on these issues,'' said Myron Ebell, of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian research and advocacy organization in Washington. ''It's going to be a litmus test or shorthand way for voters to see how the candidate thinks about not only big issues like global warming and energy rationing policies, but it's indicative of other things as well.''
Mr. Ebell said that Mr. Romney, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Huntsman, who have all said that global warming is real and at least tentatively attributed it to human actions, would suffer for it in the Republican primaries.
Mr. Perry's anti-E.P.A. stance has been popular with Republicans in Texas and could carry him far in the primaries, said Ken Kramer, director of the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club. It may prove a liability in a general election, Mr. Kramer said.
''That kind of rhetoric is popular with a certain segment here,'' he said. ''But a lot of other Texans, especially those in major cities with air pollution problems, are not necessarily supportive of the governor's war on the E.P.A.''
He added, ''My sense is there's definitely a difference between what plays well in Texas from a political standpoint and what plays well in other parts of country.''
Mr. Paul holds rather more complex views of the environment and regulation. He generally favors a hands-off approach to federal regulation, although he has backed some tax incentives for clean energy development.
He opposes tax breaks for oil and gas companies but supports Arctic drilling. He is skeptical about climate change but said in 2008 that there were unexplained anomalies in global temperatures.
Mr. Romney's position may be the most complicated of all. In Massachusetts, he proposed plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and explored creation of a regional carbon cap-and-trade program. He has mostly backed away from those positions, but he says there is still an important place for regulation.
''I believe we should keep our air and our water clean,'' Mr. Romney said at a town hall-style meeting in New Hampshire last month.
''Do I support the E.P.A.?'' he said. ''In much of its mission, yes; but in some of its mission, no.''
Despite a Supreme Court ruling to the contrary, Mr. Romney said the federal law did not give the agency authority to regulate carbon emissions. ''I don't think that was the intent of the original legislation,'' he said, ''and I don't think carbon is a pollutant in the sense of harming our bodies.''

HEADLINE: Photo Turns U.S. Envoy Into a Lesson For Chinese

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The word on the street these days, whether in Washington or Beijing, is that the United States is on the decline and China is on the ascent. But it has taken nothing more than a cup of coffee and a backpack to show that American officials can still evoke awe, respect and envy among Chinese, even if unwittingly.
A photograph taken last Friday of Gary F. Locke, the new United States ambassador to China, buying coffee with his 6-year-old daughter and carrying a black backpack at a Starbucks in the Seattle airport has gone viral on the Chinese Internet. The seemingly banal scene has bewildered and disarmed Chinese because they are used to seeing their own officials indulge in privileged lives often propped up by graft and bribery and lavish expense accounts.
It was an unintended charm offensive, but this humble image of American officialdom has no doubt helped pave the way for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who landed in China on Wednesday night for three days of meetings with Chinese leaders. 
Mr. Locke and his family were waiting to fly to Beijing when a Chinese-American businessman shot the photograph and posted it on Sina Weibo, a popular Chinese social networking site. It has been reposted over 40,000 times and has generated thousands of comments. State news organizations have weighed in with favorable articles about Mr. Locke, a former governor of Washington State and President Obama's first Commerce secretary, who on Tuesday presented his credentials to President Hu Jintao of China to start his posting.
The first impression from the Starbucks episode has been bolstered by another photograph that shows Mr. Locke, his wife, Mona, and their three children carrying their own luggage after landing at Beijing Capital International Airport. Chinese who saw them then spread the word that the family had gotten into an anonymous minivan because a formal sedan that had been sent to pick them up was too small.
''To most Chinese people, the scene was so unusual it almost defied belief,'' Chen Weihua, an editor at China Daily, an official English-language newspaper, wrote in an article Wednesday.
Cheng Li, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who studies Chinese elite politics, said in an e-mail: ''Ambassador Locke's photo contrasts sharply with the image of the Chinese officials who often live in a secret, insulated, very privileged fashion. This may explain why some Chinese leaders tend to be out of touch with the real life of the ordinary Chinese people -- members of the urban middle class, not to mention the farmers and migrant workers.''
The photographs of Mr. Locke have landed in a summer when the Chinese are asking profound questions about whether their officials are still committed to that famous Maoist mantra ''Serve the people.'' The issue was brought into sharp relief in late July by the high-speed rail crash in the eastern city of Wenzhou that killed 40 people and injured 191. Many blamed the government, and specifically the Railway Ministry, for incompetence and callousness, and the public pressure has led to the dismissals of officials.
In October 2010, anger erupted in China over an episode in which a 22-year-old drunken driver, trying to avoid arrest for killing one woman in an accident and injuring another, invoked the name of his father, a senior police official: ''Go ahead, sue me if you dare. My father is Li Gang!'' That phase became a euphemism for official arrogance and impunity.
Chinese fed up with self-indulgent behavior by officials often post photographs on the Internet of bureaucrats being chauffeured around in black Audis, buying Louis Vuitton handbags for wives or mistresses and playing golf or strolling on beaches.
The uproar over the photograph of Mr. Locke was not the first time the Chinese had been captivated by the sight of a senior American official performing seemingly humble tasks. In November 2009, President Obama, on his first trip to China, inadvertently set off a firestorm of commentary when he stepped out of an airplane in Shanghai holding a black umbrella during a rain shower. Chinese officials often have aides hold umbrellas above their heads.
The commentary on Mr. Locke written by Mr. Chen, the China Daily editor, was published under the headline ''Backpack Makes a Good Impression.'' Mr. Chen wrote: ''How could someone who holds the rank of ambassador to a big country not have someone carry his luggage, and not use a chauffeured limousine? In China even a township chief, which is not really that high up in the hierarchy, will have a chauffeur and a secretary to carry his bag.''
He concluded: ''Perhaps it is time for Chinese dignitaries to follow the example of humble Locke.''
The businessman who took Mr. Locke's photograph, Tang Zhaohui, said in a post on his microblog that even Mr. Locke's exchange with the Starbucks barista reflected humility. Mr. Locke tried using a discount coupon to pay, Mr. Tang said, but the barista would not honor it for some reason. Without complaining, Mr. Locke paid with a credit card.
To many Chinese, what has been most noteworthy about Mr. Locke, 61, barring his coffee-buying habits, is that he is the first Chinese-American ambassador here. His ancestral home is in Taishan County, Guangdong Province, from which vast numbers of people have emigrated to the United States. (Full disclosure: Mr. Locke and this reporter, whose ancestral home is also in Taishan, are cousins, though have yet to meet.)
On Sunday, as Mr. Locke stood with his family at a news conference outside his home in Beijing, he made a nod to his ties to China in a short speech. ''I am both humbled and honored to stand here before you as a child of Chinese immigrants representing America, the land of my birth, and the American values my family holds dear,'' he said.
Mr. Locke's first significant duty here is to help shepherd Mr. Biden through meetings, formal dinners and staged photo events. Mr. Biden's tour, his first as vice president, will take him through Beijing and the western city of Chengdu. He will spend time with China's presumed next leader, Xi Jinping, and discuss a variety of issues, including economic policy and the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran.
But first, Mr. Biden did his part to show he was a man of the people. Instead of going straight to the St. Regis Beijing Hotel from the airport, Mr. Biden and his entourage made an unannounced drive through the cold rain to the Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium to watch a basketball match between the Georgetown Hoyas and a team from Shanxi Province. Mr. Biden took a seat in the front row behind the visitors' bench, to the applause of dozens of Georgetown fans. Mr. Biden told reporters that he had received many requests from the Georgetown community to attend. He and Mr. Locke sat beside each other.

HEADLINE: Earnings Are Higher For Target And Others

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Target Corporation reported a bigger-than-expected increase in quarterly profit on Wednesday and forecast a more profitable year than analysts had been anticipating, as its credit card business continued to grow and sales heated up with the summer weather. 
Retail results were highlighting a split between middle- and upper-income shoppers, who might be waiting a bit before they buy, versus the unemployed and low-income workers struggling to make ends meet.
''While optimism at all income levels has improved since the recession, wealthy households continue to be the most optimistic,'' Kathryn Tesija, Target's executive vice president for merchandising, said during a conference call.
''The 20 percent of households with the highest incomes are shopping more often and spending more, while the other 80 percent have been cutting trips and spending less,'' Ms. Tesija said about retailers' experience in general.
Target's shoppers are buying closer to when they need things, so the company said it was a bit too early to fully judge August sales, which include back-to-school purchases.
August sales have been within Target's forecast for an increase of about 5 percent, though slightly below the increases in June and July, the chief financial officer, Douglas Scovanner said.
Target's same-store sales rose 4.5 percent in June, 4.1 percent in July and 3.9 percent in the second quarter.
Target was not the only retailer reporting better-than-expected results. Wal-Mart Stores said Tuesday that its profit rose more than expected.
On Wednesday, retailers such as BJ's Wholesale Club and the office-supply store Staples also reported results that surpassed expectations.
Staples' chief executive, Ronald L. Sargent, said he did not see a double-dip recession in the nation's economy, though the country is ''probably more likely to stay in economic purgatory for a while longer.''
Stock in Staples, which is based in Framingham, Mass., was flat, as was BJ's Wholesale, which is based in Westborough, Mass.
The Abercrombie & Fitch Company's quarter was also better than anticipated, but it warned of troubles as it enters ''a period of greater uncertainty,'' and its shares tumbled.
Abercrombie & Fitch, based in New Albany, Ohio, fell $6.15, to $64.87.
Target's move to add groceries to more stores has raised sales but pressured profitability because food carries lower margins than merchandise like apparel. Still, the second-quarter gross margin decline was not too steep. Gross margin dipped to 31.6 percent from 32 percent.
Target earned $704 million, or $1.03 a share, up from $679 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected Target to earn 97 cents a share.
Sales in the period, which ended July 30 and was the second quarter of Target's fiscal year, increased 5.1 percent to $15.9 billion.
Stock in Target, which is based in Minneapolis, rose $1.18, to $50.55 a share.

HEADLINE: Young Entrepreneur Sees Little Help In Washington

BYLINE: By HANNAH SELIGSON

 BODY:
One day last month, Neil Blumenthal, who is a young entrepreneur, found himself in an ornate room on Capitol Hill listening to a parade of politicians -- Senator Charles E. Schumer, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator John McCain, among others -- talk about how important young entrepreneurs were to the economy. Mr. Blumenthal, 31, one of the founders of Warby Parker, an online eyewear company that sells designer frames for less than $100, was among 150 young chief executives invited to Washington by Our Time, a youth advocacy group, to help start Buy Young, an initiative that encourages consumers to support companies owned by members of the millennial generation.
Mr. Blumenthal said he made the trip to learn more about how the federal government viewed entrepreneurship. Like a lot of founders of start-ups, he has little interest in hiring a lobbying firm, but he is all too aware of the impact government and politics can have on business. For one thing, his New York-based company, which he says has 40 employees and produced more than $1 million in revenue in its first six months, is subject to regulations that vary widely from state to state. 
The following is a condensed version of a recent conversation in which Mr. Blumenthal spoke, among other things, about what politicians don't understand about business, what he had to promise the Small Business Administration he wouldn't do with his borrowed money, and what the Bloomberg administration is doing right.
Q.What was it like trying to get an S.B.A. loan?
A. Finding a bank that did S.B.A.-term loans was a challenge. We were surprised that they needed two years and that banks had absolutely no flexibility. Many of the loan officers said we had a reputable business that was cash-flow positive and we had the most sophisticated business plan they'd ever seen, but they can't provide loans to people who don't have two years of tax returns.
Q.Isn't that a reasonable request when you're talking about using taxpayer dollars to guarantee a loan to a private company?
A. I understand where the banks are coming from. It probably was necessary to implement hard and fast rules to stop the bleeding when the crisis hit, but they should be looking at the policies and thinking: Does this make sense now?
Q. Was the application process difficult?
A. We had to sign so many documents that my hand hurt after I was done. I had to pledge not to open a zoo, swimming pool or aquarium. It struck me as strange. Yes, it's the bank's duty to do due diligence, but this was just a silly restriction.
Q.But there was a happy ending, right?
A. Yes, after being turned down by 15 banks, it was a personal relationship that introduced us to a regional bank in New Jersey that gave us a $200,000 loan.
Q.What reasons did the 15 banks give for turning you down?
A. They didn't have the authority to bypass the rule that you have to have two years of tax returns.
Q.Was your company profitable at the time?
A. Yes, we were profitable and we had a ton of traction. We had higher customer satisfaction scores than Zappos or Apple. A rational bank should have wanted to support us, even though we were a more risky bet than a company that had been around longer.
Q.What did the bank that lent you money do differently? Did it demand collateral?
A. We came through a personal relationship at a very high level at a regional bank in New Jersey that didn't have the draconian guidelines because their management was empowered to make decisions. For the $200,000 S.B.A.-backed loan that we got, the bank wanted $100,000 in collateral in either cash or marketable products. The reason they wanted so much collateral was that if we default, the regional bank is not going to go through the process of getting the money from the S.B.A. because it's so onerous.
Q.What did the loan allow you to do?
A. We were able to hire 20 employees. The loan also helped us with cash flow and to purchase inventory. If we didn't get that loan we would have had to go to the equity markets. Between the four of us co-founders, we own 90 percent of the company and that, in our opinion, is a good thing.
Q. What could Washington do to help?
A. The first is streamlining regulation. The rules of optical dispensing vary from state to state. Dispensing eyeglasses is not that complicated and even if it were complicated, there should be uniform rules. I'd also do something about the dearth of technical talent -- it is really difficult to hire Web developers and engineers. We aren't educating enough of these people. It was refreshing to hear the politicians talk about the STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math -- subjects, but come on, let's get some of the smart engineers into the country by granting them their H-1B visas.
Q. Are you involved in the political process?
A. We have never met with politicians. I don't know the first thing about how to get heard. My suspicion is that it's to donate a lot of money.
Q. Have you had any positive experiences with government?
A. What the Bloomberg administration is doing in New York City is nothing short of amazing. They are listening and problem-solving. The typical process to get permits from the Department of Buildings takes several weeks, and if you are in a landmarked building it takes even longer. The Bloomberg administration put together the New Business Acceleration Team that helps business cut through the red tape and get those approvals faster.
Q.You mentioned that some members of Congress didn't seem comfortable talking about technology. One senator, for example, didn't know what a Web developer is. Do you think members of Congress should be required to go to a class to get up to speed?
A. Who would design that class? I hope not members of Congress. I was pretty surprised at the lack of mastery.
Q.Do you think the government is doing enough to encourage entrepreneurship?
A. I was recently told a statistic that the majority of entrepreneurs are foreign-born or haven't graduated from college -- which means the best and the brightest and the most educated are not pursuing entrepreneurial paths. For whatever reason, we aren't encouraging these people to start their own business.
Q.Why do you think consumers should be encouraged to buy from young entrepreneurs?
A. I think consumers should buy whatever they want. I personally try to buy the best-quality items at the best price that do the least harm and from companies that are striving to do good -- many of those companies are run by young entrepreneurs. Still, I think it would be strange to be encouraging people to buy based on people's age rather than the strength of their product.
Q.But isn't that the cause that brought you to Washington?
A. I came to Washington primarily to meet other entrepreneurs. That being said, I was also curious to hear how our federal government was thinking about entrepreneurship.
Q.What do you make of the economic turmoil we've been experiencing?
A. It highlights that it might be too much to ask Washington to help with entrepreneurship when they can't even get the basics right, like maintaining a decent credit rating.
Q.Is your company doing anything different because of the economy?
A. We are not right now, but we do fear our ability to get working capital and debt. It's something we are monitoring closely.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Files Illegally Destroyed, Lawyer Says

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- An enforcement lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission says that the agency illegally destroyed files and documents related to thousands of early-stage investigations over the last 20 years, according to information released Wednesday by Congressional investigators.
The destroyed files comprise records of at least 9,000 preliminary inquiries into matters involving notorious individuals like Bernard L. Madoff, as well as several major Wall Street firms that later were the subject of scrutiny after the 2008 financial crisis, including Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup and Bank of America. 
The S.E.C. is the very agency that is charged with making sure that Wall Street firms retain records of their own activities, and has brought numerous enforcement cases against firms for failing to do so.
The agency's records were routinely destroyed under an S.E.C. policy, since changed, that called for the disposal of records of a preliminary inquiry that was closed if it did not get upgraded to a formal investigation, according to Congressional records and people involved in inquiries into the matter. The agency believes that both the original policy and the new rules comply with federal document-retention laws.
John Nester, an S.E.C. spokesman, said that while the agency was not required to retain all documents, it changed its policy last year regarding destruction of files for ''matters under investigation,'' the category of initial inquiry by the S.E.C.'s enforcement division that is the subject of the current scrutiny.
Changes were made to the S.E.C. policy after questions about the document destruction were raised in early 2010 by Darcy Flynn. Mr. Flynn, an employee of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division for 13 years, began a new job in January 2010 helping to manage the disposition of records for the division. Mr. Flynn, who continues to work at the S.E.C., has sought protection under federal whistle-blower laws.
The document disposal, which was first reported by Rolling Stone magazine on Wednesday, is the subject of inquiries by the Senate Judiciary Committee; the National Archives and Records Administration, which oversees laws governing federal agency records; and the inspector general of the S.E.C., according to the records and to people involved in the investigations.
In addition to whether the document disposal violated federal laws about government records, officials are concerned that the S.E.C. policy might have hindered later investigations into the same people or companies or covered up wrongdoing.
''These records may contain critical information that could be extremely useful in piecing together complex cases, even if not immediately pursued,'' Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who is the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote in a letter to the S.E.C. on Wednesday.
Mr. Nester declined to comment on Mr. Grassley's letter or on a letter to Mr. Grassley from a lawyer for Mr. Flynn that laid out the allegations in detail.
H. David Kotz, the S.E.C. inspector general, said that he was investigating the issue and hoped to complete a report by the end of September. A spokesman for the National Archives did not respond to requests for comment late Wednesday afternoon.
The National Archives wrote to the S.E.C. last year, saying that it ''appears that there has been an unauthorized disposal of federal records,'' and asked for further information, according to Mr. Flynn's chronology.
Mr. Flynn said that S.E.C. officials discussed whether to lie about the document destruction because they might be open to criminal liability. Unlawful and willful destruction of federal records is punishable by up to three years in prison.
The S.E.C. replied to the National Archives in a letter, saying that it was ''not aware of any specific instances of the destruction of records'' that should have been retained. It added that it ''cannot say with certainty that no such documents have been destroyed over the past seventeen years.''
The letter from Mr. Flynn's lawyer said that the old document destruction policy gave S.E.C. officials assurance that if they closed an inquiry without upgrading it to a formal investigation, there would be no record of their actions.
It is common for S.E.C. employees to leave the agency for the private sector and then begin representing clients before the agency. Mr. Flynn contends that the practice increases the likelihood that S.E.C. investigators could do undetected favors for former colleagues and their clients by quashing investigations.
Whether that revolving door led to the closing of an investigation in 2001 involving Deutsche Bank and the destruction of the files is part of the investigation by the S.E.C.'s inspector general.

HEADLINE: Debt Panel Faces History of Pressure and Mistrust

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Eric Lipton and Eric Lichtblau contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- There is a joke in this town that goes something like this: If you want to guarantee that a problem does not get solved, convene a committee to study it.
On the heels of a nasty showdown that led the nation to near default, a joint Congressional committee is preparing to try to devise a deficit-reduction plan that both parties can live with -- a goal that has eluded Congressional leaders, a cadre of senators and the president.
The difficulty that this new committee will have scaling the steep walls of ideology and partisan mistrust is lost on few, including its own members. 
''I approach this task like all tasks in Washington, with high hopes and tempered expectations,'' said Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican and co-chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, whose six Senate members and six House members are divided evenly by party. ''This committee has very serious work to do, but it should not be confused with Captain America or any other superhero.''
The impediments to the committee's work lie as much in the way its success markers are defined as in the inherent partisan rancor and substantial financial conflicts among its members.
Under the legislation written to raise the debt ceiling this month, if the committee fails to come up with a plan by Nov. 23 to cut the federal deficit by $1.2 trillion over 10 years, or if its proposals are not approved by Congress roughly a month later, the government will automatically cut spending across a vast area of its operations, including the Pentagon.
But the cuts would not be made until January 2013, nearly a year after the trigger is hit, leaving members of Congress to devise ways to avoid the fallout, even as they wrestle during the middle of a presidential campaign with a main component of the deficit debate: the Bush tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2012.
''The trigger can get pulled,'' said Josh Barro of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization. ''But then there is a substantial amount of time to unpull the trigger. When you look at the committee picks, it is really hard-core partisan people who are not likely to compromise, and some would prefer the trigger rather than the fight over the campaign season to come up with a plan.''
Privately, Republicans and Democrats are pondering which party would be more hurt by across-the-board cuts.
The committee members say there has been a political shift since the Obama administration and Congress failed to come up with a more sweeping plan to deal with the nation's debt, lending more urgency to their work. After the debt ceiling was lifted, Standard & Poor's downgraded the nation's credit, the stock market took a wild dip and polls demonstrated that voters have lost patience with Washington.
''There is just a lot more pressure now to accomplish something,'' said Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a Republican on the committee.
Having the debt ceiling issue resolved also helps. ''I think that since the economic nuclear bomb has been taken off the table,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a Democratic committee member, ''people can focus on this in a little fresh way.''
But many impediments remain. None of the Republicans on the committee have indicated that there is much wiggle room on the revenue side of the ledger, beyond a willingness to end tax subsidies for some industries, like ethanol. For their part, the Democrats chosen for the panel are largely protective of the entitlement programs that represent the biggest part of the budget.
''I don't think this committee is going to achieve a full fix to our problems, because Democrats have never wanted to put their health care bill on the table,'' Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who leads the House Budget Committee, said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
The central area of agreement between the two parties -- a need for major changes to the tax code -- is unlikely in the short time before the committee's deadline.
Further, it is clear that there is some residual unpleasantness after the bitter debt ceiling fight. ''Some of the members I know, some I don't, but I think I will keep my opinions of them to myself,'' Mr. Hensarling said.
Separate from the internal dynamics of the committee, each of the members has favorite causes or industry allies, which could influence their opinions on cutting spending or raising revenue.
For instance, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a Democratic member, has long promoted the interests of Boeing, taking in more than $172,000 in donations from the company or its executives during her career. Mrs. Murray once ran an ad boasting about how she helped Boeing win a $40 billion Air Force contract for its aerial-refueling tankers.
Mr. Hensarling has pulled in hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks and Wall Street firms, including $57,800 in the last election cycle from Goldman Sachs.
Further, special interest groups are waiting in the wings. ''The sense around here is a lobbying bonanza,'' said Jonathan Collegio of American Crossroads, the Republican advocacy group formed by Karl Rove.
Watching with particular interest are groups that defend entitlement programs. ''We've had all these different gangs all looking basically at these same issues,'' David Certner of AARP, which is pushing to protect programs affecting older Americans. ''We're just going to keep doing the things we've been doing -- the same lobbying, the same strategy, the same message.''
All six Republicans on the committee have signed the pledge not to raise taxes dictated by Grover Norquist, who heads Americans for Tax Reform. Now, Mr. Norquist said, he will focus on keeping the Democrats in line. ''The Republicans are serious budget reformers; the lady from Washington,'' Mr. Norquist said of Mrs. Murray, ''doesn't do budgets.''
It is these kinds of statements that worry proponents of a deficit overhaul. ''If these guys can't get it done,'' said Alan Simpson, the co-chairman of President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, ''and are in thrall to the AARP and Grover Norquist, we ain't got a prayer.''

HEADLINE: Medical Debt Cited More Often in Bankruptcies

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Medical debt is playing a bigger role in personal bankruptcy filings.

 BODY:
Medical debt is increasingly a factor in personal bankruptcy filings, an analysis of data at a large credit-counseling agency finds.
Roughly 20 percent of those seeking financial counseling this year and last cited medical debt as the primary cause of their decision to seek bankruptcy protection, according to CredAbility, an Atlanta-based nonprofit credit counseling agency that serves clients nationally. That's up from about 12 to 13 percent in the prior two years. The analysis included more than 47,000 clients for the first half of this year, and more than 100,000 in each of the prior years. (Federal law requires anyone filing for bankruptcy to receive counseling in case other options are available.)
With unemployment persistently high, more people have lost health coverage along with their jobs, says Michelle Jones, the agency's senior vice president of counseling. Health costs are escalating for employed people, as well, in the form of higher premiums and deductibles. More health plans are offering lower monthly premiums in exchange for higher deductibles, but that means people find themselves on the hook for more out-of-pocket costs, if they get sick.
One reason people tend to get into trouble with medical debt is that they are reluctant to default on health care payments, Ms. Jones said. So, rather than not pay their doctor, they take out a new credit card - often with high interest rates, if their credit is less than stellar-- and run up debt on their credit cards to cover health care costs. The short-term problem is alleviated, but the interest begins to compound and in short order they're in trouble.
"With medical bills, people are very compelled to make good on those debts," she said. "If you're sick, it's the person taking care of you. So they feel bad about not making the payment. People take extraordinary steps to pay them."
People who have lost their jobs, but are continuing their group coverage under the federal law known as COBRA, may find it difficult to make the higher premium payments and end up putting them on their credit cards if they can. Another scenario, she noted, is that if patients need continuing therapy, they may have to put payments on their credit cards, or they can't continue treatment: "If they don't pay, services won't be provided."
Medical debts can be particularly stressful because they tend to be referred to collection agencies quickly, since it's expensive for clinics and hospitals to chase payments that aren't covered by insurance.
There may be alternatives to a bankruptcy filing, she said, for those who have run up credit-card debt paying off their medical bills. They may, for instance, qualify for a debt management plan, which is a plan negotiated with creditors to allow the cardholder to pay down the debt over time, she said.
Have you incurred higher credit card debt because of medical bills?

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Holds at 8.7%, but Many Have Given Up Looking

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The city's unemployment rate is lower than it was a year ago, but essentially has not changed since March, when a relatively strong rebound in hiring stalled.

 BODY:
New York City's job market continued to putter along in July, as thousands of residents gave up looking for work and the unemployment rate held steady at 8.7 percent, the state's Labor Department reported on Thursday.
The city's unemployment rate is lower than it was a year ago, but essentially has not changed since March, when the relatively strong rebound in hiring stalled. The number of unemployed people in the city has been stuck above 340,000 for several months, after dropping from a high of more than 400,000 during the worst of the recession in late 2009, according to the state.
"It's been three or four months of going sideways," said James Brown, principal economist for the department. 
It's still an uneven job market, he said, adding, "It's very strong if you are in some of the office industries, but construction remains with significant losses and it's really not a good picture in social services."
A separate report from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that even those New Yorkers with jobs were losing ground financially. The bureau reported that the price of consumer goods in the metropolitan region rose more than twice as fast as wages did in the last 12 months.
The main gauge of inflation, the consumer price index, last month had increased 3.3 percent from a year before. That was the highest annualized inflation rate in the region since just after the Lehman Brothers investment bank collapsed in 2008 and the recession took hold.
Over the same period, wages rose just 1.5 percent, according to the state's Labor Department. It reported that the average hourly wage for private-sector workers in the city was $30.78 in July, up from $30.32 in July 2010 and essentially the same level - $30.33 - as three years ago.
A rise in gas prices of nearly 40 percent over the last year has taken the biggest bite out of paychecks, but the cost of groceries also has risen more than 5 percent, according to the bureau's report.

HEADLINE: Violations Found in Nearly 60% of Supermarkets

BYLINE: SYDNEY EMBER


HIGHLIGHT: Among the violations found by the Consumer Affairs Department: failing to place individual price tags, not making scales available, inaccurately pricing goods, taxing products that should not be taxed.

 BODY:
Nearly 60 percent of supermarket inspections in the last year turned up violations of consumer protections, an increase over the year before, even amid a high-profile city crackdown, the Department of Consumer Affairs said.
In response, the department has called for a law that would force stores to pay customers 10 times the amount of any overcharge.
After Consumer Affairs found violations at 52 percent of their inspections over the year ending last August, the city ramped up enforcement, doubling the number of inspections. The results: violations at 59 percent of inspections across the city in the past year, the department's commissioner, Jonathan B. Mintz, said on Thursday. 
Violations, large and small, include failing to place price tags on individual items, not making scales available, inaccurately pricing goods, taxing products that should not be taxed, and improperly scanning items at the register, which could result in overcharging. 
About 27 percent of stores inspected were found to be overcharging, officials said. 
"I had hoped that our efforts, the strong reaction of the public, the doubling of the number of inspections would make a difference in the investment that the supermarket industry in the city made when it came to making sure that they were doing right by the customers at the checkout counter and complying with the city's consumer protection laws," Mr. Mintz said. "Unfortunately, this did not happen."
Of the five boroughs, Manhattan had the least compliant supermarkets, with nearly 62 percent of inspections uncovering violations, followed by Queens with 61 percent, Brooklyn with 58 percent, Staten Island with 56 percent and the Bronx with 51 percent. The department has posted an online guide for shoppers.
Under the Grocery Shoppers Have Overcharge Protection (Grocery SHOP) Act proposed by Mr. Mintz, supermarkets would be required to pay 10 times the amount of the overcharge and give the item to the consumer for free. Fines for violations would increase threefold. Currently, the fines for overcharging start at $350.
"For too long, I believe that stores have been enjoying the rewards of these overcharges," Mr. Mintz said in the release. "I believe that when customers get overcharged, supermarkets should pay for it, not profit from it."
The measure would have to be adopted by the City Council and signed by the mayor to become law.
Patricia Brodhagen, the vice president for the Food Industry Alliance of New York State, a grocers' trade group, said that many of the violations cited - including failing to place labels on items, one of the most common violations - do not affect how consumers are charged. Many supermarkets already give customers their items for free if they are overcharged, she said, making that penalty in the proposed law besides the point.
Ms. Brodhagen added that the Consumer Affairs department did not seem to be concerned with all price discrepancies. "Nobody," she said, "keeps track of how many undercharges there are."

HEADLINE: Davis Polk Hires Former Antitrust Regulator

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Howard A. Shelanski, who worked at the F.T.C. and F.C.C., is the law firm's latest poach from the Washington regulatory world.

 BODY:
Howard A. Shelanski, a longtime antitrust regulator, will join Davis Polk & Wardwell in the law firm's Washington office.
Mr. Shelanski, who has served stints as an economist at both the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission, will focus on antitrust and regulatory matters for Davis Polk clients. He also will keep his teaching job at Georgetown University's law school.
"Howard is a uniquely skilled and highly respected antitrust lawyer and economist who brings valuable senior government experience to the firm," Thomas J. Reid, Davis Polk's Managing Partner, said in a statement. "He fits perfectly into our top-tier antitrust practice and our regulatory group in Washington D.C. as we guide our clients through their most complex litigation and transactional matters."
Mr. Shelanski is Davis Polk's latest poach from the regulatory world. In June, the firm hired Susan C. Ervin, who spent 15 years at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the last two years as a senior adviser at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, the firm hired Michael N. Sohn, the former general counsel of the Federal Trade Commission, or F.T.C.
Mr. Shelanski began his government career in 1998 as a senior economist to President's Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. He then moved to the Federal Communications Commission, where he was chief economist, and later became a high-ranking economist at the F.T.C.
"He is the latest in a long line of exceptionally qualified Davis Polk lawyers with senior government experience," Mr. Reid said, "and we are pleased to welcome him to the firm."

HEADLINE: Frank Questions Capital One's Deal For ING Online Bank

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Massachusetts congressman calls on the Federal Reserve to hold public hearings to examine the possible deal's impact on consumers and the economy.

 BODY:
Representative Barney Frank has asked the Federal Reserve to deepen its review of Capital One Financial's proposed $9 billion acquisition of ING Direct USA.
In a letter sent on Wednesday to the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, the Massachusetts Democrat called on the Fed to hold public hearings to examine the possible deal's impact on consumers and the economy. Mr. Frank also asked that the Fed grant the public at least two additional months to weigh in on the acquisition. The comment period is otherwise scheduled to end on Thursday. 
"This proposed purchase would create the fifth-largest bank in the United States," noted Mr. Frank, the top Democrat on the House committee that oversees the financial industry. "For this reason alone, care should be taken to thoroughly examine the impact of this purchase with respect to the consolidation of banking assets, the provision of credit by the resulting bank and compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act." 
The letter also raised questions about Capital One's deal-making record, saying that consumer advocacy groups have issued concerns about its past acquisitions. The consumer groups also contend that the deal will create another behemoth bank that one day could need a government bailout. 
"We already have four Too Big to Fail banks, why make a fifth," John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition said in a statement earlier this month. 
A Capital One spokeswoman called the concerns "baseless." The deal "further reduces, rather than increases, our overall risk profile," said the spokeswoman, Tatiana Stead. 
Mr. Frank, however, said the concerns "merit an extension of the comment period in order to allow a thorough investigation and evaluation." The Fed plans to respond to Mr. Frank's letter, a spokeswoman said. 
Capital One, meanwhile, is eager to soon close the deal. In a letter this week to the Fed, the Virginia-based bank argued against an extension of the comment period, saying that the public has had "ample time" to express concerns. 
When the takeover was announced in June, Capital One said that the deal should be finalized by the end of 2011 or early next year. 
The deal requires Capital One, currently the eighth-biggest bank in the country by deposits, to buy ING Group's online banking unit for $6.2 billion in cash and issue $2.8 billion worth of new shares to ING. It outbid General Electric's GE Capital and the CIT Group to win the crowded auction.

HEADLINE: A Former Goldman Executive Explains His Transylvanian Roots

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: A staffer for Representative Darrell Issa who changed his name after leaving Goldman Sachs has been accused of hiding his past. But he says he's honoring his Transylvanian heritage.

 BODY:
The progressive blogosphere was scandalized on Thursday by some startling news about Peter G. Haller, a mid-level staffer for Darrell Issa, the Republican congressman from California. 
An article posted on ThinkProgress.org said that the staffer, a former Goldman Sachs vice president, had legally changed his name from Peter Simonyi to Peter Haller in 2008, shortly after leaving the investment bank. The article said that now, as senior counsel to Rep. Issa, Mr. Haller, under his new name, was attempting to "thwart regulations that affect Goldman Sachs' bottom line" by writing policy materials advocating laxer regulation.
Readers were outraged. A shapeshifter on Capitol Hill! A Goldman mole in Congress!
Well, as it turns out, the story on Mr. Haller isn't so scandalous after all. In an e-mailed statement, Mr. Haller told DealBook that he is a descendant of a Transylvanian count, and that he changed his name in 2008 to honor a long-held family promise. 
His statement reads, in part:
My mother, whose maiden name is Theodora Maria Theresia haller-koi gr Haller (in the U.S., Dora Haller), married Imre Gabor Simonyi and took his name. Her father Alfred haller-koi gr Haller was killed in Budapest in 1944 by fascists as he attempted to prevent children from being conscripted into the military. Prior to his return to Hungary in 1944, he served under Regent Miklos Horthy, as a Hungarian diplomat stationed in England supporting the British in opposition to Germany. His last request was that if Theodora marries, her husband and children would carry on the Haller name. 
As my sister and I became adults, at some point discussions began that we should carry on the name of my mother's family, which had lived in Transylvania, up until it was granted to Romania under the Treaty of Trianon after World War I. During a period of unemployment following my time at Goldman Sachs, I found the time to proceed with the name change, as did my sister. Please note my father and mother remain happily married to this day.

HEADLINE: The Director Congressman

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Why I wrote a column about Representative Darrell Issa and a company he founded.

 BODY:
My column this week discusses a company founded by Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, who remained on its board until it was acquired by a private equity firm a few weeks ago. About the same time that the company decided to look for a buyer, it forced small investors to sell for a fraction of what larger shareholders would soon receive.
It is the second time this week that The New York Times has run an article centered on Mr. Issa. On Monday, Eric Lichtblau reported on the "overlap between his private and business lives, with at least some of the congressman's government actions helping to make a rich man even richer and raising the potential for conflicts."
It is reasonable to ask why the two articles appeared in such a brief time.
The answer is that I was intrigued by references to the company in the article that appeared Monday. After reading it, I looked up the company, DEI Holdings, and was interested in what I found. It had cost its investors millions, and it had taken steps that ended up treating some investors worse than others. Had I noticed the company, I would have been tempted to write about it even if it did not have a well-known director. The involvement of Mr. Issa, who has often criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission, made it all the more interesting.

I called Mr. Issa's spokesman on Tuesday, asking for an interview to discuss both his views on securities laws and his experience at the company. I told the spokesman of specific issues at the company that interested me. He did not call back. A spokesman for the company did return my call, but did not provide information on what I think is an important question: Had the company decided to seek a buyer before the small investors were forced out?
At the hearing Representative Issa conducted, which I link to in the column, he stated the S.E.C. had a "dual mandate." One is to protect the public. The other is capital formation. At that hearing, at least, he was more interested in the latter. He said he believed that a loosening of S.E.C. rules would lead more companies to seek capital, and thus promote economic growth. 
I think the two mandates are intimately related. Perhaps the most important aspect of our capital-raising system is the belief that investors can get a fair shake when they are in no position to closely monitor what is happening at the companies where they invest their money. If that belief were to vanish because the S.E.C. did a bad job on the first mandate, the commission would have no chance to fulfill the second one.

HEADLINE: Financial Stocks Sink

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: So much for summer doldrums: Europe's debt crisis and worries about an economic slowdown haunt the United States markets again.

 BODY:
Financial stocks tumbled in a global market rout on Thursday as fears re-emerged about stresses to banks amid fresh signs of economic weakness and a persistent European debt crisis.
Citigroup, among the most global of United States institutions, was down 9 percent. Bank of America was off 6.6 percent, Morgan Stanley was down 7.3 percent and Goldman Sachs, 3.4 percent. JPMorgan Chase was down 5 percent
Investors fleeing riskier assets plowed their money into gold, which rose to a new record, and Treasury securities. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell below 2 percent. The so-called fear gauge, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange's volatility index, or VIX, rose sharply 
European markets and European bank stocks were also lower. The London market was down 4.6 percent; Frankfurt was down 5.6 percent.
The concerns about European banks, which roiled markets last week, and their ability to weather the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis are not new. But they were brought into focus on Thursday when the Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was concerned about the United States operations of the big European banks. The Journal noted that one European bank had borrowed $500 million in one-week debt from the European Central Bank, a possible sign that some banks may be having trouble obtaining dollar funds. 
Morgan Stanley on Wednesday issued a glum global economic forecast, saying: 
Our revised forecasts show the US and the euroarea hovering dangerously close to a recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction - over the next 6-12 months. It won't take much in the form of additional shocks to tip the balance.
Still, the Morgan Stanley global economics team said recession was not its "base case," noting that corporations are still healthy, inflation was low and central banks were likely to act.

HEADLINE: A Republican Shout-Out for Wind Energy

BYLINE: JIM WITKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Candidates carved out time to autograph a wind turbine during Iowa's straw poll last weekend. Yet their positions on tax credits for the wind industry vary.

 BODY:
In Thursday's Times, John M. Broder writes about a blood sport that has become quite popular among the field of Republican presidential candidates: attacks on the Environmental Protection Agency. Yet the candidates recently found time to rally behind clean wind energy, a topic some voters identify with a somewhat more liberal agenda. 
At Saturday's Iowa straw poll, the G.O.P. contenders Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Ron Paul, Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain, and Thaddeus McCotter autographed a giant 130-foot wind turbine blade to show their support for Iowa's burgeoning wind industry as a source of home-grown job creation 
TPI Composites, based in Newton, Iowa, manufactured the blade and currently employs 700 workers at a former Maytag plant, according to its chief executive, Steve Lockard. The American Wind Energy Association, a trade association and lobbying group, sponsored the event on Saturday. 
It was one of about 30 such displays set up by organizations and political action committees on the Iowa State University campus.
Michele Bachman, the top vote-getter in the straw poll, was not present at the signing, although according to Peter Kelley, the wind energy association's vice president for public affairs, her staff had conveyed her interest in attending.
Texas is the leading state in installed wind capacity with 10,085 megawatts, while Iowa is second with 3,675 megawatts, accounting for almost 20 percent of the state's electricity generation in the first quarter of 2011. 
Over 200 companies are now involved in Iowa's wind industry. Since the state adopted a renewable energy standard in 1983, the industry has generated almost $5 billion in investment, according to estimates from the wind energy association.
Iowa's wind generation capacity will soon get a boost when MidAmerican Energy Company, one of the country's largest wind project developers, completes the 444-megawatt Rolling Hills site this year in southwestern Iowa.
But while Mr. Lockard expects demand for his wind turbines to remain strong through 2012, he expressed concern during Saturday's event about 2013 and beyond because of the impending expiration of the so-called production tax credit. This incentive provides a per kilowatt-hour tax credit for companies generating electricity from renewable sources.
The credit has faced expiration before but has then been renewed and expanded several times since its enactment in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act. In 2009, the Recovery Act sweetened the incentive by allowing developers to receive a grant from the Treasury Department in lieu of the tax credit, meaning the government would finance 30 percent of the project cost. 
According to Mr. Kelley of the wind energy association, the production tax credit has been the single most important piece of legislation allowing wind to compete with other sources of energy like coal.
At Saturday's event, Mr. Pawlenty, who has since withdrawn from the race, and Newt Gingrich spoke in favor of extending tax incentives in the form of production tax credits. Where the other candidates stand on the issue is less clear as the topic was not discussed during the debate preceding the straw poll .
Mr. Romney doesn't specifically address the issue at his Web site. Ron Paul is generally opposed to tax breaks for any energy producer. Both he and Ms. Bachmann have previously voted against tax incentives for renewable energy production.
"Uncertainty over whether the P.T.C. will be extended has already caused layoffs and bankruptcies in the wind energy supply chain," Mr. Kelley said. Ensuring that the credit is renewed "will be our top legislative priority in Congress this session," he said.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
With the president pledging to outline a major economic proposal shortly after Labor Day, Jackie Calmes outlines some details gleaned from his aides. So far, his plan includes calling for short-term stimulus measures, which Ms. Calmes says suggest that the onus is on Republicans to prevent a recovery-threatening impasse. The president also plans to urge the special debt committee to devise job-creation measures and to pursue larger deficit cuts than mandated by the recently passed Budget Control Act.
Mark Landler reflects on President Obama's three-day tour through the Midwest, which he wrapped up on Wednesday in Illinois. "The welcome mat was out, but the mood was somber," he writes, describing how Mr. Obama faced tough questions from people "who said they were fearful about their future, frustrated by the paralyzed job market, and fed up with the political culture in Washington." Today, Mr. Obama will meet separately with his national security and economic teams before setting off for a 10-day vacation in Martha's Vineyard.
Jennifer Steinhauer looks at the prospects of the debt committee reaching a deal that will pass Congress and what will happen if the panel fails. She explains that the panel's 12 members will have to overcome deep ideological differences and partisan mistrust - something that the president and Congress have not been able to accomplish.
On the campaign trail, the Republican candidates have laid bare their disapproval of the Environmental Protection Agency and environmental regulation more broadly, with some calling climate science a hoax or conspiracy. John M. Broder writes that while this may play well in Republican primaries, it could limit the eventual nominee's appeal to the general electorate.
With the furor over his disdainful remarks about Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, still fresh, a subdued Rick Perryemerged on Wednesday. Ashley Parker followed Mr. Perry, the governor of Texas, to New Hampshire, a state not known for its kindness to Republican presidential candidates.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is in China for a four-day visit to meet with the presumed next leader of the country, Xi Jinping, and to reassure the Chinese about the stability of their immense investments in Treasury bonds. But to hear Edward Wong tell it, the country's fixation is the new American ambassador to China, Gary F. Locke, who arrived last week without an entourage, bewildering Chinese used to privileged officials.
Around the Web:
President Obama believes that the United Statesis not at risk for another recession but wants lawmakers to do more to aid the recovery, he told CBS News.
The Washington Post contrasts Mitt Romney and Rick Perry's approaches to job creation as they compete for the Republican presidential nomination.
Happening in Washington:
Several economic reports are scheduled for release today. At 8:30 a.m., the Department of Labor will report real earnings and the Consumer Price Index for July, and weekly jobless claims. At 10, the Conference Board will unveil leading indicators for July, Freddie Mac releases weekly mortgage rates, and the National Association of Realtors releases existing home sales.

HEADLINE: Can Another Speech Really Help Obama?

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The president plans a major jobs speech in September, but as he has learned, the bully pulpit isn't always all it's cracked up to be.

 BODY:
For weeks, many of President Obama's staunchest supporters have been urging him to gather his boldest ideas for job creation and present them, in a big way, to the American people as a way of putting Republicans back on their heels.
That's what Mr. Obama will try to do shortly after Labor Day, when aides say he will give a major address unveiling new ideas for creating jobs in the short run, as well as a detailed guide for the legislative efforts to cut the nation's long-term deficit.
The idea is rooted in the notion that the president is a gifted orator whose path to the White House was made easier because of those skills. But in his two and a half years in office, Mr. Obama has discovered what many other presidents have: the bully pulpit is not always all it is cracked up to be.
The president and his aides have repeatedly sought to claim the national spotlight with speeches during difficult political moments. But expectations are always high for such addresses, and there are few examples in which a speech by Mr. Obama has dramatically helped to change the political or legislative narrative in his favor.
Perhaps the closest to that was Mr. Obama's health care speech in September 2009, after a disastrous summer in which an emerging Tea Party movement used town-hall style meetings to generate opposition to the president's health care plans.
The speech to a joint session of Congress did help to get the health care legislation back on track. (The thing that may have helped most that night was a congressman's decision to yell "you lie" at the president, which crystallized a backlash against what some saw as an overly aggressive health care opposition.)
But the declarations of presidential intention in his many speeches have more often run up against the difficult reality of hyper-partisanship in Washington. 
A year ago this September, Mr. Obama traveled to Parma, Ohio, to contrast his vision for the economy with that of the Republicans ahead of the midterm elections. He lambasted the Republicans for insisting on tax cuts for the wealthy and opposing infrastructure improvements.
"When you ask them what programs they'd actually cut, they don't have an answer," he said "That's not fiscal responsibility. That's not a serious plan to govern."
In fact, the Republicans went on to historic victories in the midterm elections, seizing control of the House of Representatives and making gains in the Senate. 
The day after the elections, Mr. Obama told reporters he had gotten the message, and by the end of the year, he had cut a deal with Republicans to extend the tax cuts. That tax deal was largely overshadowed by another speech Mr. Obama gave the day before in North Carolina in which he called for a new "Sputnik moment."
There is little chance Mr. Obama will stop giving big speeches. There is an expectation that any president should lay out his proposals and ideas to the nation.
And sometimes, a speech can help rally the country in a moment of grief, as Mr. Obama did effectively in the aftermath of the shootings in Arizona that killed six people and severely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords.
But as a tool to make things happen - to move legislation, to advance foreign policy agendas, or to achieve compromise on tough issues - the speeches by Mr. Obama have struggled to accomplish their tasks.
Administration officials often point to the address Mr. Obama gave in Cairo in 2009 as one of his most effective speeches. In it, he spoke of America's desire to reach out to the Muslim world and a new approach to dealing with America's adversaries. 
But the president's lofty goals for the Middle East have been overcome by the dramatic developments there: negotiations for peace in Israel that have bogged down and revolutions in the Arab world that have led to a new political map of the region.
On energy, Mr. Obama has given several speeches intended to push forward his goals on climate change and security. In March, he delivered a "Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future" that called for new efforts to reduce America's dependence on foreign sources of energy.
Since that speech, the administration has announced new standards for more efficient cars. But on the big, contentious issues of climate change, oil drilling and energy regulations, Washington remains as gridlocked as ever.
As White House officials are sure to point out, the effectiveness of some speeches is not immediately obvious. 
One of the president's first speeches, a weighty economic address at Georgetown University in April 2009, laid out his "four pillars" for economic recovery, which included reform of the financial industry, health care, education and energy policy. Mr. Obama eventually succeeded in pushing through legislation on most of those issues.
Mr. Obama's introduction to the national stage was through a well-received speech at the 2004 Democratic convention. And as a candidate, his speeches were viewed as an effective tool on the campaign trail. So much so that his Republican rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, aired an ad mocking Mr. Obama's many appearances before huge crowds.
But a presidential speech is different from a campaign speech. Its success is rarely measured by a simple vote at the ballot box. And it is often treated with a Beltway cynicism that makes it difficult to meet its lofty expectations.
"We really don't need another speech," Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner, said in a Twitter message on Wednesday after Mr. Obama's speech was announced. "Seriously, just drop it in the mail. Podium not required."

HEADLINE: Warren Files to Test the Senate Waters

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Elizabeth Warren set up an exploratory committee as she continues to consider a run against Senator Scott Brown.

 BODY:
3:50 p.m. | Updated Elizabeth Warren formed an exploratory committee on Thursday morning as she continues to consider a run for the Senate in Massachusetts, and her camp maintains that she is still doing just that: exploring. But given their gleeful reaction to this news, Bay State and some national Democrats seem primed for a painful letdown if Ms. Warren, a Harvard Law professor, ultimately decides against challenging Senator Scott Brown.
Ms. Warren gained national (and polarizing) attention for masterminding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the wake of the financial crisis. This week, she has been traveling around Massachusetts on a "listening tour" to gauge support for a candidacy.
"She wants to continue this conversation, and the exploratory committee will assist her in doing so," said Kyle Sullivan, a former aide to Gov. Deval Patrick, who is now advising Ms. Warren.
The committee's Web site is set up to register supporters and take their donations.
Promises of a post-Labor Day decision have not changed. But for some Democrats, the exploratory filing amounts to a :
"It's pretty much a formality at this point; she's basically in," wrote charley-on-the-mta, a co-founder of Blue Mass Group, a liberal blog that hosted Ms. Warren's introductory essay last week, in which she outlined her working-class upbringing (in Oklahoma, not mentioned) and her drive to fight for the middle class.
The post, titled "Coming Home," played up her return to Cambridge after setting up the consumer advocacy agency in Washington. Democratic activists clamored for President Obama to nominate her to lead it, but he did not; she faced certain stone-walling in the Senate, the body she is now considering joining.
Massachusetts Democrats have been eager for a strong candidate to challenge Mr. Brown, the moderate Republican who last year won the seat long held by Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The seven other Democrats in the race have failed to inspire much passion, and Eric Fehrnstrom, a political adviser to Mr. Brown, noted the unsettled field when asked to comment on Ms. Warren's latest step.
"It looks like it'll be a crowded Democratic primary, and it's hard for me to predict who will end up being the nominee," Mr. Fehrnstrom said. "A year from now, we'll find out. In the meantime, Senator Brown is going to keep his focus on creating jobs and getting the economy moving again."
So far, Ms. Warren's appearances before friendly audiences have drawn ravereviews, and she is popular with national Democratic base.
"The Emily's List community has been telling me loud and clear that they want Elizabeth Warren in the race to beat Scott Brown," Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily's List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, said in a statement. "Today, they got a little bit closer to getting their wish. I'm thrilled that Elizabeth is pursuing this next endeavor with the thoughtfulness and respect that's been such a hallmark of her career."
Some are backing up the words with money. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group that has criticized Mr. Obama from the left, has raised $100,000 for its effort to draft Ms. Warren.
Nonetheless, the professor has never run for political office, and Mr. Brown has already raised more than $10 million for his re-election effort.
Republicans quickly unleashed a line of attack that, in an unconventional combination, calls Ms. Warren out for having Oklahoma origins while implying that she is a Washington/Ivy League elitist. 
"As a native of Oklahoma, the anointed candidate of the Washington establishment, and someone who has spent many years ensconced in the hallways of Harvard, it's a good idea for Professor Warren to learn more about her adopted state of Massachusetts as she prepares to compete in a crowded Democrat primary," said Brian Walsh, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. "If she's really listening, she'll hear that her plans for higher taxes and more Washington spending will kill jobs." 
A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that Elizabeth Warren is an economist at Harvard; she is a law professor.

HEADLINE: Noble Energy Buys Consol Shale Stake for $3.4 Billion

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Noble Energy has agreed to pay $3.4 billion for a 50 percent stake in Consol Energy's venture in the huge Marcellus shale formation, reflecting the strong demand for natural gas assets.

 BODY:
Noble Energy has agreed to pay $3.4 billion for a 50 percent stake in Consol Energy's venture in the huge Marcellus shale formation, reflecting the strong demand for natural gas assets.
Under the terms of the deal, Noble will team up with Consol on its 663,350-acre project in the Marcellus shale in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, and will pay $2.13 billion to Consol in drilling costs.
Shale formations, sedimentary rock from which natural gas and oil can be extracted through a technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, have been at the center of many energy deals in recent months, despite scrutiny of the method by politicians and environmental activists.
In June, Marathon Oil agreed to pay $3.5 billion for assets in the Eagle Ford shale formation in south Texas owned by a joint venture with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
Progress Energy sold a 50 percent stakein its North Montney venture in British Columbia to the Malaysian state oil company Petronas for nearly $1.1. billion the following day.
With the joint development venture, Noble and Consol plan to quadruple the number of drilling rigs in the Marcellus formation to 16 horizontal rigs by 2015. Noble will also pay $160 million for Consol's existing wells and $59 million for half of Consol's gathering assets. 
The deal represents the latest effort by major oil and natural gas producers to expand into the Marcellus formation, a giant deposit of carbonaceous shale beneath parts of Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. Several large swaths of the area changed hands last year. In the largest deal, Royal Dutch Shell bought the drilling rights to 650,000 net acres from East Resources for $4.7 billion in cash.
Teaming up with Noble will allow Consol to speed the development of the Marcellus portion it bought from Dominion Resources for $3.48 billion in 2010. That deal was said to increase Consol's natural gas reserves by more than 50 percent, to about 3 trillion cubic feet.
"We are extremely pleased to have Noble Energy as our partner in the Marcellus," J. Brett Harvey, Consol's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. "This agreement will benefit the regional economy, the communities in which we operate, our employees and our respective companies. Together we will be able to accelerate the development of this significant resource safely, efficiently and economically."
The deal is expected to close at the end of September. Consol was advised by Jefferies & Company and represented by the law firms Vinson & Elkins and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.

HEADLINE: Birthdays Are Still Big in Buyout Land

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Leon D. Black's 60th birthday party in the Hamptons was lavish, and in a way showed that little has changed in the private equity world.

 BODY:
When the billionaire buyout titan Stephen A. Schwarzman gave himself a boom-era-defining 60th birthday party in 2007, the global economy was soaring.
Four years and one financial crisis later, the world looks very different. But not much has changed in the private equity world - at least when it comes to birthday parties.
Last Saturday night, the financier Leon D. Black celebrated his 60th with a blowout at his oceanfront estate in Southampton, on Long Island. After a buffet dinner featuring a seared foie gras station, some 200 guests took in a show by Elton John. The pop music legend, who closed with "Crocodile Rock," was paid at least $1 million for the hour-and-a-half performance.
"The great Sir Elton John performing at my friend Leon Black's fabulous 60th bday," wrote the fashion designer Vera Wang on her Facebook page. "I had the honor of dressing his wife, my friend, Debra Black, the hostess! If there was ever a great family ... this was it! Xx Vera"
The stars of music and fashion collided with a who's who of Wall Street. Revelers included Michael R. Milken, the junk-bond pioneer and Mr. Black's boss at Drexel Burnham Lambert in the 1980s; Julian H. Robertson Jr. , the hedge fund investor; Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs; and Mr. Schwarzman, head of the Blackstone Group.
Rounding out the guest list were politicians including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who rubbed elbows with media celebrities like Martha Stewart and Howard Stern.
"Leon throws some good parties, because Leon's worth like twenty gazillion, like twenty billion or something crazy, and for him, you know, a billion dollars is like ten dollars to us," Mr. Stern said on his Monday show on SiriusXM Radio. Mr. Black sits on the company's board.
Opulent celebrations thrown by the rich and famous are de rigueur in New York and Hamptons society. And in buyout land, there is something about private equity bosses and 60th birthdays: In 2002, David Bonderman, co-founder of TPG, had the Rolling Stones and John Mellencamp play at his celebration at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas.
But where Mr. Schwarzman's $3 million birthday party came to be seen as a symbol of a new Gilded Age, a party like Mr. Black's - at this moment in time - appears to some to be something else.
"It displays a kind of moral bad taste given the vast economic problems in the country," said Michael M. Thomas, a former Lehman Brothers partner who writes novels about Wall Street. "This behavior suggests they are isolated from the rest of the world, living behind these great big hedges, and in a way they are."
Mr. Black is no parvenu, having been a fixture on Wall Street for decades. When Drexel collapsed in the late 1980s, Mr. Black started a firm to buy stakes in troubled companies. Today, that firm, Apollo Global Management, manages $72 billion in assets and is publicly traded. Its holdings include Caesars Entertainment, the world's largest casino company, and LyondellBasell, a big plastics and chemicals business.
Mr. Black, a major philanthropist to various scholastic, medical and cultural institutions, has also used his riches to amass a world-class art collection. In 2009, at a Christie's auction, he paid about $47 million for a chalk drawing by Raphael of a woman's head.
While much of the nation's economy has struggled to recover from the financial crisis, Mr. Black's firm - and the rest of the private equity industry - has snapped back. Though their deals are a far cry from the record takeovers struck in the last decade, multibillion-dollar buyouts have returned as banks extend corporate loans again. And pension funds and global sovereign wealth funds, faced with poor performance in stocks and bonds, continue to commit billions to private equity in the hopes of juicing their returns.
Apollo has long been considered one of Wall Street's most skilled investors. The firm made a killing during the financial crisis. Its big bet on distressed debt at the market bottom in 2009 earned the firm and its clients billions of dollars in profits.
The industry's continued success has made it a target in Washington. At issue is the low 15 percent tax rate paid by private equity executives on "carried interest," or the share of profits that fund managers receive as part of their compensation. Eliminating this provision would raise $21 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Black, speaking at a conference early last year, said he was resigned to a tax increase, saying that "it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for some adjustment."
Yet he has also been an outspoken opponent of certain proposals that would raise taxes on him and the private equity industry. Last year, Mr. Black visited Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers and make his case.
Mr. Black, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment.
On Saturday night, to be sure, there was little talk of carried interest at the Blacks' home on Meadow Lane, one of the Hamptons most desirable addresses for its panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean and Shinnecock Bay. He counts among his neighbors Calvin Klein and David H. Koch, the billionaire industrialist.
Mr. Black had his backyard transformed into a faux nightclub setting, constructing a wooden deck over his swimming pool and building a tent for Mr. John's concert. After a buffet of crab cakes and steak, partygoers sat on couches with big puffy pillows. They watched Mr. Black's four grown children deliver touching toasts to their father, including a poem by the youngest son.
"Oh, I wish I was Leon Black's child," Mr. Stern said on Monday.
Mr. John then took the stage and performed many of his hits, including "Your Song," "Benny and the Jets" and "Candle in the Wind." He joked that he knew how important 60th birthday parties were because he recently had one. (He is 64.)
Before the concert, around 8 p.m., as a full moon rose over the Atlantic, Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Schwarzman stood at the foot of the stairs leading down to the beach. Guests overheard Mr. Blankfein playfully ribbing Mr. Schwarzman about his fin de siecle affair.
"Your 60th got us into the financial crisis," Mr. Blankfein is said to have told the private equity titan. "Let's hope this party gets us out of it."

HEADLINE: A Second Great Depression, or Worse?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The 19th century, with technological change remaking the economy, had long, traumatic slumps, and the reaction is echoed in electoral politics today, an economist writes.

 BODY:
With the United States and European economies having slowed markedly according to the latest data, and with global growth continuing to disappoint, a reasonable question increasingly arises: Are we in another Great Depression?
The easy answer is "no" - the main features of the Great Depression have not yet manifested themselves and still seem unlikely. But it is increasingly likely that we will find ourselves in the midst of something nearly as traumatic, a long slump of the kind seen with some regularity in the 19th century, particularly if presidential election-year politics continue to head in a dangerous direction.
The Great Depression had three main characteristics, seen in the United States and most other countries that were severely affected. None of these have been part of our collective experience since 2007.
First, output dropped sharply after 1929, by over 25 percent in real terms in the United States (using the Bureau of Economic Analysis data, from its Web site, for real gross domestic product, using chained 1937 dollars). In contrast, the United States had a relatively small decline in G.D.P. after the latest boom peaked. According to the bureau's most recent online data, G.D.P. peaked in the second quarter of 2008 at $14.4155 trillion and bottomed out in the second quarter of 2009 at $13.8541 trillion, a decline of about 4 percent.
Second, unemployment rose above 20 percent in the United States during the 1930s and stayed there. In the latest downturn, we experienced record job losses for the postwar United States, with around eight million jobs lost. But unemployment only briefly touched 10 percent (in the fourth quarter of 2009; see the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site).

Even by the highest estimates - which include people discouraged from looking for a job, thus not registered as unemployed - the jobless rate reached around 16 to 17 percent. It's a jobs disaster, to be sure, but not the same scale as the Great Depression.
Third, in the 1930s the credit system shrank sharply. In large part this is because banks failed in an uncontrolled manner - largely in panics that led retail depositors to take out their funds. The creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation put an end to that kind of run and, despite everything, the agency has continued to play a calming role. (I'm on the F.D.I.C.'s newly created systemic resolution advisory committee, but I don't have anything to do with how the agency handles small and medium-size banks.)
But the experience at the end of the 19th century was also quite different from the 1930s - not as horrendous, yet very traumatic for many Americans. The heavily leveraged sector more than 100 years ago was not housing but rather agriculture - a different play on real estate. 
There were booming new technologies in that day, including the stories we know well about the rapid development of transportation, telephones, electricity and steel. But falling agricultural prices kept getting in the way for many Americans. With large debt burdens, farmers were vulnerable to deflation (a lower price level in general or just for their products). And before the big migration into cities, farmers were a mainstay of consumption.
According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, falling from peak to trough in each cycle took 11 months between 1945 and 2009 but twice that length of time between 1854 and 1919. The longest decline on record, according to this methodology, was not during the 1930s but rather from October 1873 to March 1879, more than five years of economic decline. 
In this context, it is quite striking - and deeply alarming - to hear a prominent Republican presidential candidate attack Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, for his efforts to prevent deflation. Specifically, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said earlier this week, referring to Mr. Bernanke: "If this guy prints more money between now and the election, I don't know what y'all would do to him in Iowa but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas. Printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost treacherous - er, treasonous, in my opinion."
In the 19th century the agricultural sector, particularly in the West, favored higher prices and effectively looser monetary policy. This was the background for William Jennings Bryan's famous "Cross of Gold" speech in 1896; the "gold" to which he referred was the gold standard, the bastion of hard money - and tendency toward deflation - favored by the East Coast financial establishment.
Populism in the 19th century was, broadly speaking, from the left. But now the rising populists are from the right of the political spectrum, and they seem intent on intimidating monetary policy makers into inaction. We see this push both on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill - for example, in interactions between the House Financial Services Committee, where Representative Ron Paul of Texas is chairman of the monetary policy subcommittee, and the Federal Reserve.
The relative decline of agriculture and the rise of industry and services over a century ago were long believed to have made the economy more stable, as it moved away from cycles based on the weather and global swings in supply and demand for commodities. But financial development creates its own vulnerability as more people have access to credit for their personal and business decisions. Add to that the rise of a financial sector that has proved brilliant at extracting subsidies that protect against downside risk, and hence encourage excessive risk-taking. The result is an economy that is at least as prone to big boom-bust cycles as what existed at the end of the 19th century.
The rise of the Tea Party has taken fiscal policy off the table as a potential countercyclical instrument; the next fiscal moves will be contractionary (probably more spending cuts), whether jobs start to come back or not. In this situation, monetary policy matters a great deal, and Mr. Bernanke's focus on avoiding deflation and hence limiting the problems for debtors does not seem inappropriate (for more on Mr. Bernanke, his motivations and actions, see David Wessel's book, "In Fed We Trust").
Mr. Bernanke has his flaws, to be sure. Under his leadership, the Fed has been reluctant to take on regulatory issues, continuing to see the incentive distortions of "too big to fail" banks as somehow separate from monetary policy, its primary concern. And his team has consistently pushed for capital requirements that are too low relative to the shocks we now face.
And the Federal Reserve itself is to blame for some of the damage to its reputation, although it did get a major assist from Treasury in 2008-9. There were too many bailouts rushed over weekends, with terms that were too generous to incumbent management and not sufficiently advantageous to the public purse.
But to accuse Mr. Bernanke of treason for worrying about deflation is worse than dangerous politics. It risks returning us to the long slump of the late 1870s.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths EDWARDS, CHARLES CORNELL

 BODY:
EDWARDS--Charles Cornell, M.D. Died at home in La Jolla, California, August 7, 2011, after a long illness. Born in Overton, Nebraska September 16, 1923, he grew up during dust storms, locust infestations, and the Great Depression. 
He began studies at Princeton in 1941, but after Pearl Harbor enrolled in the Navy's V-12 program, and transferred to the University of Colorado, where he earned his BA and MD. He completed an MS in surgery (University of Minnesota) and surgical fellowship at the Mayo Clinic. From 1950-1952, he served with the Marines on the front lines of the Korean War, after which he spent five years in private practice in Des Moines. In 1969 President Nixon appointed him Commissioner/U.S. Food & Drug Administration; and in 1971, he became Assistant Secretary for Health (Department of Health, Education, & Welfare). In 1975, he resigned citing Ford administration cuts to health care that adversely affected the poor and unemployed. He became president/CEO, Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation, La Jolla, in 1977 and oversaw a dramatic expansion into one of the largest employers in San Diego and a leading health care provider in California. He retired in 1993. A generous benefactor and strong proponent of philanthropy and community service, Dr. Edwards is survived by his wife of 66 years, Sue Kruidenier Edwards; children Timothy K. Edwards (Pat), Charles C. Edwards, Jr. (Karin), Nancy Edwards Schned (Eric), and David B. Edwards (Marketa); eight grandchildren; & cousin Cornell Arendt.

HEADLINE: Cutting Costs the Montana Way

BYLINE: By BRIAN SCHWEITZER. 
Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, is the governor of Montana.

 BODY:
Helena, Mont.
WITH the debt crisis and the weakening economy fresh on their minds, most Americans have probably concluded that government, as a rule, cannot manage money responsibly. But it can. Just look at Montana.
For six years it has been one of the only states in America with a budget surplus: this year it is a record $433 million, proportionally equivalent to a federal surplus of $858 billion. Thus we've been able to cut taxes, invest in education and infrastructure and keep essential services intact. We recently got our first bond rating upgrade in 26 years.
And we're not simply riding the Western energy boom. The recession has driven unemployment to 7.5 percent, and while we've had a great run with oil, coal and gas, royalties from these commodities account for only 9 percent of our budget surplus. 
How do we accomplish what most states and the federal government cannot? I like to say we run government like a ranch. In ranching -- my old job -- you either pinch pennies or go belly-up. We do the same in government. Perhaps Washington can try it.
For one thing, we challenge every expense. If it isn't absolutely necessary, we eliminate it. When the recession came we found $80 million in savings, which helped us avert a budget crisis. Little things added up: we renegotiated state contracts, cut our energy consumption by 20 percent, auctioned off state vehicles and canceled building projects and computer upgrades.
We even saved by spending: we stepped up our efforts to collect unpaid tax bills from out-of-state and foreign corporations, an undertaking that more than paid for itself.
This type of penny-pinching rarely occurs in Washington. As a small example, I was recently at a military base where a private firm ran security. Why, with the toughest soldiers on earth, would the federal government spend extra cash to rent security guards rather than let troops take turns guarding the fort? Sure, there might be a convenience to contracting, but is it worth the billions spent? No doubt the lobbyists for the security firm sprinkled plenty of money around Capitol Hill to get the contract.
The federal budget contains thousands of similar line items. A government serious about tightening its belt would eliminate them all.
But we don't just cut costs. Like good ranchers, we also leave some grain in the bin in case of drought. When times were good, we stashed away cash in a special savings account. This was a political challenge, because almost every state legislator, from both parties, wanted to spend it instead. But the account proved to be a big help in getting us through the recession in solid financial shape.
I cannot recall the federal government's ever banking surplus funds in a protected account, even during the surplus-laden 1990s. If Washington ever digs out of the current hole and runs a cash balance, Congress should likewise put some grain in the bin.
And even as we've cut costs and socked away money, we've followed another ranching principle: treat your ranch hands with respect. Like other states, we've had to freeze employee pay and reduce the work force. But as in any good organization, many of the best solutions for cutting costs come from state employees. Some look at payroll as a burden; we look at it as human capital, and we work hard to keep up morale in tough times. So when we cut the state payroll, I cut my own salary.
Sadly, many politicians, especially in Washington, seem to relish the opportunity to trash government workers. This is just cheap and ugly scapegoating. More to the point, it does nothing to produce bottom-line results.
Finally, we don't spend money until we've found the lowest price. Around here, government contracts aren't a way to take care of friends. Quite the opposite: we use our purchasing power to get the lowest possible rate. When the real estate market softened, we told commercial landlords who rented space to the state that if we didn't see rent reductions, we'd move to cheaper premises when our leases were up. Most complied, saving the state almost $4 million.
How does the federal government negotiate? Consider Medicare drug purchases, one of the largest federal budget items. We are often told the cost of entitlements can be brought down only by cutting services. Nonsense. In 2003, in one of the greatest sweetheart giveaways ever dreamed up by the White House and Congress, they agreed to pay retail rates for Medicare drugs, even when everyone knew they could negotiate lower, bulk prices. The cost to taxpayers? An estimated $600 billion a decade.
There are savings to be found everywhere in government. Now that federal spending is the country's top issue, Washington should try doing what any rancher or family household does: save money, live by a budget, challenge expenses, find bargains and invest wisely. Montana has proved that it works.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall Anew On Debt Worries And the Economy

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Eric Dash, David Jolly, Jack Ewing and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After just a few days of calm, stock markets heaved again on Thursday, sending major American indexes down as much as 5 percent on persistent worries about the economy and Europe's debt problems.
The turmoil of last week returned with a vengeance as investors dumped stocks of companies that would suffer if worldwide growth slowed and the United States, in particular, broached another recession.
But the declines began in Asia and in Europe, where an unidentified bank had resorted to borrowing from the European Central Bank, hinting of strains in the banking system that some fear could ripple to the United States. Europe's chronic debt problem continues to plague the Continent's banks because so many of their assets are invested in the region's troubled countries.
Investors rushed into United States Treasuries as a safe haven, despite unease about how the government will address its deficit and economic slowdown. Bond prices rose and the yield on the 10-year bond fell below 2 percent for the first time since at least the early 1960s. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 419.63 points on the day, or 3.7 percent, to 10,990.58. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 4.5 percent to 1,140.65. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite fell the most, ending down 5.2 percent at 2,380.43.
Gold rose along with Treasuries as investors sought safety. Oil prices fell on expectations that demand would be tempered in a slowdown.
The S.& P. 500 has now fallen more than 16 percent from its April 29 peak. It is once again near bear market territory, defined as a fall of 20 percent.
Analysts said the fear stalking markets was not going away. ''We took a little break for a couple days, and it is reinstating itself and I just think that this should probably be expected,'' said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global in New York.
After the sell-offs in Asia and Europe on Thursday, stock prices opened lower in the United States on a spate of dismal economic data. Consumer prices suggested inflation was picking up, and jobless claims rose, defying hopes that the nation's high unemployment rate might slide.
The big stock plunge, though, came around 10 a.m., when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported a sharp drop in regional manufacturing activity in its monthly survey, deepening worries that the economy may dip back into recession.
That report came a day after Morgan Stanley lowered its forecasts for both worldwide and domestic economic growth, partly because it expected cuts in government spending in Europe and the United States to damp recoveries. It described the United States and the euro area as ''hovering dangerously close to a recession'' and said it would not take much in the form of additional shocks to tip the balance.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds dropped to 1.97 percent on the Philadelphia Fed news before recovering to close at 2.07. According to data from Bloomberg, that low during the day was the lowest yield since at least 1962. Global Financial Data, a supplier of historical financial and economic statistics, said it was the lowest since 1950.
''What freaked me out today was that Philly Fed number,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management. ''That was the first number that says recession.''
That sentiment was echoed by Eric Green, an economist at TD Securities. ''When you have an economy operating at stall speed facing these headwinds, it does not take much to tip it over the edge,'' he said. ''You read a report like this and you think we are going over the edge.''
Credit Suisse said in a note that if the Philadelphia numbers proved a national barometer, and that was unknown, ''then a recession likely began in August.''
The latest worries about Europe's banks flared after an unnamed lender tapped an emergency borrowing program, which was established by the European Central Bank to ensure that firms had ample money in dollars.
The bank borrowed $500 million, a relatively modest sum. But it was the first time a bank had turned to the special program since February, and it set off worries that at least some banks might be struggling to find dollars to finance their operations.
Regulators and bank executives played down the possibility that it could lead to a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when credit markets froze virtually around the world.
But that news, combined with a report that the New York Federal Reserve has in recent weeks been more closely monitoring the American subsidiaries of European banks, pushed down bank shares in Europe and then in the United States.
The shares of Dexia, a large Belgian bank, fell 14 percent. Societe Generale fell 12.3 percent. Shares in two British banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays Bank, fell sharply. In the United States, Citigroup fell 6.3 percent to $27.98, and Bank of America fell 6 percent to $7.01.
American banks are probably in better financial shape than they were on the eve of the 2008 crisis. But the sell-off reflects fears that the troubles brewing among European lenders could spread across the Atlantic.
''It is just a measure of the whole negative sentiment in the markets,'' said Mr. Green of TD Securities.
Asian Pacific stock markets, which missed the worst of the selling on Thursday, fell sharply in early trading on Friday. The Nikkei 225 in Japan was 2.15 percent lower midday. Stocks in South Korea sagged 4.3 percent, and the major index in Australia was down 2.64 percent.
Gold rose to a non-inflation adjusted record of more than $1,837 an ounce. Futures on the S.& P. 500 index were o.4 percent lower in Asia.
The United States stock market began to gyrate wildly this month after Standard & Poor's decision late on Aug. 5 to downgrade America's long-term credit rating. There were alternating gains and losses of more than 4 percent on four subsequent trading days -- which had never before happened in the history of the S.& P. index, which dates to 1928.
Stocks were buoyed by the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would keep short-term interest rates close to zero for the next two years. This week, corporate profits spurred some optimism. So did a $12.5 billion deal by Google.
On Thursday, the sell-off was broad, with all 10 sectors of the S.& P. 500 finishing lower; most rattled were industrial and material companies. So far this month, financial stocks are the worst performers.
Extreme volatility is likely to continue, market analysts say, as long as there is uncertainty about how the chronic debt crisis in the euro zone will be resolved and about whether the global economy is slipping. Policy makers in Europe and the United States have yet to demonstrate the kind of forceful leadership that would instill confidence, they assert.
The VIX, a measure of stock market volatility, which eased last week, snapped back by about one-third on Thursday, to a reading of 42.67, suggesting that investors had grown more fearful.
So far, at least, credit markets in the United States have shown few signs of stress, bolstered by the cheap financing supported by the Federal Reserve.
But the European credit markets are signaling some increased levels of strain, though still far from that experienced nearly three years ago.
For example, interbank lending rates in Europe -- a measure of banks' willingness or reluctance to lend to each other -- have risen. Swap rates in the foreign exchange market, which allows banks to swap euros for dollars, have doubled from a few months ago. They remain less than half the levels reached during the financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Seattle, After Decade of Debate, Approves Tunnel

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- For all its gentle reserve, this city has generated more than a few bold notions, from commercial jets to $5 coffee. Its Next Big Thing is similarly unconventional: a huge act of redevelopment intended to be all but invisible.
On Tuesday, voters here gave what amounts to a final blessing to a $2 billion, 1.7-mile, 56-foot-wide, deep-bore highway tunnel that will run below downtown skyscrapers and behind a sea wall that holds back Puget Sound. 
The decisive vote, on a technical question about the authority of the City Council to approve the project, was seen as an ''enough is enough'' statement after 10 years of debate. The project will replace an earthquake-damaged elevated highway that has run between downtown and Elliott Bay for a half-century.
It was also seen as a sharp rejection of Mayor Mike McGinn, who built his 2009 campaign on opposition to the tunnel and has spent much of his term fighting it, calling it too expensive and counter to the city's broader goals of expanding alternative means of transportation.
But assuming that an earthquake does not devastate the tunnel or that its construction does not cause downtown to collapse on top of it (not going to happen, engineers say), the politics will eventually give way to one of the more ambitious public works projects in the country and a remarkable urban transformation.
The tunnel is scheduled to be completed in late 2015. A few years later, 22 acres of redesigned, newly accessible downtown waterfront -- over which the decaying Alaskan Way Viaduct now looms -- is expected to open to the public.
Preliminary design for the waterfront is under way, and its potential features have a clear Northwest flavor. Besides cafes, shops, housing, bike paths and open spaces with views of the water and the Olympic Mountains, ideas under consideration include thermal pools for public bathing and ''poetry poles,'' ''with poetry by local poets,'' said Nick Licata, a member of the City Council.
Beverages are also likely to be a priority.
''Beer has got to be right up front,'' said Marshall Foster, the city planning director.
But before the party starts, Mr. Foster said, ''There's a lot of work to do, a lot of money to be spent, a lot of money to be found to pay for all of this.''
While the waterfront project does not yet have a budget, many critics have questioned whether the tunnel and related construction costs will outstrip the $3.1 billion allocated for them in local, state and federal money. Opponents often call the Seattle tunnel project Big Dig West, a swipe that refers to the Boston highway tunnel project that cost more than twice its initial budget, took years longer than expected to complete and was mired in fraud and mismanagement.
''Everybody wants to declare that Boston built a tunnel, Washington's building a tunnel, therefore you're going to have the same problems they did and you're going to come in over budget,'' said Paula Hammond, the state secretary of transportation. ''I declare that not true. This is Washington's opportunity to demonstrate how to build a megaproject with strong management, risk management, accountability, and to deliver a project on budget and on time, to show people that it can be done.''
Once finished, the highway is projected to handle less than half the traffic the current viaduct handles, in part because tolls will be charged -- they are expected to be as high as $4 -- and are likely to prompt many drivers to use free routes. But the tunnel is strongly supported by most top business and political leaders (after Tuesday's vote, even Mayor McGinn said the city had spoken and the project should go forward) who say it will ease highway traffic through the city, improve transportation routes to the Port of Seattle and open up the waterfront.
The Federal Highway Administration is expected to give final approval to the project as early as Friday. A southern portion of the existing viaduct is to be torn down in October, with the rest remaining open until the tunnel is completed.
Kenneth Mead, a former inspector general for the federal Department of Transportation who presided over financial reviews of the Big Dig, said that state officials routinely insist that their megaproject will be different than troubled ones elsewhere.
''They all say that in the beginning,'' he said, adding that megaprojects often are under way for a year or more before complications inevitably arise.
Washington officials insist they are ready to deal with complications. Even if the area is hit by a devastating magnitude-9 earthquake, a situation that experts say is possible, Ron Paananen, the tunnel project administrator for the state, said the tunnel ''may sustain damage or not be usable, but there would be no loss of life.''

HEADLINE: Prison Closing Pleases City and Helps State Budget

BYLINE: By BRANDI GRISSOM. 
bgrissom@texastribune.org

 BODY:
SUGAR LAND -- Across the street from a manicured subdivision and just down the road from a growing regional airport is one of the oldest prisons in Texas, its stark white exterior and razor wire jutting out from a maze of oak trees. 
The 1930's Art Deco penitentiary, named Central Unit, was once a state-of-the-art facility, but now it seems out of place in this growing master-planned city just south of Houston. City leaders here have been eager for years to see the minimum-security prison shuttered and its valuable land made into a revenue-generating business park, helping to complete the city's transformation from rural town to wealthy commercial hub.
''The whole face of Sugar Land has changed so much over the last 50 years,'' said Regina Morales, the city's economic development director.
This year, the state, facing a crushing budget shortfall and seeing a chance to save about $12.5 million a year, made it possible to close Central Unit. On a sunny, muggy afternoon last week, uniformed inmates, bused in from other prisons, helped to dismantle metal bunks and cart out furniture from the prison, whose inmates were sent to other units earlier this month. The Central Unit will close by the end of August.
''It's a part of history,'' the senior warden, Herman Weston, said. ''I'm sad about that.''
Texas bought the prison property, originally more than 5,400 acres, in 1908 from Imperial Sugar, the company for which Sugar Land was named. The current prison, built in 1932, housed more than 1,000 inmates at times. They farmed, worked in a cannery and ran a meat packing plant, all owned by the state.
''The idea was to train these guys and give them some skills,'' said Don Hudson, who has worked at the prison since 1987. He was manager of the soap factory, which began operations in 1965, initially making detergent out of tallow in bones from the packing plant. Over the years, as agriculture operations shrank and the state sold much of the land, the city grew up around the prison. All that remains of Central Unit is about 330 acres. And, in 2002, the Imperial Refinery shut down and the city made plans for a 700-acre master-planned development on the site.
No longer known as a hub for sugar manufacturing but as a booming suburb that attracts businesses and developers, Sugar Land saw its population grow 158 percent in the 1990s, according to the 2000 census, making it the second-fastest-growing city in Texas.
City officials started eyeing what was left of the prison property. Along with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, they conducted a study in 2009 that showed that a business park on the site would raise nearly $1 million annually in tax revenue for the city and some $4.6 million for the state.
The state's budget crisis finally persuaded lawmakers to shutter Central Unit, the first time in Texas history they closed a state prison.

HEADLINE: H.P. Weighs Spinning Off Its PC Unit

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF; Contributing reporting were Evelyn Rusli, Michael J. de la Merced and Jeffrey Cane from New York, and Julia Werdigier from London.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- In a sweeping change for Hewlett-Packard, Leo Apotheker, the technology giant's chief executive, said Thursday that he was considering spinning off the company's personal computer business into a separate company and spending $10 billion on Autonomy, a business software maker.
By acquiring Autonomy, based in Britain, Mr. Apotheker would sharply refocus the company on business services and products. He has been trying to speed the company's growth, which has stagnated amid internal missteps, a sour economy and shifting consumer tastes. 
Mr. Apotheker's plan includes killing off the TouchPad tablet, introduced into stores only weeks ago, Pre smartphones and other WebOS products it acquired last year when it bought Palm for $1.2 billion. A spinoff of the PC unit would also reverse H.P.'s $25 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2002.
''It's Day 1 of the transformation,'' Mr. Apotheker said in an interview. He spoke of the ''difficult decisions'' that had to be made, but said he was seeking better performance from the company.
Splitting off the PC unit would eliminate the drag of a slumping, low-margin business on H.P. Instead, Mr. Apotheker, who joined H.P. last year, is trying to move toward providing corporate customers with more services and cloud computing -- a term used to describe delivering products and services online -- that he says is more ''high value.''
The strategy challenges I.B.M and Oracle, two giants in the market. By unloading its computer business, H.P.'s would follow in the footsteps of I.B.M., which sold its computer unit to Lenovo, a Chinese company, in 2005.
H.P. said it would take 12 to 18 months to decide what to do with the PC unit. Meanwhile, it will continue to run the business as usual. Mr. Apotheker said the company did not intend to dispose of its printer business.
''Enterprise is where the growth is, that's where the margins are,'' said Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher & Company.
Wall Street has been concerned about H.P.'s growth ever since Mr. Apotheker joined the company, and the weakening economy has added to the uncertainty. A series of disappointing quarters and forecasts had sent the company's shares down nearly 22 percent since the start of the year before Thursday.
Shares of H.P. fell $1.88, or 6 percent, to close at $29.51.
Acquiring Autonomy, which makes software that searches and keeps track of corporate and government data, would greatly enhance H.P.'s shift to software and business services. The company has become one of the biggest technology firms in Britain and counts BP, Ford Motor and the United States Defense Department among its customers.
Autonomy would be H.P.'s third-largest acquisition ever, after Compaq and Electronic Data Systems. The $10 billion offer for Autonomy would represent a rich 64 percent premium over its market value. It produced almost $1 billion in revenue in the 12 months that ended June 30.
Mr. Apotheker said that Autonomy would get access to H.P.'s huge customer base. Its products would be sold across H.P. business, he said.
That also was H.P.'s strategy in buying Compaq. It gave the company the scale to cut costs and secure favorable prices on parts. It was also supposed to give it clout with corporations that were also seeking printers, servers, storage and data management services.
As recently as February, Todd Bradley, H.P.'s executive vice president for the company's computer division, insisted in an interview that the PC was still a valuable part of H.P.'s business. He dismissed speculation that the company would dump the unit. ''The PC business has been strategically important to H.P,'' he said. ''The strategic importance hasn't changed as the leadership changes.''
H.P. has dominated the PC business, but in recent months the industry has gone through a downward turn with the shift from desktops and laptops to tablets.
In the third quarter, revenue from H.P.'s personal computer sales fell 3 percent to $9.5 billion. Sales to consumers fell 17 percent although sales to corporate customers rose 9 percent.
By jettisoning its tablet, along with its mobile phone business, H.P. would be surrendering in a fast-growing market dominated by Apple. But so far, Apple is the only company that is selling a significant number of tablets. It sold more than $6 billion worth of iPads in the most recent quarter.
Mr. Apotheker had bragged about the TouchPad tablet, in particular, calling it a serious challenger in an expanding market. His executives scoffed at critics of the product, calling the effort a marathon, not a sprint.
But in the end, consumers balked at buying the device. H.P. quickly cut the price 20 percent and then decided to put it out of its misery after just two months. Mr. Apotheker said that the tablet had failed to live up to the financial milestones he set.
H.P. said that it was considering licensing its WebOS software to other companies or selling it.
Louis Miscioscia, an analyst with Collins Stewart, said that H.P.'s overhaul would take years and that it remained early in the turnaround. The PC business would have inevitably declined, he said, while its tablet effort was too little too late.
''In technology, you can't be so far behind,'' Mr. Miscioscia said. ''You get too far behind and it's really hard to leapfrog back in.''
In its earnings report on Thursday, H.P. showed that it was continuing to struggle with slow growth. It reported net income in the quarter ended July 31 grew 9 percent to $1.93 billion, or 93 cents a share, versus $1.77 billion, or 75 cents in the year-ago quarter.
The company said revenue inched up nearly 1 percent, to $31.2 billion from $30.7 billion.
The adjusted income of $1.10 a share was slightly above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected $1.09 a share and revenue of $31.19 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.
H.P.'s outlook for the fourth quarter was well below expectations. Revenue is expected to be $32.1 billion to $32.5 billion, short of the forecast from analysts of slightly more than $34 billion. Adjusted income is expected to be $1.12 to $1.16 a share, again below the $1.31 predicted by analysts.

HEADLINE: No Sign of Calm in Market Outlook

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE, RICHARD BEALES and JEFFREY GOLDFARB

 BODY:
The fear of a euro zone sequel to the Lehman Brothers collapse has whipsawed stocks, bonds and just about every other market. Thursday's action followed the same pattern. Major European and American stock indexes slumped as much as 6 percent, while safe-haven Treasuries and gold rose. As long as policy makers and fundamentals alike offer no conviction, global volatility is set to stay high.
This week's uninspiring summit talk between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, followed by Thursday's news reports about European banking woes, helped reignite the kind of fear trade that has sent the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down, up and down again in an approximately 100-point range since Aug. 4. Meanwhile, a record high for gold and new lows for Treasury yields underscored how desperate some investors were to escape the volatility. 
Gloomy United States economic data didn't help. The Philadelphia Fed reported a collapse in regional manufacturing activity, while existing home sales fell further. Those figures served as another reminder that even setting aside the potential economic damage from Europe's debt troubles, the world's largest economy is only stumbling along. The White House and the Fed alike are now low on practical options that might increase growth.
This lack of any meaningful further safety net of the kind that eased the Lehman debacle in 2008 should keep financial markets rocky well beyond the traditionally thin trading days of August. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX index of S.& P. 500 volatility soared more than 35 percent to top 42 on Thursday. It stopped just shy of the peak earlier this month, and well short of crisis levels three years back -- but is running far above the precrisis norm.
Unconvincing economic data leaning toward softness -- which has led several investment banks as well as the New York Fed president, Bill Dudley, to downgrade their growth expectations in recent days -- may well provide the tinder for more market gyrations. But the potential sparks include both bank alarms and failures by political leaders to make hard decisions and stick to them. The recent stomach-churning volatility is brutal for many investors. Unfortunately, they may need to keep the Alka-Seltzer at hand for a while.
Wall Street Upstarts
Upstart merger and acquisitions boutiques are eating from Wall Street's table. Two newish shops, Blair Effron's Centerview and Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst, helped Motorola Mobility strike a deal to sell itself to Google for $12.5 billion this week. Along with two other firms opened over the last five years by Ken Moelis and Joseph Perella, this foursome is gnawing at the fee pool of big investment banks.
In the aftermath of the crisis, flocks of bankers either went solo or joined tested players like Bob Greenhill and Roger Altman, who had done so years before. Mr. Effron, Mr. Perella and Mr. Moelis, who started their boutiques in 2006 and 2007, had a head start on the 2008 crisis, enabling them to woo disenfranchised colleagues with the promise of independence and equity stakes. Mr. Quattrone's return to the industry in 2008 neatly coincided with resurgent demand for his Silicon Valley M.& A. expertise.
Global merger activity plunged from more than $4 trillion in 2007 to about $2 trillion two years later. Even so, according to Thomson Reuters data, the four relative newcomers have advised on nearly $900 billion worth of transactions since 2006. That is about 5 percent of the worldwide volume over that span. Based on estimates by Freeman & Company using publicly disclosed figures, Centerview, Perella Weinberg, Moelis & Company and Qatalyst have pocketed a combined $1.3 billion of merger-related fees over five years.
Lazard, Evercore and Greenhill have picked up market share, too. It couldn't be happening at a worse time for Wall Street's giants. Their trading and lending arms are struggling, so even a modest loss of business on the advisory side stings.
But specialized M.& A. firms weren't besieged during the crisis in the way mortgage bond trading behemoths were. Corporate boards are also alert to conflicts of interest when hiring advisers. And it helps the independent players that acquirers like Google are sitting on hoards of cash that diminish the appeal of the lending and capital-raising promised by bigger banks. With those factors in place, Mr. Effron, Mr. Quattrone, Mr. Moelis and Mr. Perella shouldn't have trouble keeping their firms nourished.

HEADLINE: Euro-Style Anxiety Spreads

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and JACK EWING; Nelson D. Schwartz and Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
European banks are continuing to show signs of strain, making investors increasingly skittish about American financial institutions.
Regulators, bank executives and others continued to play down the risks on Thursday, emphasizing that this would not be a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. In Europe, political leaders have vowed to prevent a Lehman-like collapse of a major bank, while American firms are better insulated from potential shocks than they were three years ago.
But on Thursday, shares of some big Wall Street banks sank to levels nearly as low as that in the months after the downfall of Lehman Brothers. Among investors, anxiety has been intensifying over the soundness of European banks despite repeated efforts to contain the sovereign debt crisis. The latest fears flared up after an unspecified lender tapped an emergency borrowing program set up by the European Central Bank to ensure that firms had ample funds in dollars. 
On Wednesday the bank, which officials would not identify, borrowed $500 million, considered a relatively modest sum in global finance. But the move was widely viewed as a sign that Europe's financial problems were deepening, given that it was the first time a European bank had used the dollar pipeline since February.
Investors are also nervous that the world economy may tip back into a recession, putting new pressure on big American banks just as they appear to be finding their footing.
After a few fleeting days of relief, stress levels across the industry are once again rising. Credit-default swaps on major banks, which pay out in the event of a financial collapse, have again widened in the last few days. Borrowing costs are notching slightly higher. Tension on trading floors is palpable -- especially for the usually relaxed month of August.
To be sure, fears are nowhere near the levels reached at the depths of the financial crisis. Still, even measures taken to stave off another crisis are feeding the panic.
Here in the United States, news reports of heightened regulatory scrutiny have further eroded confidence and caused investors to dump their bank shares.
In Europe, temporary bans on short-selling of financial stocks, imposed last week by regulators in France and several other European countries, provided only a bit of relief. Traders say the measures have caused them to place some negative bets on bank stocks in countries that did not impose such measures, like the United States and Britain.
''There's a general climate of apprehension,'' said Jean-Pierre Lambert, a senior bank analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London. ''When you have doubts about names, it can turn into a vicious circle.''
On Thursday, Citigroup shares plunged 6.26 percent, to $27.98. Bank of America was down 6 percent, to $7.01. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs shares sink 4.76 percent and 3.51 percent, respectively. Bank stocks are down about 30 percent since January, and have swung wildly over the last few weeks.
The pounding was even more pronounced in Europe, where talk about the short-term financing challenges of the banks swirled through the stock market. Shares in Dexia, a large Belgian bank, dropped 14 percent. Societe Generale fell 12 percent. Two British giants, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, each had sharp declines.
American regulators have stepped up scrutiny of both United States and European lenders over the summer, with officials holding more frequent conference calls with individual firms alongside their counterparts at other central banks, according to people briefed on the phone calls.
William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, described the inquiries as routine bank supervision. ''We're always scrutinizing European banks, U.S. banks and foreign banks in terms of how they're doing, capital, liquidity, credit quality -- so this is standard operating procedure,'' he said in remarks at a New Jersey business conference, according to The Star-Ledger of Newark.
For now, American banks appear to be sound, and are probably in better financial shape than they were on the eve of the 2008 crisis. But the fear is that the troubles brewing among European lenders could ripple across the Atlantic.
European banks have amassed vast holdings of government and corporate bonds from Italy and Spain, two countries whose debts have worried investors. Doubts about the stability of these European institutions, in turn, are generating concerns about American banks, which are among their biggest lenders and trading partners. That is prompting investors on both sides of the Atlantic to unload their shares while also ratcheting up bank borrowing costs.
The short-term credit markets, where European banks turn for billions of dollars in financing, have been under serious strain, although nowhere near the levels of three years ago. Most European banks can borrow dollars only overnight or as long as a week; banks elsewhere can take out loans for as long as several months or more.
''Currently many banks cannot access term-funding markets at reasonable rates,'' Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a report on European banks. ''If these term-funding stresses continue well into the fall, the risks are rising that a lack of credit availability could dent domestic demand growth further.''
Still, several short-term credit traders and analysts said that suggested little has changed while the talk has been flying. A crucial barometer of bank stress -- the rate banks charge each other to swap euro-denominated assets into dollars -- is at roughly the same level it was a week ago.
''A lot of this concern around the European banks is overstated,'' said Alex Roever, a short-term fixed income analyst at JPMorgan. ''We are not looking at another 2009, although investors are obviously being cautious.''
Investors in bank stocks have been pummeled by the bad news. Weak data for the housing and job markets suggests loan growth will not pick up anytime soon. Consumer confidence has plunged to record lows, while big corporations are so nervous that analysts expect many to delay hiring and expansion plans.
On Thursday, Morgan Stanley economists warned that both the United States and Europe were ''hovering dangerously close to a recession.''
The prospect of twin recessions is perhaps the biggest worry for analysts who follow large American banks. JPMorgan Chase had about $49 billion of loans and other commitments to customers in France, Italy, Spain and several peripheral countries, according to research from Barclays. Citigroup had about $44 billion, while Bank of America had about 20 billion.
''The banks' loans and commitments to European customers appear manageable,'' said Jason Goldberg, the Barclays analyst who did the analysis. ''To the extent issues in Europe lead to a slowdown in global economic growth, the U.S. banks aren't immune.''

HEADLINE: Save the Savings Bond

BYLINE: By FRED T. GOLDBERG Jr. and PETER TUFANO. 
Fred T. Goldberg Jr. was commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service from 1989 to 1992. Peter Tufano is the dean of the Said Business School at Oxford University.

 BODY:
FOR generations of children, the idea of saving first became real when a savings bond landed in a birthday or holiday card, the image of a famous American staring out from the elaborate, earth-tone etching on a stately certificate. These fond memories may explain why this year nearly 50,000 Americans -- the vast majority of them modest wage-earners -- decided, under a new I.R.S. policy, to buy savings bonds with a portion of their precious tax refunds.
But taking advantage of this crucial form of savings is about to get much harder. The Treasury Department announced last month that in January it would end over-the-counter sales of savings bonds. While paper bonds will still be available at tax time and electronic bonds will still be sold online, bonds will no longer be sold at banks, savings-and-loan institutions and credit unions. 
Given the continuing debate over fiscal policy, now hardly seems like the time for Treasury to make it harder for Americans to support their country by buying its debt. The savings bond program, which began in 1935, has helped millions of Americans save for a home, for college tuition or for a first car. More than a financial instrument, savings bonds are an instrument of hope. Pamela Sinclair, a 48-year-old Baltimore mother who works in health care, told us that she bought bonds for her children, using her tax refund, because ''they could be president of the United States someday.''
Moreover, the tried-and-true savings bond is a universal product. Where else can someone with as little as $50 invest in a virtually risk-free, inflation-protected, giftable, fee-free savings product with returns that often exceed the meager interest on savings accounts?
Savings and financial literacy are particularly critical for working families with limited assets. The nonprofit group Doorways to Dreams Fund, which encourages low-income families to save (and which we serve as board members), found that up to 10 percent of low-income tax filers ordered savings bonds with their tax refunds, when offered the opportunity in pilot tests conducted between 2006 and 2009. Most said they saved for their children and grandchildren; nearly a third developed a savings habit, buying bonds year after year.
In the past decade, opportunities for saving money at tax time have improved. Under President George W. Bush, the I.R.S. introduced a ''split refund'' feature -- an option for filers to send their refunds directly to more than one account. Last year, the Obama administration added the option to use refund money to buy savings bonds. As a result, all taxpayers now have the option to save, even if they do not have bank accounts.
The decision to eliminate the sale of paper bonds at banks is only the latest of several actions that have blunted the impact of these positive developments. The federal government has for years done little to support the savings bond program -- eliminating its marketing budget, ending a program that allowed employees to buy savings bonds through payroll deduction, lowering annual purchase limits and making savings bond terms less favorable for small investors. Despite these obstacles, Americans still buy more than $1 billion in paper savings bonds every year.
It's true that Americans will still be able to buy savings bonds electronically, through a Web-based platform known as TreasuryDirect. But the system isn't user-friendly, and it presupposes ready Internet access, which about 35 percent of all Americans and 65 percent of low-income Americans do not have. And the system requires a user to have a bank account, effectively excluding the 17 million American adults who are ''unbanked.'' This may explain why less than 1 percent of the 55 million people who own savings bonds have TreasuryDirect accounts.
Rather than making savings bonds less accessible, the government should encourage thrift by reinventing the bond program for the 21st century. The option to buy a savings bond at tax time is a wonderful first step. Another promising opportunity is to offer savings bonds in retail stores via a savings-bond card, similar to the gift cards and prepaid bank cards in ever wider use. (Imagine if you could ''buy savings'' in a checkout line.) And the TreasuryDirect site should be updated and made more accessible, particularly for those who are less adept at navigating financial information.
While we applaud the Obama administration for retaining paper savings bonds at tax time, we urge the Treasury Department to reverse its decision to eliminate their sale, year-round, at financial institutions. We must not take away one of the few proven tools -- one born during the Depression -- that empowers working people to save for themselves and their children.

HEADLINE: Island's Naval Base Stirs Opposition In South Korea

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
GANGJEONG, South Korea -- Dozens of banners adorn this village on the southern coast of South Korea's southernmost major island, trumpeting anxieties that have invaded this otherwise idyllic community and divided it so deeply that residents say some fathers and sons have stopped talking to one another.
''Fight to the death against the American imperialists' anti-China naval base!'' says one banner.
That declaration -- and the underlying issue dividing this village of 1,000 fishermen and farmers on Jeju Island -- mirrors the broader quandary South Korea faces, caught between the United States, its longstanding military ally, and China, its former battlefield foe but now its leading trading partner. 
In January, the South Korean Navy began construction on a $970 million base in Gangjeong. Once completed in 2014, it will be home to 20 warships, including submarines, that the navy says will protect shipping lanes for South Korea's export-driven economy, which is dependent on imported oil. It will also enable South Korea to respond quickly to a brewing territorial dispute with China over Socotra Rock, a submerged reef south of Jeju that the Koreans call Ieodo. Both sides believe it is surrounded by oil and mineral deposits.
American ships cruising East Asian seas will be permitted to visit the port, the Defense Ministry says, and many villagers and anti-base activists from the Korean mainland suspect that the naval base will serve less as a shield against South Korea's prime enemy, North Korea, than as an outpost for the United States Navy to project its power against China.
Fear of becoming ''the shrimp whose back gets broken in a fight between whales'' -- a popular saying in this country, whose territory has been the battlefield of bigger powers -- is palpable in this village, where palm trees sway in the wind and low-slung homes lie snug behind walls of volcanic rock.
''I don't understand why we're trying so hard to accommodate something people in Okinawa tried so hard to resist,'' said Kim Jong-hwan, 55, a tangerine farmer, referring to the Japanese islanders' struggle against the American military base there. ''When I think how the Americans go around the world starting wars, I can only expect the worst.''
Older islanders have harrowing memories of war. Shortly before and during the 1950-53 Korean War, government troops cracking down on people they suspected of being leftists who might sympathize with North Korea devastated Jeju, burning villages and killing about 30,000 people, or one-tenth of the population. In 2005, the government designated Jeju, sometimes romanized as Cheju, as a ''peace island.''
For months, Mr. Kim and other villagers have joined the anti-base activists, squatting in the center of the construction zone. When the police tried to remove them recently, they chained themselves to trees.
The South Korean Navy has erected a billboard in the village displaying an artist's conception of a state-of-the-art, ''eco-friendly'' port, covering about 125 acres and receiving luxury cruise ships as well as military vessels.
''A new attraction for beautiful Jeju!'' it proclaims.
Nearby, protesters' banners accuse the navy of destroying the environment and the villagers' way of life.
''Don't bring war here!'' one says.
Both the South Korean and American militaries insist that the United States military is not involved in the base's construction. Nor is the base directed against a particular country, the Defense Ministry says. But the controversy feeds on the unease many South Koreans feel as they struggle to reconcile the influence of a rising China with their longstanding security ties to the United States.
Ever since the United States fought alongside it in the Korean War, South Korea has considered its alliance with Washington a top priority, a position re-emphasized after North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and its recent military provocations, including the shelling of another South Korean island in November. But many South Koreans, especially younger ones, suspect that Washington is exploiting that sense of vulnerability to compel their country into advancing American foreign policy interests.
Meanwhile, trade with China exceeds South Korea's trade with the United States and Japan combined. But Beijing also maintains close ties with North Korea.
''The question behind Jeju is, can South Korea afford to confront China? Or, can it afford not to confront China?'' said Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul.
Yun Yon, a retired navy vice admiral, said, ''We may do business with the Chinese, but still it's the Americans we should do security with.''
Song Kang-ho, an activist against the base, disagreed. ''With the U.S. economy in a mess, it's just a matter of time before China dominates Northeast Asia,'' Mr. Song said. ''We should keep neutral between the rising and declining superpowers.''
In 2005, South Korea's fear of confronting China flared into a public quarrel between Seoul and Washington over ''strategic flexibility,'' a plan that would redefine the mission of American troops stationed in South Korea for the South's defense, allowing them to be sent to conflicts elsewhere. The dispute was patched up in 2006 when Washington agreed to respect South Korea's wish not to be ''involved in a regional conflict in Northeast Asia against the will of the Korean people.''
Yet, pressure from both China and the United States continued as South Korea expanded its navy, building KDX-III destroyers fitted with the American-designed Aegis missile-intercepting system.
In March, Ellen O. Tauscher, the American under secretary of state for arms control and international security, said the United States wanted South Korea to expand the allies' low-level missile defense ties into an integrated regional missile defense system that some experts suspect was intended as a shield against China.
Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control specialist at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, said the new Aegis destroyers to be based in Jeju would help defend South Korea against Chinese missiles and help defend Japan against missiles from both China and North Korea.
But they ''won't provide much defense for South Korea against North Korean missiles,'' he said. ''Very few North Korean missiles would rise high enough on their way toward South Korea to give South Korean destroyers a shot.''
China had already complained, in 2004, about South Korea's missile defense cooperation with the United States, said Kim Jong-dae, who served in the office of Roh Moo-hyun, South Korea's president from 2003 to 2008. Later, it denounced the planned naval base in Jeju, Admiral Yun said.
Partly out of deference to Beijing, Seoul has yet to commit itself fully to the American missile defense program. Even so, John F. Fei of the RAND Corporation said in a paper published in February that the construction of the Jeju base might indicate that once South Korea saw China's rising economic power as a possible threat, ''it no longer repressed voices within the elite calling for a more muscular political and security posture to hedge against China.''
Still, Matthew Hoey, an arms control analyst based in Cambridge, Mass., who recently visited Gangjeong to support those fighting the base, argued that the base could set off a regional arms race by prompting China to upgrade its own strategic deterrent.
The divide in this Korean village has turned emotional, often erupting into shouting matches. Those who favor the base and those who do not avoid one another on the street and even shop at different stores, according to villagers on both sides.
Gangjeong once had 50 various social associations, but the members' ties have been broken as ''even fathers and sons, as well as bothers, turned their back against each other,'' said Mr. Kim, the tangerine farmer.
Speaking about the opponents of the base, Koh Jong-pyo, 47, an abalone fisherman, said: ''They worry too much. Think what it could do for the local economy whenever an American aircraft carrier arrives with thousands of sailors and their cash.''

HEADLINE: Black Scientists Less Likely to Win Federal Research Grants, Study Reports

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
A research grant application from a black scientist to the National Institutes of Health is markedly less likely to win approval than one from a white scientist, a new study reported on Thursday.
Even when the researchers made statistical adjustments to ensure they were comparing apples to apples -- that is, scientists at similar institutions with similar academic track records -- the disparity persisted. A black scientist was one-third less likely than a white counterpart to get a research project financed, the study found.
''It is striking and very disconcerting,'' said Donna K. Ginther, a professor of economics at the University of Kansas who led the study. ''It was very unexpected to find this big of a gap that couldn't be explained.'' 
The findings are being published in Friday's issue of the journal Science.
At the N.I.H., which commissioned the study, top officials said they would follow up to figure out the causes of the disparity and take steps to fix it.
''This situation is not acceptable,'' said Dr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the N.I.H., a federal medical research agency. ''This is not one of those reports that we will look at and then put aside.''
The researchers said they did not know whether the panels that reviewed the grant applications were discriminating against black applicants, whether applications from black researchers were somehow weaker, or whether a combination of factors was at play.
In the study, Dr. Ginther and her colleagues looked at 83,000 grant applications from 2000 to 2006. For every 100 applications submitted by white scientists, 29 were awarded grants. For every 100 applications from black scientists, 16 were financed.
After the apples-to-apples statistical adjustments, the gap narrowed but still existed.
The medical research community has long struggled to recruit more minority scientists. For example, about 2.9 percent of full-time medical school faculty members are black, Dr. Collins said; according to census figures, blacks make up 12.6 percent of the population. But the study now shows that the few blacks who do enter research are not on an even playing field.
''It indicates to us that we have not only failed to recruit the best and brightest minds from all of the groups that need to come and join us,'' Dr. Collins said, ''but for those who have come and joined us, there is an inequity in their ability to achieve funding from the N.I.H.''
Members of other races and ethnic groups, including Hispanics, do not appear to run into the same difficulties. Asians were somewhat less successful, but the gap disappeared when foreign-born scientists -- who may have difficulty with English in writing successful grants -- were excluded.
Earlier studies have found that women have largely the same level of success as men in obtaining N.I.H. grants.
The grant applications are reviewed in a two-step process. In the first, an application is assigned to a committee consisting of 10 to 40 people, largely drawn from researchers outside the N.I.H. For each application, three committee members review it in detail and assign a tentative score, and then the full committee discusses the top 50 percent of the applications before assigning a final numerical score to each.
The study found that once final numerical scores were assigned, the second review treated scientists of all groups equally based on the scores.
On the grant applications, researchers are asked to identify their race and ethnicity, but that information is not passed along to the review committees. Still, because the applications are not judged anonymously, the reviewers may know the applicant, and often race is not difficult to infer from the name or academic details. For example, a person who attended a historically black university is likely to be black.
Dr. Otis W. Brawley, who is the chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society and is black, said the cause was not overt racism. ''It's not that they're out to deny blacks funding,'' said Dr. Brawley, who worked as an administrator at the National Cancer Institute, part of the N.I.H., in the 1990s.
Rather, it is more likely an unconscious bias, he said, with the reviewers more likely to give the benefit of the doubt to someone they are familiar with, and with black researchers tending to keep a low profile in the scientific world.
Dr. Collins agreed. ''Even today, in 2011, in our society, there is still an unconscious, insidious form of bias that subtly influences people's opinions,'' he said. ''I think that may be very disturbing for people in the scientific community to contemplate, but I think we have to take that as one of the possibilities and investigate it and see if that is in fact still happening.''
The institutes have put together a task force to follow up on the Science study. For example, it plans to perform an experiment to review some grants by two committees; one will use the current review process, while the other will review the applications with the names and institutions of the applicants removed.
The institutes will also recruit more young researchers to serve on the review committees. That experience could give them a better understanding of how to write a successful application for their own research.
Dr. Raynard S. Kington, a co-author of the Science study who helped put it together when he was the N.I.H.'s deputy director in 2008, lauded Dr. Collins and other officials there for taking the issue seriously.
''There are those who have said, 'I don't understand what the problem is, why do we need to do anything?' '' said Dr. Kington, who is black and is now president of Grinnell College in Iowa.

HEADLINE: Amalgamated Hires a New Chief Executive

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A NEW YORK agency that changed hands last year is bringing in a new chief executive in a bid to spur further growth.
Amalgamated, which works for marketers like Ben & Jerry's, CarMax, Coca-Cola, MSG Networks and Qdoba Mexican Grill, is hiring Brian Martin as chief executive, succeeding Charles Rosen. Mr. Rosen, who was one of the three founders of Amalgamated in 2003, is leaving to pursue what he described as his longtime interests in public affairs and progressive politics.
The arrival of Mr. Martin is to be formally announced on Friday. It comes 11 months after a majority stake in Amalgamated was acquired by Eric Silver, a creative executive who left DDB Worldwide in New York to join Amalgamated as chief creative officer. Mr. Silver continues in that post, and is the majority owner of Amalgamated; Mr. Martin is acquiring an unspecified minority share in the agency as he comes aboard. 
Mr. Martin, who is 51, has worked in management posts for agencies that include Deutsch, JWT and what is now Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners. His specialty was business development, helping agencies attract new clients. Mr. Martin also served as chief marketing officer and chief executive of Qtopics, an online polling service.
For the last five years, Mr. Martin has run his own consultancy in New York, Source Martin, where he worked on agency reviews and other assignments for marketers like AT&T, Citibank and MetLife. Source Martin is being dissolved as Mr. Martin arrives at Amalgamated, effective on Sept. 1.
The moves are among a recent reshuffling of the executive suites at agencies that has involved many prominent industry figures. The increasing challenges that agencies face as they seek to keep up with changes in consumer behavior, technology and the economy are leading to more changes in top posts.
''I think it's the most exciting time in my lifetime to be in this business,'' Mr. Martin said in a phone interview. He compared it to ''the beginning of the TV era'' in the early 1950s and added, ''The next 10 years is when the most interesting things are going to get done.''
For that reason, Mr. Martin said, the place to be is ''in the middle of the action'' -- that is, at an agency -- rather than on the periphery at someplace like a consultancy.
Joining Amalgamated represents ''an opportunity to come into a place where you don't have to fix things, just turn up the volume,'' he added.
Mr. Silver, 44, said he was pleased with results at the agency since his arrival, citing an expansion to about 40 employees, from 34 a year ago; new digital work like a ''Fair Tweets'' campaign for Ben & Jerry's on Twitter, which was tied to World Fair Trade Day; and the addition of new clients like CarMax.
Still, ''I want us to play on a bigger stage,'' Mr. Silver said, ''expand, grow bigger.''
Mr. Martin ''knows how agencies operate, knows how clients operate,'' he added, ''and his new-business record at his prior agencies seems pretty impressive.'' That should offset any potential drawbacks from Mr. Martin's never having been a chief executive at an agency, Mr. Silver said.
Mr. Rosen, in a separate phone interview, also endorsed Mr. Martin, calling him ''a wonderful addition'' to Amalgamated who will ''fill in the mortar'' around the agency's ''bricks'' of its digital, creative and strategic work.
Mr. Rosen, 44, said he would sell his minority stake in Amalgamated as he steps down. He will subsequently serve as a consultant, he added, working with the agency on projects.
Although ''I have such mixed emotions about leaving,'' Mr. Rosen said, he agreed with an opinion expressed by Mr. Silver at a recent dinner.
''He said, 'You know, Charles, when you talk about politics, your eyes light up,' and it made me think,'' said Mr. Rosen, who has worked in advertising for 13 years at agencies that in addition to Amalgamated included Cliff Freeman & Partners.
''As I look at the current political climate,'' Mr. Rosen said, ''the discourse has shifted so far to the right that I felt it was time to take everything I've learned in the industry, at Amalgamated, about cultural strategy and branding, and apply it.''
''Look at how shockingly effective the Tea Party was from a marketing perspective,'' Mr. Rosen said, adding that he would like to work on ''creating an entity that would be a new populist movement'' to serve as a liberal counterpoint to the Tea Party.
Mr. Rosen's departure will leave only one of the three founders of Amalgamated still at the agency: Doug Cameron, the chief strategy officer. (Fiona McBride, president of Amalgamated, joined the agency in 2008.)
The third founder, Jason Gaboriau, was executive creative director before Mr. Silver's arrival. He sold his stake in Amalgamated to Mr. Silver and left the agency; he is now a co-executive creative director of the Los Angeles office of Crispin Porter & Bogusky, part of MDC Partners.

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Super Stars: Quilts From the American Folk Art Museum' (through Sept. 25) This location is featuring 20 quilts in which stars figure in some way, whether as pieced-together geometric forms or as little tufts of thread that suggest a distant galaxy. American Folk Art Museum Lincoln Square Branch, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
- Asia Society and Museum: 'The Buddhist Heritage of Pakistan: Art of Gandhara' (through Oct. 30) After a seemingly endless run of geopolitical roadblocks, this exhibition of ancient far northern Indian art, most of it from the collections of two museums in Pakistan, finally arrived, six months late, at Asia Society. Is the show worth all the diplomatic headaches it caused? With its images of bruiser bodhisattvas and polycultural goddesses, and some notable flights into the stratosphere of sculptural splendor, it is. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) 
Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Bronx Calling: The First AIM Biennial' (through Sept. 5) Some of the 72 participants in the Bronx Museum's Artist in the Marketplace program from 2010 and 2011, all included in this two-site exhibition, will warrant keeping an eye on. One for sure is Jessica Stoller, who creates exquisite, tabletop-scale, glazed porcelain figurative sculptures with a spooky, feminist edge. Matthew Conradt's large, vaguely nightmarish collages picturing faceless figures in Cubist-Surrealist compositions; Romy Scheroder's assemblages made of disparate pieces of wooden furniture; and Karla Wozniak's thick and crusty paintings of landscapes blighted by road signs also stand out. Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org; also at Wave Hill, West 249th Street and Independence Avenue, Riverdale, the Bronx, (718) 549-3200, wavehill.org. (Ken Johnson)
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Vishnu: Hinduism's Blue-Skinned Savior' (through Oct. 2) Hindu sculptures are no ordinary things. Concentrations of spiritual energy so dense as to turn physics inside out, they funnel light from other universes into our mundane world. The light takes a little time to penetrate this show, dauntingly crowded with objects, ideas and information. But it shines through in the end as we trace the many earthly forms taken by one of Hinduism's greatest gods and arrive at the spiritual matinee idol named Krishna. With his sapphire skin and sweet flute songs, he radiates devotional love, and everyone falls for him, including us. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2010: Hans-Peter Feldmann' (through Nov. 2) Mr. Feldmann, the septuagenarian German artist who was the surprise pick for the Boss Prize honors, has decided to exhibit his prize money in the form of 100,000 $1 bills, pinned to the wall of one of the Guggenheim's Tower galleries. What sounds on paper like a conceptual stunt or a riff on Warholian materialism becomes overpoweringly physical in person, thanks to the smell of the used bills and the traces of their circulation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Lee Ufan: Marking Infinity' (through Sept. 28) This five-decade retrospective fills the museum with about 90 works in a Zen-Minimalist, be-here-now vein by a Korean artist who lives in Paris and Japan. Sculptures consist of ordinary, pumpkin-size boulders juxtaposed with sheets and slabs of dark, glossy steel. Paintings made of wide brush strokes executed in gridded order on raw canvas exemplify tension between action and restraint. In its always near-perfect composure, Mr. Lee's art teeters perilously between art and decor. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
- International Center of Photography: 'Elliott Erwitt: Personal Best' (through Aug. 28) Like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Mr. Erwitt seeks ''the decisive moment,'' an instant in real time when people, animals or objects appear before the camera in surprising, funny and illuminating ways. The Henny Youngman of photographic one-liners, he delivers visual humor with such economy and grace that it is easy to overlook just how excellent an artist he is. This show presents more than 100 of his favorite images from the past seven decades. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'Hiroshima: Ground Zero 1945' (through Aug. 28) The contact prints and photographs in this show were made in connection with the 1947 United States Strategic Bombing Survey of Hiroshima and depict the cataclysmic devastation in unflinching detail. The survey texts that accompany the images may appear shockingly clinical. The caption on a picture of a library, or what remains of it, reads: ''Interior first story showing contents damage and spalling of cement plaster by fire. Note all books reduced to ashes.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Rosenberg)
Jewish Museum: 'Collecting Matisse and Modern Masters: The Cone Sisters of Baltimore' (through Sept. 25) This exhibition samples the extraordinary trove of European art amassed by two American spinsters in the first half of the 20th century, work now owned by the Baltimore Museum of Art. Although some major collection highlights are absent, the pieces here -- presented in the order of acquisition -- generate a compelling portrait of the Cones as collectors. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Andean Tunic, 400 B.C.E.-1800 C.E.' (through Sept. 18) This small show celebrates the festive yet functional garments woven south of the equator. To the modern eye, they're wearable paintings; lovers of Keith Haring and Elizabeth Murray will find much to admire. So will anyone interested in the complex relationships among art, clothing, ritual and power. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Anthony Caro on the Roof' (through Oct. 30) No one in the 1960s produced groovier abstract sculpture than the British artist Anthony Caro, five of whose heavy metal assemblages grace the Met's Rooftop Garden. But only one of these works has that startling, newborn feeling. Sporting a new coat of shiny, taxicab-yellow paint, ''Midday'' (1960) has the look of a jaunty, industrial dinosaur. The others, dating from 1968 to 2010, show a development toward an increasingly conservative, ponderous monumentality. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Frans Hals in the Metropolitan Museum' (through Oct. 10) This small but potent show gathers the Met's 11 confirmed works by the great 17th-century Dutch painter, appending them with two outstanding loans and a selection of contextualizing works. It gives a remarkably full account of his talent and the painterly realisms -- vivacious to relatively restrained -- that he formulated. It also reveals an artist who viewed his subjects with a nonjudgmental equanimity, whether he depicted them singly or in groups, in dignified repose or unbridled revelry. As a result, a strange kind of gravity and sympathy for the human condition emanate from these works, raw as they can sometimes seem. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Mother India: The Goddess in Indian Painting' (through Nov. 27) Sculptures, paintings and drawings from the Met's collection represent manifestations of Devi, the Great Mother goddess who is thought to be the most popular of all Indian deities. Among works dating from the first millennium B.C. to 1990 are pieces of exceptional beauty, including a small, 12th-century argillite sculpture depicting the 16-armed Durga slaying her most fearsome opponent, Mahishasura, after he emerges from the lopped neck of his buffalo disguise. Carved in extraordinarily refined detail, it is a marvel of formal and metaphorical concentration. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Night Vision: Photography After Dark' (through Sept. 18) It wasn't until the gelatin dry-plate process was introduced in the late 1880s that exposure time was lowered enough for photographs to be taken regularly after dark. Alfred Stieglitz was among the first to photograph New York at night. His work is shown alongside Berenice Abbott's spectral ''Nightview, New York'' from 1932, taken from the window of a skyscraper; Brassai's nocturnal views of Paris; and Weegee's high-contrast picture of a crime scene. Diane Arbus, Bill Brandt, Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand and Kohei Yoshiyuki are among the other artists included in this modest, lovely show of 40 black-and-white photographs drawn from the museum's collection, which stops a couple of decades short of the present. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective' (through Aug. 28) Few artists have pushed drawing to such sculptural and even architectural extremes as Mr. Serra, so it makes sense that his adamantine pursuit of the medium, surveyed in an installation that he largely designed himself, is not quite like anything seen at the Met before. There are moments of off-putting starkness on Mr. Serra's side and some of the usual architectural infelicities on the Met's, but as a demonstration of this august institution's willingness to engage with genuinely radical, physically unsettling art of recent vintage, the show is cause for hope. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MoMA PS1: Ryan Trecartin: 'Any Ever' (through Sept. 3) This game-changing show of seven related videos, viewed amid eccentric seating arrangements procured mostly from Ikea, reflects the combined imagination of a supertalented young artist and his band of merry, cross-dressing pranksters. The results teeter giddily at the intersection of art, reality television and social networking; forge an integration of video and installation art, not to mention a blend of actual life and animation undreamt of by Walt Disney; and evince an aspirational faith in the potential of uninhibited self-expression, both individual and collective, to counter the mounting materialism of everyday life. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'The Age of Elegance: The Joan Taub Ades Collection' (through Aug. 28) This small but engrossing exhibition presents about three dozen works dating from the mid-17th to the late 19th centuries by European artists, each in his own way a draftsman of consummate skill. Some names, like Boucher and Millais, are familiar; most will be known only to art historical specialists. Ranging from postcard to laptop size, including portraiture, still-life and mythological scenes, they exemplify the fine but now endangered art of drawing at its best. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Fashion: Dress in the Art of Medieval France and the Netherlands' (through Sept. 4) Medieval illuminations -- so rich in narrative, embellishment and religious expression -- can display sartorial trends that can help experts date manuscripts and discern the subtleties of a figure's status or character. There are many examples here, as well as mannequins in full-scale model attire -- say, a splendid hunting ensemble of gold-embroidered blue velvet and lilac wool felt for the men, and for the women, a princessy gown of yellow silk trimmed in black crushed velvet, accessorized by a turret. This lively show will teach you to scrutinize centuries-old manuscripts as you would a style magazine. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'El Museo's Bienal: The (S) Files 2011' (through Jan. 8) Because of a long renovation of El Museo del Barrio's Fifth Avenue building, four years have passed since the museum's last biannual survey of new Latino, Caribbean and Latin American art. As if to make up for lost time, the new edition is the biggest so far, including work by 75 artists spread over seven shows in four boroughs, with the main event at El Museo itself. The ''S'' this year is for ''Street,'' which covers everything from graffiti to junk sculpture to painted cityscapes, and some of the work has problems with focus. Yet taking the street as a subject opens the possibility to at least think about other subjects, like money for artists, and the lack of it. Other segments of the show are now on display at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, and Lehman College Art Gallery in the Bronx; a Brooklyn show is scheduled to start in November. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Otherworldly: Optical Delusions and Small Realities' (through Sept. 18) In the age of the flat screen, a show about the diorama sounds charmingly naive. Yet ''Otherworldly'' circles back to the two-dimensional image in ways that feel very sophisticated. A good number of the show's more than 40 artists build model homes, cities and landscapes mainly to photograph them. At times the exhibition feels like a Hollywood film-studio tour in miniature. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'I Am Still Alive: Politics and Everyday Life in Contemporary Drawing' (through Sept. 19) This show of contemporary drawings (most acquired since 2005) is anchored by a group of telegrams sent by the Japanese artist On Kawara to friends and associates; each one bears the message ''I am still alive.'' The artists seem to be in a permanent state of wariness and suspicion, which is sometimes the result of political instability and at other times more innate. But their efforts to process matters of life and death in short bursts of creative activity feel very of the moment. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Boris Mikhailov: Case History' (through Sept. 5) This exhibition's visceral photographs of homeless people in Ukraine are not for the squeamish. The 19 photos, large-format examples from a series of more than 400 images produced in the late 1990s, portray people in grungy rooms or in wintery outdoor sites naked or pulling aside their clothes to expose parts of their bodies. Thus Mr. Mikhailov protests a society that allows people to fall into such substandard states and conditions. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Talk to Me: Design and the Communication Between People and Objects' (through Nov. 7) This broad, ambitious survey of interactive design is made for the texting, tweeting, social-networking, app-downloading, smartphone-wielding museumgoer. Its nearly 200 projects include not only crowd-pleasing video games, robots and chattering objects but also some surprisingly seductive interfaces, charts and information systems -- each with its own hash tag. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
- New Museum: 'Ostalgia' (through Sept. 25) This tough, absorbing exhibition fills all five floors of the New Museum with contemporary art from, or about, Russia and former Soviet bloc countries of Eastern Europe. A fair number of the artists are unfamiliar to New York; some have difficult, even harrowing histories. But a show that could have been a surveyish introduction to them is something more. It's an extended essay about what happens when art and life meet not because it's a cool idea, but because they have no choice: they either join forces or lose everything. New Museum, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Cory Arcangel: Pro Tools' (through Sept. 11) This solo turn from Mr. Arcangel, the digital wunderkind, artist-musician and inveterate hacker, seems a trifle scrubbed clean, sanitized and austere. Containing work almost entirely from 2011, it tells us little of his funkier early digital efforts or artistic development. A few pieces reflect his longstanding interest in television and video games; in others he tries too hard to establish his formalist bona fides with wry riffs on abstract painting and sculpture. Mr. Arcangel seems guided by a somewhat callow faith in the avant-garde, striving to perpetuate its tradition, dating from Duchamp, of laying claim to new areas of nonart for art's sake. Sometimes he succeeds, but not always. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Breaking Ground: The Whitney's Founding Collection' (through Sept. 18) In anticipation of its move to a new home in 2015, the Whitney is cooking up a series of six back-to-back experimental permanent collection shows at its present location. The first of them is a sampler of the earliest work in the holdings, and as a summary of the institution's initial view of American Modernism, what a curious thing it is. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lyonel Feininger: At The Edge of the World' (through Oct. 16) This overdue survey is an eye-opener, especially for the rapturous storybook street scenes that Feininger (1871-1956) painted from 1907 to 1911 -- fresh off his triumph as a comic-strip artist and with a big assist from Fauvism's heated palette -- and for the hand-carved and painted toylike figures and buildings that may be his most original response to Cubism. But the show diligently emphasizes the stiltedly mystical Cubified landscapes into which Feininger's painting style hardened after 1918. There's too little evidence of the photographs, woodcuts and pencil sketches that, with the carved sculptures, kept his natural, urbane lightness alive. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

- Lyonel Feininger: 'Drawings and Watercolors from the Julie Feininger Estate' (through Oct. 15) On the occasion of the Feininger retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, a gallery long involved with his career presents a parallel survey of works on paper from his widow's estate. It compensates for some of the museum show's shortcomings, most impressively with a gratifying profusion of small, lively woodcut prints from 1918-23 that will be unfamiliar to most viewers.

'Dara Birnbaum: Arabesque' (through Aug. 26) This veteran media artist's latest show at the gallery explores the intertwined careers and divergent legacies of the husband-and-wife Romantic composers Robert and Clara Schumann. The title piece is a large, multichannel video installation that samples clips of piano performances from YouTube and stills from the maudlin 1947 biopic about the Schumanns, ''Song of Love''; it offers both weepy melodrama and clear-eyed commentary on the reception of artistic genius.

- 'La Carte d'Apres Nature' (through Oct. 8) Using the Belgian painter Rene Magritte as a kind of divining rod, this show, organized by artist Thomas Demand (a version of one seen last year at the Nouveau Musee National de Monaco), finds surrealism in some unlikely places. Among the objects on view are three paintings by Magritte; 19th-century landscape photographs by the German artist August Kotzsch; 1970s shots of parkgoing tourists by the Italian artist Luigi Ghirri; and an architectural model from the 1967 Montreal Expo. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Rosenberg)
- 'Beautiful Vagabonds: Birds in Contemporary Photography, Sound and Video' (through Aug. 26) For some tweeting that has absolutely nothing to do with microblogs, here's a summer group show that alternates nature and artifice in images of some of the most beautiful beings on earth. The best work is the most straightforward and includes Barbara Bosworth's almost impossibly tender shot of an indigo bunting, a tiny concentration of cerulean nestled in a woman's hand. Yancey Richardson Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-9610, yanceyrichardson.com. (Cotter)
Sol LeWitt: 'Arcs and Lines' (through Aug. 26) This extraordinary show features three gridded wall drawings by the eminent Conceptual-Minimalist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), most prominently the airy and ebullient ''Wall Drawing #122'' from 1972, a spare work in blue crayon that wraps almost perfectly around the gallery's large central space. Featuring combinations of two straight, wavy, curved or broken lines in each compartment of the grid, its vaulting composition evokes Matisse's blue nudes, brisk Alpine views and even the blinking sweep of a radar screen, exemplifying both the economy and rich suggestiveness of LeWitt's art. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)
'Magic for Beginners' (through Aug. 27) When the future is unclear, it helps to look back -- or sideways. A corner piece by Scott Hug, in which a silhouetted figure reaches out to touch his own dark reflection in a black mirror, evokes Modernist self-reflexivity. Jennifer Cohen's Constructivist-style sculptures have toes and a finger added. Brent Stewart riffs on John Baldessari's photo-collages. Jesse McLean's psychedelic video revolves around childhood obsessions with the video game Tron and Leonardo DiCaprio. PPOW, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 647-1044, ppowgallery.com. (Johnson)
- 'Sigmar Polke: Photoworks, 1964-2000' (through Sept. 10) If this genius of postwar German art, who died last summer at 69, had made no paintings, his wide-ranging photographic work would have assured him a prominent place in history. That's proven by this generous survey -- the first in New York devoted to Polke's photography, the medium perfectly suited his mercurial sensibility. He exploited its ease, immateriality and darkroom processes; spiked it with his works in other mediums (as well as himself); and used it to make his every activity an occasion for making art. His talent for making something from nothing is never more magical. Leo Koenig Inc., 545 West 23rd Street, (212) 334-9255, leokoenig.com. (Smith)
'Soft Machines' (through Aug. 26) This intermittently interesting show includes a video by the young Chinese artist Ma Qiusha, in which she tells how her parents pressured her to succeed as an artist; it ends with her removing a bloody razor blade from her mouth. A painting by Holton Rower resembles a giant tree slice with psychedelically colorized rings. And Sterling Ruby's pair of pointy-toothed mouths made of stuffed, stars-and-stripes-patterned fabric is like a Bread and Puppet Theater prop. Pace, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-4258, thepacegallery.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: SoHo
'The Atomic Explosion: A Collection of Vintage Photographs' (through Sept. 2) This show gathers 66 images of American nuclear tests and detonations, most of them conducted at the Nevada Test Site and on the Marshall Islands during the 1940s and '50s. The massing mushroom clouds in these images, photographed from miles away, are made to seem benignly organic. A giant portobello rises over Bikini Atoll; slender enokis sprout in Nevada. The news-service captions on many of the prints feel just as innocuous; one compares a double-capped cloud to ''a giant dumbbell.''

Galleries: Other
- Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych and Selected Works at the German Consulate General' (through Sept. 15) The shining star of this exhibition is ''The Fulbright Triptych,'' a little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and images of the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
Andra Ursuta: 'Vandal Lust' (through Sept. 4) For her much-improved second solo show, this young, Romanian-born artist pays tribute to Ilya Kabakov's dream of Eastern bloc escape, the 1984 installation ''The Man Who Flew Into Space From His Apartment,'' by imagining a similar attempt using a medieval catapult. The plan's failure is evident in a dented wall and a life-size mannequin of the artist crumpled on the floor. Looming over her, the catapult itself is a bizarre, cobbled-together assemblage of materials, scales and odd intimations. For all its brutishness, it conjures delicate architectural miniaturization, a network of tiny hallways clogged with stuff and redolent of stymied lives. Ramiken Crucible, 389 Grand Street, near Clinton Street, Lower East Side, (917) 434-4245, ramikencrucible.com. (Smith)
Public Art
'Mark di Suvero at Governors Island: Presented by Storm King Art Center' (through Sept. 25) With 11 works spanning more than three decades, this show organized by Storm King Art Center -- the 500-acre sculpture park in the Hudson Valley -- is Mark di Suvero's biggest New York City survey since 1975. The all-outdoor exhibition works alongside the island's packed calendar of activities and festivals, offering bike riders and picnickers culture by osmosis. Plan to spend some time along the island's southern end, where four of Mr. di Suvero's best sculptures engage the waterfront and one another in invigorating ways. Governors Island, govisland.com. (Rosenberg)
Eva Rothschild: 'Empire' (through Aug. 28) At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web over 18 feet at its highest point. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire'' will be a required photo-op for tourists and other visitors. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Central Park, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Cotter)
Out Of Town
'Blinky Palermo: Retrospective 1964-1977' (through Oct. 31) Already influential at the time of his unexpected death, at 33, in 1977, the German artist Blinky Palermo (born Peter Schwarze) has come to seem essential to an art world obsessed with painting by means other than paint. Much, therefore, is expected of his first full-dress survey in North America. Split between two institutions and further subdivided by medium (cloth pictures and wall drawings at Bard, metal paintings at Dia), the show feels choppy but true to Palermo's geographic and artistic schisms. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diaart.org; Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Rosenberg)
- Portland Museum of Art: 'John Marin: Modernism at Midcentury' (through Oct. 10) This excellent show focuses on the last two decades of Marin, a painter whom many at the time -- the '30s and '40s -- considered the greatest living American artist. It presents 50 watercolors and oil paintings picturing views around his Cape Split, Me., summer home; his Cliffiside, N.J., winter residence; and Manhattan. Some of the works update Winslow Homer's naturalism, but most teeter on the brink of Cubist-Expressionist abstraction. All are impetuously energetic. 7 Congress Square, Portland, Me., (207) 775-6148, portlandmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute: 'Pissarro's People' (through Oct. 2) The Impressionist Camille Pissarro was, by temperament and belief, a welcomer of people and ideals, and there's an embracing feel to this modest, open-hearted exhibition of paintings and works on paper that demonstrates how central a role the human presence was in the work of an artist usually associated with landscapes. Pissarro's idealism was insistent, sometimes to the point of making his art look bland. But his ethical generosity shines through like good karma and makes him an artist to love. 225 South Street, Williamstown, Mass., (413) 458-2303, clarkart.edu. (Cotter)
Last Chance
'Al Held Paintings 1959' (closes on Friday) The 13 radiant, muscular paintings on paper in this show sum up the reactions of a young, ambitious artist to New York's first survey of postwar American painting, staged by the Museum of Modern in the summer of 1959 and emphasizing the works of the leading Abstract Expressionists. Held's works negotiate their own path between gesture and geometry; formulate shapes that suggest some long-lost but implicitly enthusiastic alphabet; and subtly presage Minimal and Pop Art with equal equanimity. Craig F. Starr Gallery, 5 East 73rd Street, (212) 570-1739, starr-art.com. (Smith)
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Lorna Simpson: Gathered' (closes on Sunday) Much of Lorna Simpson's photo-based work has been about African-American identity approached from an oblique and elusive perspective. She returns to that theme in new ways in the two installations and video that make up this small show, which includes some 300 framed photographs hung in grid formation on a long gallery wall. Roughly half the pictures are vintage 1950s pinup images of young black women (and a few men) alluringly posed in domestic settings. The rest are of Ms. Simpson herself, posed and dressed like the figures in the photographs, as if to suggest overlooked connections between the present and the past. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
'Don't Quit Your Day Job' (closes on Friday) Among the summer group shows with which art dealers annually break the monthly grind of solo and dual exhibitions, this one achieves an unusual combination of self-conscious modesty and poignancy. It displays 52 photographs taken between 1973 and the present by 19 American art and photography dealers from several generations, and it includes early attempts, private snapshots and homages to other, better-known photographers. The show confirms that great photographer-dealers in the tradition of Alfred Stieglitz are few and far between while also reminding us of the devotion to art and artists that usually guides art dealers to their calling. Hasted Kraeutler, 537 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-0006, hastedkraeutler.com. (Smith)
'Hilary Lloyd' (closes on Sunday) The British artist Hilary Lloyd makes her New York gallery debut with videos that have the presence of sculptures. Seven sets of monitors, each composed of two or three screens mounted on poles, stand here and there across Artists Space's loftlike premises. Each set of monitors shows images, repeated once or twice, sometimes in slightly different versions. The results could easily feel dry, but don't. You want to see what will happen next, even when you know there's no next. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)
'North by New York: New Nordic Art' (closes on Friday) Emotional restraint is the rule with this diverse selection of works by 15 contemporary Scandinavian artists. Gunnel Wahlstrand's big, black-and-white, photorealistic ink drawing of a boy in jacket and tie reading at his bedroom desk is technically impressive and coolly depressing. Most engaging is a half-hour video like a home-movie scrapbook called ''My Life'' by Marja Viitahuhta. In a laconic voice-over, a fictional female narrator mentions significant events for each of her 99 years, ending with the stoic statement, ''I die.'' Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 779-3587, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
Matthew Ronay: 'Between the Worlds' (closes on Friday) In this immersive new installation commissioned for Artpace San Antonio, viewers enter a large tent to find a black, white and gray landscape of tree trunks, mushrooms and volcanoes populated by totemic papier-mache figures (one of them inhabited by Mr. Ronay during an opening-night performance). Brimming with references to Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, it's a little bit like a walk-in version of one of Pollock's early paintings. Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Leo Villareal: 'Volume' (closes on Friday) You might just want to sit and gaze in blissful stupefaction at ''Cylinder,'' the single-light sculpture featured here. It consists of 160 12-foot-long lengths of shiny stainless steel, each with 140 light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, along one edge, hanging in five concentric circles to create a cylindrical volume nine feet in diameter. The thousands of computer-controlled lights flicker in the darkness, generating all kinds of patterns and a fascinating beauty.

HEADLINE: At This Girls' Camp, Crafts Take a Drill Press

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
RIVER GROVE, Ill. -- Forget tie-dyed shirts, lanyards and water games. At summer camp this year, Nautika Kotero, 13, learned to use a drill press, solder electrical wires and build a lamp.
Though the slim, 5-foot-5 teenager dreams of becoming a basketball star, Nautika now has a backup plan after her weeklong immersion course: a career in manufacturing.
Just over a quarter of the 11.7 million workers in manufacturing are women. But Gadget Camp, a workshop for girls in this suburb west of Chicago, is part of an effort to change that.
Although the economy is wobbling and nearly 14 million people are looking for work, some employers are still having a hard time finding skilled workers for certain positions. Manufacturers in particular complain that few applicants can operate computerized equipment, read blueprints and solve production problems. And with the baby boomers starting to retire, these and other employers worry there will be few young workers willing or able to replace them. 
Gadget Camp, sponsored in part by a foundation affiliated with the Fabricators and Manufacturers Association, which provided financing to nine other camps this summer, is intended to help over the long haul by exposing girls to an occupation they might previously have considered unappealing, if they considered it at all.
By the last day of camp, Nautika had told her parents that manufacturing was ''cool.'' Fashioning a lamp shade out of a thin piece of cardboard, she mused, ''I have two good careers ahead of me.'' Since the fragile recovery began, manufacturing is one of the few sectors that have added jobs. But the image of manufacturing as an occupation of the future has been tarnished by the exodus of factory jobs to foreign sites and the use of machinery to replace workers. Younger people, especially, see more alluring opportunities in digital technology, finance or health care.
''The perception is that there are no jobs in manufacturing,'' said Susan H. Palisano, director of education and training at the Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology, a nonprofit group in East Hartford that promotes manufacturing employment and has run summer programs for middle-school students for the last three years. ''It seems that everybody had an uncle or grandfather that got laid off.''
Across the country, a handful of companies, nonprofit groups, public educational agencies and even science museums are trying to make manufacturing seem, well, fun. Focusing mainly on children aged 10 to 17, organizations including the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown, Pa.; and Stihl, a maker of chain saws and other outdoor power equipment in Virginia Beach, Va., run camps that let students operate basic machinery, meet workers and make things.
Nuts, Bolts & Thingamajigs, the foundation that helped sponsor the Gadget camp in River Grove, has awarded $2,500 grants to 112 manufacturing-themed camps -- most of them for boys and girls -- around the country since 2004. ''It's not easy getting people into the career field,'' said Marcia Arndt, a board member of the foundation. ''I think there's a myth out there that manufacturing is dirty and undesirable, but it's really highly technological.''
Impressions also persist that manufacturing is a man's job. Technical fields in general, and those that require scientific or mathematical backgrounds, are indeed dominated by men. Yet a Commerce Department report released early this month showed that women in such fields earn 33 percent more, on average, than women working outside of scientific and technical fields, a higher premium than men enjoy in similar occupations.
Antigone Sharris, who came up with the idea for the all-girls Gadget camp, had worked extensively in manufacturing before becoming an instructor in electronics, welding and computer-aided machinery at Triton College, a two-year public school here that provided some funding for the camp.
Ms. Sharris is a mentor to high school robotics teams and wants to encourage young women to consider a range of technically oriented careers. ''Girls don't naturally gravitate toward engineering,'' said Ms. Sharris, a jolly and patient instructor who interspersed practical tips on using a band saw or a drill press with casual explanations of fractions, the concept of leverage and Newton's laws.
In a windowless classroom and shop on Triton's scruffy campus, 16 girls aged 11 to 15 designed and constructed a cat feeder, a candy dispenser and various pieces of jewelry and music boxes, using foam board, wood, metal, fiberglass and PVC pipe.
''Not letting your children learn the hands-on component of the theory of science is killing us as a nation,'' Ms. Sharris said. ''You have to stop giving kids books and start giving them tools.''
To give the girls a concrete sense of what such skills could mean in the workplace, Ms. Sharris invited a human resources coordinator from a local manufacturer to tell them about salaries -- starting in the $40,000 range and moving up to six digits, including overtime.
Several of the campers came from low-income and minority communities near the college. Only five of the 16 girls at the camp had paid the $99 fee; the rest were subsidized.
While Ms. Sharris focused mostly on basic technical skills, factory tours aimed at introducing the girls to modern manufacturing work brought out talk that might have fit at a nationalist rally.
During a tour of Tru-Way, which produces precision metal parts, Stan Mastalerz, the company's president, showed the girls a tiny component used in electronic circuit boards.
Ms. Sharris jumped in. ''See that?'' she asked. ''This is something that might be in your Game Boy that you don't even know about. The game may be made in China, but there are pieces that are made right here in your backyard.''
The reality of factory life gave a few girls pause. Visiting Tru-Way on a scorching summer afternoon, they noted the extreme heat and noise of the shop floor.
Brittany Orr, 15, who asked questions and jotted notes, said she liked the tasks that involved some thought and analysis. But ''I would not want to do a job where you just do the same thing again,'' she said. ''It seems tedious.''
A tour of MSi Testing & Engineering, a small company in Melrose Park, Ill., that evaluates the strength and quality of metal materials used by manufacturers, showed that it offered more of the work she preferred.
In the end, the campers learned lessons in persistence and problem-solving as well as technical skills. When Nautika began building the lamp she had designed, she wanted to install a rotating shade.
Ms. Sharris brought out a tiny motor. ''What you are trying to figure out is what to use to make your lampshade so that it will spin,'' she said.
Ms. Sharris rejected Nautika's first suggestion of foam board: too heavy. Ms. Sharris recommended a simple piece of copier paper, then spied a paper plate on a table. ''Humor me,'' she said, showing Nautika how to affix the motor to the plate with generous daubs from a glue gun.
Next came wiring a battery. To tutor Nautika in basic electronics, Ms. Sharris recruited Ariana Vargas, a 17-year-old counselor who has competed on her robotics team. Ariana demonstrated how to strip the green coating from the electrical wires with pliers. On Nautika's first try, the whole tip broke off.
A few fumbles later, Nautika was frustrated. ''I don't know how you did it!'' she said.
Ariana replied, ''Practice, practice and more practice.''
Finally, the coating came off, exposing bare wire. Her confidence building, Nautika stripped another wire and slid both ends through a PVC pipe and connected them to the battery.
The plate began to spin.
''Yea!'' Nautika exclaimed. ''I did it.''

TOKYO -- In a bid to calm jittery markets, top Japanese finance officials discussed the country's persistently strengthening currency at an emergency meeting Thursday, even as a beverage maker announced an overseas acquisition that took advantage of the soaring yen.
The contrast between the alarm among government officials over the strong yen on one hand and the opportunism of Asahi Group's bold $1.3 billion deal for a New Zealand beverage company on the other underscores the mixed fortunes for Japan from its surging currency.
Considered a haven by investors, the yen has been driven to near post-World War II highs amid Europe's debt problems and doubts about U.S. economic growth. The currency's climb has wreaked havoc with Japan's export-led economy and weighed on the stock market.
A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters because it makes their goods less competitive and erodes the value of their overseas earnings when repatriated into yen. Every time the dollar loses <5>1 in value, Toyota Motor loses about <5>30 billion in earnings per quarter, according to the automaker. 
At the same time, the strong yen has bolstered the country's purchasing power overseas, an advantage most visibly exploited by Japanese corporations that are seeking to expand. On Thursday, Asahi said it was buying Independent Liquor of New Zealand for <5>97.6 billion, or $1.3 billion, as the Tokyo-based beverage maker looked to increase its sales overseas to make up for a shrinking market at home.
Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at the NLI Research Institute in Tokyo, said Japan needed to concentrate on the positives of a strong currency and deal with the negatives.
''Upward pressure on the yen is likely to continue for some time, and even if the yen were to weaken temporarily, there would be no change to the fact that every time the global economy worsens, the yen strengthens,'' Mr. Ueno said in a note to clients. ''To escape this cycle, Japan needs to build an economy and industry that not only survives a strong yen, but thrives with it.'' Japan needs to foster new industries, like care for its elderly, and
seek opportunities overseas, he said.
Asahi, the maker of Japan's top-selling beer, Super Dry, and soft drinks, said in a statement Thursday that it would buy all outstanding shares of Flavoured Beverages Group, the parent company of Independent Liquor, from the private equity firms Unitas and Pacific Equity Partners, adding the Woodstock Bourbon and Vodka Cruiser labels to its family of drinks.
Asahi's purchase followed a bigger overseas acquisition by its rival Kirin, which said this month that it would buy a controlling stake in Schincariol, a Brazilian beverage maker, for $2.6 billion.
Despite the disruption caused by the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March, Japanese companies spent $26.6 billion on mergers and acquisitions overseas in the three months through June, the highest quarterly volume in almost three years, according to Dealogic.
''When the yen is on an upward trend, it creates a favorable environment for M.&A.'s,'' Kotaro Masuda of the Institute for International Trade and Investment said in a research note, referring to mergers and acquisitions. ''It also becomes possible for companies to buffer against currency risks by producing more overseas.''
Still, the response in Japan has been characterized more by panic than anticipation of any potential upside. And the prospect of Japanese companies' shifting more of their production abroad does little to soothe the anxiety.
Two weeks ago, the Japanese government spent an estimated <5>4.5 trillion to stage a record intervention in currency markets, selling the yen and buying dollars in a bid to weaken the Japanese currency.
Though the yen fell slightly against the dollar following that move, it has again edged upward in recent sessions. Late Thursday in Tokyo, the dollar traded at <5>76.60, down 11 percent from a year earlier and 3 percent in the past month.
Over the past five years, the dollar's value has fallen 33 percent against the yen. Analysts have questioned whether Japan can hope to keep the yen from rising, as long as global investors treat it as a haven. It may seem counterintuitive that the currency of Japan, a country burdened with sluggish growth and a huge public debt, is seen as a refuge from the debt crisis in Europe. But most of Japan's debt is held domestically, yields on government bonds remain far lower than other industrialized nations and inflation is nonexistent, all positive factors for the yen.
On Thursday, a top currency official at the Japanese Finance Ministry met with his counterpart at the central bank, a signal to markets of government readiness to temper the rise in the yen. The government has staged a series of currency interventions in the past year with limited effect. One, conducted in March in conjunction with other members of the Group of 7 industrialized nations, came after the yen reached its post-World War II high following the earthquake and tsunami.
Though the officials who met Thursday did not reveal specifics of their discussion, the meeting seemed aimed at showing markets Japan's determination to try to stare down currency markets. After the meeting, Vice Finance Minister Takehiko Nakao said that talks had covered ''the yen and global financial markets over all.'' Mr. Nakao met with Hiroshi Nakaso, the executive director of the Bank of Japan, the central bank.
Mr. Nakao did not say whether Japan planned another currency intervention, though government officials have said that they are watching market movements closely. Government officials have also urged the Bank of Japan to take measures to increase liquidity in the Japanese financial system, which also has the effect of weakening the yen.
Last year, a similar meeting between senior officials of the Finance Ministry and Bank of Japan, also following a spike in the yen, produced a joint statement warning markets against excessive currency volatility. No such statement was issued Thursday.
Meanwhile, government numbers released Thursday showed that exports continued to suffer from the strong yen. Japanese exports were down 3.3 percent in July from a year earlier, according to Ministry of Finance data, worse than the 2.4 percent decline expected by economists.
The strong currency is threatening to undermine Japan's economic recovery just as industrial production rebounds following the earthquake and tsunami. Fears of a global economic slowdown are also hurting trade, weighing on the Japanese economy.
Reconstruction demand and a recovery in industrial output are likely to buoy the economy, said Cameron Umetsu, senior economist for Japan at UBS. ''But the murky global backdrop still holds the potential to serve up nasty surprises for export-sensitive Japan,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fact Sheet on Syrian Sanctions

 BODY:
THE WHITE HOUSE
Office of the Press Secretary
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PUB-DATE: August 18, 2011
FACT SHEET: Administration Steps to Pressure Syrian Regime and Support Universal Rights of the Syrian people
The United States has taken a series of steps and actions to work toward putting an end to the Syrian government's violence, arrests, and torture, supporting the Syrian people's universal rights, and pushing for a democratic transition.
Executive Orders, Sanctions, and other Financial Actions 
Syria has been designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism since December 1979. An additional layer of sanctions was added in May 2004 with the issuance of Executive Order 13338, which implemented the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 and imposed additional measures pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Subsequent Executive orders have imposed additional sanctions targeting, among others, the President of Syria. Since the beginning of Syrian unrest, we have intensely pursued targeted financial measures to increase pressure on the Syrian regime. We have specifically targeted those responsible for human rights abuses, senior officials of the Syrian government, and Syrian businessmen linked to the Syrian regime. Our goal is to put an immediate stop to the Syrian government's use of violence against civilians and its policies of mass arrests and torture, and to pressure the Syrian regime to allow for a democratic transition as per the demands of the Syrian people.
Our actions to date include:
* Today, President Obama signed a new Executive Order taking additional steps pursuant to the national emergency with respect to Syria that blocks the property of the Syrian government, bans U.S. persons from new investments in or exporting services to Syria, and bans U.S. imports of, and other transactions or dealings in, Syrian-origin petroleum or petroleum products. This is the strongest financial action we have taken against the Syrian regime thus far. This Executive Order is consistent with the remaining sanctions provisions of the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act.
* Since the unrest began in mid-March, we have designated 32 Syrian and Iranian individuals and entities, including Syrian businessmen and their companies. These actions freeze the assets of and prohibit all U.S. persons from doing business with the identified individual or entity, thereby isolating them from the U.S. financial system.
* On August 10, pursuant to E.O. 13382, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated the Commercial Bank of Syria for its involvement in proliferation activities, and also designated its subsidiary, Syrian-Lebanese Commercial Bank. The Commercial Bank of Syria was identified by the Treasury Department as a financial institution of primary money laundering concern in 2004 and, pursuant to Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, has been subject since 2006 to a final rule prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from maintaining correspondent accounts for the Commercial Bank of Syria.
* On July 8, the Treasury Department issued a warning to U.S. financial institutions alerting them to the potential for increased illicit financial activities involving accounts held by or on behalf of senior political figures in Syria, as a result of the unrest in Syria.
* On May 18, President Obama signed Executive Order 13573 targeting senior Syrian government officials due to their government's continuing escalation of violence against the Syrian people. President Assad and six other regime officials were listed in the Annex to this Order.
* On May 18, the Department of Commerce suspended specific licenses related to Syrian Air's Boeing 747 aircraft.
* On April 29, President Obama signed Executive Order 13572 imposing sanctions on certain individuals and entities listed in the Annex to the Order and providing the authority to designate persons responsible for human rights abuses in Syria, including those related to repressing the Syrian people. Notably, President Assad's brother Maher al-Asad and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) were listed in the Annex to this Order.
* On April 29, the Department of Commerce revoked commercial export licenses pertaining to Syrian official VIP aircraft.
Actions at the United Nations and Other Diplomatic Efforts The United States has led an international effort at the United Nations (UN) to push for a UN Security Council Resolution that would increase pressure on the Syrian government to stop its brutal repression of the Syrian people. Additional actions taken include:
* On August 3, with strong U.S. leadership, the UN Security Council adopted by consensus a Presidential Statement condemning the Syrian government's widespread human rights abuses and use of force against civilians.
* The United States worked with allies to ensure that, after a protracted diplomatic struggle and in the face of significant opposition from the Syrian regime and other non-democratic governments, the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) granted UN accreditation on July 25 to the Syrian non-governmental organization the Center for Media and Freedom of Expression. This was the first Syrian NGO ever to receive ECOSOC accreditation, which allows it to attend and take part in UN events.
* On July 22, the State Department imposed travel restrictions on the Syrian Embassy in Washington, D.C., in response to Syrian efforts to restrict the movement of U.S. diplomats in Damascus. Syrian diplomats now must request permission prior to leaving Washington, D.C.
* On June 15 in Geneva, the United States and Canada drafted a statement signed by 54 UN member states that addressed the deteriorating human rights situation in Syria and urged the Syrian government to allow access to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights' fact finding mission.
* The United States led the call for a Special Session on Syria at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. On April 29, the Human Rights Council passed a strong resolution condemning the Syrian government and calling for an investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. To date, Syria has refused access to the High Commissioner's investigative team, despite calls from the Security Council and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
* The United States actively lobbied to prevent Syria from being elected to the UN Human Rights Council. Our lobbying efforts against Syria's offensive campaign resulted in Syria withdrawing its candidacy on May 11.

HEADLINE: Energy Firms Subpoenaed In New York

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
New York State's attorney general has sent subpoenas to three large energy companies as part of a broad investigation into whether they have accurately described to investors the prospects for their natural gas wells, according to several sources familiar with the inquiry.
The subpoenas focus on how the companies took advantage of federal rules, adopted in late 2008, that govern the way they report their oil and gas reserves to investors. 
Investigators have requested documents relating to the formulas that companies use to predict how much gas their wells are likely to produce in the coming decades. The subpoenas, which were sent on Aug. 8, also request documents related to the assumptions that companies have made about drilling costs in their estimates of the wells' long-term profitability.
The investigation will be watched closely in the industry because the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, is using a New York law called the Martin Act that gives him broad powers over businesses and allows him to obtain and publicly disclose an unusual amount of information.
Subpoenas were sent to the three companies -- Range Resources, Cabot Oil and Gas, and Goodrich Petroleum -- according to the sources, who have direct knowledge of the investigation. Mr. Schneiderman also broadened a continuing investigation by his office into a fourth company, Chesapeake Energy, asking it to respond to similar questions about its shale gas wells, they said.
The four companies were chosen because they are heavily involved in natural gas drilling and because New York State has more than $45 million of its pension money invested with them. If a company improperly reported to investors how its wells were likely to perform or failed to disclose the true costs of drilling, there could be repercussions for the state's financial portfolio.
Some legal experts consider the subpoenas an indication of Mr. Schneiderman's growing willingness to confront powerful interests. The action also opens a new front in an already heated debate in New York and other states over how much to allow companies to drill, and how they should be regulated.
The subpoenas come as New York's governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, seeks to end a de facto shale gas drilling moratorium caused by state regulators' extensive review of the environmental impact and the regulation of such drilling.
Under the Martin Act, which was passed in 1921, Mr. Schneiderman is empowered to subpoena virtually any document from any business operating in the state, and he can choose between civil or criminal charges.
Mr. Schneiderman does not have to prove that a company intended to defraud anyone, or that anyone actually was defrauded -- or even that a transaction between two parties occurred.
The law helped raise Eliot Spitzer's profile as New York attorney general because he used it to investigate Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney.
''The entire industry will pay attention to this because it shows that Schneiderman is taking a page straight from Spitzer's playbook,'' said Lloyd Constantine, who was chief of the antitrust division of the New York attorney general's office from 1980 to 1991 and who served as a senior adviser to Mr. Spitzer when he was governor. ''The Martin Act is powerful if a prosecutor wants to make it that way, and Schneiderman is clearly choosing to do so.''
Since he took office in January, Mr. Schneiderman has used the Martin Act to investigate major Wall Street banks involved in the mortgage-backed securities crisis and other accusations of financial impropriety.
Mr. Constantine said Mr. Spitzer was especially skilled at using the Martin Act to obtain damaging information, which he then released to the public as part of a strategy to win large settlements and avoid lengthy trials.
If Mr. Schneiderman finds damaging documents and releases them to the public, trial lawyers could use them as the basis for civil suits.
''The subpoenas are a big deal because they show how state scrutiny of shale gas has expanded beyond oil and gas producer states,'' said Kevin Book, director of research for ClearView Energy Partners, a research and consulting firm.
Despite limited data about how shale gas wells perform in the long term, responsible companies should have little to fear because current technology made their reserve estimates more accurate, Mr. Book said.
Mr. Schneiderman's office and the companies being investigated declined to comment. The subpoenas request documents relating to apparent discrepancies between what companies have told investors about gas well performance and costs and what is revealed in their federal filings, the sources said.
The subpoenas also require the companies to turn over information about the formulas used to predict how long the shale wells will produce gas before they dry up. The subpoenas were sent in response to documents made public by a series of articles in The New York Times, according to the three sources familiar with the investigation.
In recent years, a technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which involves injecting water and chemicals deep underground, has been increasingly used to release natural gas trapped in shale formations.
The process has been especially controversial in New York, areas of which lie atop a large shale formation, mostly because of concern over its environmental impact.
This is not Mr. Schneiderman's first foray into the fracking issue.
On May 31, his office sued several federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, in an effort to require additional review before fracking is allowed at more than 15,000 gas wells that are planned for the Delaware River watershed.
This watershed supplies drinking water to more than seven million New York City residents.
In June, Mr. Schneiderman also sent subpoenas to five large shale gas companies as part of a Martin Act inquiry into whether the companies had accurately disclosed the environmental risks from fracking to investors.
The federal Securities and Exchange Commission has also begun increasing its oversight of the industry. Last month, the agency sent subpoenas to several shale gas companies.
The commission has said it is considering whether to revise rule changes like those that allow companies to conceal details about how they calculate reserve estimates and to avoid third-party audits of these estimates.
The commission also has asked some oil and gas companies over the past month to reduce the number of years they predict their shale gas wells will produce, according to two industry consultants informed of the requests.

HEADLINE: A Race in Montana May Again Be Crucial To Senate Control

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
LINCOLN, Mont. -- A few election cycles ago, before the recession, the debt crisis and the Tea Party movement redefined American politics, a species called ''the New Western Democrat'' emerged in places like Montana.
Identified by their moderate politics, their plumage -- typically a cowboy hat and boots -- and by the ability to spit with authenticity, these centrists gave hope to Democrats nationally that a traditionally conservative corner of the country might be won over.
Now, Senator Jon Tester, a big-bellied farmer and self-described populist Democrat seeking a second term, is staking his career -- and with it, perhaps his party's control of the Senate -- on a bet that the West's middle way is still viable. Extremism, Mr. Tester said again and again in a round of campaign stops across the state last week, is a direr threat to Montana than tough times, national debt or recession.
''Working together is what built this place when the homesteaders came here,'' Mr. Tester told a radio audience last week in Billings. ''Working together is a Montana way of life, it's a Montana value and we need to take that back to Washington, D.C. Start working for proactive solutions instead of trying to find excuses to vote against stuff.'' 
Talk like that is not aimed at Montana Democrats, who by and large seem happy with Mr. Tester, or at Republicans, who seem largely to have rallied already around his Republican challenger, Representative Denny Rehberg, but at unaffiliated and often downright alienated voters like Dixie and Jess Kibbee who define Montana's quirky electorate and will most likely decide the 2012 election here.
Mr. Kibbee, 71, a retired schoolteacher, is leaning toward Mr. Tester, while Ms. Kibbee, 63, who sold insurance, is undecided. And she could be hard to please: she favors higher taxes on the rich, but lower corporate taxes to create jobs, and she despises most of all the vituperative tone of party politics in Washington.
''We need to stop fighting,'' Ms. Kibbee said.
Many residents, in several dozen interviews across the state last week, said they personally liked Mr. Tester, 54, who reflects a certain homespun Montana type. Folksy and soft-spoken, he can support gun owners' rights and liberal social safety nets in the same breath while emphatically gesturing with his mangled left hand, three fingers lost in an accident involving a meat grinder at age 9.
But whether Mr. Tester's plea for moderation gets a fair hearing in the election is far from certain, political experts say. Already money is pouring into the state from outside groups, and the arguments are ugly. The first advertisements began appearing as early as March, 20 months before Election Day, some trying to show Mr. Rehberg as hostile to the environment, some painting Mr. Tester as a craven captive to President Obama, who is not particularly popular here.
Mr. Tester's narrow defeat of the Republican incumbent, Conrad Burns, in 2006 was the linchpin that gave Democrats their Senate majority that year, and political analysts said the focus, and the stakes, would be just as high next year. A poll in March called the race a dead heat, with Mr. Tester having an edge among independents -- 49 percent to 37 percent for Mr. Rehberg -- but with enough undecided to swing the difference. The poll, by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research for Lee Newspapers, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points for the total sample of 625 registered voters in Montana.
''It's hard to see a scenario under which the Republicans take the Senate without taking Montana, which also means the Democrats have to defend it,'' said David C. W. Parker, an assistant professor of political science at Montana State University, who is writing a book about the race.
But other factors, engrained into Montana's political history and geography, could also push the contest more toward the middle and away from the blood-fest of extremes that marked the 2010 midterm elections, when moderates, especially among Republicans, fell under a surge of Tea Party-backed candidates.
For one thing, Mr. Rehberg, 55, has no ordinary House district, which in many places around the nation are narrowly drawn, gerrymandered pockets of liberals or conservatives that make for safe seats. In Montana, because of its sparse population, just under a million people, the Congressional district is the entire state. That means Mr. Rehberg has had to find common cause with a diverse constituency -- the same voters Mr. Tester needs -- in getting elected to Congress six times.
''I travel to all 56 counties continually,'' Mr. Rehberg said in an interview. ''And I have done a lot of listening.''
In contrast to many of the Congressional races last year, Mr. Rehberg and Mr. Tester are also both veterans of Washington, which could blunt the kind of attacks that marked the 2010 election season, where self-declared ''outsiders'' called on voters to throw out the incumbents.
Mr. Rehberg, a rancher and real-estate developer, has also bucked the more conservative corners of his party in recent months. He was one of only four Republicans in the House to vote against the budget plan put forward by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin in April. Mr. Rehberg said he had too many questions about the plan's potential impact on Medicare.
He also refused in an interview to say definitively that he would never under any circumstances vote to increase federal taxes, by closing loopholes, for example.
''To get us out of this financial crisis as we have it today, I do not believe that we need a tax increase,'' he said. ''Tax increases should not be the first resort.''
One wild card in the race is the role that might be played by Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a popular Democrat whose support in 2006 was crucial to Mr. Tester's election.
Mr. Schweitzer, who cannot run again for governor in 2012 because of term limits, has hinted at various paths he might pursue next -- and many Montanans think he might be considering a primary challenge to Senator Max Baucus, a fellow Democrat whose term expires in 2014. Mr. Schweitzer declined through a spokeswoman to comment about the Tester-Rehberg race.
But the biggest question is whether anger -- at Washington, at the parties, at the economy -- can be in fact transmuted to hope for a better way, or whether anger just makes for more anger in a rolling cascade.
''United we stand, divided we fall -- and we're falling,'' said DeAnne Asher, 64, who was chatting with friends on a recent morning in Lincoln, in the state's wooded western half. Ms. Asher, who said she mostly voted Republican, does not plan to support Mr. Tester, but does not see voting for Mr. Rehberg either at this point. The entire system, she said, is broken.
''I'm fed up,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Obama, on Midwest Tour, Moves to Regain Mantle of Campaigner

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
ALPHA, Ill. -- On the final stop of a Midwestern bus tour, after President Obama faced a rolling reality check about the precarious state of the nation's economy, a young man offered a parting word of encouragement.
''I just want to let you know one thing,'' said the man, Eric Palmer, who stood in the back of the crowd here at the Country Corner Farm. ''I am not disappointed in you like Michele Bachmann wants everyone to believe.''
''Thank you,'' Mr. Obama replied, a slight smile spreading across his face. ''I appreciate that.''
In a three-day journey through the friendly terrain of Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois that ended Wednesday, there were few direct mentions of Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Mrs. Bachmann or any other Republican presidential hopefuls. But the trip offered the first real indication of how the president plans to confront his Republican opponent -- whoever he or she is. 
As he did four years ago when he found his back against the wall in his Democratic primary fight with Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Obama seemed intent on showing that he is the partisan fighter that some of his supporters fear he is not.
He signaled that he intends to use the rising influence of the Tea Party movement as a chance to undermine Republicans with independent voters. And he bluntly asked voters to begin considering what he believes the consequences would be if Republicans won the White House.
''There is a group of folks who think that I'd rather see my opponent lose than see America win,'' Mr. Obama said. ''There are folks who are willing to engage in political brinksmanship even if it costs the country.''
Here in Alpha, the president received a warm and enthusiastic reception, after people waited for hours before dawn to get tickets and waited again in the afternoon sunshine for his arrival. But a mood of hopeful optimism that hung in the air during his campaign appearances four years ago has given way to calls for patience, with tough questions and few immediate solutions.
For now, at least, the fierce sense of energy that marked the Democrats' 2008 effort to reclaim the White House is coursing with greater intensity through the Republican side of the campaign. A spirited nominating contest and a unified goal of defeating an incumbent president have awakened the party from its sleepy disposition in the 2008 presidential race when George W. Bush was leaving office.
It is premature to suggest the enthusiasm gap is permanent. Democrats are confident that when the general election battle begins -- with Mr. Obama matched against a single opponent -- the fervor surrounding the 2008 campaign will return.
But several voters who came to see the president on Wednesday said they worried that Mr. Obama had become consumed by Washington and had not responded aggressively to Republican efforts to discredit him.
''Everyone was so hopeful with him, but Washington grabbed him and here we are,'' said LuAnn Lavine, a real estate agent from Geneseo, Ill. ''I just want him to stay strong and don't take the guff. We want a president who is a leader, and I want him to be a little bit stronger.''
The president's travels, which covered more than 350 miles, were billed as an official White House event, rather than a political trip. (Republicans roundly disagreed.) He strode onto the stage here in silence, rather than with a campaign anthem heralding his arrival.
While he visited three states that he easily carried four years ago, including his home of Illinois, a series of tough questions about lost jobs, the future of Social Security and government regulations made his visit anything but a pep rally. His fortified black bus rolled right by a hand-painted sign along Route 150 that declared ''One Term President.''
The trip was the president's first extended time outside Washington in months. It was an opportunity to separate himself from Congress, which his supporters believe he has struggled to do, and begin laying the groundwork to challenge Republicans on competing job-creation plans that became muddled during the debate over raising the nation's debt ceiling.
With his own approval ratings hovering near their lowest point since he became president, and with a new Gallup poll showing that only 26 percent of Americans approve of his economic policies, Mr. Obama singled out one element of Washington that is viewed in an even more unfavorable light: Congress.
''You're supposed to be in public service to serve the public,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And that means that, yes, you don't get your way 100 percent of the time. It means that you compromise. It means you apply common sense.''
Woven into the careful political staging, which included arriving at the Whiteside County Fair to see a cattle show on Wednesday and dropping by football practice at Galesburg High to catch a scrimmage of the Silver Streaks, the president delivered a rebuttal of the criticism that has been hardening against him.
As he took questions from voters, a glimpse of Candidate Obama emerged. He worked to extend the conversation beyond a sound bite in hopes of explaining what his administration has done to help frame the arguments that will define his re-election.
A 13-year-old girl rose from the crowd and asked the president what he could do to help protect law enforcement officers like her stepfather, the sheriff of Henry County. Mr. Obama turned the moment into an opportunity to talk about the size and role of government.
''Don't buy into this notion that somehow all our problems would be solved if we eliminate government,'' Mr. Obama said, noting that police officers, firefighters and soldiers all represent the face of government. He drew applause as he added, ''There's a difference between politics and government.''
In addition to promoting his message, the Midwest tour also was intended to allow Mr. Obama a chance to revive himself in the place where his political career was born. Some admirers carried signs from his 2004 Senate race, while others wore T-shirts from his presidential race.
Mary Wills, a 74-year-old retiree from Geneseo, collected a presidential autograph on a picture that she had taken with Mr. Obama when he visited near here eight years ago as an aspiring senator. The snapshot shows the president without a touch of gray and with a far wider smile.
''If we give him time, if people will bear with him, I think he can turn this country around,'' Mrs. Wills said. ''I do so hope he gets re-elected, but I worry about it.''

HEADLINE: Fewer Youths To Be Deported In New Policy

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Julia Preston contributed reporting from Hershey, Pa.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration announced Thursday that it would suspend deportation proceedings against many illegal immigrants who pose no threat to national security or public safety.
The new policy is expected to help thousands of illegal immigrants who came to the United States as young children, graduated from high school and want to go on to college or serve in the armed forces.
White House and immigration officials said they would exercise ''prosecutorial discretion'' to focus enforcement efforts on cases involving criminals and people who have flagrantly violated immigration laws. 
Under the new policy, the secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, can provide relief, on a case-by-case basis, to young people who are in the country illegally but pose no threat to national security or to the public safety.
The decision would, through administrative action, help many intended beneficiaries of legislation that has been stalled in Congress for a decade. The sponsor of the legislation, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, has argued that ''these young people should not be punished for their parents' mistakes.''
The action would also bolster President Obama's reputation with Latino voters as he heads into the 2012 election. Just a week ago the leaders of major Hispanic organizations criticized his record, saying in a report that Mr. Obama and Congress had ''overpromised and underdelivered'' on immigration and other issues of concern to Latino voters, a major force in some swing states.
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, denounced the new policy.
''The Obama administration has again made clear its plan to grant backdoor amnesty to illegal immigrants,'' Mr. Smith said. ''The administration should enforce immigration laws, not look for ways to ignore them. Officials should remember the oath of office they took to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land.''
White House officials emphasized that they were not granting relief to a whole class of people, but would review cases one by one, using new standards meant to distinguish low- and high-priority cases.
''The president has said on numerous occasions that it makes no sense to expend our enforcement resources on low-priority cases, such as individuals'' who were brought to this country as young children and know no other home, Ms. Napolitano said in a letter to Mr. Durbin.
She said that low-priority cases were ''clogging immigration court dockets'' and diverting enforcement resources away from individuals who pose a threat to public safety.
Mr. Durbin said he believed the new policy would stop the deportation of most people who would qualify for relief under his bill, known as the Dream Act (formally the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act).
Some experts have estimated that more than two million people might be eligible to apply for legal status under the Dream Act. Mr. Durbin's office estimates that 100,000 to 200,000 could eventually earn citizenship, though the numbers are uncertain.
Under the new policy, the government will review 300,000 cases of people in deportation proceedings to identify those who might qualify for relief and those who should be expelled as soon as possible.
White House officials said the new policy could help illegal immigrants with family members in the United States. The White House is interpreting ''family'' to include partners of lesbian, gay and bisexual people.
Richard Socarides, a New York lawyer who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton on gay issues, said, ''The new policy will end, at least for now, the deportations of gay people legally married to their same-sex American citizen partners, and it may extend to other people in same-sex partnerships.''
J. Kevin Appleby, director of migration policy at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the initiative would keep immigrant families together. ''It is consistent with the teaching of the church that human rights should be respected, regardless of an immigrant's legal status,'' he said.
Cecilia Munoz, a White House official who helped develop the new policy, said officials would suspend deportation proceedings in low-priority cases that, for example, involve ''military veterans and the spouses of active-duty military personnel.''
Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell, said the new policy could also benefit ''illegal immigrants who were stopped for traffic violations and thrown into deportation proceedings, as well as people whose only violation of immigration law is that they stayed beyond the expiration of their visas or worked here illegally.'' Ms. Napolitano said her agency and the Justice Department would do the case-by-case review of all people in deportation proceedings.
Those who qualify for relief can apply for permission to work in the United States and will probably receive it, officials said.
The new policy ''will not provide categorical relief for any group'' and ''will not alleviate the need for passage of the Dream Act or for larger reforms to our immigration laws,'' Ms. Napolitano said.
People in deportation proceedings stand to benefit most from the new policy. The new enforcement priorities also make it less likely that the government will begin such proceedings in the future against people who have no criminal records and pose no threat to national security.
White House officials said the new policy ratified guidance on ''prosecutorial discretion'' recently issued by John Morton, the director of immigration and customs enforcement at the Department of Homeland Security.
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, praised the new directive, saying it would allow federal agents to ''focus on serious felons, gang members and individuals who are a national security threat, rather than college students and veterans who have risked their lives for our country.''
Roy H. Beck, the president of Numbers USA, a nonprofit group that wants to reduce legal and illegal immigration, said he could understand the decision to defer deportation in some cases. But he said the decision to grant work permits was distressing.
''This is a jobs issue,'' Mr. Beck said. ''The president is taking sides, putting illegal aliens ahead of unemployed Americans.''

HEADLINE: Number of Green Jobs Fails to Live Up to Promises

BYLINE: By AARON GLANTZ. 
aglantz@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Flanked by a cadre of local political leaders, Mayor Chuck Reed of San Jose used a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a solar power company last week to talk up the promise of the green economy.
Mr. Reed called the opening of the new headquarters of SolFocus, which produces large, free-standing solar panels, an ''enormously important'' development for the city's economy.
''Clean technology is the next wave of innovation that Silicon Valley needs to capture,'' the mayor said, noting that the San Jose City Council had committed to increasing the number of ''green jobs'' in the city to 25,000 by 2022. San Jose currently has 4,350 such jobs, according to city officials.
But SolFocus assembles its solar panels in China, and the new San Jose headquarters employs just 90 people. 
In the Bay Area as in much of the country, the green economy is not proving to be the job-creation engine that many politicians envisioned. President Obama once pledged to create five million green jobs over 10 years. Gov. Jerry Brown promised 500,000 clean-technology jobs statewide by the end of the decade. But the results so far suggest such numbers are a pipe dream.
''I won't say I'm not frustrated,'' said Van Jones, an Oakland activist who served briefly as Mr. Obama's green-jobs czar before resigning under fire after conservative critics said he had signed a petition accusing the Bush administration of deliberately allowing the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a claim Mr. Jones denies.
A study released in July by the non-partisan Brookings Institution found clean-technology jobs accounted for just 2 percent of employment nationwide and only slightly more -- 2.2 percent -- in Silicon Valley. Rather than adding jobs, the study found, the sector actually lost 492 positions from 2003 to 2010 in the South Bay, where the unemployment rate in June was 10.5 percent.
Federal and state efforts to stimulate creation of green jobs have largely failed, government records show. Two years after it was awarded $186 million in federal stimulus money to weatherize drafty homes, California has spent only a little over half that sum and has so far created the equivalent of just 538 full-time jobs in the last quarter, according to the State Department of Community Services and Development.
The weatherization program was initially delayed for seven months while the federal Department of Labor determined prevailing wage standards for the industry. Even after that issue was resolved, the program never really caught on.
''Companies and public policy officials really overestimated how much consumers care about energy efficiency,'' said Sheeraz Haji, chief executive of the Cleantech Group, a market research firm. ''People care about their wallet and the comfort of their home, but it's not a sexy thing.''
Job training programs intended for the clean economy have also failed to generate big numbers. The Economic Development Department in California reports that $59 million in state, federal and private money dedicated to green jobs training and apprenticeship has led to only 719 job placements -- the equivalent of an $82,000 subsidy for each one.
''The demand's just not there to take this to scale,'' said Fred Lucero, project manager at Richmond BUILD, which teaches students the basics of carpentry and electrical work in addition to specifically ''green'' trades like solar installation.
Richmond BUILD has found jobs for 159 of the 221 students who have entered its clean-energy program -- but only 35 graduates are employed with solar and energy efficiency companies, with the balance doing more traditional building trades work. Mr. Lucero said he considered each placement a success because his primary mission was to steer residents of the city's most violent neighborhoods away from a life of crime.
At Asian Neighborhood Design, a 38-year old nonprofit in the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco, training programs for green construction jobs have remained small because the number of available jobs is small. The group accepted just 16 of 200 applicants for the most recent 14-week cycle, making it harder to get into than the University of California. The group's training director, Jamie Brewster, said he was able to find jobs for 10 trainees within two weeks of their completing the program.
Mr. Brewster said huge job losses in construction had made it nearly impossible to place large numbers of young people in the trades. Because green construction is a large component of the green economy, the moribund housing market and associated weakness in all types of building are clearly important factors in explaining the weak creation of green jobs.
Advocates and entrepreneurs also blame Washington for the slow growth. Mr. Jones cited the failure of so-called cap and trade legislation, which would have cut carbon pollution and increased the cost of using fossil fuel, making alternative energy more competitive. Congressional Republicans have staunchly opposed cap-and-trade.
Mr. Haji of the Cleantech Group agrees. ''Having a market mechanism that helps drive these new technologies would have made a significant difference,'' he said. ''Without that, the industry muddles along.''
Still, California has forged ahead with environmental legislation, including its own version of cap-and-trade that is part of the landmark anti-global-warming law AB 32 enacted in 2006. Another measure, signed into law earlier this year by Mr. Brown, requires utilities to generate at least a third of all their electricity from renewable sources by 2020.
State government officials said they were still banking on these new laws to propel demand for 20,000 megawatts of renewable energy, the cornerstone of Mr. Brown's green jobs plan. In June, the governor attended the groundbreaking of the 3,470-megawatt Blythe Solar Power Project in the Mojave Desert, which backers say will create 5,390 construction jobs and 400 permanent positions.
The 600-turbine Alta Wind Energy Center southeast of Bakersfield is set to become the world's largest wind farm when it is completed in 2015. Terra-Gen, a company based in New York that has received more than $300 million in private investment from Google and Citi for the Alta farm, says it will bring 1,020 megawatts on line by the end of the year. But even when it is fully up and running, the wind farm will bring only 50 permanent operations and maintenance jobs to rural Kern County, the company said.
Both the possibilities and limitations of the green economy were on display at SolFocus's ribbon-cutting in San Jose.
A SolFocus spokeswoman, Nancy Hartsoch, said the company was willing to pay a premium for the highly-skilled physicists, chemists and mechanical engineers who will work at the campus on Zanker Road, although the solar panels themselves will continue being made in China. Mayor Reed said he continued to hope that San Jose would attract manufacturing and assembly jobs, but Ms. Hartsoch said that was unlikely because ''taxes and labor rates'' were too high to merit investment in a factory in Northern California.
SolFocus's plans do not much resemble what Mr. Jones, the former Obama administration official, had in mind in his 2008 book, ''The Green Collar Economy: How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems,'' when he described the green economy as ''Joe Sixpack with a hard hat and a lunch bucket going off to fix America,'' and talked of millions of new jobs.
In an interview last week, though, he seemed to have scaled back. ''The green economy as we initially conceived it,'' Mr. Jones said, ''was never supposed to save the entire global economy.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 26, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Friday about the failure of the green economy to create as many jobs as many politicians had envisioned referred incorrectly to the cost to homeowners of a program to weatherize homes using federal stimulus money. The program does not require any upfront money from consumers.

HEADLINE: Birthdays Still Big In Buyout Land

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
When the billionaire buyout titan Stephen A. Schwarzman gave himself a boom-era-defining 60th birthday party in 2007, the global economy was soaring.
Four years and one financial crisis later, the world looks very different. But not much has changed in the private equity world - at least when it comes to birthday parties.
Last Saturday night, the financier Leon D. Black celebrated his 60th with a blowout at his oceanfront estate in Southampton, on Long Island. After a buffet dinner featuring a seared foie gras station, some 200 guests took in a show by Elton John. The pop music legend, who closed with ''Crocodile Rock,'' was paid at least $1 million for the hour-and-a-half performance.
''The great Sir Elton John performing at my friend Leon Black's fabulous 60th bday,'' wrote the fashion designer Vera Wang on her Facebook page. ''I had the honor of dressing his wife, my friend, Debra Black, the hostess! If there was ever a great family ... this was it! Xx Vera'' 
The stars of music and fashion collided with a who's who of Wall Street. Revelers included Michael R. Milken, the junk-bond pioneer and Mr. Black's boss at Drexel Burnham Lambert in the 1980s; Julian H. Robertson Jr. , the hedge fund investor; Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs; and Mr. Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group.
Rounding out the guest list were politicians including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who rubbed elbows with the media celebrities Martha Stewart and Howard Stern.
''Leon throws some good parties, because Leon's worth like twenty gazillion, like twenty billion or something crazy and for him, you know, a billion dollars is like ten dollars to us,'' Mr. Stern said on his Monday show on SiriusXM Radio. Mr. Black sits on the company's board.
Opulent celebrations thrown by the rich and famous are de rigueur in New York and Hamptons society. And in buyout land, there is something about private equity bosses and 60th birthdays: In 2002, David Bonderman, co-founder of TPG, had the Rolling Stones and John Mellencamp play at his celebration at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas.
But where Mr. Schwarzman's $3 million birthday party came to be seen as a symbol of a new Gilded Age, a party like Mr. Black's - at this moment in time - appears to some to be something else.
''It displays a kind of moral bad taste given the vast economic problems in the country,'' said Michael M. Thomas, a former Lehman Brothers partner who writes novels about Wall Street. ''This behavior suggests they are isolated from the rest of the world living behind these great big hedges, and in a way they are.''
Mr. Black is no parvenu, having been a fixture on Wall Street for decades. When Drexel collapsed in the late 1980s, Mr. Black started a firm to buy stakes in troubled companies. Today, that firm, Apollo Global Management, manages $72 billion in assets and is publicly traded. Its holdings include Caesars Entertainment, the world's largest casino company, and LyondellBasell, a big plastics and chemicals business.
Mr. Black, a major philanthropist to various scholastic, medical and cultural institutions, has also used his riches to amass a world-class art collection. In 2009, at a Christie's auction, he paid about $47 million for a chalk drawing by Raphael of a woman's head.
While much of the nation's economy has struggled to recover from the financial crisis, Mr. Black's firm - and the rest of the private equity industry - has snapped back. Though their deals are a far cry from the record takeovers struck in the last decade, multibillion-dollar buyouts have returned as banks extend corporate loans again. And pension funds and global sovereign wealth funds, faced with poor performance in stocks and bonds, continue to commit billions to private equity in the hopes of juicing their returns.
Apollo has long been considered one of Wall Street's most skilled investors. The firm made a killing during the financial crisis. Its big bet on distressed debt at the market bottom in 2009 earned the firm and its clients billions of dollars in profits.
The industry's continued success has made it a target in Washington. At issue is the low 15 percent tax rate paid by private equity executives on ''carried interest,'' or the share of profits that fund managers receive as part of their compensation. Eliminating this provision would raise $21 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Black, speaking at a conference early last year, said he was resigned to a tax increase, saying that ''it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for some adjustment.''
Yet he has also been an outspoken opponent of certain proposals that would raise taxes on him and the private equity industry. Last year, Mr. Black visited Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers and make his case.
Mr. Black, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment.
On Saturday night, to be sure, there was little talk of carried interest at the Blacks' home on Meadow Lane, one of the Hamptons most desirable addresses for its panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean and Shinnecock Bay. He counts among his neighbors Calvin Klein and David H. Koch, the billionaire industrialist.
Mr. Black had his backyard transformed into a faux nightclub setting, constructing a wooden deck over his swimming pool and building a tent for Mr. John's concert. After a buffet of crab cakes and steak, partygoers sat on couches with big puffy pillows. They watched Mr. Black's four grown children deliver touching toasts to their father, including a poem by the youngest son.
''Oh, I wish I was Leon Black's child,'' Mr. Stern said on Monday.
Mr. John then took the stage and performed many of his hits, including ''Your Song,'' ''Benny and the Jets,'' and ''Candle in the Wind.'' He joked that he knew how important 60th birthday parties were because he recently had one. (He is 64.)
Before the concert, around 8 p.m., as a full moon rose over the Atlantic, Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Schwarzman stood at the foot of the stairs leading down to the beach. Guests overheard Mr. Blankfein playfully ribbing Mr. Schwarzman about his fin de siecle affair.
''Your 60th got us into the financial crisis,'' Mr. Blankfein is said to have told the private equity titan. ''Let's hope this party gets us out of it.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Idea: An insistence on austerity is threatening economies in Europe and here

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street dropped sharply on Thursday, with investors spooked, again, about the euro-zone debt crisis and the sputtering United States economy.
Yet, even at this hour, leaders on both sides of the Atlantic seem determined to handcuff fiscal policies -- the main tools that can increase jobs, consumer demand and economic growth -- with an unquestioning devotion to rigid austerity. 
Europe's post-2008 economic problems have differed from America's in many important ways. Washington has mercifully never had to cope with the problem of a dollar torn apart by the separate taxing and spending policies of 17 sovereign governments.
But as the crisis moves toward its fourth year, there are disturbing common threads.
One is the chilling specter of sovereign default, something that never should have come up in the United States but did for a while because of the reckless brinkmanship of House Republicans. A more real threat of default now haunts European bond markets, as chronically underfinanced bailout plans with punitive terms have made it impossible for the debtor countries to grow fast enough to pay down their debts.
Another grim parallel is the refusal by leaders to take politically tough but economically necessary stands.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France again ruled out the two steps most needed to stem the panic in the financial markets: issuing common European bonds and committing more money for Europe's depleted bailout fund. Instead, they proposed more meetings and called on all European nations to enshrine an ill-advised ''golden rule'' of balanced budgets in their constitutions. Markets are rightly unimpressed.
Excessive indebtedness is a real, long-term problem. But Europe's broad downward trajectory can only be turned around if governments -- both those of lenders and debtors -- spend more in the near term to put people back to work and get consumers back to spending.
Instead, panicked by market volatility and urged on by Chancellor Merkel, Europe's leaders have made a bad situation worse by prescribing austerity everywhere they look. The results are painfully clear. Growth is grinding to a halt across Europe.
That is true even in Germany, as its export markets falter and domestic demand fails to take up the slack. It is now growing at an anemic 0.1 percent and the euro zone at only 0.2 percent.
Meanwhile, debt market panic has spread from smaller economies like Greece, Ireland and Portugal to the larger economies of Spain, Italy and even France. Only emergency lending by the European Central Bank now staves off renewed fears of default, and no one knows how much longer the bank can continue without help from European bonds and a better financed bailout fund.
As the crisis quickens, more enlightened voices struggle to be heard. Christine Lagarde, the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is calling for balancing long-term debt reduction with ''short-term support for growth and jobs.'' The financier George Soros this week renewed his pleas for more growth-friendly policies, as has Gordon Brown, the former British prime minister.
Elections are approaching in Spain, France, Germany and other European countries over the coming months. The campaign will soon gear up here. Voters on both sides of the Atlantic need to demand more from their leaders than continued austerity on autopilot.

HEADLINE: Factory Activity Plummets And Home Resales Slump

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slumped to a nearly two-and-a-half-year low in August, and home resales unexpectedly dropped in July.
Other data released on Thursday also showed that consumer inflation rose at its fastest rate in four months in July and that more Americans than expected filed claims for jobless benefits last week.
Stock markets worldwide tumbled on the weak economic data, which stoked concerns that the recovery was on the rocks. 
Still, economists said they did not believe that the sharp drop in manufacturing activity signaled that the nation's economy was sliding back into recession.
''Without a strong rebound in the coming months, this will be taken as a very worrying development for policy makers charting the outlook for the second half of the year,'' said Peter Newland, a senior economist at Barclays Capital in New York.
''That said, 'hard' data so far available for the third quarter have taken a clearly stronger tone and timely jobless claims data are not indicative of a dramatic weakening in the economy,'' he added.
Data including retail sales and industrial production suggested the economy found some momentum early in the third quarter after barely growing in the first half of the year.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William C. Dudley, said on Thursday that the risk of a double-dip recession was ''quite low.''
''The risks have risen a little bit, but I think we very much still expect the economy to recover.'' The agency expects growth to be significantly firmer than it was during the first half of the year, he told New Jersey business leaders.
In one positive report, the Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.5 percent in July. The increase, which followed a gain of 0.3 percent in June, was lifted by the money supply and interest rate components, the board said.
Ken Goldstein, an economist at the board, said that growth was modest, especially in nonfinancial indicators.
Despite the risks, he said, ''the economy should continue to expand at a modest pace through the fall.''
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's business activity index fell to minus 30.7 in August, the lowest level since March 2009 when the economy was in recession, from 3.2 in July.
That was much worse than economists' expectations for a reading of plus 3.7. Any reading below zero indicates a contraction in the region's manufacturing.
''This report clearly reflects the fact that businesses cut their outlook as a result of the debt limit crises and the resulting downgrade of the U.S. credit rating,'' said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities in New York.
''I would not read too much into this in terms of the outlook on the economy since manufacturing had been on the rebound in autos and exports and the economy was stuck in first gear for two years.''
A second report showed sales of previously owned homes fell 3.5 percent in July, to an annual rate of 4.67 million units, the lowest in eight months. Economists had expected home resales to rise to a 4.9 million-unit pace.
Separate data from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 9,000, to 408,000. Another report from the department showed the Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent in July, the largest gain since March, after falling 0.2 percent in June.
Gasoline, which rose 4.7 percent after falling 6.8 percent the previous month, accounted for about half of the rise in C.P.I. last month.
But core C.P.I. -- excluding food and energy -- rose 0.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in June.
Morgan Stanley cut its global growth forecast and said that the United States and its major export partner the euro zone were ''dangerously close to recession.'' In a research note that spooked investors, it lowered its United States estimate to 1.8 percent growth in gross domestic product for 2011 from 2.6 percent and for next year to 2.1 percent from 3.0 percent.
The jobless claims data covers the survey week for August nonfarm payrolls. Claims dropped by 14,000 between the July and August survey periods, but there are fears that turbulence in the financial markets could have slowed hiring this month.
Despite the spike in consumer inflation last month, which also reflected a 0.4 percent rise in food prices, inflation generally remains contained.
In the 12 months to July, core C.P.I. increased 1.8 percent -- the largest increase since December 2009. This measure has rebounded from a record low of 0.6 percent in October, and the Fed would like to see that closer to 2 percent.
Overall consumer prices rose 3.6 percent year-on-year, rising by the same amount for a third consecutive month.

HEADLINE: U.S. Leads Allies In Call For Chief Of Syria To Quit

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Reporting was contributed by Mark Landler and Brian Knowlton from Washington, Neil MacFarquhar from New York, Nada Bakri from Beirut, Lebanon, Alan Cowell from Paris, Nicholas Kulish from Berlin and Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States and several of its major allies on Thursday called on Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, to give up power. The carefully choreographed announcements came after months of popular protests and increasingly deadly reprisals that the United Nations commissioner for human rights said amounted to crimes against humanity by the Syrian authorities.
President Obama, who had faced criticism for not acting more assertively, ordered the freezing of all Syrian assets within American jurisdiction, banned imports of Syrian oil and barred American citizens from having any business dealings with the Syrian government, which the administration once courted in the hopes of improving relations.
He called on other countries to impose their own sanctions, focusing on Syria's oil and gas industry, and European leaders suggested those were now under consideration. 
The ultimate effect of the chorus of international condemnation and sanctions remains to be seen, and the United States and its allies risked highlighting their relative powerlessness to alter events inside Syria. But their decision to turn up the pressure substantially could have a profound psychological effect on a government that has survived for decades by retrenching during crises and manipulating relations in the region -- from Turkey to Israel, Lebanon to Iran -- to keep itself relevant, if not admired.
Diplomatically, at least, Syria now appears more isolated than at any other time in the 41 years that Mr. Assad or his father, Hafez, has led the country. Administration officials and diplomats said they hoped that fact alone could break open fissures among the political and business elite cosseted under Mr. Assad's rule. Until now they appear to have bet on the government's somehow surviving.
It was Mr. Obama's first explicit call for the Syrian leader to resign, and it came after weeks of divisions within the administration and mounting criticism from many in Congress, advocates of Syrian democracy and others that the United States and other nations had responded too tepidly to the violent suppression of protests that have swept Syrian cities for five months. It also followed behind-the-scenes diplomatic maneuvering in which Turkey took the lead in an unsuccessful effort to persuade Mr. Assad to halt the violence.
''We have consistently said that President Assad must lead a democratic transition or get out of the way,'' Mr. Obama said in a written statement released Thursday morning after coordination with allies in Europe. ''He has not led. For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside.''
Almost simultaneously, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany issued a joint statement urging Mr. Assad ''to face the reality of the complete rejection of his regime by the Syrian people and to step aside in the best interests of Syria and the unity of its people.'' Canada made a similar appeal, as did the European Union. The United Nations human rights office in Geneva issued a damning, 22-page report that concluded that Syrian government forces might have committed crimes against humanity by carrying out summary executions, torturing prisoners and harming children.
The United Nations report, overseen by the high commissioner for human rights, Navanethem Pillay, accused Syria of grossly violating its citizens' rights and carrying out ''numerous summary executions, including 353 named victims.'' It also said that members of the security forces ''posed as civilians in order to cause unrest and portray an inaccurate picture of events.''
The office recommended that the United Nations Security Council consider referring Syria to the International Criminal Court for prosecution. In New York, the Security Council met later on Thursday and discussed potential steps against Syria.
The United States and European members of the Security Council pressed for a resolution condemning Syria and were debating sanctions that could include an arms embargo, a freezing of assets and a ban on travel by the country's leaders, diplomats there said. They would not say whether the Council would consider referring the matter to the international court, but did say that Council members expressed a desire to hold accountable those responsible for the violence. At the United Nations, Syria said the United States was trying to use the Security Council as an ''instrument'' to instigate further instability.
Even Russia, which has resisted punitive measures against Syria so far and appears likely to veto an embargo, has sounded increasingly frustrated with Mr. Assad's government, which has ignored repeated calls to halt the violence, including those from countries like Turkey with which it had closer relations. While Mr. Assad told the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on Wednesday that the crackdown had in fact ended, activists within Syria said the violence continued unabated.
After Mr. Assad spoke on Wednesday, two people were reported killed in the city of Homs after a nighttime prayer, held only during the month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to sunset; at least one more died in the city on Thursday when security forces opened fire on a small protest in the neighborhood of Baba Amr. Residents and activists also reported attacks and arrests in other cities, including Deir al-Zour, Hama and the capital, Damascus. ''The killings and destruction haven't stopped,'' an activist in Homs, who would be identified only as Mohamad, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. ''They haven't withdrawn from the city. On the contrary, the number of security forces has increased and gunfire is heard every so often.''
In Washington, administration officials acknowledged that American sanctions alone would have little effect. ''No outside power can or should impose this transition,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said at the State Department. ''It is up to the Syrian people to choose their own leaders, in a democratic system based on the rule of law and dedicated to protecting the rights of all citizens, regardless of ethnicity, religion, sect or gender.''
With Syria's opposition barely organized and under constant harassment, there is no obvious path to a transfer of power, even if Mr. Assad's grip weakens significantly. ''Nothing about this is going to be easy,'' a senior administration official said.
The sanctions that Mr. Obama ordered took aim at Syria's oil and petroleum exports. Syria is a relative small energy producer, exporting only 148,000 barrels of oil a day, almost all of it to European nations, according to the United States Department of Energy. Mr. Cameron, Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Merkel said in their statement that they would be ''actively supporting'' additional sanctions through the European Union, but no new ones were announced Thursday. Like the United States, the European Union has imposed sanctions on Mr. Assad and dozens of other security officials and businessmen in Syria. The union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, said the union was discussing how to broaden its sanctions.
The Obama administration has sharply criticized the violence in Syria from the start, steadily intensifying its pressure on Mr. Assad with statements and with actions. But in stark contrast to its comparatively swift calls for the ouster of Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, or Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the administration stopped short of doing so in the case of Syria.
The White House and State Department debated the issue intensely in recent weeks, with Mrs. Clinton arguing that a call for Mr. Assad to go would be meaningless without broader support and action. An administration official said the president first broached calling for Mr. Assad's departure in a phone call with Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Merkel on Aug. 5.
Mrs. Clinton persuaded the White House to delay its call until the sanctions could be readied and to give Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, a chance to press the Syrian leader to halt the violence and begin a reform process that would include a unity government and new elections. As the violence continued and intensified with the start of Ramadan, Mr. Obama spoke with Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and said he wanted to move more quickly, an administration official said.
Turkey, with a shared border and deep historic and economic ties to Syria, did not join in the diplomatic chorus on Thursday. ''Turkey was the first country to say that there was no point in continuing talks with Syria while military operations continued,'' said a Turkish government official, who asked not to be named because of his diplomatic position. ''Turkey, however, is not at the point mentioned in President Obama's speech today.''

HEADLINE: In Revote, Connecticut Unions Pick Concessions Over Layoffs

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; Elizabeth Maker contributed reporting from Danbury and Newtown, Conn.

 BODY:
HARTFORD -- Two months after Connecticut workers rejected an agreement meant to save $1.6 billion over two years, union leaders said on Thursday that they had accepted the same deal, bowing to the threat of layoffs in a year full of battles between unions and state governments.
After the June vote, unions representing 45,000 state workers changed the voting rules to make approval more likely. But with 3,000 layoff notices already sent out and 2,000 or more still possible, all 14 unions that have completed a new vote have approved the deal, officials said, meaning it would have passed even under the old rules. 
The agreement includes a two-year wage freeze and concessions on health care and pension benefits. In exchange, the unions secured a four-year no-layoff clause and a promise that the state would not demand unpaid furloughs. The changes are expected to save about $1.6 billion over two years and $21.5 billion over 20. Pension and compensation packages for workers hired after July 1 will be reduced even further, and will not include the ''longevity pay'' that had rewarded workers for staying on the job.
The votes played out against a now-familiar backdrop: a state government under fiscal stress, pushback against public-employee unions, and an economy struggling to create jobs.
But in a liberal state with a strong union tradition, the process involved little of the anti-union rhetoric seen in places like Wisconsin and Ohio and instead reflected an effort to reconcile longstanding attitudes and political alliances with changed times.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, Connecticut's first Democratic governor in 20 years, had staked his balanced budget on spending cuts, broad tax increases and union givebacks, and after the June vote, he began the process of laying off thousands of workers while planning even larger cuts. On Thursday, he and union leaders said that, despite the tumult, Connecticut had managed to set an example of shared sacrifice.
''We have achieved something the skeptics said was unachievable: we've made the relationship between the state and its workforce sustainable,'' Mr. Malloy said in a statement. ''And unlike in most other states, we did it without going to war with public employees.''
The agreement, which came on the heels of one approved in New York this week, reflected a changed climate in which even strong union states are exacting concessions from state employees and in which lawmakers in states like Wisconsin and New Jersey are taking away benefits through legislation.
''Disaster has been averted, and we are on solid ground to regroup and go forward,'' Ron McLellan, a 32-year power-plant operator and president of one of the state's 15 public-employee unions, said at a news conference announcing the results. ''The billionaires and the large corporations who have targeted public-service workers across the country do not always win.''
But some Connecticut employees said they voted ''yes'' more because they felt they had to than because they wanted to.
''The whole thing is dirty and unjust, plain and simple,'' said Robert Mills, a food-services supervisor at Garner Correctional Institution in Newtown, who voted against the deal in June but in favor of it this time. ''The government is using intimidation and scare tactics to force people to do what they want.'' Of his ''yes'' vote, he said: ''I did it because the threatening and bullying by the governor worked. I don't want to lose my job; I don't want my friends to lose their jobs.''
A majority of workers approved the agreement in June, but it failed because of rules requiring that 14 of the 15 unions approve it, and that those 14 unions represent at least 80 percent of the workforce. This time, all that was needed was the approval of eight unions representing more than half of state employees. In all, 73 percent voted in favor of the deal the second time, up from 57 percent the first time.
A big winner was Mr. Malloy, whose attempt to provide a national model of cooperation was almost killed by the June vote. He said at a press conference Thursday that the deal was ''the most fundamental restructuring of the relationship between state government and state workers'' in Connecticut's history.
He pledged to rescind the layoff notices already issued as soon as possible, but it remained unclear whether all of them would be rescinded or whether other planned cuts would go forward.
For workers, the verdict on who won was less simple.
At Danbury Superior Court, Kristie Farrington, 31, a clerk in the public defender's office, said she had supported the contract both times. ''I don't want to be selfish,'' said Ms. Farrington, whose second child is due this month. ''Working in the public defender's office, I deal every day with clients who are indigent and have it really bad. Who am I to say, 'No, I'm not willing to make a few concessions?' ''
James R. Blanchette, 51, a social worker for the Department of Children and Families in Danbury, received a pink slip a few weeks ago. He, too, said he had voted ''yes'' both times. Mr. Blanchette, a retired Hartford police lieutenant, has worked in both the public and the private sectors, and ''working as a unionized state employee is so much better, so much more secure,'' he said. ''I don't think a lot of union workers realize how good they have it.''
But another Department of Children and Families employee, a nurse who asked that her name not be used because her supervisor had told workers not to identify themselves to reporters, said she had voted no both times. ''Governor Malloy is holding a noose over our heads,'' she said. ''We can't just roll over and be bullied like this. Isn't this America, the land of the free?''
For most workers, though, practical concerns trumped rhetoric. Christopher Shankle, associate director of graduate studies at Western Connecticut State University, said the deal made sense given economic realities. He weighed the wage freeze against the no-layoff provision. ''That's a lot more security than most people have,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bank Plans Big Layoffs To Cut Costs

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Bank of America is set to eliminate at least 3,500 jobs in the coming months, as the beleaguered financial giant seeks to cut costs and restructure amid deepening shareholder dissatisfaction.
With its stock down more than 50 percent since January, the job cuts by Bank of America may be only the start of a broader restructuring at the company, which is the nation's largest bank. Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive of the bank, has said that he hopes to trim quarterly expenses by $1.5 billion. Thousands more job cuts are likely in the months ahead.
''I know it is tough to have to manage through reductions,'' Mr. Moynihan wrote in a memo to the company's senior leadership late Thursday that outlined the cuts. ''But we owe it to our customers and our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses carefully.'' 
In the memo, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Moynihan said the company's broader revamping effort was nearing completion of its first phase, which examines the consumer business and support functions. A third and final review is set for early September.
The company plans to announce the first results of that project next month, which could include further job cuts that would total more than 10,000.
Mr. Moynihan said in the memo that the company had already begun to tell the 3,500 employees that their jobs were to be eliminated, and that the reductions would come throughout the company. Bank of America, which has roughly 280,000 employees, cut about 2,500 jobs in the first half of the year.
Even more than its large rivals, Bank of America has been battered particularly hard by the bursting of the housing bubble and the surge in foreclosures. It has already suffered tens of billions in losses tied to its disastrous acquisition in 2008 of Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender that has come to epitomize the excesses of the housing boom of the last decade.
Investors are also pressing the bank to buy back billions of dollars in securities it assembled from mortgages that later soured. In June, it agreed to pay a group of investors including Pimco, BlackRock and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York $8.5 billion to settle a portion of these claims.
While the settlement represented the culmination of months of negotiations and was seen as an attempt by Mr. Moynihan to finally put Countrywide's disastrous legacy behind the company, investors remain skeptical.
Earlier this month, American International Group, the giant insurer, filed suit against the company over mortgage backed securities it assembled, and investors fear the June settlement may actually spur more litigation, rather than resolve it.
The latest job cuts, which were first reported on the Wall Street Journal's Web site late Thursday, will also hit the company's Merrill Lynch unit. Bank of America agreed to acquire the firm at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. While Merrill has proved profitable more recently, trading volumes and the flow of deals have slowed substantially in recent months, making it vulnerable to further job reductions.
Despite the huge settlements and other write-downs, Mr. Moynihan has said that he does not plan to issue more stock to raise new capital. Instead, the company has been engaged in the corporate version of a yard sale in recent weeks, raising billions of dollars as it offloads everything from its Canadian credit card business to several commercial real estate properties.
In the recent market downturn, Bank of America shares have been especially hard hit. Since the beginning of the year, Bank of America shares have fallen from $15 to a closing price of $7.01 on Thursday.
''While the markets reflect many economic factors we cannot control, we must stay focused on what we can control,'' Mr. Moynihan said in the memo.

HEADLINE: Truth About Syria: For the horrors to end, Bashar al-Assad and his cronies must go

 BODY:
It took too long, but President Obama has finally -- and unequivocally -- called for the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to step down and end his murderous war against the Syrian people. In another belated but welcome move, Mr. Obama also ordered a stiff new array of sanctions, including freezing all Syrian government assets in the United States and banning American citizens and corporations from doing business with the Syrian government. 
Washington has limited economic and diplomatic leverage with Damascus. But if there ever was a time to use it, it is surely now. In a fresh show of desperate cruelty, Mr. Assad this week ordered Syrian naval warships to fire on civilians in the port city of Latakia. That came on top of bloody army assaults on many other centers of opposition.
The United Nations estimates that at least 2,000 Syrians have been killed in the uprising since mid-March. A report by the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights cited summary executions and gross violations of human rights that ''may amount to crimes against humanity.''
In an effort to bring coordinated pressure, leaders of Germany, France, Britain and the European Union also called on Mr. Assad to depart, and Europe announced that it would be imposing new sanctions. These should include a ban on imports of Syrian oil. That would have minimal effect on world oil prices but a big one on Damascus.
Turkey and neighboring Arab countries should also tighten the screws. Any fantasies that Mr. Assad is a guarantor of Syrian stability or could lead a peaceful transition have been rightly jettisoned. His killing spree has become too much even for the absolute rulers of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to stomach. They, along with the somewhat more enlightened Kuwaiti government, withdrew their ambassadors. Such gestures are welcome but not enough. These and other Arab governments should impose sanctions.
Syria's most influential neighbor is Turkey, with $2.5 billion in annual trade. Once an Assad ally, then a would-be mediator, Turkey now declares that it, too, is out of patience. It could make a decisive difference if it followed that overdue judgment with its own economic sanctions.

HEADLINE: Companies Point Fingers as Students Protest Conditions at Chocolate Plant

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
HERSHEY, Pa. -- A day after hundreds of foreign exchange students walked off their jobs at a plant packing Hershey's chocolates to protest low pay and physically draining work, executives at the Hershey Company and three other companies involved in the plant scrambled to sort out which one was responsible for the conditions that prompted the students' complaints.
Among the four companies with a role in the huge plant where the foreign students were employed, each one pointed to another as being the primary manager in charge of monitoring the students' work. 
One of the companies, the Council for Educational Travel U.S.A., the nonprofit organization based in California that recruited the college students in their home countries and found the jobs for them at Hershey's Eastern Distribution Center III, said it was ''reaching out'' to the students to address their concerns.
But on Thursday the students staged another protest, this time in the heart of America's chocolate capital. About 150 of them held a rally in front of the Hershey Story Museum in the center of town, then they walked through the streets chanting -- with a chorus of Turkish students singing in their own language -- to passers-by. Many people driving through this working-class town honked and waved.
About 400 students, mainly from universities in China, Turkey and Eastern Europe, came to work at the packing plant under a summer cultural exchange program offered by the State Department. With visas called J-1, the students work for several months and then may travel around the country.
The students, including many from medical and engineering graduate schools, said they were expecting a relaxing summer job and opportunities to befriend Americans. They were encouraged, they said, by the Web site of the council, which shows laughing students on a highway before a panoramic mountain landscape, promising a chance to ''live your dream.''
Instead, the students were dropped into the middle of a transformed American workplace, doing fast-paced production line and lifting work in round-the-clock shifts for wages of $7.25 to $8.35 an hour, under multiple layers of contractors. The students said they rarely saw American employees in their area of the plant, where they were packing Reese's, Kit-Kat and other candies.
Their cultural exchange has been an unlikely connection with the American labor movement. A group called the National Guestworker Alliance helped them to organize, and they were joined by leaders from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Service Employees International Union.
The Hershey Company said it had contracted day-to-day operations at the packing plant to Exel, a logistics company. ''The Hershey Company expects all its vendors, including Exel, to treat employees fairly and equitably,'' said Kirk Saville, a spokesman.
Exel contracted with a local labor supplier, SHS Staffing Solutions, to provide temporary workers, including the J-1 students, for the summer months when work is at a peak, said Lynn Anderson, a spokeswoman for Exel.
SHS Staffing said its main function was to handle payroll and schedules for the students. Exel announced late Thursday that it had instructed the staffing company not to hire any more J-1 visa student workers for the packing plant after the end of this summer. Rick Anaya, chief executive of the council, said every student had signed a job offer specifying what they would do before going to work at the plant. The packing job offer stated ''frequent lifting of 24 kilograms,'' boxes weighing more than 50 pounds. Mr. Anaya said that students had done the jobs in past years and he did not regard the lifting as inappropriate for them.
''One of the complaints students have raised is that it is hard work,'' Mr. Anaya said in a statement. ''That may be; we're not sure. But the job offer is self-explanatory.''
One of the protesting students, Peng Lu, 21, an economics student from Yunan, China, said he struggled to lift the boxes. ''Very heavy, sometimes we can't do,'' Mr. Peng said, in imperfect English. ''But they ask, faster, faster,'' he said. ''If you can't, they say, 'Go home.' ''
In a meeting at the plant last week, which a student recorded on a mobile phone, a manager advised them they could be fired and the council might send them back home if they engaged in a protest. After their meetings with the guest worker group, the students said, they had begun to worry that they had been used for jobs that local Americans could do, but for less pay.
They found sympathy from labor leaders. Dennis Bomberger, the business manager of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. local union that represents Hershey's chocolate workers, said they had no direct part in the protest because they do not represent the packing plant. Mr. Bomberger noted that while that plant has grown, Hershey's has reduced its full-time union employees by 700 since 2007, to a total of 1,500, with 500 more layoffs expected next year.
Rick Bloomingdale, the president of the Pennsylvania A.F.L.-C.I.O., said he admired the students' risk-taking, especially since they were not in their own countries. Mr. Bloomingdale and two other labor leaders were arrested briefly during the protest in front of the packing plant on Wednesday.
He said he thought the conditions the students described were ''a throwback to the company town of 100 years ago.''
Mr. Anaya said that the involvement of the unions had made the students less inclined to cooperate with his organization. He said he planned to offer all the students trips paid by the council to Philadelphia and Washington to visit tourist attractions.
''We believe that the experiences they have, while not always easy, will help to shape their views of the world and the U.S.,'' Mr. Anaya said. ''Most certainly they will have improved their English and their understanding of America.''
The students said one way they had learned English in Hershey was by inventing new protest slogans. ''Who are we? The J-1 students. We are proud,'' they chanted on Thursday on the street in heavily accented English.

HEADLINE: Vacation May Provide a Break from Washington's Woes

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- President Obama slipped out of Washington on Thursday to join his family for a nine-day vacation on Martha's Vineyard, leaving behind the most dismal stretch of his presidency and looking to recharge for what is sure to be an epic political battle this fall over the nation's finances.
The bad news followed the president to the steps of his helicopter, with stocks on Wall Street resuming their stomach-churning slide amid fresh fears that the economy will relapse into recession. But in a flurry of high-level diplomacy, he did manage to orchestrate a tougher global response to the bloody crackdown in Syria and issued his first explicit demand that its president, Bashar al-Assad, resign. 
Mr. Obama, who is on his third summer vacation on Martha's Vineyard as president, is expected to fall into a time-tested schedule of golf, bike rides and ice-cream outings with his daughters and a couple of dinners out with his wife, Michelle.
The White House said he has no public events planned, though he will huddle with economic advisers and prepare for a major speech on economic policy after Labor Day.
The president's top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, flew to the island with Mr. Obama on Thursday. The deputy director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese, will travel to Martha's Vineyard next week.
On his first Christmas vacation, in Hawaii, Mr. Obama was criticized for reacting too slowly to the attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines jet.
''The president of the United States is the president of the United States, wherever he goes,'' said Joshua Earnest, the deputy White House press secretary.
In what is a predictable ritual, there were calls from Republican quarters about Mr. Obama's decision to take time off during such a fraught period -- not to mention his choice of this elite enclave, favored by Kennedys, Clintons and other members of the Democratic Party aristocracy.
The apparent Republican front-runner, Mitt Romney, said that if he were in the president's shoes, ''I would go back to my office immediately.'' Speaking to a Chicago radio station, he said, ''If I were president, I wouldn't be looking to spend 10 days on Martha's Vineyard.''
In fact, Mr. Romney will be on Martha's Vineyard himself for a fund-raiser on Aug. 27, while Mr. Obama is there. Mr. Romney has also come under criticism for his leisurely summer break at his lakeside home in New Hampshire -- one long enough that the Web site Politico cracked that he had entered a ''Mittness Protection Program.''
The Republican National Committee got into the act, too, issuing 18 postcards, as part of a fund-raising e-mail, that ridiculed Mr. Obama's sagging approval ratings and his choice again this summer to vacation at an expensive secluded estate, known as Blue Heron Farm (''this $50,000 per week estate is wicked awesome,'' says one).
''Before he jets off, send him a postcard,'' the Republican chairman, Reince Priebus, wrote. ''He sure needs a break after a long year crisscrossing the country raising money to save his job -- all the while over 14 million Americans are out of work and even more are suffering because of his policies.''
White House officials brushed aside the criticisms.
''He's also a husband and a father,'' Mr. Earnest said, adding, ''I don't think the American people begrudge the president spending a little time with his wife and daughters, at the end of the summer, before his daughters head back to school.''
Mr. Obama did squeeze in a three-day campaign-style bus tour of the Midwest this week. Despite encountering audiences anxious about the economy and the job market, the trip seemed to be a tonic for the president.
''I had a great time,'' he said to reporters flying back from Peoria with him Wednesday. ''The more we're out of Washington, the better.''
According to the latest Gallup poll, four out of five Americans disapprove of Mr. Obama's handling of the economy, the lowest ratings of his tenure. His overall approval rating was 40 percent, Gallup said.
Mr. Obama has fared better on the foreign-policy front. His announcement of sanctions against the Syrian government -- and his call on Mr. Assad to step down -- came after a series of phone calls last week and this week with the leaders of Britain, France and Germany, as well as with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.
Mr. Obama's vacation habits fall in between those of his two immediate predecessors, according to Mark Knoller, a CBS News reporter who tracks these things. By his count, Mr. Obama has taken 10 vacation trips in his presidency, covering all or part of 61 days.
At the same point in their terms, Bill Clinton had taken only 28 vacation days and but was about to begin a 21-day stay in Jackson Hole, Wyo. George W. Bush had made 26 visits to his ranch in Crawford, Tex., covering 180 days.

HEADLINE: Raising Money, and Hopes

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
3:50 p.m. Updated Elizabeth Warren formed an exploratory committee on Thursday morning as she continues to consider a run for the Senate in Massachusetts, and her camp maintains that she is still doing just that: exploring. But given their gleeful reaction to this news, Bay State and some national Democrats seem primed for a painful letdown if Ms. Warren, a Harvard Law professor, ultimately decides against challenging Senator Scott Brown.
Ms. Warren gained national (and polarizing) attention for masterminding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the wake of the financial crisis. This week, she has been traveling around Massachusetts on a ''listening tour'' to gauge support for a candidacy. 
''She wants to continue this conversation, and the exploratory committee will assist her in doing so,'' said Kyle Sullivan, a former aide to Gov. Deval Patrick, who is now advising Ms. Warren.
The committee's Web site is set up to register supporters and take their donations.
Promises of a post-Labor Day decision have not changed. But for some Democrats, the exploratory filing amounts to a fait accompli:
''It's pretty much a formality at this point; she's basically in,'' wrote charley-on-the-mta, a co-founder of Blue Mass Group, a liberal blog that hosted Ms. Warren's introductory essay last week, in which she outlined her working-class upbringing (in Oklahoma, not mentioned) and her drive to fight for the middle class.
The post, titled ''Coming Home,'' played up her return to Cambridge after setting up the consumer advocacy agency in Washington. Democratic activists clamored for President Obama to nominate her to lead it, but he did not; she faced certain stone-walling in the Senate, the body she is now considering joining.
Massachusetts Democrats have been eager for a strong candidate to challenge Mr. Brown, the moderate Republican who last year won the seat long held by Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The seven other Democrats in the race have failed to inspire much passion, and Eric Fehrnstrom, a political adviser to Mr. Brown, noted the unsettled field when asked to comment on Ms. Warren's latest step.
''It looks like it'll be a crowded Democratic primary, and it's hard for me to predict who will end up being the nominee,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom said. ''A year from now, we'll find out. In the meantime, Senator Brown is going to keep his focus on creating jobs and getting the economy moving again.''
So far, Ms. Warren's appearances before friendly audiences have drawn ravereviews, and she is popular with national Democratic base.
''The Emily's List community has been telling me loud and clear that they want Elizabeth Warren in the race to beat Scott Brown,'' Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily's List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, said in a statement. ''Today, they got a little bit closer to getting their wish. I'm thrilled that Elizabeth is pursuing this next endeavor with the thoughtfulness and respect that's been such a hallmark of her career.''
Some are backing up the words with money. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group that has criticized Mr. Obama from the left, has raised $100,000 for its effort to draft Ms. Warren.
Nonetheless, the professor has never run for political office, and Mr. Brown has already raised more than $10 million for his re-election effort.
Republicans quickly unleashed a line of attack that, in an unconventional combination, calls Ms. Warren out for having Oklahoma origins while implying that she is a Washington/Ivy League elitist.
''As a native of Oklahoma, the anointed candidate of the Washington establishment, and someone who has spent many years ensconced in the hallways of Harvard, it's a good idea for Professor Warren to learn more about her adopted state of Massachusetts as she prepares to compete in a crowded Democrat primary,'' said Brian Walsh, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''If she's really listening, she'll hear that her plans for higher taxes and more Washington spending will kill jobs.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cooperation Emphasized As Biden Visits China

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Chinese leaders emphasized on Thursday the need for economic cooperation at a time when the global economy is struggling with new crises. But a fistfight at an American-versus-Chinese good-will basketball game at night cast a shadow on the day's diplomacy.
The American delegation had arrived anxious that the Chinese might express concerns over the country's large holdings of American debt. But United States officials present at Mr. Biden's meetings said Chinese leaders told him they still had confidence in the United States' financial system and did not show worry over their country's investments. Chinese officials did not provide a briefing for foreign reporters, so it was not immediately possible to get their version of what was said. 
Recent commentaries from official Chinese news organizations had expressed alarm about China's holdings after the debt ceiling crisis in the United States.
Mr. Biden, meanwhile, returned to an old theme: that China needed to build a more sustainable economy that would put greater weight on domestic consumption rather than exports. He emphasized that such a rebalancing was a way that China could help spur growth in the United States and other countries and address structural flaws in its own economy.
''That's the overwhelming reason I've come: to talk about jobs and growth, and as was phrased this morning, the reordering of our economies -- yours and ours,'' Mr. Biden said in an afternoon meeting with Wu Bangguo, the head of the National People's Congress and officially the second-ranking official in China.
As the world's two largest economies during an uneasy time, Mr. Biden said, both nations ''hold the key together to not only our own prosperity, but to generating growth and jobs worldwide.''
American officials have emphasized that a crucial aspect of rebalancing the economies is allowing the Chinese currency, the renminbi, to appreciate in value. It has gone up by 7 percent since June 2010, but that is not enough, American officials say.
It was unclear if the melee at the basketball game would have any lasting effect on the trip, but it was evident that the news was spreading fast, with videos and photos quickly posted on the Web. The fisticuffs erupted at a close-fought game in Beijing between the Georgetown Hoyas and the Bayi Rockets, a team made up of members of the People's Liberation Army.
Sarah E. Burton, an American spectator, described the fight as a ''fist-furious brawl'' that erupted after at least five on-court scuffles. The game was called off.
The Hoyas' trip to China was not related to Mr. Biden's mission, but after arriving Wednesday, Mr. Biden did attend a game in which the Hoyas crushed a team from Shanxi Province.
It was Mr. Biden's first trip to China since taking office. A main purpose of the trip, which includes three full days of meetings in Beijing and the western city of Chengdu, is for Mr. Biden and other American officials to build a relationship with Vice President Xi Jinping, who is expected to become China's leader next year. On Thursday, Mr. Biden had two meetings with Mr. Xi in the Great Hall of the People and attended a dinner hosted by Mr. Xi.
American officials said the two discussed a broad range of issues, including matters of deep disagreement, in a frank manner. Topics included American arms sales to Taiwan, policy toward Pakistan and the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran.
Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi arrived at the Great Hall together at 10:30 a.m., striding under blue skies made unusually clear from a night of rain. Inside, the pair walked on a red carpet past an honor guard that first played ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' and then the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.
The men exchanged opening remarks at a conference table. Mr. Xi was the first to speak, and he underscored the main theme of Mr. Biden's visit, which was the increasingly intertwined interests, particularly economic interests, of both countries: ''I, too, believe that under the new situation, China and the United States have ever more extensive common interests, and we shoulder ever more important common responsibilities,'' he said.
Mr. Biden spoke nostalgically of his first visit to China in 1979, when he was a senator. Before he could finish his opening remarks, which had been prepared for officials and journalists to hear, Chinese security officers forcefully shoved foreign reporters and some White House employees from the meeting room. It was unclear whether there had been some sort of misunderstanding for the disturbance, rare during such a high-level meeting, but American officials declined to comment on the matter.
The morning meetings with Mr. Xi ran 45 minutes late, which American officials later said they took as a good sign. Mr. Biden then went with his granddaughter Naomi and the new United States ambassador, Gary F. Locke, and Mr. Locke's wife, Mona, to Yao Ji Chao Gan, a small restaurant north of Tiananmen Square that specializes in fried liver and bowls of intestine.
The restaurant, tucked away behind the ancient building known as the Drum Tower, was crowded with Chinese patrons at lunchtime. An owner of the restaurant spoke to Mr. Biden about her relatives in Minnesota.
Some patrons clapped as Mr. Biden strode among tables, and one yelled out ''Beijing welcomes you!'' in Mandarin Chinese. Mr. Biden's group ate pork buns, but did not order the house specialty.

HIGHLIGHT: More similar than you think.

 BODY:
This post by Jon Cohn made me think of something I wrote, to fairly general derision, last year.
What I wrote then was that the relatively good news coming out of Germany should be viewed as a regional development within a larger economy, and that Germany -- as Europe's center of durable goods manufacturing -- bore some resemblance to the industrial midwest, which was also experiencing a bounceback as manufacturing revived.
A year later that parallel is a lot easier to see -- or would be if you were paying attention. As Cohn notes
the precipitous drop in unemployment in this part of the country has been one of the better, if under-appreciated, economic stories of the last year -- testimony to a rebound in the manufacturing sector bolstered, in part, by the government's rescue of General Motors and Chrysler.
Now there are signs that this expansion is faltering -- but so it expansion in Germany.
Truly, when talking about European economies, you want to adopt a regional economics/economic geography perspective. And when you do, some of the alleged success stories become a lot less striking.

HEADLINE: A Year Full of Weather Disasters and an Economic Toll to Match

HIGHLIGHT: Normally, three or four weather disasters a year in the United States will cause at least $1 billion in damages each. This year, there were nine such disasters.

 BODY:
The weather this year has not only been lousy, it has been as destructive in terms of economic loss as any on record.
Normally, three or four weather disasters a year in the United States will cause at least $1 billion in damages each. This year, there were nine such disasters. They included the huge snow dump in late January and early February on the Midwest and Northeast, the rash of tornadoes this spring across the Midwest and the more recent flooding of the Missouri and Souris Rivers. The disasters are responsible for at least 589 deaths, including 160 in May when tornadoes ripped through Joplin, Mo.

These nine billion-dollar disasters tie the record set in 2008, according to a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The total damage done by all storms, tornadoes, flooding and heat waves so far this year adds up to about $35 billion. The National Climatic Data Center says it estimates the costs in terms of dollars and lives that would not have been incurred had the event not taken place. Insured and uninsured losses are included in damage estimates and are likely to change as assessments become more complete. With four months to go in 2011, this year's total amount of damage is likely to rise. Forecasters are already predicting further meteorological mayhem as hurricane season intensifies.
Over the last 30 years, there have been about 108 natural disasters that have caused $1 billion in damages each, according to NOAA. The total damage from all natural disasters since 1980 is about $750 billion.
"The increasing impacts of natural disasters, as seen this year, are a stark reminder of the lives and livelihoods at risk," Jack Hayes, director of NOAA's National Weather Service, said in a statement.
Part of the problem is that more people are living in high-risk areas, particularly coastal regions, NOAA said. This makes communities "increasingly vulnerable to severe weather events, such as tornado outbreaks, intense heat waves, flooding, active hurricane seasons, and solar storms that threaten electrical and communication systems," the statement said.
NOAA, along with other private and public agencies, is taking several steps to try to make the nation more "weather-ready," including more precise forecasts, improved ability to alert local authorities about the risks and the development of specialized mobile-ready emergency response teams.
The National Weather Service is also planning several test projects involving emergency response and ecological forecasting. Test projects are to start soon at strategic locations in the Gulf Coast, South and mid-Atlantic region. They include improvements to a system in Charleston, W.Va., for alerts three hours ahead of severe weather instead of the current half-hour.
The nine weather events that have caused at least $1 billion in damages so far this year are:
Central/East Groundhog Day blizzard (Jan. 29-Feb. 3). This storm was tied to 36 deaths. The losses totaled more than $2 billion.
Midwest/Southeast tornadoes (April 4-5). Nine people were killed. Total losses were more than $2 billion.
Southeast/Midwest tornadoes (April 8-11). Resulted in more than $2 billion in losses.
Midwest/Southeast tornadoes (April 14-16). Caused 38 deaths. Total losses are more than $2 billion.
Southeast/Ohio Valley/Midwest tornadoes (April 25-30). Caused 327 deaths. Losses total more than $9 billion.
Midwest/Southeast tornadoes (May 22-27). Caused 177 deaths. Total losses are more than $7 billion.
Southern Plains/Southwest drought, heat waves, wildfires. Direct losses are more than $5 billion.
Mississippi River flooding. At least two deaths and losses ranging from $2 billion-$4 billion.
Upper Midwest flooding. Losses estimated at $2 billion.

HEADLINE: The North Dakota Miracle

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Forget the Texas Miracle. Let's instead take a look at North Dakota, which has the lowest unemployment rate and the highest job growth rate in the country.

 BODY:
Forget the Texas Miracle. Let's instead take a look at North Dakota, which has the lowest unemployment rate and the fastest job growth rate in the country. 
According to new data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics today, North Dakota had an unemployment rate of just 3.3 percent in July - that's just over a third of the national rate (9.1 percent), and about a quarter of the rate of the state with the highest joblessness (Nevada, at 12.9 percent). 
North Dakota has had the lowest unemployment in the country (or was tied for the lowest unemployment rate in the country) every single month since July 2008.
Its healthy job market is also reflected in its payroll growth numbers. North Dakota had 19,700 more jobs in July than it did during the same month last year. 
That probably sounds like small potatoes when you look at Texas, which had 269,500 more jobs last month than it did a year earlier. But Texas is a much bigger, more populous state, and had many more jobs to begin with. In terms of percentage growth, North Dakota has a better record: year over year, its payrolls grew by 5.2 percent. Texas came in second, with an increase of 2.6 percent.
Why is North Dakota doing so well? For one of the same reasons that Texas has been doing well: oil.

HEADLINE: Community Stands Strong to Block an Eviction

BYLINE: NATASHA LENNARD


HIGHLIGHT: Housing advocates and supporters rallied to block an eviction in Bedford-Stuyvesant, which now may not happen.

 BODY:
From inside Mary Lee Ward's small and sparsely furnished living room in Bedford-Stuyvesant, it sounded Friday as if a block party was in full swing in the street below. Cars and trucks honked their horns melodically as they passed and almost 200 voices could be heard cheering and chanting.
But this was no street party; it was not yet 9 a.m. and the crowd outside was there as a line of defense.
Ms. Ward -- a tiny, soft-spoken 82-year-old -- faced forcible eviction by a marshal on Friday morning because of a subprime mortgage she bought in 1995. And so neighbors, friends, housing advocates and supporters had formed a thick human wall outside Ms. Ward's small gray house on Tompkins Avenue in Brooklyn. 
Shortly after 9:30, the local state assemblywoman, Annette Robinson, emerged from the house with news.
"The marshal will not be taking action today," Ms. Robinson said over a bullhorn as Ms. Ward stood by her side. Ms. Robinson vowed to negotiate with the deed holder to keep Ms. Ward in her home.
Friday's deadline followed three years of work by a nonprofit legal group, Common Law, and Ms. Robinson, among others.
"If I'm evicted today, that's it for anybody who's a senior citizen," Ms. Ward, who has been in the house since 1967, said earlier in the morning, sitting next to a table in her living room covered with legal documents. "It would show they can break up the community and do anything to us."
Fifteen years ago, Ms. Ward says, she needed money for a lawyer to help her keep her great-granddaughter from being put up for adoption. Like many others in her neighborhood, she turned to a subprime lender. 
She signed a contract with Delta Funding, a company she found advertised on a flier tucked in her mailbox. She borrowed $82,000 against her house, but claims to have received a loan of only $1,000. Ms. Ward still displays a faded portrait of her great-granddaughter as a baby, even though she was unable to prevent the adoption and has long lost contact.
In 1999, the state was about to sue Delta Funding when the two sides reached a settlement over allegations of predatory lending practices directed at elderly members of minority groups throughout Queens and Brooklyn. The next year, federal agencies sued and nearly simultaneously settled with Delta over similar issues. 
Officials from Common Law say the lender sent a letter to Ms. Ward in 2001 informing her that they were canceling her loan, but in fact, it never was canceled. Rather, the mortgage has been passed from financial institution to financial institution for 10 years, during which time Ms. Ward has been in and out of court facing eviction over the loan, Common Law says. 
Last year, a real estate speculation company, 768 Dean Inc., bought Ms. Ward's loan at auction. The company arranged for a marshal to remove Ms. Ward from her property on Friday, Common Law says, a move that galvanized local support for her. By 7 a.m., demonstrators stood outside her doorstep, brandishing banners that read "We stand with Ms. Ward" and "Defend the block."
"We have the people power to push the landlord to negotiate with us," said Karen Gargamelli, a lawyer with Common Law. "Our demands are that the eviction be stopped and that the landlord give the deed back either directly to Ms. Ward or to the Bed-Stuy community in a land trust for affordable housing." 
Common Law has also asked the state attorney general to investigate why Ms. Ward's purportedly rescinded mortgage has continued to haunt her for over a decade. 
768 Dean Inc. does not have a listed phone number. Voice messages left at the workplace of its principal owner, Shammeem A. Chowdhury, and with Mr. Chowdhury's lawyer were not immediately returned.
Ms. Ward is not the first recipient of this brand of foreclosure defense. Take Back the Land, a housing activist group founded in Miami, has blockaded houses in Rochester in recent months to delay or prevent evictions. Many of the protesters outside Ms. Ward's house came in response to a call put out by a coalition of housing advocacy groups, Organizing for Occupation.
A tearful Ms. Ward spoke briefly to those who had gathered on her behalf. "You have to stick with it when you know you're right," she said. "We're not slaves anymore. My grandfather was a slave, but I'm not."

HEADLINE: Podcast: Eurobonds, Star Analysts and Productivity

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
Financial markets have been showing more signs of stress. The daily swings of stock markets have been growing wider, and investments presumed to be safe, like Treasury bonds and gold bullion, have been rising sharply in price.
While these market movements are global, many of the problems over the last week emanate from Europe. In the new Weekend Business podcast, Graham Bowley and Floyd Norris discuss proposals to create eurobonds as a way to provide financing for troubled members of the European Union. Political opposition in relatively rich countries like Germany, however, makes such bonds unlikely in the near future. Meanwhile, banks in Europe and elsewhere retain considerable exposure to European sovereign debt. No simple solution is at hand, and the markets remain skittish.
In a separate conversation in the podcast, and in an article on the cover of Sunday Business, Susanne Craig says that despite the uncertain market outlook, a bidding war has developed for stock analysts specializing in Internet and social media companies. We haven't returned to the manic mood of the late 1990s, she says, but the sums being paid to some stock analysts may suggest that we are heading in that direction. 
Tyler Cowen, the George Mason University economist, explores the implications of declining labor productivity in his Economic View column in Sunday Business, and in a podcast conversation. This may be the most serious of the many economic problems facing the United States, he says.

Feeling blue about the economy and the markets? Paul Lim, who writes the Fundamentally column for Sunday Business, says in the podcast that he sees a silver lining for stocks. While big American companies have not been hiring in large numbers, they have begun spending in two ways - on tangible things like technology and on acquisitions of other companies. Both should bolster share prices. 
The news section of the podcast includes a discussion of Google's plans to acquire Motorola Mobility.
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Europe's troubles (32:13); news roundup (21:33); star analysts (18:38); Tyler Cowen on productivity (11:51); Paul Lim on stocks (6:30); the week ahead (2:08).
As articles discussed in the podcast are published during the weekend, links will be added to this post.

HEADLINE: Higher Bridge, Tunnel and PATH Rates Approved

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The new tolls and fares will be phased in starting next month.

 BODY:
A steep toll increase on the bridges and tunnels that cross the Hudson River was approved Friday morning by the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the culmination of a two-week dance among the agency, politicians and the public.
The increase, to be phased in, will raise peak-time E-ZPass tolls to $9.50 from $8 beginning next month. By 2015, that toll will be $12.50. The cash toll will go up 50 percent in September, to $12 a car; by 2015, the cash toll will be $15.
The board also voted to raise the single-fare ride on PATH trains, which travel between Manhattan and New Jersey, by 25 cents in September and in each of the following three years.
The toll increases, although significant and sure to be criticized by drivers, are smaller than in an initial proposal floated by the Port Authority earlier this month, and few who follow the Port Authority were surprised by the change.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey publicly expressed surprise at the initial plan -- a stance that raised some eyebrows as the governors jointly control the agency, whose every public action, particularly one as significant as a toll or fare increase, is rarely announced without some form of prior approval from the two executives.
The governors, who each can overrule board votes, had pledged to review the proposal with the agency, and nine public hearings were held, all on Tuesday. (Few, if any, authority board members attended those sessions.)
Late Thursday, as predicted, the governors issued a joint statement that took credit for the lower increases. "We are pleased that our work together" led to the lower rates, the governors wrote.
Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie have called for a significant audit of the Port Authority and blamed "fiscal mismanagement" for the raising of tolls and fares. The governors promised to reduce the agency's budget for maintenance and expansion.
The authority, like many sprawling bureaucracies, has its share of waste and inefficiencies, like spiraling overtime. But the agency has trimmed its operating budget in the past few years and reduced staffing to the lowest level in decades. The creditworthiness of its bonds recently received an upgrade from a rating agency.
The need for higher tolls is based more on the declining economy, which reduced the number of commuters (and thus, toll and fare revenue) using the agency's crossings. And the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site has siphoned billions away from the agency's budget for improving and expanding its bridges, tunnels, airports, shipping ports and the PATH system.
Mr. Christie, who has pledged to not raise taxes on his constituents, called for the agency to use part of its budget for New Jersey road and highway repairs, which are traditionally financed by the state. Some of Mr. Christie's political opponents say the higher rates are a de facto tax increase on commuters.
At Friday's board hearing, representatives of several civic groups expressed support for the higher tolls, saying the money was necessary to help pay for the region's transportation infrastructure to stay in good repair.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, on his Friday morning radio program, also endorsed the plan, warning that without additional revenue, the region's economy would be at risk.
"The bridges would eventually fall down, we wouldn't fix anything, we wouldn't make the commute better," the mayor said. "If you want services, you've got to pay for them."
The proposals were approved 9 to 0 by the agency's board of commissioners, all of whom are appointed by the two states' governors.
A few commuters and civic activists spoke at the meeting against the new rates, saying the working public was being asked to subsidize the agency's foul-ups.
None of the commissioners would speak to reporters after the meeting. "I speak to the public, but not under these circumstances," one commissioner, David S. Steiner, said as he walked past reporters into a private side room.
Mr. Steiner, an appointee of former Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey, had not appeared to have listened to the public, either. He could be seen resting, with his eyes shut, during significant portions of Friday's board meeting.

HEADLINE: Finally, Someone to Run Against Wall Street

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Enter Elizabeth Warren.

 BODY:
One of the truly amazing things about American politics in the Lesser Depression is that nobody in political life has been willing to run as the champion of ordinary Americans against the financial wheeler-dealers who brought this disaster on us. Republicans won't, of course, because their worldview says that greed is good and government the only source of evil. But Obama has also been almost weirdly unwilling to express even the slightest populism.
So I'm glad to hear that Elizabeth Warren will apparently run for Senate. She's no Huey Long -- her manner is more schoolteacher than rabble-rouser -- but that makes her more credible. And she's got the best credentials on the financial crisis of any prominent figure in American life.
This should be edifying.

HEADLINE: Big Three Increase Their Financial Footprint on Woodward Dream Cruise

BYLINE: MARY M. CHAPMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Though Chevrolet is the official sponsor of the annual multiday event in suburban Detroit, Ford and Chrysler are making stronger plays for eyeballs than in past years.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- After a lengthy spell in the doldrums, and encouraged by improved sales, domestic carmakers are stepping up involvement in the Woodward Dream Cruise, suburban Detroit's annual paean to all things automotive.
Created in 1995 to raise funds for a suburban soccer field and held the third Saturday in August, the Cruise attracts 1.5 million people who line Woodward Avenue, metro Detroit's central thoroughfare, to watch 40,000 vehicles snake, peel and rumble their way north for 16 miles through eight communities. The cruise begins in Ferndale and reaches its terminus in Pontiac.
Leading the love-in this year is Chevrolet, which is committed to sponsorship through 2013. The General Motors division, like most other automakers, had dialed back its participation as the industry reeled. Last year, the Motor City casino was the chief sponsor.
"Obviously, we didn't do as much the last couple of years, but we're ramping back up," said Tom Wilkinson, Chevrolet's communication's manager, in a telephone interview. "And the next two years will also give us a chance to get some rhythm and keep building." Chevrolet sales increased 14 percent from January through July in the United States, he added.
With multiple events scheduled throughout the weekend, Chevrolet is also using the cruise to mark the brand's centennial celebration. "The strategy was not to have one big event," Mr. Wilkinson said.
Chevrolet's three-year sponsorship totals $1.2 million, not including independent marketing, said Martin Pawlusiak, who handles cruise sponsorships. The event last year injected about $56 million into the local economy and benefited 100 charities, he said. As of Thursday, sponsorship was up 15 percent over last year, he added, including a $35,000 from Auburn Hills-based Plex Systems, a software company that sells to auto suppliers.
"We doubled the size of our company in the last three years and thought this was a great opportunity to give back to the local community in a way that works well with our customer base," said Patrick Fetterman, the company's vice president of marketing.
Tony Michaels, the cruise's executive director, said that while the industry's sales gains had been modest, the corporate mood had brightened. G.M.'s domestic sales improved from 185,105 last August to 214,915 in July. Ford's totals increased from 157,327 to 180,315, while Chrysler went from 99,611 to 112,026. Companies recently announced plans to hire new workers.
"There's a substantial uptick that is obvious," Mr. Michaels said. "You can see they're excited."
The festivities began this week when the G.M. design team was the host of a cruise-route car show, featuring entertainment and vehicles owned by team members. On Thursday, Daniel F. Akerson, the G.M. chairman and chief executive, drove a 1960 Corvette down Woodward, accompanied by 50 owner-driven Chevrolet Volts, 20 employee-owned Chevrolet heritage vehicles, the new Camaro ZL1, the Chevrolet Sonic and other classic vehicles.
Ford returns this year with an expanded Mustang Alley, which occupies Nine Mile Road near Woodward in suburban Ferndale. The presentation features the 2013 Ford Focus ST production concept, which is due in showrooms next spring, as well as more than 700 Mustangs. Technicians will be on hand to install performance parts on newer vehicles or modern parts on classic cars.
"We're offering a bigger array of vehicles and engines than before," said Richard Truett, Ford's powertrain communications manager, in a telephone interview, adding that Ford has sunk more resources into marketing than in recent years. "We have more people working on it."
In addition to mobile billboards and a prominent Fiat wallscape in suburban Birmingham, Chrysler has more space than usual in a strip-mall parking lot.
"It's a little bigger than last year," said Dianna C. Gutierrez, the automaker's marketing and advertising public relations manager. "This is definitely an important event for us." The manufacturer is highlighting production and historical vehicles, a Nascar show car and seven employee-owned muscle cars.
If the industry may be regarded in rebound relative only to its turn in the abyss, Dana DeCoster, publisher of Cruis'news, which covers the classic and hot-rod industry, said it was still progress. "From being out on the streets the last couple of days, I've noticed a much larger presence of the Big Three," he said in a telephone interview. "The companies are coming back, and what better place than the cruise to show that off."

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
Will he listen? That's the question about Bashar al-Assad, Syria's president, since President Obama and political leaders in Canada and Europe issued demands on Thursday for him to step aside. Steve Myers reports that besides calling for Mr. Assad's resignation, Mr. Obama also ordered the freezing of Syrian assets within American jurisdiction and barred American citizens from business with Mr. Assad's government. At home, critics said Mr. Obama's moves were too little, too late.
Shortly after calling for Mr. Assad's resignation, President Obama slipped out of Washingtonfor a nine-day vacation on Martha's Vineyard "leaving behind the most dismal stretch of his presidency and looking to recharge for what is sure to be an epic political battle this fall over the nation's finances," Mark Landler writes. Predictably, Mr. Obama's Republican opponents seized on the spectacle of the president taking a break while the economy is faltering.
Jeff Zeleny revisits Mr. Obama's bus tour through the Midwest that wrapped up on Wednesday for clues as to how the president plans to confront his eventual Republican challenger. He notes that Mr. Obama signaled his intention to cast himself as the partisan fighter that some of his followers fear he is not and to use the outsize influence of the Tea Party movement to undermine Republican influence among independent voters.
The Obama administration has halted deportations for illegal immigrants who came to the United States as young children and graduated from high school or served in the military. Robert Pear reports that the decision allows Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, to consider deportations on a case-by-case basis to decide who poses a security threat.
Twelve time zones away from Washington in Beijing, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday began talks with his Chinese counterpart, Vice President Xi Jinping, that will focus on the global economy, trade and currency. Edward Wong discusses the first round of talks, which are scheduled to continue as Mr. Biden spends significant time with Mr. Xi, China's presumed next leader, and defends the economic policies of the United States.
Around the Web:
Politico focuses on Mr. Obama's measured (some say, slow) response to the situation in Syria and the support and criticisms aimed at the president as a result.
Voice of America notes that despite suffocative international sanctions, foreign policy experts do not expect Mr. Assad to resign.
Mr. Obama's approval rating for his handling of the economy hit a new low of 26 percent, according to the most recent Gallup poll. His overall approval rating was relatively steady at 41 percent.
In Martha's Vineyard, where the Obamas are vacationing, happy hour has turned (deliciously) political, according to The Atlantic.
Happening in Washington:
-President Obama has nominated Susan D. Page to become the first-ever American ambassador to South Sudan, the East African nation formed in July when the region split from the former Sudan.
-Former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, a 2012 Republican presidential candidate, will speak at 12:30 p.m. at the National Press Club.
A motorcycle tribute procession for Sept. 11, 2001, will travel through Virginia today to the Pentagon in Arlington. The event organizer, Americas 9/11 Foundation Inc., is expecting more than 1,800 cyclists to participate in a ride from Shanksville, Pa., to the Pentagon, and then on to the site of the World Trade Center in New York City.

HIGHLIGHT: Are this week's comments by Gov. Perry just the words of a newbie to the national stage? Or the future of the Republican Party?

 BODY:
Consider the Rick Perry paradox: in a G.O.P. field notably bereft of experience in elected office, he has won nine back-to-back elections and spent the last decade as governor of America's second-most-populous state. And, though the Thread has yet to see him in person, he is apparently the Red State equivalent of Kal-El. Or so says this rapturous lede from Politico:
It sounds like a political fairy tale: Months of campaigning by nearly a dozen candidates have left Republicans restless and worried. No one quite fits the bill. Less than six months remain before the primaries. 
And then a superhero arrives. 
He's not just larger than life, he's bigger than the Ames Straw Poll. His dramatic entrance alters the whole campaign. He swoops to the rescue and leaves everybody eating his dust. 
This is the promise of Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who announced his presidential candidacy here Saturday and stole the show from the straw poll 1,200 miles away.
Perry holds the tantalizing promise of being the candidate everybody can agree on. To tea party die-hards, he's Ron Paul with electability; to evangelicals, he's Mike Huckabee with big-state gravitas; to the country-club set, he's a steady hand with a long record of being someone they can do business with.
He's got good looks, charisma, experience. So how do you explain his penchant for comments that are, well, a bit out there? Ben Bernanke's loose-money policy is "treasonous," and Texans would "treat him pretty roughly" if he came to their state. Global warming is a hoax. Evolution is just an idea "out there." Social Security is unconstitutional, and the 16th Amendment, which establishes the grounds for federal income taxes, should be repealed. Are these just the words of a newbie to the national stage? Or the future of the Republican Party? 
James Fallows picks Door No. 1:
Just after Sarah Palin was nominated three years ago, I argued that anyone who moves all at once from state-level to national-level politics is going to be shocked by the greater intensity of the scrutiny and the broader range of expertise called for. Therefore that person is destined to make mistakes; the question is how bad they will be. For Palin, they showed up in her disastrous first few interviews, especially with Katie Couric. Perry is getting his own introduction to this principle just now.
No doubt Perry will learn to be a little savvier with his soundbites. On other hand, Palin was a first-term governor from a thinly populated state; Perry's state has more people than Australia, and an economy almost as large. Whether the rest of the country accepts his schtick, Perry isn't going to change. As John Spong, a senior editor at Texas Monthly, wrote on New York Magazine's Web site, that's just the way things go in Texas:
'Treat him pretty ugly' is, in fact, the way we talk down here. We're prone to violent imagery, typically without the intent to actually hurt anyone. Ann Richards's Republican opponent when she first ran for governor, Clayton Williams, actually survived a campaign-trail rape joke. (She didn't pass him in the polls until he refused to shake her hand after a debate.) What's more, we use terms like 'shitstorm' in public as naturally as 'y'all.' Though Perry has avoided that specific bit of profanity with the press, he was once caught on-camera mocking a reporter at the close of an interview by saying, 'Adios, mofo.' He's also shown an inclination to our trademark Big Talk, as evidenced by his willingness to consider secession at an Austin tax day event in 2009. When people say everything's bigger in Texas, they don't mean to exclude the rhetoric.
And that kind of talk will be part of Perry's game plan going forward, as he said in an interview with Hillary Chabot of the Boston Herald: "The rhetoric will probably get heated. I'm going to be outspoken, I'm going to be passionate, I'm going to be calling it like I see it And if I hurt the president's feelings, well, with all due respect, I love my country and I love future generations more than I care about his feelings."
That may play in Plano, but what about Peoria? Spong thinks not:
In another presidential primary season, that might have been a good thing. The notion of a Lone Star independent streak fueled the Western movies that helped build Hollywood and later propelled George W. Bush into the White House. He relied on it to place himself above the beltway fray. And he could get away with sounding like a gunslinger when he said he wanted Osama bin Laden "dead or alive" because he was expressing an anger shared by the entire country. He harked back to a time when the fights were simpler and the guy in the white hat won. Still, some of us cringed. His wording played a little too simple. He sounded like he was borrowing from the stereotype, which is worse than embodying it.
The latter would be Perry's problem. His cowboy rhetoric, however organic, reads differently when he crosses the state line. It sounds to many ears like he's come unhinged. But worse for Perry, when he points his tough Texanese at the federal government, he's not addressing the economic frustration of the nation as a whole, he's tapping into a populist rage that belongs to the tea party. It's not clear there are enough of them to win a national election. It's even less likely that the rest of the voting populace is itching to spend four more years knee-deep in Texas bluster.
Indeed, Perry's inaugural-week comments quickly drew rebukes from fellow Republicans. Karl Rove called them "unpresidential." Bruce Bartlett said Perry was an "idiot." In comments to Politico, several G.O.P. congressmen fretted about what a Perry general-election bid would mean for Republican candidates elsewhere in the country:
House Republicans from heavily suburban districts were particularly uneasy about the Bernanke remark and Perry's refusal to say whether President Barack Obama is a patriot. These members, some of them facing potentially tough reelection campaigns next year, urged the White House hopeful to stick to core issues of jobs and spending. 
'You can't be calling Bernanke a traitor and you can't be questioning whether or not Barack Obama loves America, that type of thing,' said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and veteran Long Island incumbent. 'I've been with Perry a few times, and I can see how he could project, again, if it's done the right way. But no, if he continues this, he'll have a tough time.'
Roskam sounded a similar note. 'I think he's got to make a decision largely around what's good for his family - his family comes up frequently in these conversations,' said the three-term Republican. 'But Paul Ryan is a real thought leader. His getting into the race changes the dynamic. A guy like Ryan sells in suburban Chicago.'
Others, however, were more supportive. Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, wrote in his syndicated column:
You could be mistaken for thinking that Perry set out from his infancy to trample on certain eastern sensibilities. Born in nowheresville Texas to a family of cotton farmers. An Eagle Scout. Attendance at Texas A&M, where he was a 'yell leader' - basically a male cheerleader - and in ROTC. After earning a degree in animal science and serving in the Air Force, he entered politics and eventually ascended to the governorship in the wake of another hated Texan - George W. Bush.
Perry makes Bush look like a sniveling elitist, what with his patrician, highly credentialed family. Perry went to Paint Creek Rural School in Haskell, Texas; Bush went to Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and then on to Yale and Harvard.
Perry is a great partisan of Texas and has mused about its leaving the union. He's an evangelical Christian who unembarrassedly prays in public and for his state. He's a tea partier who extols the Constitution and seeks a drastically limited federal government. He's a law-and-order conservative in a state that still executes people.
It'd be almost impossible to come up with a background and cluster of affiliations so provocative. Texas has all the negative charge for liberals that Massachusetts does for conservatives. Perry will be branded as a backward, dimwitted, heartless neo-Confederate. A walking, talking threat to the separation of church and state who doesn't realize people like him were supposed to slink away after the Scopes trial nearly 90 years ago.
The odd thing is, for all his posturing, Perry is actually considered a moderate by Texas Republican standards. Remember, this is a state where Ron Paul, who believes that NAFTA is part of a plot to force America into a European Union-style arrangement with Canada and Mexico, is regarded as a statesman. And it's true that Perry has been more of an old-school Whig, willing to open the revenue faucets on infrastructure and other business-friendly development, than a small-government purist. As the staunchly right-wing Web site The American Dream argued,
Supporters of Texas Governor Rick Perry are not going to like this article at all. Right now, Republicans all over the United States are touting Rick Perry as the "Republican messiah" that is going to come charging in to save America from the presidency of Barack Obama. Many believe that if Rick Perry enters the race, he will instantly become the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. Perry certainly looks the part and he knows how to give a good speech, but when ordinary Americans all over the country take a hard look at his record, they may not like what they see. The truth is that Rick Perry is a big-time globalist, he has raised taxes and fees in Texas numerous times, he has massively increased the size of government spending and government debt in Texas, he has been trying to ram the Trans-Texas Corridor down the throats of the Texas people and he tried to force young women all over Texas to be injected with the Gardasil vaccine. No, Rick Perry is not going to save America. In fact, he would likely be very, very similar to both Bush and Obama in a lot of ways.
...
#4 Rick Perry has spearheaded the effort to lease roads in Texas to foreign companies, to turn roads that are already free to drive on into toll roads, and to develop the Trans-Texas Corridor which would be part of the planned NAFTA superhighway system. If you really do deep research on this whole Trans-Texas Corridor nonsense you will see why no American should ever cast a single vote for Rick Perry.
#10 Rick Perry attended the Bilderberg Group meetings in 2007. Associating himself with that organization should be a red flag for all American voters.
But it's not just the tinfoil-hatters who have been criticizing Perry's Tea Party credentials. As the Texas Observer's Dave Mann noted in the New Republic,
For anyone who's closely followed Perry's tenure in Texas - as I have, covering the governor for The Texas Observer since 2003 - it's no secret that some of the state's conservatives and libertarians dispute his conservative credentials. It's true that Perry has trafficked heavily in anti-Washington rhetoric, especially in the run-up to his candidacy to become president. But the closer you look at Perry's record in Texas, the harder it is to discern any coherent ideology at all. When GOP primary voters in other parts of the country examine his signature legislative accomplishments and policy stances, some won't like what they find.
There's even been some backlash among the red-meat red state commentariat. Michelle Malkin wrote that
Texas, we have a problem. Your GOP governor is running for president against Barack Obama. Yet, one of his most infamous acts as executive of the nation's second-largest state smacks of every worst habit of the Obama administration. And his newly crafted rationalizations for the atrocious decision are positively Clintonesque. Trusting Rick Perry's tea party credentials is a perilous shot in the dark.
Not that the Tea Party is listening to Malkin: in an Aug. 16 Rasmussen poll, Perry took the plurality of Tea Party supporters - 39 percent to Michele Bachmann's second-place 21 percent.
Of course, stripped of its yee-haw bluster, Mr. Perry's comments are not all that different from the sort of positions we've heard from Bachmann, Herman Cain or even Mitt Romney. In other words, this isn't the Republican primary; it's the Tea Party primary, and the various candidates are struggling to understand the lay of the new course. Perry has simply been more brazen about it. Whether he moves into the pole position or fizzles out, his candidacy will have clarified just how far the right's center of gravity has tilted.
All of which means that the real winner, at least in the ideas primary, is Representative Ron Paul. As one of his aides said in an e-mail to Politico's Ben Smith after the dustup over Perry's anti-Bernanke comment, "Anyone who doesn't get Ron Paul's impact on the process or the fact he is gaining support in Iowa was sleeping through yesterday back and forth." 
Indeed, Representative Paul may have the last laugh in more ways than one. As he told a New Hampshire crowd, Rick Perry "makes me sound like a moderate."

HEADLINE: A Smattering of This Week's Food Links

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A smattering of food links for Aug. 19.

 BODY:
Slow Food USA is issuing the "$5 Challenge" to "take back the value meal." Want to participate? On Sept. 17, get together with family and friends and cook a "slow food meal" that costs no more than $5 per person. I've been saying it for years: cooking, even with great ingredients, can be soooo cheap.
Or if you prefer a slightly more strenuous brand of activism, from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16 there is a march from New York City to the White House to demand GMO labeling.
TERRIFIC post by Michele Simon: If safe, organic (or sustainable) animal products are too expensive to buy, eat less of them!
A study finds that obese people who are otherwise healthy live just as long as healthy skinny people and are actually less likely to die of cardiovascular causes. (There are skinny people who eat fast food every day, and obese people who eat fruits and vegetables every day. I'd rather be in the latter category.) And just a reminder, an adult is considered obese if his body-mass index (B.M.I.) is 30 or higher. See (roughly) how close or far you are here.
The E.U. is looking into private sector marketing techniques to improve public healthy eating campaigns. Speaking of private sector marketing: a "triple double" used to be a basketball term. Now it's a giant Oreo. And now that we're onto Oreos here's a primer on saturated fat from Marion Nestle.
Grocery cooperatives are booming.
Washing your spinach might not help much. Purdue University researchers say that salmonella and E. coli can live inside plant tissues. Oh boy.
Not so fun fact: It rained more in New York on Sunday than it has in Texas for the entire year. (It was the rainiest day on record for New York, and the worst one-year drought on record for Texas.)
Watching TV for six hours a day could shorten your life expectancy by five years! (Any studies that people know of about staring into computer screens? Not sure I want to know.)
Interesting NPR story: some economists say that the net effect of U.S. agricultural policy is to increase the price of food and thereby discourage obesity. Huh? Speaking of farm subsidy myths, here are nine more.
A farmer attending Obama's town hall in Atkinson, Ill., asked the president about potential farm restrictions that might hinder his business. Obama said, don't always believe what you hear; to find out what's really going on simply contact the U.S.D.A. A Politico reporter took Obama up on his suggestion and called the U.S.D.A. to see what he can find out about the farmer's question. Hilarity ensued.
Near-record food prices have compounded the famine in East Africa. About 29,000 children under five have died in Somalia in the last 90 days.
What's being called "the nation's first strictly vegan cafeteria" is opening at a college next week. Guess where. Berkeley? Nope. Tufts? Nah. University of North Texas? You got it. Don't tell the cattlemen.
McDonald's is embarking on a national listening tour to determine what its customers (here, mom "BlogHers") want. Listen in on the first one. (F.Y.I. this video is DEFINITELY not biased.)
If you haven't heard of the "30 Project" (or even if you have) watch this video. Very cool.

HEADLINE: For Some Banks, Prices Are Below 2008

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: For some banks, share prices are at or below the credit crisis lows.

 BODY:
Which banks don't you trust?
Share prices have plunged since mid-July for banks around the world as a result of all kinds of worries. For most, but not all, banks, the good news is that at least their prices are well above the lows they hit during the credit crisis in 2008 and 2009.
Here is the performance of some major banks, showing their stock price changes through early afternoon in the United States, from the low daily closing price in 2008 or 2009, and from the end of 2010. All figures are in local currencies, so they do not reflect currency changes.
Mizuho Financial, Japan: -24% from 2008-'09 low, -26% since the beginning of 2011
Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan, -16%, -24%
Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan, -8%, -20%
Credit Suisse, Switzerland, -4%, -42%
Credit Agricole, France, 0%, -36%
Bank of China, China, +4%, -9%
Commerzbank, Germany, +5%, -57%
Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan, +7%, -24%
Bank of New York Mellon, U.S., +7%, -36%
Societe Generale, France, +16%, -48%
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, +23%, -3%
UBS, Switzerland, +35%, -12%
Lloyds Bank, Britain, +42%, -57%
Banco Santander, Spain, +52%, -23%
UniCredit, Italy, +54%, -42%
Banco Paribas, France, +58%, -31%
Hang Seng Bank, Hong Kong, +61%, -15%
Nordea Bank, Sweden, +66%, -27%
HSBC, Britain, +68%, -22%
Morgan Stanley, United States, +76%, -40%
Deutsche Bank, Germany, +76%, -30%
Bank of America, United States, +122%, -48%
Citigroup, United States, +170%, -24%
Wells Fargo, United States, +191%, -24%
Barclays, Britain, +194%, -42%
The banks that scared us the most in 2008 and 2009, like Citigroup and Bank of America, have lost a lot of value this year, but at least they are way above the lows of the last crisis. But some major European banks are down to their old lows, and some Japanese banks have plunged to new lows.

HEADLINE: Obama Isn't the Only One to Take a Break

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The nation's top elected Republican is also off on holiday, but special criticism is always reserved for presidential vacations.

 BODY:
He left Washington in the midst of an economic crisis in the country. The stock market was plummeting. The jobs picture was worsening. And he started his vacation by playing golf.
No, not President Obama, although he started his vacation on Martha's Vineyard Thursday.
House Speaker John A. Boehner, the nation's top Republican, left Washington on Aug. 2, literally moments after Mr. Obama signed the debt-limit deal into law.
Since then? Some golf and a lot of fund-raising for himself and his Republican colleagues - but not a moment in Washington.
Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner's office, said that "the speaker took a few personal days back in Ohio right after the debt agreement, but has been and will be on the road the rest of the month helping out fellow Republicans."
Of course, being the speaker of the House is not the same as holding the White House, and presidents of both parties are often subject to criticism for the timing or location of their vacations - Mr. Obama has been receiving a great deal for both. His summer trips to Martha's Vineyard have come under attack for the past two summers, as did Bill Clinton's visits there. And George W. Bush was often criticized for the amount of time he spent away from the White House. 
And Mr. Boehner has not been one of the Republican voices criticizing the president's annual vacation. A scan of Mr. Boehner's tweets - from his speaker's office and his campaign office - finds no snarky asides about how Mr. Obama should stay in Washington rather than relaxing by the beach.
But neither has there been any indication that Mr. Boehner is dissatisfied with the organized effort by his fellow Republicans to embarrass Mr. Obama for going to the fashionable island for 10 days.
The Republican National Committee put up a Web site, obamagetaway.com, where visitors can create a postcard featuring one of 18 different pictures of the president at play - bowling, eating shave ice, playing basketball, or swimming with his shirt off.
"I shot a 39 on the front nine - matches my approval rating," one of the postcards says.
Other prominent Republicans, including a number of the presidential candidates, have not missed the opportunity as well. 
Mitt Romney said Thursday on a radio program that "if I were president today, I wouldn't be looking to go spend 10 days on Martha's Vineyard."
Mr. Romney added: "Now, Martha's Vineyard is in my home state of Massachusetts, so I don't want to say anything negative about people vacationing there. But if you're the president of the United States and the nation is in crisis - and we're in a jobs crisis right now - then you shouldn't be out vacationing. Instead, you should be focusing on getting the economy going again."
Interestingly, Mr. Romney often mentions that when he is not on the campaign trail, he spends most of his time at his vacation home in New Hampshire - an 11-acre estate on the banks of Lake Winnipesaukee.
Tim Pawlenty, who has dropped out of the Republican contest, took a swipe during the debate last week, saying that Mr. Obama "should cancel his Cape Cod vacation, call the Congress back into session and get to work on this."
And Newt Gingrich told Fox News host Sean Hannity that Mr. Obama "ought to cancel his vacation - period."
The White House has responded as it always does (and in general accordance with administrations past, of both parties). 
"I don't think Americans out there would begrudge that notion that the president would spend some time with his family," Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said. "There's no such thing as a presidential vacation. The presidency travels with you."
Bill Burton, a former deputy press secretary for Mr. Obama who now runs a large fund-raising group for Democrats, referred to the Republican criticism of the president's vacation and of Mr. Obama's recent three-day bus trip through the Midwest.
"Is there no one in the G.O.P. field big enough to say, actually, the president should have a secure bus and a couple days off?" Mr. Burton tweeted.

HEADLINE: Confidence in Obama, and in the Economy, Declines

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The broad decline in the president's approval ratings is evident in all demographic groups, including many that will be crucial to his re-election efforts.

 BODY:
Markets "go up and down," the White House press secretary Jay Carney noted this month. So do presidential approval ratings. But the trendline for President Obama has been poor.
His Gallup approval rating has twice fallen below 40 percent within the past week, a threshold he had previously avoided crossing. The trend has also been evident in other polls.
The drop in Mr. Obama's approval ratings has not been especially deep by historical standards. So far for the third quarter (which began July 1), his Gallup approval rating has averaged 43.3 percent as compared with 46.8 percent in the second quarter, a decline of 3.5 points. There have been 76 occasions in the past when a president's approval ratings have dropped by more than that from quarter to quarter. If Mr. Obama's approval ratings remain near the 40 percent mark or below for the rest of August and September, he has a chance to move up the list of historically significant declines. But so far this is within normal bounds.
If the decline in Mr. Obama's approval ratings is not especially deep, however, it is broad -- affecting essentially all demographic groups, including many that will be critical to his re-election efforts.
One way to study this is to calculate a trendline for each demographic group based on Gallup's weekly tracking averages since the start of 2011. This helps to smooth out the week-to-week fluctuations, which are intrinsically quite large when Gallup's data is broken into smaller sub-samples. (For instance, the margin of error on a weekly reading of Mr. Obama's approval rating among African-American voters is about plus or minus six percentage points.) 
The trendline for Mr. Obama's approval rating among voters aged 65 and older, for example, shows roughly a 7-point decline over this period: to 37 percent today, from 44 percent at the start of 2011.
Unfortunately for Mr. Obama, figures like these are quite common among many demographic groups. In the chart below, I've used this same method to track the magnitude of Mr. Obama's approval ratings decline among 27 groups that Gallup studies.
The trend for all 27 groups has been negative. And although the margins of error on this calculation (represented by the red bars in the chart) are fairly high, the decline has been statistically significant in 24 of 27 cases.
Three groups in particular stand out for having especially large declines. First is what Gallup terms "pure independent" voters, among whom Mr. Obama's approval rating has dropped by 10 points since the start of the year. These pure independents are true swing voters; Gallup defines the category to exclude the many voters who call themselves independent but in fact lean toward one or another party and behave like partisans. 
It should not be surprising that when Mr. Obama's approval rating declines, the decline will be especially steep with this group -- they are called swing voters for a reason, and their political views are often volatile. Still, this is an inauspicious group to be losing favor with if Mr. Obama wants to win another term.
Another group with whom Mr. Obama has experienced an alarmingly large decline are Hispanic voters -- also about 10 points since the start of the year. Although the margins of error on subsamples of Hispanic voters can be especially high because of language barriers and other issues, that could complicate Mr. Obama's efforts to win states like Colorado and Nevada.
Finally, Mr. Obama's approval ratings are down about 9 points with conservative Democrats. They are also a swing group to an extent: about 20 percent of conservative Democrats, and 37 percent of white conservative Democrats, voted for John McCain in 2008. And they are plentiful in states like Ohio.
Many black Democrats also identify as conservative. Mr. Obama has experienced an approval ratings decline of about 6 points since the start of the year with African-Americans -- larger than with white voters. Although it is not clear how many black voters would actually vote against Mr. Obama in November 2012, his approval ratings among black voters had been exceptionally resilient before now.
On the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Obama's approval ratings have barely declined with conservative Republicans. This is easy enough to explain: so few of them approved of his performance in the first place, there wasn't much more room for the numbers to fall.
Mr. Obama's approval rating decline has also been smaller than average -- about 3 points since the start of the year -- with liberal Democrats. Although many leading liberal voices were unhappy with the debt ceiling deal that Mr. Obama struck with Republicans this month (justifiably, in my view), this just isn't showing up in a big way among the liberal rank-and-file. 
One thing to keep in mind is that if most liberal Democrats had strongly approved of Mr. Obama's performance before, then a "downgrade" in their views of him might be toward less enthusiastic approval, rather than to outright disapproval. Although these liberal Democrats might not vote against Mr. Obama, less enthusiastic support could translate into reduced turnout, volunteerism and fund-raising for the president's re-election campaign. Nevertheless, analysts should be careful to distinguish the liberal blogosphere from liberal Democrats over all and furthermore from the Democratic base, which includes many voters who do not identify themselves as liberal.
Ultimately there is plenty of blame going around, with Democratic base groups and swing voters having come to view Mr. Obama more negatively.
This should not be surprising: the unhappiness with Mr. Obama is not a matter of small-bore, constituency-based politics. Instead, it revolves around more fundamental areas like the economy, questions about the efficacy of his leadership, and an overall gloominess about the direction of the country, issues which transcend demographic and partisan boundaries. Breaking down an approval ratings decline in this fashion can sometimes create the false impression that a president is dying by a thousand cuts, when his problems instead usually revolve around no more than two or three major issues.
The good news for Mr. Obama is that if the decline has been broad-based, an improvement in his numbers would probably have broad effects, too, particularly if it is driven by improved economic fundamentals. In the past, presidential approval ratings have had a reasonably strong tendency to revert toward the mean, particularly in a president's first term. 
For whatever reason, the autumn of a president's third year has often been kinder than the summer: Ronald Reagan's approval ratings began to turn positive in November 1983, while Bill Clinton's did in late September 1995. Mr. Reagan, however, was buoyed by an 8 percent annualized rate of economic growth in late 1983. 
Growth for Mr. Clinton was only ordinary -- about 3 percent in the latter half of 1995. But even that level is unlikely to be achieved in the next three to six months, according to most economists' forecasts.
At the same time, the relationship between the actual performance of the economy, Americans' perceptions about the economy and their views of the president are more nebulous than most analysts would acknowledge. 
There has been an extremely sharp decline in consumer confidence within the past four to five weeks, for example, while investor sentiment -- as evidenced by the volatile and mostly negative movement in the stock market -- has also turned dim. It seems likely that political events like the debt ceiling debate, and the S.&P. debt downgrade that followed, are responsible for this at least in part.
Fundamental data, however, has been more mixed and probably does not point on balance toward a recession. So Mr. Obama could see some improvement in his approval ratings -- say, back into the mid-40s -- if these sentiment-based measures snap more into line with the fundamentals. That would not put Mr. Obama in a great position, but he essentially would be where he was before, with a fighting chance of winning re-election against a good Republican nominee and reasonably strong chances against a poor one.
Or it may be that a lack of confidence in Mr. Obama -- as well as the Republicans in Congress -- will itself prove to be an impediment to recovery, and that these numbers could continue to erode. One does get the sense that we're nearing an inflection point.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths EDWARDS, CHARLES CORNELL

 BODY:
EDWARDS--Charles Cornell, M.D. Died at home in La Jolla, California, August 7, 2011, after a long illness. Born in Overton, Nebraska September 16, 1923, he grew up during dust storms, locust infestations, and the Great Depression. 
He began studies at Princeton in 1941, but after Pearl Harbor enrolled in the Navy's V-12 program, and transferred to the University of Colorado, where he earned his BA and MD. He completed an MS in surgery (University of Minnesota) and surgical fellowship at the Mayo Clinic. From 1950-1952, he served with the Marines on the front lines of the Korean War, after which he spent five years in private practice in Des Moines. In 1969 President Nixon appointed him Commissioner/U.S. Food & Drug Administration; and in 1971, he became Assistant Secretary for Health (Department of Health, Education, & Welfare). In 1975, he resigned citing Ford administration cuts to health care that adversely affected the poor and unemployed. He became president/CEO, Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation, La Jolla, in 1977 and oversaw a dramatic expansion into one of the largest employers in San Diego and a leading health care provider in California. He retired in 1993. A generous benefactor and strong proponent of philanthropy and community service, Dr. Edwards is survived by his wife of 66 years, Sue Kruidenier Edwards; children Timothy K. Edwards (Pat), Charles C. Edwards, Jr. (Karin), Nancy Edwards Schned (Eric), and David B. Edwards (Marketa); eight grandchildren; & cousin Cornell Arendt.

Payrolls climbed in 31 states in July, led by New York and Texas, while the jobless rate increased in 28, painting a mixed employment picture for last month.
Employers in New York increased their staffs by 29,400 workers, while those in Texas added 29,300, figures from the Labor Department showed Friday. Joblessness increased by 0.4 percentage point in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and South Carolina. Nevada continued to lead the nation in unemployment with a rate of 12.9 percent. 
Widespread job growth is needed to shore up incomes after spending among consumers ground to a halt in the second quarter. That raised concern that the world's largest economy was stalling. A Labor Department report on Aug. 5 showed employers added 117,000 workers to payrolls last month and the jobless rate fell to 9.1 percent.
''The overall labor market was doing better than previous months, but the bigger point is that it's a lot weaker than earlier in the year,'' Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto, said before the report. ''That's a concern given that any data from July won't reflect the market turmoil in the last couple of weeks that really could have prompted some businesses to postpone or cancel any hiring plans.''
After Nevada, the jobless rate was highest in California at 12 percent, and Michigan and South Carolina, both at 10.9 percent.
Payrolls in Michigan rose 23,000 and Tennessee gained by 14,300. They rounded out the top four states showing the biggest increase.
The biggest job losses last month occurred in Illinois, where employers cut payrolls by 24,900, and in Florida, which had a 22,100 decrease.
Over the last 12 months, six states lost jobs, including Indiana, Nevada, Kansas, Alabama, Georgia and Delaware.
The jobless rate in North Dakota, the lowest in the United States, increased to 3.3 percent from 3.2 percent in June.
While payroll growth picked up in July, employment prospects for Americans have dimmed compared with earlier in the year. Employers added 216,000 workers from May to July, compared with 646,000 in the previous three-month period.
The risk of a recession has risen to 30 percent from 14 percent in July, according to the median of the 39 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. A sell-off in stocks, government fiscal austerity and a lack of jobs will hurt American growth, which slowed to a 0.9 percent pace in the first half of 2011, the economists said.
State and local employment data are derived independently from the national statistics, which are typically released on the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller surveys, making the national figures more reliable, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

HEADLINE: Quake in Japan Causes Costly Shift to Fossil Fuels

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
YOKOSUKA, Japan -- The half-century-old, oil-fueled power generators here had been idle for more than a year when, a day after the nuclear accident in March, orders came from Tokyo Electric Power headquarters to fire them up.
''They asked me how long it would take,'' said Masatake Koseki, head of the Yokosuka plant, which is 40 miles south of Tokyo and run by Tokyo Electric. ''The facilities are old, so I told them six months. But they said, 'No, you must ready them by summer to prepare for an energy shortage.' ''
Now, at summer's peak, Yokosuka's two fuel-oil and two gas turbines are cranking out a total of 900,000 kilowatts of electricity -- and an abundance of fumes.
The generators are helping to replace the 400 million kilowatt-hours of daily electricity production lost this summer because of the shutdown of all but 15 of Japan's 54 nuclear reactors in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. Across the country, dozens of other fossil-fuel plants have been fired up, and Japan is importing billions of dollars worth of liquefied natural gas, coal and oil to keep them running. 
Japan, the world's third-largest user of electricity behind China and the United States, had counted on an expansion of nuclear power to contain energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, its nuclear program is in retreat, as the public and government officials urge a sharp reduction in the nation's reliance on nuclear power and perhaps an end to it altogether.
As its nuclear program implodes, Japan is grappling with a jump in fuel costs, making an economic recovery from the March earthquake and tsunami all the more difficult. Annual fuel expenses could rise by more than 3 trillion yen, or about $39 billion, the government says.
The country, until recently a vocal proponent of measures to curb climate change, is also leaving a bigger carbon footprint. According to government calculations, Japan's greenhouse gas emissions could rise by as much as 210 million metric tons, or 16 percent, by 2013 from 1990 levels if its nuclear reactors were shut permanently. Under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement on greenhouse gas emissions, Japan promised to reduce its emissions by 6 percent over that period.
''Can nuclear be eliminated?'' asked Adam Schatzker, an energy analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ''It's possible, but very costly.''
If necessary, Japan could replace the energy capacity lost in the shutdown of its nuclear fleet by increasing the use of natural gas and coal, Mr. Schatzker said. ''But even if fossil fuel facilities can make up for the loss of nuclear, it would likely take time, cost a great deal more money and pollute significantly,'' he said.
For resource-poor Japan, it is an energy shift of an unprecedented scale and speed. A generation ago, the oil shock of 1973, which exposed the country's overdependence on Middle Eastern oil, forced Japanese companies to focus on energy efficiency and prompted the government to invest heavily in nuclear power.
But as it doubled down on nuclear power plants, Japan was slow to develop alternative forms of energy, like solar or wind power, which account for just 1 percent of its electricity supply.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called for a gradual move away from nuclear energy, and proposed a goal of generating 20 percent of Japan's electricity from renewable sources, including hydroelectric plants, by the early 2020s. The Parliament is debating legislation to spur that change.
A nuclear-free future could come much sooner, however. Nervous local governments have blocked the restart of reactors idled for routine inspections, which occur every 13 months. If no reactors can restart, Japan's entire nuclear fleet, which provided 30 percent of its electricity in 2009, could be closed by spring.
The shutdowns are already causing an energy squeeze. At least three utilities have come close to full capacity during peak demand hours this summer. The government has warned that eastern Japan, including Tokyo, could face an electricity shortage of about 10 percent next summer if no nuclear plants are running.
A 10 percent shortage may not be disastrous. This summer, for example, a major energy-saving drive by households and companies drove down peak electricity demand in July by about 20 percent, to 46.3 million kilowatts, averting blackouts despite the energy shortfall, according to Tokyo Electric, the operator of the stricken Fukushima plant.
Still, ''we take this situation very seriously,'' Toshio Nishizawa, chief executive of Tokyo Electric, said this month. Only three of the company's 17 nuclear reactors are running.
A protracted increase in fossil fuel costs is possible to make up for the shortfall, traders say.
Japan's liquefied natural gas imports have jumped for three consecutive months, squeezing global supplies amid strong demand from China and other emerging economies. Imports of coal, which still accounts for 25 percent of Japan's energy, are also rising.
Analysts at RBC Capital Markets predict that in Japan, the world's largest importer of coal, coal-fired generation could climb as much as 20 percent, equivalent to 3 percent of global supply.
Last month, Japan's power utilities said they would raise electricity prices in September to make up for higher fuel costs.
Some businesses worry about the impact of a long-term energy deficit.
''We could see Japanese companies start to move overseas,'' Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of Sumitomo Chemical and head of Japan's largest business lobby, the Keidanren, told reporters last month. ''A prolonged energy shortage could harm business and investment.''
Meanwhile, the sharply higher energy costs are helping to undermine Japan's formerly rock-solid balance of trade, which swung into the red for three straight months after the earthquake as exporters struggled to restart production. The country's trade surplus for July was down 90 percent from a year earlier, on a combination of weak exports and rising energy imports.
Elon Musk, the American entrepreneur and founder of the electric car company, Tesla Motors, was in tsunami-stricken Soma late last month to donate $250,000 to build a solar farm there. He said that he saw potential for renewable energy in Japan, but that cumbersome regulations and government foot-dragging were holding the industry back.
''The cost of solar power has dropped in recent years, but government policy hasn't caught up to that,'' Mr. Musk said in a telephone interview.
One roadblock for renewable power in Japan has been the inability of producers to get an adequate price for their electricity on the market, where they must compete with cheaper power from coal, natural gas and nuclear power.
Lawmakers are debating a law that would require utilities to buy electricity from solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric and other renewable power sources, even if it means paying a premium. According to Japan's Trade Ministry, the move would raise average home electricity bills by about 200 yen (more than $2) a month.
''If we, as a society, are willing to pay more, this technology will most certainly spread,'' said Norihiro Okumura, an economist with the Tokyo-based Institute of Energy Economics. ''And though some in industry say this hurts competitiveness, renewable energy will create new businesses, too.''
Until then, the huge generators at the Yokosuka power plant will continue to pick up the slack, fumes notwithstanding.
''People once called this the No. 1 power plant in the Orient,'' Mr. Koseki said. ''We are back, doing what we can.''

HEADLINE: A Lawyer in Minnesota Challenges the Accuracy of D.W.I. Breath Tests

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
For nearly five years, the accuracy of drunken driven tests administered with a breath testing device used by Minnesota law enforcement agencies has been in question.
About 4,000 people in 69 Minnesota counties have challenged the results based on what they believe to be the device's faulty readings of blood-alcohol levels. The state has maintained that the breath test results are accurate and that those found to have been driving with alcohol levels above the legal limit should be punished.
This year, a judge ruled that although the device's source code contained errors, its shortcomings did not affect the accuracy of the results. The decision was appealed, and the case is before the Minnesota Supreme Court. Ryan Pacyga, a lawyer who represents nearly 200 of the people accused of drunken driving, and who are now challenging the results, discusses. 
Q Please describe what is at issue with this device.
A The machine is called the Intoxilyzer 5000EN. It is manufactured by a Kentucky company that sold the machines to Minnesota law enforcement. It uses infrared technology to measure particulate matter, and then uses a mathematical formula to convert it to what the blood-alcohol level would be. That's because our law in Minnesota says it's illegal to have a blood-alcohol content of .08 or more, so any test other than blood -- like breath and urine -- has to use a conversion rate to convert the reading into its blood-alcohol equivalent. The machine is somewhat antiquated -- akin somewhat to an old Atari machine game console. There is a lawyer in the state who got the idea we should ask for the source codes for these machines, which are software updates that from time to time the manufacturer sends out. At times, Minnesota has installed the source codes. At times, it has not. That's problem No. 1. Problem No. 2 is we want to test the source codes themselves because it is the source code that is the accuser, not the officer. Some judges started granting our requests to test the source code. Some said it was irrelevant. Prosecutors said, ''We don't have access to the source codes.'' And then the manufacturers said they weren't going to release the source code because it was akin to Coca-Cola's secret formula.
Q How long do you believe there has been a problem with the Intoxilyzer, and what made people start looking into it?
A The suspicion is that this probably started a long time ago. The more air you blow into the machine, the higher the alcohol rate it registers. You have officers saying, ''Blow harder. Blow harder,'' as people are blowing into these machines. I've seen it happen time and again. In some cases, if you didn't blow enough air into a machine you get what is called a ''deficient sample,'' which is qualified as a refusal. A refusal takes a harsher punishment in Minnesota.'' [Note: The state and the manufacturer dispute that blowing harder is linked to higher readings.] I've handled over 1,000 D.W.I.'s in the last seven years and always look at the breath volume and compare the two samples [tests consist of two breaths into the Intoxilyzer]. I've seen this. I don't know whether it could be tested or if it's been tested. It's kind of anecdotal. The other thing is this machine uses a control -- a simulated solution control that is usually between a .078 and .082 when it is put into the machine. When the machine does the ''control'' and ''replicate,'' I often see that, despite knowing the control is a given value, the machine measures it higher, or lower. The point is that it knows what the control is, and it still isn't measuring it right. The state says it's within an acceptable limit. It may be acceptable to the state, but if you are a defendant, it's not so cool.
Q How many cases are involved here?
A Over all, tens of thousands of tests probably over five or six years. A lot of lawyers never challenged the tests. We're probably down to around 4,000 now. I've got over 160 people myself. My understanding is that is the second largest group in the state.
Q Why is this issue important?
A In some form or other, everyone involved in this is fighting for their lives. Someone who drives as part of a job -- a truck driver, someone who makes deliveries, a traveling salesman -- they're going to lose that job. They've had training for their jobs and that's all the training they have, and especially in this economy, their prospects for employment are not good. There are mechanics, they have to test-drive cars. They're out of work. There are also background checks for white-collar workers. There's not a lot of tolerance for a D.W.I. A lot of people are getting screened out because employers think if you have a D.W.I., you must be an alcoholic.

HEADLINE: 9/11's White Elephant

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
There is nothing wrong -- and much that is right -- with building a national monument to memorialize the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 9/11 attacks a decade ago. The awful events of that day traumatized the country -- and changed it. The dead deserve to be remembered. Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.
What I do want to suggest, though, is that what's being built in the name of 9/11 -- a staggering $11 billion worth of government-sponsored construction on the 16 acres we now call ground zero -- is an example of just about everything wrong with modern government. When the World Trade Center site is finally completed, it will include a state-of-the-art train station whose cost overruns have surpassed $1 billion. The 9/11 memorial itself, which covers the footprint of the former twin towers, was so far behind schedule that it is now being hastily constructed, out of sequence, so that it will be ready by the 10th anniversary of the tragedy. 
And then there's 1 World Trade Center, scheduled to be completed in 2013, which will add 2.6 million square feet of office space in a city that doesn't need it, at a cost so high that it will be a cash drain for decades to come. Where's the Tea Party when you need them?
Last year, I wrote about 1 World Trade Center, pointing out that its $3.3 billion price tag made it, by far, the most expensive office building ever constructed in America. At the time, Richard Gladstone, the project manager for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is in charge of rebuilding ground zero, told me point-blank that despite its costs, the new skyscraper would not affect the commuters who pay the tolls to cross the six bridges and tunnels the agency operates.
But, on Friday, that statement was shown to be -- how to put this nicely? -- untrue. The Port Authority, with the complicity of Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie, the governors of New York and New Jersey, who oversee the agency, approved a series of toll increases so onerous that by 2015, a typical commuter who uses the George Washington Bridge will have to pay $62.50 a week to get to work.
What has been especially galling has been the cynicism surrounding the efforts to get the toll increases. First, the Port Authority said that unless it could increase the tolls, it would have to ''slow or stop'' the construction of 1 World Trade Center. Though this scenario was highly unlikely, it got the construction unions duly aroused, as it was intended to do. They began calling in favors among the politicians.
The Port Authority was originally going to propose two increases of $2, spaced a few years apart. But the politicos in both Cuomo's and Christie's offices suggested that the agency come forth with a much higher initial toll increase -- thus allowing the two governors to look like heroes when they ''persuaded'' the Port Authority to lower the increases. The governors also railed on about waste and fraud at the Port Authority, while knowing full well the real problem was the fact that $3.3 billion -- money that could have been spent on needed infrastructure improvements -- was instead diverted to a white elephant at ground zero.
I understand that it's hard, even for a blunt-talking fiscal conservative like Christie, to openly criticize 1 World Trade Center. For many people, its rebuilding has enormous symbolic importance. George Pataki, the former New York governor, who pushed hardest for the rebuilding, originally named the building Freedom Tower. Recent editorialsin the New York tabloidsobjecting to the toll increases nevertheless tiptoed gingerly around the outrageous costs of 1 World Trade Center.
But despite the shroud of patriotism that its supporters have always cloaked it in, it's really just a big, fancy office building. An office building with such poor economics that it will soak New Jersey and New York commuters for decades to come. An office building only the government could love.
Lately, supporters of the project have begun saying that its economics have improved. They point to the fact that Conde Nast, the publishing giant, has agreed to be the anchor tenant. What they fail to point out is that Conde Nast's rent is less than half the break-even cost of the 1 million square feet it will occupy. In other words, a company that publishes high-end magazines aimed at rich people will be getting an enormous government subsidy for the foreseeable future.
And who will be paying for that subsidy? The mailroom attendants who use the Lincoln Tunnel to get to work. The middle-class New Jersey-ites who use the George Washington Bridge. The firefighters and police officers who live in Staten Island. Thus, in the name of 9/11, does New York and New Jersey place another economic burden on the already overburdened middle class. How sad.

HEADLINE: Yesterday's Computer

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF and IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
Although the world is dependent on personal computers, making them has not been a great business for most American companies for almost a decade.
The announcement on Thursday by Hewlett-Packard that it was considering offloading its PC business, even though it is the undisputed worldwide market leader, was a clear sign of the difficulties.
If H.P. goes through with the idea, it would follow I.B.M., an early PC maker, which was one of the first to recognize the long-term problems and, in 2005, sold its business to Lenovo, a Chinese company. Other American makers like Compaq (acquired by H.P.), Gateway and Packard Bell were absorbed by others or just faded away. Depending on how H.P. sheds the unit -- it could sell or spin it off as a separate company -- only two American PC makers would remain.
One of them, Dell, struggles for every percentage point of market share. 
The other, Apple, prospers. And the reason it does highlights the shift from a PC-centric era to one dominated by smartphones and tablets. H.P., Dell and, indeed, every PC maker worldwide, has been unable to make a tablet consumers feel they must have. At the same time H.P. said that it might spin off PCs, it killed off its tablet, the TouchPad, after just a few weeks on store shelves.
Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, according to IDC, a research firm. Tablets, in contrast, are flying off store shelves. Global sales are expected to more than double this year to 24.1 million, according to Forrester Research. More than two-thirds of those tablets, however, are sold by Apple. Sales of its iPad pulled in $9 billion in just the first half of the year, or 30 percent more than all of Dell's consumer PC business in the same period. The joke in Silicon Valley is that there is no tablet market, only an iPad market. (That was also true of Apple and the iPod market.)
The other observation that is no joke: Apple is the only maker with strong PC growth. Spending on desktops and laptops grew 16 percent in the latest quarter, while Dell's consumer product sales increased 1 percent.
''It's definitely weighing on the computer makers, and it is something that will weigh on them for some time,'' said Louis Miscioscia, an analyst with Collins Stewart.
''The tablet effect is real,'' said Leo Apotheker, H.P.'s chief executive, in an interview on Thursday, acknowledging that the TouchPad had failed to live up to expectations and that it would have cost too much to compete. ''It's very different from where the business was going 10 years ago,'' Mr. Apotheker said.
On Friday, H.P.'s shares fell 20 percent in reaction to his plans.
Michael S. Dell, Dell's chief executive, took the opportunity to poke fun at the prospect of H.P. unloading its PC unit by saying in a message on Twitter that ''they're calling it a separation, but it feels like a divorce.'' Following up with more sarcasm, he said, ''If HP spins off its computer business ... maybe they will call it Compaq.''
Mr. Dell was clearly enjoying the moment, but his company faces the same market forces as H.P. Its overall PC business has been flat. Recently, Dell has pared back some of its consumer products, including a 5-inch Streak tablet, while keeping a 7-inch tablet. Together, they eked out barely 1 percent of the market, according to ABI Research.
Like H.P., Dell is pushing its enterprise business, which has higher margins. But David Johnson, Dell's senior vice president of corporate strategy, said his company had no plans to follow in H.P.'s footsteps and split off its PC business. ''We have no plans to change our strategy,'' he said.
Tablets remain the hope of other PC makers and phone makers. By next year, tablet sales in the United States will outpace those of netbooks, the mini-laptops people use to surf the Web, according to Forrester Research. Netbooks were considered a salvation for the PC industry when they were introduced a few years ago, but they have since fallen out of favor with consumers.
But buyers see little need to buy any tablet other than iPad, even if it is slightly more expensive than some of its rivals, analysts said.
''The performance still isn't there for a lot of them,'' said Richard Doherty, research director for the Envisioneering Group, a market research and consulting firm. ''And it's not just the product, it's the ecosystem behind it.''
For that matter, selling tablets is no easier for the smartphone makers. Motorola Mobility, which Google said this week that it would buy, got nowhere with its Xoom. Research in Motion entered the tablet market this spring with a long history of building mobile devices. Still, the company has struggled to get consumers to buy its tablet, the PlayBook, which it introduced earlier this year.
RIM says it shipped 500,000 PlayBooks during its last fiscal quarter. Kevin Burden, a vice president at ABI Research, estimated that only 40 to 50 percent of those tablets found buyers.
Shoppers were not charmed by the PlayBook's inability to directly check corporate e-mail -- they have to connect wirelessly to BlackBerry phones -- and lack of applications.
RIM's strength was selling to institutions, not individuals, but even here the changing market buffeted the maker. Most corporations have no idea if their employees need to use tablets at work. But even before the I.T. departments work that one out, employees decide that tablets are like phones and buy them at their own expense. So RIM's insider status has become somewhat meaningless since the purchasing decision effectively becomes a consumer choice.
''RIM was hoping that its relationships with I.T. departments was going to open the door to the PlayBook,'' Mr. Burden said. ''But the tablet decision has gone back to the users instead.''
Alan Panezic, RIM's vice president for enterprise product management and marketing, acknowledged that many companies make employees choose, and pay for, their tablets.
''This is an area that's still developing, to be honest,'' Mr. Panezic said. ''There's obviously a wonderful benefit for businesses if workers are going to supply their own computers.''
But that may change if corporations decide that tablets are an important work tool, he said. While most employees are now willing to spend $50 to $200 to buy smartphones, which are subsidized by carriers, many of them may balk at spending $500 or more for a tablet.
Given RIM's close association with e-mail, the initial inability of the PlayBook to handle it without a BlackBerry surprised many industry observers. Mr. Panezic said that some would-be corporate customers had effectively told RIM to come back once the feature was added.
Over the next couple of months, Apple will face yet another wave of competition. Sony says it will introduce tablets, while Amazon.com is expected to sell a tablet this fall that builds on the success of its Kindle e-book reader. Google continues to hone its Android operating system for tablets. Future generations of tablets running Android could help myriad PC and phone makers challenge Apple's domination in tablets as Android phone makers challenge Apple's iPhone.
Of all Apple's existing rivals, Samsung has made the most inroads with its Galaxy Tab. However, the company, which also makes PCs and other electronics, remains a distant second in the tablet race with a 12.5 percent market share.
Gavin Kim, a vice president for Samsung Mobile, said Samsung would continue trying to make its tablet better and fill gaps in the market. Tablets are a critical part of the company's overall strategy, he said.
''Nothing from our perspective says we need to be letting off the gas,'' Mr. Kim said.

 BODY:
DID the American economy hit the brakes this summer?
That possibility was raised this week by the abrupt fall in an economic indicator that normally receives little attention but that fell unexpectedly to a level that in the past has signaled a recession had either begun or was about to do so. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its monthly business outlook survey of manufacturers in its region found that only 14.7 percent of them thought business was improving, while 45.4 percent thought conditions were worsening. As a result, the index , calculated by subtracting negative responses from positive ones, fell to minus 30.7. In July it had been a positive 3.2
The index has been around since 1968, and during that time there has been a recession every time it fell below minus 30, as can be seen in the accompanying chart.
The Philadelphia Fed survey also asks about various aspects of business. The figures for current shipments and for new orders also fell into negative territory.
''The most troubling part is the decline in new orders,'' said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist for Moody's Analytics. ''Sentiment is so fragile now that businesses could be hunkering down.''
In the survey, 45.4 percent of companies reported business conditions were getting worse, compared with just 24.3 percent in July. The 21.1 percentage point increase was one of the sharpest moves ever for the index, and the worst since the number reporting deteriorating conditions rose 25.9 percentage points in October 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to a credit crisis and turned a relatively mild recession into a severe one.
Michael Trebing, a senior economic analyst at the Philadelphia Fed, cautioned that the survey responses were received between Aug. 8 and 16, a period of extreme volatility in the stock market caused in part by a decision by Standard & Poor's to downgrade the credit rating of the United States. He said it was possible that news background contributed to the negative responses from companies.
Several regional Federal Reserve Banks conduct similar surveys, but most have not yet released August figures. The New York Fed's survey also came out this week. It also showed a decline into negative territory, but the move was not as large.
The Philadelphia index is based on a survey of 150 companies in Delaware, southern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
Manufacturing is no longer the primary driver of the American economy, and of course that region might not be typical of the entire country. But manufacturing has been a strength of the recovery that began in the summer of 2009, and the new report adds to growing evidence that the sector's recovery is losing steam.

HEADLINE: Folk Art Museum Considers Closing

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
The financial picture has grown so bleak at the American Folk Art Museum that its trustees are considering whether to shut it down and donate its collections to another institution, said a person involved in the discussions, who requested anonymity because the talks are confidential.
No final decision has been made, and members of the folk museum's staff are said to be lobbying to keep it going in some form. But the museum's leadership has been in talks with the Smithsonian Institution for several months about possibly acquiring the collection in conjunction with the Brooklyn Museum. 
A decision to dissolve the museum and transfer its collection would require the approval of both the New York State attorney general's office and the State Department of Education. The attorney general's office would consider, among other things, whether the transfer would put New York State residents at a disadvantage.
Even if ownership of the collection were transferred to the Smithsonian, one possibility being discussed is to have the Brooklyn Museum display some of it long term, making it still accessible to New Yorkers. The folk art museum has one of the country's finest collections of American folk art, including some 5,000 quilts, paintings and functional objects like weathervanes. But it has long been plagued by serious financial problems.
A decade ago the museum borrowed $32 million, in the form of bonds, to finance the construction of an impressive building on West 53rd Street in Manhattan, designed by the architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. In 2009, after suffering substantial investment losses in the financial crisis, the museum defaulted on its debt, and in May the trustees decided to sell the building to the Museum of Modern Art, down the block, in order to pay off the debt.
But the sale of the building for $31.2million, while covering the debt, did not leave the museum with any extra cash. And it left, if anything, an even more difficult conundrum for the museum about how to move forward.
The museum still has a small, 5,000-square-foot space in Lincoln Square, at Columbus Avenue near 66th Street, where it could continue mounting small shows if the trustees felt that it could sustain the costs of keeping a staff and paying to store, conserve and insure the collection. The museum remains open at that location these days, and admission is free. The building on West 53rd Street is closed.
The museum's president, Laura Parsons, said of the current situation: ''The board took the first step of discharging its obligations to the bondholders -- the next step is to determine what the best outcome for the museum and the art is.''
Ms. Parsons declined to go into greater detail, saying that the discussions were confidential.
Compared with the Brooklyn Museum, which has had to make hard choices in recent years about what parts of its own enormous holdings to keep, the Smithsonian would appear to have greater resources to take care of the folk collection. But there will most likely be pressure to keep some of the collection in New York, making a loan arrangement with the Brooklyn Museum appealing.
A spokeswoman for the Smithsonian Institution was on vacation and could not be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for the Brooklyn Museum, Sally Williams, said that the museum's director, Arnold Lehman, was out of town and that she had not been briefed on any discussions.
The folk art museum has suffered considerable bad fortune over the years. For example, its former chairman, Ralph O. Esmerian, promised to donate his collection of folk art, including a version of Edward Hicks's ''Peaceable Kingdom,'' but Mr. Esmerian also put the painting up as collateral against money he owed, and in 2008 it was put up for auction. In July Mr. Esmerian, who is no longer on the board, was sentenced to six years in prison for fraud.
The Museum of Modern Art has said that it does not know yet what it plans to do with the folk museum building. The museum sits between MoMA's building and the site of a high-rise being planned by Hines, the real estate developer, which will include multiple floors of galleries for MoMA. One possible plan would be to tear down the folk art museum's building to allow MoMA to make maximum use of the space.
In addition to its holdings of folk art, the folk museum has a collection of outsider art, including several thousand drawings, books and related material by Henry Darger.
The museum has lost several top employees since its financial problems started a few years ago. Brooke Davis Anderson, who was in charge of the museum's collection of outsider art, departed last year for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The museum's executive director, Maria Ann Conelli, left this year.
The folk art museum's situation is a stark warning of what can happen when a museum overreaches in constructing a new home. Founded in 1961, the museum survived some early near-death experiences. When it decided to build a permanent home, it engaged high-profile architects and borrowed the $32 million by issuing bonds through New York City's Trust for Cultural Resources, a public benefit corporation that helps major cultural institutions borrow money for capital projects.
Some critics have attributed the museum's troubles to its architecture, saying that it was unwelcoming and did not display the art and artifacts attractively. To be sure, the museum never drew the crowds it had projected in estimates made during the planning process, or received enough contributions to support its interest payments. It was the first institution that borrowed through the trust to default on its debt.

HEADLINE: Uncertainty in Courthouse Fogs the View at the Stadium

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
It is a sad state of affairs when the big events are being played in courtrooms rather than ballparks. But that is the plight of the Mets, who are trying to stay competitive on the field and solvent off the field.
The suited representatives of the House of Wilpon were in court Friday afternoon -- always a fun way to start a summer weekend -- while the uniformed arm was at the Mets' home in Queens. 
The immediate result was that the creepy smile of Bernard L. Madoff continues to leer at the owners the same way the dark rain cloud loomed over Citi Field at game time. Madoff has been hanging over this franchise since December 2008, when he was arrested for running a Ponzi scheme that has terribly harmed the owners, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz.
On Friday, with stormy weather in the vicinity, the Mets were trying to stay relevant against the Milwaukee Brewers, the first-place team in the Central Division. The franchises were whooshing past each other in opposite directions, the small-television-market Brewers six and a half games ahead in the Central Division, the major-market Mets 20 1/2games behind in the East.
On Friday afternoon, in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Judge Jed S. Rakoff said he would continue to study the $1 billion claim by Irving H. Picard, the trustee for many of Madoff's victims.
Thus concluded another crummy week for the Mets. Last Tuesday, in a unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit backed the trustee's claim that Wilpon and Katz had been among the ''net winners'' in the Madoff machinations and that they owed other victims at least $300 million.
Judge Rakoff left the impression Friday that he could dismiss some claims against the Mets but could still hold a trial next March. That could put pressure on the Mets' owners to settle as close to $300 million as they can, but make no mistake, none of this is good for the Mets.
Even $300 million would be a huge blow to the owners, who have agreed to sell a third of the franchise for $200 million to David Einhorn, a hedge-fund operator based in Milwaukee. However, that deal has not been completed, raising many questions about what happens next if this case drags on.
The Mets would seem to have limited resources to restock the franchise. And if the House of Wilpon should sell the franchise, and Einhorn is not in place, the current shaky economy would suggest there are not a ton of prospective owners who could shore up a fading franchise.
The lack of a clear path toward settlement means that indecision could hang over the Mets during the off-season when they would like to have clarity about how much they can afford for free agents.
Up to now, the Mets have showed more zip than in recent years, perhaps traceable to Terry Collins, the peppery little manager who works the dugout, communicates with the players, and generally maintains an upbeat mood. Given the economic dark clouds, this is no small thing to say about a bunch of players who are not totally unaware of the legal problems. Now it is up to Collins to keep the Mets scrapping.
''When you play a first-place team, you have to get fired up,'' Collins said before the game. At one point the Mets won five straight games and had a 55-51 record and a few die-hards were even raving about possibly contending for the wild-card berth. However, this being the Mets' 50th season, old-line fans are conditioned to reality, which is that the world is harsh and rewards are infrequent.
''They're coming in here seeing how we are decimated by injuries and they think they can feast off us,'' Collins said, not so much about the Brewers but the entire league. ''It's my job to make sure it doesn't happen,'' he added.
Perhaps their most stirring game came Aug. 8, when not one but two of their top hitters, Jose Reyes and Daniel Murphy, were placed on the disabled list. The Mets fell four runs behind, then scored twice in the eighth and three more times in the ninth for a 9-8 victory over San Diego, touching off a raucous celebration.
Reyes's re-injured hamstring still does not permit him to make turns around the bases but the Mets had a 60-63 record going into the Brewers series.
Given the gloom and doom available to them in the news media, the players have done admirably so far this season. The players know they are still in the major leagues and their checks are clearing, so life is good. But it is never a good sign when a franchise has a split-squad doubleheader -- players at the ballpark, lawyers in court.

HEADLINE: More Women Behind Bars

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Mexico's Drug War, Feminized'' (news analysis, Sunday Review, Aug. 14) struck an emotional chord, illustrating that the war on drugs is being waged against women and families on both sides of the border. 
Karla Solorio spoke for countless women in Mexico and the United States who have ended up in prison because of drug violations when she said: ''I'm not someone with a family. I'm just a prisoner.''
Because of the war on drugs, fathers are absent from many neighborhoods, and now mothers are behind bars in shocking numbers as well. Who, then, is taking care of our children?
We need widespread drug policy reform to stop the violence, mass incarceration and devastating loss of lives and liberty. Women must use their voices to speak out to end this global destruction for the sake of all of our children.
GRETCHEN BURNS BERGMAN Spring Valley, Calif., Aug. 15, 2011
The writer is co-founder and executive director of A New PATH (Parents for Addiction Treatment and Healing).
To the Editor:
The recent spike in Mexico's female prison population mirrors the same trend in the United States. Women are the fastest-growing segment of the American prison population, increasing by 757 percent between 1977 and 2004.
Research has helped us develop an understanding of women's pathways to crime, and it is likely that Mexican women in prison also have histories of trauma and abuse, high rates of substance abuse and mental illness, and limited social and economic resources.
These trends have profound consequences for the women, their communities and their families, particularly since the majority of women in prison are mothers who are the primary caregivers for their children when they are incarcerated.
For women on either side of the border, evidence-based interventions and alternatives to incarceration are the best way to truly address the factors in women's lives that lead to crime and are more likely to reduce the propensity for repeat offenses.

PERSON: Leon J. Schipper 

HEADLINE: Leon Schipper, 64, Physicist and Iconoclast

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Leon J. Schipper, a physicist whose passion for data led him to question the value of popular energy policies, like government subsidies for ethanol and for electric cars and the ''cash for clunkers'' program, died Tuesday in Berkeley, Calif. He was 64.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he had worked for more than 20 years. 
Dr. Schipper, who was known as Lee, held a bachelor's degree in music and a Ph.D. in astrophysics, both from Berkeley, but he specialized in energy efficiency and transportation energy and was often a critic of the conventional wisdom.
For example, in his view the 2009 ''cash for clunkers'' program -- which offered rebates of up to $4,500 to people who bought a new car that got better mileage than their old one -- did little to save energy. In many cases, he found, buyers were using the rebate money to buy something bigger and more high-powered than they would have otherwise. ''The effect is inverse of what we were hoping for,'' he said.
Analyzing the Chevy Volt, the new sedan that is supposed to go 40 miles on batteries and then use a gasoline engine, he calculated that because of inefficiencies in electricity generation, its fuel economy was no better than a Toyota Prius hybrid running on gasoline, while its price was roughly double that of the Prius.
''Does the extra $20,000 justify the overall fuel and possible carbon dioxide savings?'' he asked. ''If two drivers switched to Prius, the overall savings of oil likely would be larger than one driver switching to a Volt, for the same money.''
Ethanol, he complained, probably did not reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by much, and would never become a major source of transportation energy unless it could be competitive with oil on an unsubsidized basis.
John P. Holdren, President Obama's science adviser, said that when he set up the Energy and Resources Program at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1973, Dr. Schipper was his first hire.
''He was one of the first people to point out that people don't want to consume energy,'' Dr. Holdren said, ''they want to consume energy services, like transportation, comfortable rooms, cold beer and so forth. And that there was an enormous variation in the amount of energy needed to perform those services.''
In addition to his work in the field of energy, Dr. Schipper mastered the haiku-like prose of letters to the editor, which requires making complicated points in about three sentences, and had 15 of them published in The New York Times over a 36-year period, mostly on energy.
In one letter in July 2008, he argued that the government should help the poor insulate their homes, rather than helping pay their energy bills. ''Shelling out money every year for more waste is not cool,'' he wrote. ''Why not provide comfort in the long run instead?''
Leon Jay Schipper was born April 7, 1947, in Santa Monica, Calif.
In 1976, between the first and second international oil shocks, he published an influential paper in the journal Science pointing out that Sweden consumed far less energy per unit of economic activity than the United States did. The paper helped establish his reputation as an energy analyst.
He was a Fulbright scholar at the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics in Stockholm in 1977-78, and was fluent in Swedish and also spoke French and German, his family said.
From 1995 to 2001, Dr. Schipper was a senior scientist at the International Energy Agency in Paris. He was the founder of the World Resources Institute's center for sustainable transport, called Embarq. At his death, Dr. Schipper was a project scientist for the Global Metropolitan Studies Initiative at the University of California, Berkeley, and senior research engineer for the Precourt Energy Efficiency Center at Stanford University.
Dr. Schipper is survived by his wife, Agneta; two daughters, Lisa Schipper of Berkeley and Julia Schipper of Washington; and a sister, Amy Schipper-Howe, of Boise, Idaho.
Dr. Schipper, who played the vibraphone, led an amateur musical group that played at scientific conferences on reducing the impact of global warming. It was called Lee Schipper and the Mitigators.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Report Finds 'Vast Improvement' at the City's Beaches

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
It may not be this summer's most gripping beach read, but a civic organization's new 27-page report should bring smiles to New York's swimmers and sunbathers.
The report, by the century-old organization New Yorkers for Parks, says the city's municipal beaches have shown a ''vast improvement'' since its last survey two years ago, with beaches like Orchard Beach in the Bronx and South Beach on Staten Island rated excellent for maintenance of their sand, boardwalks, bathrooms and drinking fountains. Two of the city's most popular beaches, Coney Island and Rockaway, were rated very good.
''The news is overwhelmingly good,'' the report said. ''The city's beaches have shown extraordinary progress since the first Report Card on Beaches in 2007.'' 
Still, the report, to be released Monday, found that even at relatively shipshape beaches like Orchard, some bathrooms lacked hand towels and dryers, and stall doors could not be locked. Over all, at the seven municipal beaches surveyed, one of every five drinking fountains was found to be unusable because of insufficient water pressure or broken spigots.
Only one beach, the relatively little-used Wolfe's Pond on Staten Island, received an undesirable rating of ''challenged'' -- largely for the absence of signs warning beachgoers not to swim in areas without lifeguards.
No beach was rated unsatisfactory, as two beaches had been in the 2009 and 2007 reports. The city opened an eighth beach, Cedar Grove on Staten Island, in 2011 but it was not included in the survey, which was taken during the 2010 beach season, with spot checks this summer to confirm the findings. Issues like water quality and sewage, which closed four beaches for a time in late July after a fire at a Harlem sewage plant, were not addressed.
Alyson Beha, director of research, planning and policy for New Yorkers for Parks, attributed the improvement to the city's aggressive response to the findings of its earlier reports. But officials at the Parks and Recreation Department chose to emphasize the hard work of its staff on often-steaming days, a system of supervision that requires regular detailed inspections reports and investment by the city.
In interviews, Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, and his first deputy for operations, Liam Kavanagh, cited factors like a roughly 50 percent increase since 2002 in mechanized rakes and sifters, including a tractor-driven machine adapted from a potato-digger. At Coney Island and Rockaway, $30 million has been spent on boardwalk repair, some of it money from the federal economic stimulus. And in Brooklyn, workers wearing ''glass patrol'' T-shirts have been collecting glass from beachgoers and reminding people about the dangers of broken glass.
Mr. Benepe disputed the findings about Wolfe's Pond, saying most of the park was a pristine natural area not meant for swimming. He said the central stretch where swimming is permitted has lifeguards and is well maintained, as the report found.
The improvement in South Beach was notable; in 2009, it was rated unsatisfactory. The 2011 report gave it a score of 99 out of 100, the highest of all seven beaches, which the report said indicated significant capital investment by the city. The sandy beach itself was free of litter and shards of glass, which was not the case in 2009. Toilets, sinks and water fountains were working. Orchard Beach and Staten Island's Midland Beach also received excellent ratings.
The category in which improvement was most palpable was in the cleanliness and safety of the ''shoreline,'' the actual strips of sand. In 2007 and 2009, beaches received poor ratings in that category because litter and broken glass were commonplace, entrances were unsafe and dunes unprotected.
''The remarkable improvement across six out of seven beaches suggests that targeted maintenance and capital investments have resulted in significantly cleaner and safer beaches,'' the report said.
The survey, which did not include beaches managed by the federal government, was conducted by four trained workers that the organization hired; they divided beaches into 50-foot-wide sections, randomly choosing 10 percent of those to inspect. They checked every bathroom and drinking fountain.

HEADLINE: Year Packed With Weather Disasters Has Brought Economic Toll to Match

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
The weather this year has not only been lousy, it has been as destructive in terms of economic loss as any on record.
Normally, three or four weather disasters a year in the United States will cause at least $1 billion in damages each. This year, there were nine such disasters. They included the huge snow dump in late January and early February on the Midwest and Northeast, the rash of tornadoes this spring across the Midwest and the more recent flooding of the Missouri and Souris Rivers. The disasters were responsible for at least 589 deaths, including 160 in May when tornadoes ripped through Joplin, Mo.
These nine billion-dollar disasters tie the record set in 2008, according to a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The total damage done by all storms, tornadoes, flooding and heat waves so far this year adds up to about $35 billion. The National Climatic Data Center says it estimates the costs in terms of dollars and lives that would not have been incurred had the event not taken place. Insured and uninsured losses are included in damage estimates and are likely to change as assessments become more complete. With four months to go in 2011, this year's total amount of damage is likely to rise. Forecasters are already predicting further meteorological mayhem as hurricane season intensifies. 
Over the last 30 years, there have been about 108 natural disasters that have caused $1 billion in damages each, according to NOAA. The total damage from all natural disasters since 1980 is about $750 billion.
''The increasing impacts of natural disasters, as seen this year, are a stark reminder of the lives and livelihoods at risk,'' Jack Hayes, director of NOAA's National Weather Service, said in a statement.
Part of the problem is that more people are living in high-risk areas, NOAA said. This makes them ''increasingly vulnerable to severe weather events, such as tornado outbreaks, intense heat waves, flooding, active hurricane seasons, and solar storms that threaten electrical and communication systems,'' the statement said.
NOAA, along with other private and public agencies, is taking several steps to try to make the nation more ''weather ready,'' including making more precise forecasts, improving the ability to alert local authorities about risks and developing specialized mobile-ready emergency response teams.
The National Weather Service is also planning several test projects involving emergency response and ecological forecasting. Test projects are to start soon at strategic locations in the mid-Atlantic region, on the Gulf Coast and elsewhere in the South. They include improvements to a system in Charleston, W.Va., for alerts three hours ahead of severe weather instead of the current half-hour.
The nine weather events that have caused at least $1 billion in damages so far this year are:
Central/East Groundhog Day blizzard (Jan. 29-Feb. 3). This storm was tied to 36 deaths. The losses exceeded $2 billion.
Midwest/Southeast tornadoes (April 4-5). Nine people were killed. Total losses were more than $2 billion.
Southeast/Midwest tornadoes (April 8-11). Resulted in more than $2 billion in losses.
Midwest/Southeast tornadoes (April 14-16). Caused 38 deaths. Total losses are more than $2 billion.
Southeast/Ohio Valley/Midwest tornadoes (April 25-30). Caused 327 deaths. Losses total more than $9 billion.
Midwest/Southeast tornadoes (May 22-27). Caused 177 deaths. Total losses are more than $7 billion.
Southern Plains/Southwest drought, heat waves, wildfires. Direct losses are more than $5 billion.
Mississippi River flooding. At least two deaths and losses ranging from $2 billion to $4 billion.
Upper Midwest flooding. Losses estimated at $2 billion.

HEADLINE: The Hidden Dangers In Safe Havens

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
AS Europe's debt troubles intensified earlier this month and United States debt was downgraded, many people rushed into gold and Treasury securities as a safe haven. It was the latest sign that in uncertain times, investors act in ways that can hurt them in the long run.
''They fled the perceived risk of falling stock prices right into the assured risk of overvalued assets,'' said G. Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for the wealth management division at Brown Brothers Harriman.
What drove those decisions was not logic but fear -- fear of a repeat of September 2008. And that fear may only have intensified when markets dropped again late this week, sending yields on 10-year Treasury notes to record lows and the price of gold above $1,800 an ounce.
Even if the fear is understandable, however, acting on it may not be the best long-term strategy. 
''If you were right about the timing decision to get out, you're going to have to be right again about when to get back in,'' said Joseph W. Spada, managing director at Summit Financial Resources in Parsippany, N.J. ''Even professionals have trouble doing it. If that's not going to be your strategy, then don't do it once.''
But now that people have done it once, what are the risks of holding on to large positions in gold and Treasuries?
TREASURIES While the economy may seem bad to many people, it would not take much improvement for investors to lose money quickly on their investment in Treasury bonds.
A week and a half ago, the 10-year Treasury note was yielding only 2.10 percent, after Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' credit rating. Since the yield of a bond moves in the opposite direction of its price, this meant demand for 10-year Treasuries was high.
If over the next six months, the yield were to move up another half of a percentage point to 2.60 percent, however, investors owning those bonds would have a negative 6.25 percent return, said Barbara Reinhard, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse Private Banking in New York. If the yield curve were to move up a full percentage point during that time, the loss would be 14 percent.
She said such a quick increase could easily happen, as it did from October 2010 to January 2011 when the Federal Reserve began its second round of large-scale purchases of government debt, the program known as quantitative easing.
Now, plenty of people buy bonds with the intention of holding them until maturity. In doing that, it would seem that they would earn a return of 2.10 percent. But they would actually lose 1.5 percent, when the most recent inflation rate of 3.6 percent is factored in.
''That's assuming inflation doesn't rise,'' Ms. Reinhard said. ''Right now, you're betting inflation will fall below 2.10 percent. You're betting against history because inflation has been around 3 to 4 percent historically.''
This is not the brightest picture for people who added to their allocation of Treasury bonds. But many felt it was the only safe place.
J. D. Montgomery, a managing director at Canterbury Consulting, an investment consulting firm in Newport Beach, Calif., said he had a client who wrestled with where to put $5 million that he needed to keep safe. The client chose a three-month Treasury note, even though the interest was only $1,000.
There was at least some logic behind this. Most people who bought Treasuries were abandoning their investment strategy, and wealth advisers say that is more troubling than paltry returns.
''The risk of changing your strategy when it's being tested as opposed to changing it when it's not being tested is you risk derailing your long-term investment plan,'' said Gregg Fisher, president and chief investment officer of Gerstein Fisher, a wealth management firm in New York.
So what should nervous investors have done? Selling Treasury bonds when everyone else was buying them would have been a start. But that might have taken too much discipline. Moving to cash was the top option because at least investors would have money ready when they felt comfortable returning to the markets.
GOLDInvestors in gold are a different breed. They often have a passion for the metal that goes beyond returns. And they are not going to be swayed by arguments that gold, hovering around $1,800 an ounce, is overvalued.
''When you buy gold you're saying nothing is going to work and everything is going to stay ridiculous,'' said Mackin Pulsifer, vice chairman and chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust International in New York. ''There is a fair cohort who believes this in a theological sense, but I believe it's unreasonable given the history of the United States.''
As for the nonbelievers who piled into gold, they need to think practically now. Only about 11 percent of gold has an industrial use. While gold can get lost or buried, it does not get used up like oil or natural gas. And its actual cost is between a third and half of where it is trading. Dan Denbow, co-manager of the USAA Precious Metals and Minerals Fund in San Antonio, said it cost about $600 to produce an ounce of gold, but that rises to about $1,000 when all the costs of mining are factored in.
Yet a bigger risk may come from exchange-traded funds for gold. While they let small investors buy gold easily -- the price of one share of the GLD exchange trade fund is roughly one-tenth the price of an ounce of gold -- that same ease of buying means investors can just as quickly sell their shares in a panic.
No one I spoke to would venture a guess as to how high gold would rise before it hit its peak. But most stressed that people forgot that gold's value was driven by sentiment.
''Gold doesn't have any intrinsic value,'' said Larry M. Elkin, president of the Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Scarsdale, N.Y. ''It's this era's wampum. At one point you could buy Manhattan for beads.''
(Mr. Elkin said what bothered him the most about investing in gold was how irrational it was, unlike buying a blue-chip stock whose value rises and falls based on what the company produces.)
That said, having gold in a portfolio is still a good buffer against swings in other markets. Mr. Fisher calculated that over a 43-year period ending in June 2011, the average annual increase for gold, accounting for inflation, was 3.82 percent compared with 4.92 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Gold, however, was 28 percent more volatile.
''The smoother the ride, the more likely the investor is going to stay in his strategy,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''That produces a better result.''
He said that from the perspectives of both return and volatility, a better strategy would have been to put 10 percent in gold and split the rest 60-40 between stocks and five-year Treasury bonds. Rebalancing the portfolio to maintain those ratios would have meant an average annual return of 4.66 percent, with more than half of the volatility of gold alone.
For those who fled to gold and Treasuries, the hardest part will be deciding when to get back into other securities. The best way in uncertain markets may be to go slowly in small chunks -- a practice known as dollar-cost averaging.
''There are real and psychological benefits to it, because getting someone to take that first step is the hardest,'' said Christopher Wolfe, chief investment officer for the private bank and investment group at Bank of America. ''With a five-year time horizon, it makes a big difference. You might get one of those wicked big down days you could benefit from. But if you have a 30-year time horizon it doesn't matter.''
Of course, if people had thought on such a long time horizon they might not have rushed to buy gold and Treasuries in the first place.

HEADLINE: How Can We Get Businesses to Hire?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''What Is Business Waiting For?,'' by Joe Nocera (column, Aug. 16):
To encourage new hiring, the United States needs to pass legislation capping the workweek, as France did in 2000. France imposed a 35-hour workweek, with a 25 percent bonus for overtime. In addition, French workers today get 30 days of paid vacation. 
While the French policy was intensely criticized, both within and outside France, it was immensely popular with workers, who reported enjoying the extra time for leisure and to be with their families. And it reportedly helped create some 350,000 new jobs.
It was later eased when the French economy got healthy and the focus changed to worker productivity and international competitiveness.
I believe that capping the American workweek would be a solid move to create many jobs quickly. Reasonable exceptions could be made for vital workers like police and fire personnel.
WINTHROP DRAKE THIES New York, Aug. 17, 2011
The writer is a retired attorney.
To the Editor:
Two years ago our executive communications company had 17 employees. Today it has seven. We very much would prefer to have 17 employees. The primary reason we do not is that, like many small businesses, we are dependent on big businesses as customers.
And the big businesses that we would ordinarily depend on to become clients are sitting on their cash, because they are deathly afraid of an Obama administration that has been hostile to business (for example, the National Labor Relations Board's ordering Boeing to change its plans for a new South Carolina plant).
They have no idea where the administration's next attack is coming from, and how much it is going to cost them to defend. So businesses do not spend money; they do not hire my company; and we cannot hire back those 10 good people we had to let go.
TERRY CATCHPOLE Executive Chairman The Catchpole Corporation Boston, Aug. 16, 2011
To the Editor:
Joe Nocera emphasizes the differences between German and American employers. I would point out that Germany has a universal health care system; thus German employers are not responsible for providing health insurance for their employees, as most American companies do.
Our system puts a great burden on our companies and actually discourages them from hiring full-time employees. It also raises the cost of American products in the global market, a handicap hard to overcome.
PETER NIKOLITS Orleans, Mass., Aug. 16, 2011
To the Editor:
I don't agree that executives focus on short-term results because ''they've spent the last 30 years having it beaten into them that the only thing that matters is delivering 'shareholder value,' '' as Joe Nocera writes. Executives focus on short-term results because they are the ones who have beaten this thought into shareholders and then worked to create a compensation system that rewards them for doing just that.
Conservative economic theory preaches that people are primarily motivated by economic incentives. Until executives are compensated on measures other than shareholder value, they will do whatever it takes to maximize their own pay regardless of whether it is beneficial in the long run for either the company or the country.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Approves Revised Increases on Tolls

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
A steep toll increase on the bridges and tunnels that cross the Hudson River was approved Friday morning by the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the culmination of a two-week dance among the agency, politicians and the public.
The increase, to be phased in, will raise peak-time E-ZPass tolls to $9.50 from $8 beginning next month. By 2015, that toll will be $12.50. The cash toll will go up 50 percent in September, to $12 a car; by 2015, the cash toll will be $15. 
The board also voted to raise the single-fare ride on PATH trains, which travel between Manhattan and New Jersey, by 25 cents in September and in each of the following three years.
The toll increases, although significant and sure to be criticized by drivers, are smaller than in an initial proposal floated by the Port Authority earlier this month, and few who follow the Port Authority were surprised by the change.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey publicly expressed surprise at the initial plan -- a stance that raised some eyebrows as the governors jointly control the agency, whose every public action, particularly one as significant as a toll or fare increase, is rarely announced without some form of prior approval from the two executives.
The governors, who each can overrule board votes, had pledged to review the proposal with the agency, and nine public hearings were held, all on Tuesday. (Few, if any, authority board members attended those sessions.)
Late Thursday, as predicted, the governors issued a joint statement that took credit for the lower increases. ''We are pleased that our work together'' led to the lower rates, the governors wrote.
Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie have called for a significant audit of the Port Authority and blamed ''fiscal mismanagement'' for the raising of tolls and fares. The governors promised to reduce the agency's budget for maintenance and expansion.
The authority, like many sprawling bureaucracies, has its share of waste and inefficiencies, like spiraling overtime. But the agency has trimmed its operating budget in the past few years and reduced staffing to the lowest level in decades. The creditworthiness of its bonds recently received an upgrade from a rating agency.
The need for higher tolls is based more on the declining economy, which reduced the number of commuters (and thus, toll and fare revenue) using the agency's crossings. And the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site has siphoned billions away from the agency's budget for improving and expanding its bridges, tunnels, airports, shipping ports and the PATH system.
Mr. Christie, who has pledged to not raise taxes on his constituents, called for the agency to use part of its budget for New Jersey road and highway repairs, which are traditionally financed by the state. Some of Mr. Christie's political opponents say the higher rates are a de facto tax increase on commuters.
At Friday's board hearing, representatives of several civic groups expressed support for the higher tolls, saying the money was necessary to help pay for the region's transportation infrastructure to stay in good repair.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, on his Friday morning radio program, also endorsed the plan, warning that without additional revenue, the region's economy would be at risk.
''The bridges would eventually fall down, we wouldn't fix anything, we wouldn't make the commute better,'' the mayor said. ''If you want services, you've got to pay for them.''
The proposals were approved 9 to 0 by the agency's board of commissioners, all of whom are appointed by the two states' governors.
A few commuters and civic activists spoke at the meeting against the new rates, saying the working public was being asked to subsidize the agency's foul-ups.
None of the commissioners would speak to reporters after the meeting. ''I speak to the public, but not under these circumstances,'' one commissioner, David S. Steiner, said as he walked past reporters into a private side room.
Mr. Steiner, an appointee of former Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey, had not appeared to have listened to the public, either. He could be seen resting, with his eyes shut, during significant portions of Friday's board meeting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Questioning The Dogma Of Tax Rates

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary and the 19 other people who work in his office. He pays a much lower rate than I do, and, I suspect, lower than nearly everyone reading this column. So, no doubt, do a long list of American billionaires, including Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone and the hedge fund king John Paulson.
Is this fair?
The issue of tax loopholes for the rich has been simmering for months, but boiled up again this week after Mr. Buffett, the famed investor and Berkshire Hathaway chief executive, called for higher taxes for the wealthy in an Op-Ed column in The New York Times. ''My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress,'' he wrote. 
President Obama has been making a similar argument, and has made the ''carried interest'' exemption from ordinary income rates, which benefits hedge fund and private equity managers, the centerpiece of his tax campaign. ''How can we ask a student to pay more for college before we ask hedge fund managers to stop paying taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries? It's not fair. It's not right,'' the president said a few weeks ago.
By now it's gospel that the carried interest exemption is a tax loophole, which suggests that those benefiting from it are somehow evading a legal obligation imposed on others in similar circumstances. For most hedge fund and private equity partnership managers, carried interest is compensation in the form of a percentage (usually 20 percent) of any gains they generate for investors. If a hedge fund manager generated $1 billion for investors by betting against mortgage-backed securities before the real estate market collapsed, the hedge fund manager is entitled to keep $200 million as compensation. The tax code treats that as a capital gain, taxed at a lower 15 percent rate. (The top rate on ordinary income is 35 percent.) The argument that this should be ordinary income rests on the notion that hedge fund managers earn these fees from their labor, just like other workers get a salary for theirs and are taxed at ordinary income rates.
This seems sensible, and the people who are laying out $45 million for Manhattan apartments and Hamptons estates and throwing themselves multimillion-dollar birthday parties make appealing targets. But like so much about the United States tax code, nothing is that simple. Carried interest is indistinguishable from nearly all other forms of compensation that are treated like capital gains, such as stock options, deferred stock grants for corporate executives and many forms of incentive compensation, which is widespread across many industries. Like all capital investments, carried interest entails risk, since there's no way of knowing what it will be worth until long after the labor is performed, often years later.
Some argue that favorable treatment for carried interest also confers a social benefit. It aligns a manager's financial interest with that of investors, most of whom are pension funds, endowments and other nonprofit institutions like hospitals, museums and universities.
Hedge funds and private equity managers don't even make up the bulk of people who are compensated through carried interest. The fiercest lobbying against raising the tax on carried interest has come not from Wall Street but from the battered real estate industry, which often uses carried interest as compensation. ''Why take down the entire real estate industry with the ship when the objective was to tax a different industry?'' James V. Camp, chairman of legislative affairs in California for a real estate trade group, told me this week. ''The real estate industry will be decimated if the carried interest taxation concept becomes law.''
This is largely why legislative efforts to eliminate the carried interest exemption have gone nowhere, not because of any special fondness in Congress for hedge fund managers. Unless Congress is willing to say baldly that hedge fund and private equity managers are a special class who deserve to pay higher taxes -- a potentially dangerous effort to use the tax code to punish a group of people who are in disfavor largely because they make a lot of money -- policy makers are going to have to confront a much broader and potentially far more explosive question: why are all capital gains, not just carried interest, treated more favorably than ordinary income?
The notion that low capital gains tax rates are a good thing because they promote investment, lead to job creation, encourage people to sell assets without fear of tax consequences and actually raise total tax revenue is so entrenched in both parties that the idea of equalizing capital gains and ordinary income rates is barely mentioned or, when it is, is quickly denounced. It's become a third rail of tax policy and electoral politics. ''It's now so woven into standard thinking that it's become a cultural norm,'' a prominent hedge fund official told me this week.
Proponents of lower -- even zero -- capital gains rates have some academic research and statistics to support their claims. Still, there's no doubt that the root of the problem highlighted by Mr. Buffett is the disparity between tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income. Were these rates the same, the debate over how to treat carried interest would vanish, along with much of the disparity between tax rates for the rich and people like Mr. Buffett's secretary.
Is that so unthinkable? It does seem intuitive that lower taxes and thus potentially greater rewards would encourage risk-taking and investment, and surely at some rate high taxes can discourage any endeavor. But even some hedge fund and private equity officials concede that the argument for lower capital gains rates rests more on faith than science. ''I've seen study after study that says lower capital gains rates have no impact on behavior,'' the hedge fund official told me.
That view is also backed by a growing amount of academic research questioning the premise that lower capital gains rates promote growth. The evidence ''is murky, at best,'' said Leonard E. Burman, the Daniel Patrick Moynihan professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University. Mr. Burman is also a former deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy in the Clinton administration and author of ''The Labyrinth of Capital Gains Tax Policy.''
''It's not the panacea for economic growth that advocates make it out to be,'' he said. Mr. Buffett himself lent empirical support to this view in his column. ''I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone -- not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 -- shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off,'' he said.
Whatever benefits lower capital gains rates might generate, they indisputably complicate the tax code and have spawned a multibillion-dollar industry in tax avoidance. ''Every imaginable individual income tax shelter is driven by the differential,'' Mr. Burman noted. He added that the tax code was needlessly complex. ''Have you looked at the alternate rate schedule on the back of Schedule D? It's so complicated. It's insane. That alone is a really good argument for change.''
But the biggest reason for equalizing capital gains rates may be that it would generate a vast amount of additional revenue for the Treasury. The Internal Revenue Service reports that for taxpayers with the top 400 adjusted gross incomes, capital gains in 2008 amounted to an eye-popping average of $154 million for each of those taxpayers, or 57 percent of their adjusted gross income, and this in a year when the stock market plunged. In 2007, it was $229 million each, or 66 percent. Much of the windfall from higher capital gains rates could be offset by cutting the rate on ordinary income. For antitax zealots who vow they won't accept one more penny of federal tax, all of it could be offset by lower rates on ordinary income. And for advocates of reducing the government deficit at least in part through higher taxes, tax reform is an appealing approach.
Though controversial, this isn't a new idea. The most prominently successful advocate of a drastically simplified tax code that treated ordinary income and capital gains the same was Ronald Reagan, who made it a centerpiece of his successful 1986 tax reform proposal. (The lower rate reappeared as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, championed by Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker of the House, and signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.)
In the end, the most compelling argument for equalizing tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income may not be economic efficiency, growth incentives, higher tax revenue or reducing the deficit. It's simple fairness. It's hard to quantify or put a dollar value on a just society. ''I've earned both, and in my experience earning income from capital gains is a lot easier than earning ordinary income,'' Mr. Burman said. ''Why not tax both at the same rate? It only seems fair.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Offer Oil Leases In the Gulf

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Making good on a promise, the Interior Department announced Friday that it had scheduled its first sale of offshore oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico since the Deepwater Horizon disaster last year. But it is changing some of the rules to ensure that leased parcels are actually drilled and not hoarded.
President Obama's relations with the oil industry have suffered since the BP spill, with many executives accusing him of choking off domestic petroleum supplies and suppressing job creation. But it is unclear whether the resumption of lease sales will affect the rate of oil production in the gulf or improve relations. 
The department said Friday that it was more than doubling the minimum bid for the right to drill in deep water in the gulf, to $100 an acre from $37.50 an acre in the proposed sale, which is scheduled for Dec. 14. The auction encompasses more than 20 million acres of the western gulf.
Officials said the change was based on an analysis of the last 15 years of lease sales in the gulf, which found that leases that received high bids of less than $100 per acre have experienced virtually no exploration and development.
The American Petroleum Institute said it was pleased to see the lease sale going forward but questioned the rationale for raising the minimum bid. ''We are hopeful that this does not discourage investment in these vital domestic resources,'' said Erik Milito, a senior official at the petroleum lobby.
Resuming leasing fulfills a promise President Obama made earlier this year to encourage more domestic oil and gas exploration in the gulf, off the shores of Alaska and in the Atlantic. Last week the Interior Department also granted tentative approval to Royal Dutch Shell to drill in the Arctic Ocean starting next year.
Friday's announcement of new rules is a bit like calling the oil industry's bluff on its resolve to drill more.
Administration officials have complained that billions of barrels of domestic oil have gone untapped because oil companies have locked up millions of acres both onshore and offshore at bargain prices but have failed to develop the resources.
The gulf sale will be the first in 21 months, avoiding making 2011 the first year since 1958 that a lease sale has not been held. It will be the first sale in the part of the gulf bordering Texas since the summer of 2009 and the first sale of any kind in the gulf since March 2010.
President Obama suspended leasing in the gulf after the Deepwater Horizon accident in April 2010, which killed 11 workers and spilled an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the gulf. In May he said that lease sales would resume this year but that all drilling would be conducted under stricter environmental and safety regulations.
Ken Salazar, the Interior secretary, said the agency was comfortable with resuming large-scale deepwater operations in the gulf because rigorous new standards were now in place.
''This sale is an important step toward a secure energy future that includes safe, environmentally sound development of our domestic energy resources,'' he said in a statement. ''Since Deepwater Horizon, we have strengthened oversight at every stage of the oil and gas development process, including deepwater drilling safety, subsea blowout containment and spill response capability.
''Exploration and development of our western gulf's vital energy resources will continue to help power our nation and drive our economy,'' he added.
The lease offering includes parcels from nine to 250 miles offshore and in water depths from 16 to nearly 11,000 feet. The Interior Department estimates that the tract could produce 222 million to 423 million barrels of oil and 1.49 trillion to 2.65 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement is raising the minimum bid on leases in water deeper than 1,312 feet to encourage companies to actively explore those areas and to compensate for the high costs of dealing with a spill.
Regulators said they concluded that raising the minimum bid would discourage companies from purchasing leases and then sitting on them for years.
The regulatory bureau ''is proposing this increase in an effort to ensure that areas with the greatest resource potential are developed, and to decrease the amount of leased acreage that is warehoused and goes unexplored,'' said Michael R. Bromwich, director of the regulatory agency.
Officials said they could not yet gauge industry interest in the parcels to be offered. Nor could they estimate how much money the government would reap from the auction, known as lease sale 218.
The last western gulf sale, held in August 2009, covered 18.4 million acres and brought in $111 million.
The last lease sale before the BP blowout and spill was for the central Gulf of Mexico in March 2010. It covered almost 37 million acres and yielded $920 million.
Some environmentalists said it was too soon after the BP disaster to resume large-scale leasing and drilling in the gulf and urged the government to delay the announced sale.
''Rushing this lease sale puts marine ecosystems at risk before the ink is even dry on the impacts of the BP spill,'' said Jacqueline Savitz of the international conservation group Oceana. She added that the ocean energy bureau ''appears to be caving to intense pressure from the oil industry to return to 'business as usual,' without regard for the extraordinary risks to already imperiled marine animals.''

HEADLINE: Questions on a Bank Merger

 BODY:
Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat of Massachusetts, got it exactly right this week when he asked the Federal Reserve to do more than just rubber-stamp the proposed purchase of the online bank, ING Direct, by the Capital One Financial Corporation. 
Since that merger would create the fifth-largest bank in the United States, the Federal Reserve should make sure that the new entity is good for the banking sector generally and in full compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to lend, invest and provide services in poor communities.
A number of civil rights, consumer protection and housing advocacy groups have raised troubling questions about Capital One's lending policies as they affect creditworthy, low-income minority families. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is currently investigating a formal complaint filed by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an advocacy group that focuses on community redevelopment issues.
The complaint alleges that the company shuts out low-income borrowers by requiring higher credit scores than are necessary to meet the standards of the Federal Housing Administration, which insures mortgages mainly for low- and moderate-income families. The complaint also argues that the bank's policy is racially discriminatory because it has a disparate impact on black and Hispanic borrowers.
These issues should be fully aired before the Federal Reserve approves this proposed deal. Mr. Frank has asked the regulator to extend the public comment period on the transaction for at least 60 days instead of ending it on Monday, as was originally scheduled. Given what's at stake, that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

HEADLINE: For President at Play, Family Outings, Golf And Lots of Advisers

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
CHILMARK, Mass. -- When President Obama boarded Air Force One this week for his vacation on Martha's Vineyard, he was conspicuously accompanied by John O. Brennan, his chief counterterrorism adviser. Next week, a top economic adviser, Brian Deese, will arrive to prep Mr. Obama for his speech on the economy after Labor Day.
If that seems a bit like going on vacation with your lawyer and accountant, well, that's part of being a president at play. 
The Obama administration, as much as its predecessors, is acutely sensitive to criticism about the president taking time off -- complaints that are noisier this year because his annual retreat comes at a time of economic pain and market turmoil.
By bringing along Mr. Brennan, who was photographed Friday giving Mr. Obama his daily national security briefing on deck chairs -- before the president took his daughters to a local bookstore; before even, he played his first round of golf -- the White House is sending a message: this vacation is less a chance to kick back than a change of scenery.
''The president understands that he has important responsibilities to fill,'' the deputy White House press secretary, Joshua Earnest, said to reporters on the way to Martha's Vineyard. ''And it's his job to fill those responsibilities 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.''
The trouble for this White House -- from a public relations point of view, if not a quality-of-life point of view -- is that this is such a delightful place to do the hard work of governing.
The administration flew about 150 people to Martha's Vineyard: Secret Service agents, military aides and staff members -- from Mr. Brennan down to the handler who walked the Obama family dog, Bo, onto Air Force One. (Neatly trimmed for his Vineyard romp, Bo sneaked in by the rear stairs, ahead of the press contingent.)
Some staff members are housed in bed and breakfasts, with ruffled bedspreads and gaily painted shutters. Others are at a hotel in Edgartown, a stylish port known for its stately homes built by whaling captains. The first family is renting a 28-acre waterfront estate, Blue Heron Farm, which has horse paddocks, a boat house and an apple orchard.
Few locals in this Democrat-friendly terrain begrudge Mr. Obama his time off. A banner at the Mansion House Inn, where reporters are staying, declares, ''Having achieved so much against division and dysfunction, President Obama deserves a Vineyard vacation.'' (Full disclosure: the hotel is swell, too, with a rooftop deck that looks out to yachts in the harbor.)
Contrast that to the quarters where staff members were billeted when President George W. Bush vacationed at his ranch in Crawford, Tex.
Because it was so remote, with few hotels nearby, the White House leased 11 acres outside the gates from a neighbor of Mr. Bush, and put in five trailers, said Steve Atkiss, a former special assistant to the president for operations, who helped set up the outpost.
The trailers housed Secret Service agents, military aides, a communications center, helicopter pilots and members of the president's senior staff.
''They were pretty run-of-the-mill double-wide trailers,'' said Mr. Atkiss, who now works for Command Consulting Group, a security and intelligence consultancy. ''They were functional spaces without being in the least bit luxurious. It was not Martha's Vineyard.''
And Mr. Bush spent a lot of time in Texas: 180 days, at the same point in his administration where Mr. Obama is now, according to the CBS News reporter Mark Knoller, who compiles such statistics. Mr. Obama had spent 61 days on vacation before this holiday began.
As with Mr. Obama, Mr. Bush's sojourns were not vacations in the normal sense of the word. He played host to world leaders at the ranch, and held national security meetings. Mr. Atkiss argued that presidents can actually get more done on vacation, since they are not interrupted by White House ceremonial duties.
Mr. Obama did play golf in Edgartown, after he took his girls home from Bunch of Grapes, a Vineyard Haven bookstore. But his aides say he will devote time next week to honing proposals to revive the economy, to be announced in September. Fast-moving events in Syria and Libya guarantee that Mr. Brennan will be kept busy, too.
For now, though, the president's staff members are savoring the sea breezes in a place they insist functions perfectly well as a New England White House. Working out of a B&B, Mr. Earnest said, is ''better than doing my job at my desk in lower press'' -- referring to the cramped West Wing space where press aides field calls from reporters.

HEADLINE: Belarus Suspends Pact to Give Up Enriched Uranium

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ; Steven Lee Myers and Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting from Washington, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Belarus said Friday that it would suspend an agreement to give up its supply of highly enriched uranium, torpedoing, at least temporarily, what was considered a significant victory by the Obama administration in curtailing the spread of dangerous nuclear material.
The move comes in response to the latest wave of economic sanctions imposed by Washington this month as punishment for a ruthless crackdown on government opponents, including widespread arrests, that has continued unabated for months. 
''The imposition of new American economic sanctions goes contrary to the spirit of interaction and cooperation,'' the Belarus Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ''As a result, Belarus has decided to freeze projects with the United States for exchanging highly enriched uranium fuel within the framework of initiatives for decreasing global threats.''
The State Department expressed disappointment in the announcement and called on Belarus to ''meet its stated objective of the elimination of all of its stocks of highly enriched uranium.'' A spokeswoman, Heide Bronke Fulton, said that the United States would continue to press for human rights and democratic freedoms in Belarus and reiterated American calls for the release of political prisoners.
The announcement by Belarus is sure to complicate the country's already rocky relations with the United States. Belarus expelled the American ambassador in 2008, and the embassy in Minsk has been working with a skeleton crew of five diplomats.
Under the original nuclear deal, signed at a security summit meeting in Kazakhstan in December, Belarus had agreed to transfer its supply of nuclear fuel by 2012. The material was to be shipped to Russia, where it was to be changed to a less purified grade. In exchange, the United States agreed to provide Belarus with some financial aid.
Belarus is the only country from the former Soviet Union outside of Russia to possess large stocks of highly enriched uranium, and the agreement, which was signed by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarus foreign minister, Sergei Martynov, was hailed at the time as a major foreign policy success.
After the Soviet collapse 20 years ago, the United States moved quickly to secure the nuclear stockpiles left largely unguarded in the newly independent countries, which were reeling under political and social upheaval. But Belarus, a highly authoritarian and extremely poor former Soviet republic, had long resisted giving up its nuclear fuel. Its stockpile is one of its few bargaining chips in negotiations with the United States and regional power brokers for the loans and handouts it needs to sustain its Soviet-style command economy.
The Foreign Ministry said on Friday that it would continue to abide by international regulations in securing its stockpile. American officials say Belarus possesses about 485 pounds of highly enriched uranium, though outside experts give varying numbers and it is unclear how much of the material has been enriched to weapons grade.
Matthew Bunn, an associate professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who specializes in research of nuclear theft and terrorism, said he saw little or no risk that the material, which is housed in a secure site, could fall into the wrong hands. Still, Mr. Bunn said, the issue needs to be addressed because ''it's one of only a few stocks that are enough for a crude terrorist nuclear bomb.''
Belarus said it would restart the transfer program only when the United States removed the sanctions.
The latest sanctions, imposed last week, single out four government-owned companies and augment measures adopted earlier this year, including a ban on travel to the United States by the president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, and several dozen other government officials.
The earlier American sanctions and similar measures put in place by the European Union, were imposed after the arrests of opposition activists who gathered for a protest against what they said were tainted presidential elections in December.
The police violently dispersed the protest, and dozens of opposition leaders have since been handed lengthy prison sentences. Meanwhile, human rights groups and independent journalists continue to face almost daily harassment by the Belarusian security services, called the K.G.B.

HEADLINE: Dissident Meets Leader Of Myanmar

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- The democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi met with Myanmar's president on Friday, state-run television reported, her highest contact with the new, nominally civilian government since her release from house arrest in November. 
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and President Thein Sein held ''frank and friendly discussions'' to ''find ways and means of cooperation,'' the state-run broadcast reported, showing video of them greeting each other.
The meeting lasted nearly an hour and was ''significant,'' a government official said.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has repeatedly called for political dialogue with the government since her release from seven years of house arrest. If her party reaches an accommodation with the government, it could encourage Western nations to lift political and economic embargoes on Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.
Nyan Win, the spokesman for her party, the National League for Democracy, said the meeting ''could be the first step toward national reconciliation,'' but declined to elaborate until details were available.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, said the United States welcomed news of the meeting.
''These are positive steps, and we continue to call for the Burmese government to follow its rhetoric with concrete action towards national reconciliation and progress on core issues of concern to the international community, including the release of political prisoners,'' he said.
It remains unclear if the government is committed to a dialogue with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and whether it would be willing to discuss the kinds of reforms that would restore its legitimacy with the international community.
Mr. Thein Sein took power in March after an election that critics dismissed as a sham to create a nominally civilian government while entrenching the country's military rulers. The Constitution ensures that the military retains dominance.

HEADLINE: Once Again, Fear Sends Stocks Down

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Jack Ewing and Julia Werdigier contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After starting out the week with hopes of newfound stability, stock market investors ended up experiencing another ugly week as worries about the global economy resurfaced.
On Monday, stock indexes had finally recovered from the huge sell-off of the previous week, after the downgrade of United States long-term debt by Standard & Poor's late on Aug. 5 unleashed days of painful market turmoil.
But by midweek, stocks were falling again, as investors worried about Europe's debt crisis, and the possibility of recession in the United States intensified. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 1.5 percent on Friday, and closed down more than 4 percent for the week. 
It was the fourth consecutive week of market declines as investors remained rattled. The latest signs of strain came from some European banks laden with debt from the region's troubled economies -- strains that could spread across the Atlantic.
Despite a meeting in Paris earlier in the week between the leaders of Germany and France to pledge greater economic coordination between nations sharing the euro, confidence quickly eroded in the markets over whether Europe's policy makers have solutions to the Continent's debt crisis.
In the United States, dismal economic data on Thursday pointed to an unexpectedly abrupt slowdown in manufacturing and a pickup in inflation.
Next week, the market's attention will turn to the Federal Reserve's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for signs of how confident the chairman of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, is about the strength of the American recovery.
At last year's symposium, faced by a similar midyear slowdown, Mr. Bernanke paved the way for a second round of large-scale bond purchases, or quantitative easing.
But after the Fed this month already promised to keep short-term interest rates close to zero for the next two years, few economists expect further stimulus from the Fed.
On Friday, markets closed sharply lower in Asia and Europe, and that sentiment then carried over into the United States. Stocks had been briefly higher in the morning hours, but then slipped. Some analysts attributed the slide to technical factors and thin volume.
At the close, the S.& P. 500 was down 17.12 points, or 1.5 percent, at 1,123.53. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 172.93 points, or 1.57 percent, to 10,817.65. The Nasdaq composite index lost 38.59 points, or 1.62 percent, to 2,341.84.
For the week, the S.& P. was down 4.6 percent, the Dow fell 4 percent and the Nasdaq slid 6.6 percent. The steepest declines were on Thursday, when the indexes slipped more than 3 percent on persistent worries about the economy and Europe's debt problems.
Stocks of companies most susceptible to slow growth and those related to banks have been hit. Technology, financials and industrials were among the sectors down more than 1 percent on Friday.
''You are still seeing a lot of the economically sensitive names leading us on the way down,'' said Seth Setrakian, co-head of United States equities at First New York.
Some of the downturn on Wall Street was attributed to technical reasons. Friday, for example, was a day when options contracts expire, an event that can fuel volatility or market moves.
Analysts were also quick to point out that on a day before a summer weekend, low volumes could unfold into a ''bleed'' toward the end of the trading session -- and indeed, what had been a relatively placid session in New York turned downward in the final hours.
''Just as importantly, any important policy makers that can come up with anything constructive are on vacation,'' said Mr. Setrakian. ''So what good news can come over the weekend?''
''So everyone is playing much lighter and much tighter,'' he said. ''It is very simply the data that has been coming out economically has not been constructive.''
Gold continued the sharp ascent it has seen over the last months, demonstrating that nervousness remained intense. Gold futures were up $30, to $1,848.90 an ounce.
Europe's major stock indexes ended the day lower. The FTSE 100 in London fell 1 percent and the Euro Stoxx 50, a barometer of European blue-chip stocks, pulled back 2.15 percent.
Asian markets were also lower. The Nikkei 225 index in Japan lost 2.51 percent, and the major market indexes in Singapore and Hong Kong closed down more than 3 percent.
Tension on money markets, which some analysts said was overblown, awoke unpleasant memories of the seizure in interbank lending that came after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
''Everybody is taking risk off the table,'' said George Rusnak, national director of fixed income for Wells Fargo. ''This is probably going to be a trend over the next several weeks. There is not a lot of robust trading going on right now.''
Mr. Rusnak and other analysts again noted that concerns had mounted about the banking sector, especially with respect to the exposure of American banks to their European counterparts.
One drag on the American markets, and specifically the tech sector, on Friday was Hewlett-Packard, which is considering plans to spin off the company's personal computer business into a separate company and is spending $10 billion on Autonomy, a business software maker. Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell 20 percent, or $5.91, to $23.60.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged, and the yield remained at 2.07 percent. It had touched record lows below 2 percent in intraday trading on Thursday.
''The growth outlook being hurt in Europe, and the ongoing sluggish data we have seen in the United States is the underlying issue the stock market is trying to grapple with,'' said Robert S. Tipp, a managing director and chief investment strategist for Prudential Fixed Income.
He said the crisis of confidence was evident as investors parked money in cash and short-term fixed-income assets.
One thing to worry about next week will be whether the European Central Bank can continue to hold down yields on Italian and Spanish bonds. If not, Italian and Spanish borrowing costs might reach the point where they became too expensive, raising the risk of default.
On Friday, Italian bonds and Spanish bonds dipped to 4.96 percent.

HEADLINE: Obama in the Valley

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
In 1970, the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori coined the phrase ''uncanny valley.'' In the field of robotics, and increasingly in computer animation, it refers to the theory that people feel good about robots -- up to a point. When they start to look almost real, but not quite, we experience an eerie and unsettling sense of revulsion. 
I have often thought that there must be an uncanny valley of politics, a point at which particular politicians rouse our discomfort because there's something about them that people connect with, but there's something else about them -- intangible, unbelievable and not relatable -- that produces a sense of unease.
It can be found in the ''Artificial Intelligence'' of Michele Bachmann and her pull-the-string-in-the-middle-of-my-back compulsion to repeat the same red-meat responses no matter the question. It's the Buzz Lightyear-come-to-life bravado of Rick Perry, complete with delusions of grandeur and accomplishment. And it's pretty much everything about the mechanical ''I, Republican'' Mitt Romney.
But one person I never thought would fall into this valley was Barack Obama, the charismatic candidate who electrified the electorate in 2008 and whom many saw as the fulfillment of the dream of the even-more-electrifying Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Yet here Obama is, down in the valley, struggling to connect with the American people and failing, increasingly coming across as dispassionate to some and outright revolting to others.
Of course, Republicans haven't helped. They're absolutely committed to, and obsessed with, his failure. But that cannot be the excuse. Great leadership isn't shaped in the absence of opposition but in the presence of it. Great leaders draw us together by our universal humanity; they galvanize the wills of the willing; they draw clarity for the spigot of chaos.
But that is not how this president is performing at this critical moment, and people are growing increasingly unhappy with him. A Gallup poll released on Aug. 15 found that Obama's approval rating had fallen to the lowest level of his presidency, and Gallup polls released a few days later found that the number of people not satisfied with the direction of the country and who disapproved of the president's performance on the economy, budget deficit, job creation, education and foreign affairs had reached the highest levels of the administration.
The country needs the president to rise to this crisis in word, spirit and deed. We need him to reach out of his nature and into the nation's need. We are on the precipice. There's growing concern that we may slip into a second, more painful recession. There is little optimism that the housing crisis will loosen its grip on the economy anytime soon. The unspeakable truth is that we may well be on the leading edge of a prolonged period of national stagnation, if not decline.
A robotic Sustainer-in-Chief with an eerie inhumanity will not satisfy. At this moment, we need less valley and more mountaintop.

HEADLINE: Japanese Prime Minister, Under Pressure to Quit, Drops Plan to Meet With Obama

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Prime Minister Naoto Kan has scrapped plans to meet with President Obama in Washington next month as pressure builds on the unpopular Japanese leader to resign in the coming weeks.
The top government spokesman said on Friday that Japan had stopped trying to organize the trip, which was to have taken place in early September. The spokesman, Yukio Edano, the chief cabinet secretary, said the trip was impossible, given ''Japan's current political situation.''
The statement seemed to be a reference to growing speculation in political circles that Mr. Kan could soon step down -- as early as the end of next week, according to some local news media reports. That would open the way for an election within his governing Democratic Party to choose a successor. 
Some politicians say that the internal party election could happen on Aug. 28 or Aug. 29, though others are calling for the party to hold a longer, American-style primary in order to foster a healthy policy debate. Jockeying has begun to succeed Mr. Kan, with a half-dozen Democratic lawmakers already putting up their hands.
Mr. Kan has faced growing criticism for what many here see as his ad hoc and inconsistent response to the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident in March. Mr. Kan, who took office just over a year ago, is also blamed for his perceived inability to chart a new direction for the nation, which was already gripped by economic and political stagnation before the triple disaster.
In the face of such criticism, Mr. Kan promised in June to step down once he won passage in Parliament of a series of key bills, which political analysts say he hopes to be the legacy of his short-lived administration. These include a measure to foster green energy use, and another to finance the costly reconstruction of the tsunami-ravaged northeast, where about 20,000 people are dead or missing.
Mr. Kan has tried to make a late comeback by calling for a phasing out of nuclear energy in Japan, hoping to tap the deep misgivings about atomic power after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. But he has run into resistance within his own party, where the nuclear industry holds strong political influence, and skepticism among the Japanese public, which views him as unable to fulfill his promises.
Mr. Kan's successor would be the sixth new prime minister in five years, and most of the candidates to replace Mr. Kan have been younger, untested and relatively unknown lawmakers who seem to lack a strong base of support within the party or with the public. This has raised the specter of yet another weak, short-lived prime minister, which may only prolong Japan's stagnation.
Some candidates have begun calling for a ''grand alliance'' with the largest opposition party, the Liberal Democrats, in the hope of ending the stalemate in Parliament, where the opposition controls the upper house. But the formation of such a large and unwieldy coalition could also add to paralysis by yielding watered-down compromises instead of the bolder action many Japanese voters seem to want.
On Friday, Mr. Edano, the spokesman, said Japan's foreign minister had told the American ambassador, John V. Roos, about Mr. Kan's cancellation of the meeting with Mr. Obama. Mr. Edano told reporters that Mr. Roos had ''showed understanding.''
Japanese news reports said the Japanese government was now trying to arrange a meeting between the American president and whoever becomes Mr. Kan's successor, on the sidelines of a United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York in late September.

HEADLINE: Chinese Premier Sounds Confident Note on U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- After widespread criticism among Chinese of Washington's recent debt-ceiling gridlock and with expanding fears of another recession that could imperil the value of China's huge stake in American debt, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Chinese leaders labored on Friday to cast the American economy's weakness as a passing phase. 
The day's exchanges, first with Vice President Xi Jinping and then with Premier Wen Jiabao, only underscored the extent to which the world's two biggest economies are inextricably linked, and the concern each side has that disruptions on one side of the Pacific might spill over to the other.
In Friday's discussions, however, the previously outspoken Chinese publicly muted their concerns, while Mr. Biden proffered repeated assurances that the United States would overcome its fiscal and economic troubles. Yet, Mr. Xi, the presumed successor to President Hu Jintao, obliquely referred to the shifting balance of fiscal power between the nations.
No longer, he said, is America the sole source of money and technology, and China the source of factory labor. ''More and more, Chinese businesses are going to the United States to make investments and start businesses,'' he said, ''contributing their part to the growth of the U.S. economy and the creation of jobs.''
Mr. Biden enthusiastically endorsed more Chinese investment in the American economy, telling Mr. Xi, ''It means jobs, it means American jobs.''
The White House was expected to reveal later that Chinese firms had committed to $965 million in purchases of American exports and investments in American businesses, said one Obama administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deals had not been officially announced.
Meeting later with Mr. Biden in Zhongnanhai, the Chinese leadership's compound in central Beijing, Mr. Wen reiterated his faith in the strength of the American economic system and praised Mr. Biden for his assurances.
''In spite of the difficulties facing the United States economy at present, I have full confidence that the United States will overcome these difficulties and get its economy back on the track of healthy growth,'' he said.
It was especially important, he added, that Mr. Biden had assured Chinese ''that the United States will keep its word and its obligations with regard to its government debt, it will preserve the safety, liquidity and value of U.S. Treasuries.''
Mr. Biden replied, ''U.S. Treasuries -- we're going to take care of very closely, not merely because China owns 8 percent of them, but because the Americans own 85 percent of them.''
The Chinese have made America's rising debt and concerns about its economic strength a central topic in Mr. Biden's private discussions here. Since arriving Wednesday evening, the vice president has met with Mr. Wen, Mr. Xi, President Hu Jintao and Wu Bangguo, who leads the National People's Congress.
Friday's tributes to American financial strength appeared directed as much at the Chinese people as at global markets. Chinese news reports have suggested that citizens are losing faith in the American economy and that they are upset that the Chinese government holds more than $1 trillion in Treasury securities.

HIGHLIGHT: But skip the lutefisk.

 BODY:
A few random notes:
1. Stockholm isn't perfect. Even in August, it can rain cats and dogs -- which is why I'm still sitting in the lounge blogging over my coffee and herring.
2. More seriously, I wouldn't want to live here -- because I'm not Swedish! Culturally I'm very much an American, Northeast Corridor edition, and even the Swedes tell me that their society can feel a bit claustrophobic. Fundamentally, my home is in the real real America -- the multicultural, multiracial, freewheeling society that is built around the American idea. Of course, the "patriots" of the right hate that America.
3. Of course the point is not that Sweden is perfect, it's the fact that it works and thrives despite high taxes and a strong welfare state -- which isn't supposed to be possible according to conservative dogma. 
An anecdote here: Robin and I were talking yesterday with an eminent American financial economist, and said something about tax levels here. He said, "Well, that's why all the young people are leaving." Except, you know, they aren't. But never mind -- that's what's supposed to be happening, and it must be happening.
4. And of course I can't pass up the excuse for another video:

Participants and spectators from both sides of the 2012 campaign will appear on the Sunday shows to talk strategy for either securing a second term or beginning a first. Three governors will also weigh in to discuss what the consecutive rabble-rousing in Washington means for state and local elections.
David Axelrod, one of the president's top campaign advisers, will appear on ABC's "This Week" to discuss Mr. Obama's second attempt at the presidency. And later on CNN's "State of the Union," he will offer a glimpse into the White House's new jobs plan and the big speech his administration has planned for September. But Jon Huntsman has a plan too - a plan to win his party's nomination. He will stop by "This Week" to share his team's strategy for success.
Also on "State of the Union," Governors Bob McDonnell, Republican of Virginia, and Martin O'Malley, Democrat of Maryland, will share the frustrations of state politicians as they watch the bickering in Washington have an effect on both their constituents and their chances of re-election. Representative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, will discuss the Congressional Black Caucus's efforts to create jobs for the African-American community after leveling criticism of the president for not addressing their pointedly high unemployment rate.
And another governor, Mitch Daniels of Indiana, may not plan to run for the Republican nomination, but he still plans to share his opinion of the contenders on NBC's "Meet the Press." Afterward, Robert Gibbs, an Obama campaign adviser, will explain how the president plans to shift the nation's focus to jobs in order to heighten his chances at re-election.
Former Senator Rick Santorum will sit down for a one-on-one with FOX's "Fox News Sunday" in the aftermath of last week's presidential debate. But first, Karl Rove, former Bush White House adviser, and Bill Burton, former Obama White House deputy communications director, will examine the current political landscape with the staggering economy as the backdrop.
Key voices from each party will be heard when Ed Gillespie, former R.N.C. chairman, and Terry McAuliffe, former D.N.C. chairman, debate on CBS's "Face the Nation." Plus, Senator John McCain of Arizona will sit down to say which of his party members is best able to take on the president in the 2012 campaign.
Though a group of White House staffers have joined the president on Martha's Vineyard, others have stayed behind to speak on the administration's behalf. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan will appear on C-SPAN's "Newsmakers" and Cecilia Munoz, White House director of intergovernmental affairs, will chat with Univision's "Al Punto."

HEADLINE: Downtown Manhattan

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
ONE WORLD TRADE CENTER is rising, and the 9/11 Memorial will open right below it next month on the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. Although progress on the World Trade Center site has been slow, the surrounding neighborhoods did not wait to revive (and in some cases reinvent themselves) after all the emotional and economic devastation. The financial district is bustling, Chinatown is as quirky and enticing as ever, and TriBeCa is bursting with new restaurants, bars and hotels. With the exception of those seeking a night of relentless club-hopping, travelers hardly need venture north of Canal Street for a complete New York weekend.
Friday
2 p.m. 1) CRUISING THE HARBOR 
Been there (Liberty and Governors Islands) and done that (taken the free Staten Island Ferry)? There are other options for harbor cruises, and what better way to get an overview of Lower Manhattan? One possibility is a 90-minute sail on the Clipper City tall ship, a replica of a 19th-century lumber-hauling schooner (Manhattan by Sail; 800-544-1224; manhattanbysail.com), which departs from the South Street Seaport. Another is a one-hour harbor cruise with Statue Cruises (201-604-2800; statuecruises.com). The company will soon launch its Hornblower Hybrid, which relies on several power sources, including hydrogen fuel cells, solar panels and wind turbines.
4 p.m. 2) SUGAR AND SOAP
Venture to TriBeCa for a treat at Duane Park Patisserie (179 Duane Street; 212-274-8447; duaneparkpatisserie.com, lemon tarts, $5; ''magic cupcakes,'' $4) on the shady pocket park it's named after. Then wander into the nearby shops, ranging from the cute to the serious. At Lucca Antiques (182 Duane Street; 212-343-9005; luccaantiques.com) the owners salvage old wood and metal objects from Europe and brilliantly reformulate them into modern furniture, lamps and wall decor. Torly Kid (51 Hudson Street; 212-406-7440; torlykid.com) has funkily functional clothes for babies to tweens. At the Working Class Emporium (168 Duane Street; 212-941-1199; workingclassinc.com), a shop, you can buy quirky gifts like three-dimensional puzzles and soap shaped like dogs.
6:30 p.m. 3) BANKERS' HAPPY HOUR
If you resent investment bankers' salaries and bonuses, then here's something else to be envious of: the cobblestone stretch of Stone Street. What might be New York's greatest outdoor drinking spot happens to be right next to Goldman Sachs's former headquarters. When it's warm, this quaint block, lined with 19th-century Greek Revival buildings, is practically blocked by tables occupied by financial types, a few sundry locals and knowledgeable tourists. Choose a table outside Adrienne's Pizzabar (212-248-3838; 54 Stone Street; adriennespizzabar.com) and order a meatball and broccoli rabe pizza ($28.50), enough for three people; a bottle of wine starts at a few dollars more.
10 p.m. 4) THE ANTI-COPA
Midtown's Copacabana recently reopened, bringing some throwback flash to New York's music scene. But for throwback grit, try the Friday night party at 2020 (20 Warren Street; 212-962-9759; 2020latinclub.com), where Latinos working in every kind of downtown job come to dance to the D.J.-supplied rhythms of the Spanish-speaking Caribbean.
Saturday
10:30 a.m. 5) BUENOS AIRES BRUNCH
Under one form or another, the restaurateur Stacey Sosa has run an Argentine restaurant in this cool space in TriBeCa since 1997. And though brunch at Estancia 460 (212-431-5093; 460 Greenwich Street; estancia460.wordpress.com) is very New York, with frittatas, granola and some innovative egg dishes, there are flashes of Buenos Aires, like French toast with dulce de leche. (Brunch for two about $30.)
Noon 6) MANAHATTA
Most people don't put the Smithsonian on their New York must-do list. But the National Museum of the American Indian (212-514-3700; nmai.si.edu), in the Beaux Arts splendor of the old Customs House near Battery Park, is a reminder that Manhattan and the rest of the Western Hemisphere has a long and vibrant cultural history. The Infinity of Nations exhibition has everything from a macaw and heron feather headdress from Brazil to a hunting hat with ivory carvings from the Arctic. To get an up-close view of a wampum belt and corn pounder used by the Lenape Indians, who called the island Manahatta, head to the museum's resource center and ask. The museum is free -- not far from the price for which the Lenapes famously sold Manhattan to the Dutch.
2 p.m. 7) DOCTORAL DOWNTOWN
Continue your historical education with a Big Onion tour. Downtown's a complicated place, with layers upon layers of history: Dutch, African-American, Revolutionary and financial, among others. It takes a doctoral candidate to decode it, and that is who will lead you on a two-hour $18 tour that might include ''Historic TriBeCa,'' ''Revolutionary New York'' or ''The Financial District.'' Times vary; see bigonion.com.
7 p.m. 8) WINE BY THE T-SHIRT
At the wine bar Terroir Tribeca (24 Harrison Street; 212-625-9463; wineisterroir.com), the young servers dressed in wine-themed T-shirts don't look as though they could know what they are talking about, but don't get them started. (Actually, do get them started.) A glass of wine begins at $8.75, and the menu is full of temptations so nonstandard you can justify it: fried balls of risotto, wine and oxtail ($8), for example, is a perfect way to spend your allotment of deep-fried calories.
9 p.m. 9) SALVAGE AND BRUSCHETTA
Who knows how many diners have walked out of Robert DeNiro and company's Locanda Verde, the big northern Italian spot, and wondered what was going on in the tiny, bustling restaurant across the street? Decked out with salvaged materials that evoke an old factory or warehouse, Smith and Mills (71 North Moore Street; 212-226-2515; smithandmills.com) seats 22 at tables shoehorned between the standing, drinking crowds. The menu includes tomato bruschetta, oysters with horseradish, burgers and brioche bread pudding; dinner for two about $70, with drinks. One must-see: the bathroom, in a turn-of-the-century iron elevator.
11 p.m. 10) DRINKS ON DOYERS
Head east to Chinatown, where Apotheke (9 Doyers Street; 212-406-0400; apothekenyc.com) is a non-Chinese intruder sitting on the elbow of L-shaped Doyers Street, the spot known as the Bloody Angle for the gang-related killings there in the early 20th century. Here you'll find one of the city's top cocktail bars, with throwback decor and dim lighting. Try the Deal Closer, made with cucumber, vodka, mint, lime and vanilla, along with ''Chinatown aphrodisiacs'' ($15).
Sunday
8 a.m. 11) BROOKLYN BRIDGE CROSSING
With the arrival of the dog days, you have to get up pretty early to walk across this beloved landmark in comfort. As romantic as ever, a walk along the elevated pedestrian walkway provides a photo opportunity a minute. On your way back, stop by City Hall Park to see four decades of Sol LeWitt's sculptures, on display until Dec. 3. Then head west across Chambers Street to pick up bagels and smoked salmon from Zucker's (146 Chambers Street; 212-608-5844; zuckersbagels.com).
12: 30 p.m. 12) IN MEMORIAM
On Sept. 12, the National September 11 Memorial opens, with its pair of one-acre reflecting pools in the footprints of the fallen towers, names of victims inscribed in bronze panels, and rustling swamp white oak trees overhead. An on-site museum, which opens in September 2012, will have exhibitions on the original World Trade Center and the day of the attacks. Visitors can reserve free passes at 911memorial.org. No pass is needed to visit the ''Unwavering Spirit: Hope and Healing at Ground Zero'' exhibition at St. Paul's Chapel nearby (209 Broadway; trinitywallstreet.org). St. Paul's became a refuge for rescue workers in the days after the attacks. Now it houses photographs, testimonials and artifacts from those weeks after the city changed irrevocably.
IF YOU GO
The Greenwich Hotel (212-941-8900; 377 Greenwich Street; thegreenwichhotel.com), Robert DeNiro's 2008 creation, has 88 individually designed rooms in the heart of TriBeCa. Free Internet and local phone calls, and for rooms starting at $495 a night, you actually get your choice of local newspaper.
To keep it boutique but lower the rate, try Gild Hall (15 Gold Street; 212-232-7700; thompsonhotels.com), a member of the Thompson Hotels, where 12-foot ceilings and marble bathroom floors go for as little as $179 a night on weekends.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The 36 Hours column last Sunday, about Downtown New York, misstated the opening date of the Memorial Museum at the World Trade Center site. Though the National September 11 Memorial will open on Sept. 12, 2011, as stated, the Museum will not open until September 2012.

HEADLINE: Beautiful Minds

BYLINE: By EDWARD BARSAMIAN

 BODY:
Meet the model students - the hard-working women wearing the best of fall's back-to-school-inspired looks in the photographer Angelo Pennetta's portfolio ''Beautiful Minds.'' Here, they tell T about life on campus, hitting the sales racks versus the stacks, and how to prep for everything from costume parties to pop quizzes. The first of a two-part series.
Jane Randall Princeton University (class of 2013), Majoring in history 
On ''America's Next Top Model'' often relegates the aspiring mannequin to the dustbin of catalogs. But Randall, 20, is hardly a typical contestant: while filming the show, she did the unthinkable and read a book! Soon after, the Princeton history major was informed that outside reading was forbidden by the show's producers. Now that she's a real model, she ''always keeps a book'' with her when going to castings. Better to follow the work of her favorite professor, Anthony Grafton, a renaissance expert.
THE GENERAL STORE Princeton's University Store, or U-store as we call it, is absolutely cool and has everything from computer software to groceries to Clinique makeup. They also sell the Vera Bradley accessories that all the girls use to carry their student ID's. CAMPUS REQUIREMENT A sense of humor - Princeton prides itself on quirky traditions and loyal alumni. GO TIGERS! I played on the varsity women's lacrosse team, and I'm a member of the University Cottage Club. DINE AND DASH I eat most of my meals at Cottage, but the egg sandwiches at Olive's are the best I've ever had. SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS The fall and spring lawn parties bring the best bands - last year B.O.B and Wiz performed, but my favorite was seeing the Spin Doctors.
Sonia Dara Harvard University (class of 2013), Majoring in economics with a secondary in human evolutionary biology and citation in Spanish
At age 21, Dara recently interned for Tyra Banks, whose trailblazing strides for minority models she is already emulating. She is the first model of South Asian descent to be in Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue, and like banks she hopes one day to shift from model to mogul. ''i really enjoyed the exposure to the business side of fashion,'' says the third year economics major at Harvard of her internship. ''not to mention learning the ropes from someone that i really look up to.''
WHERE TO SHOP.COM When there's time, I shop on Newbury Street, but more often I resort to ASOS and Gilt. They deliver to my dorm! Here's a tip: the vintage stores between Harvard and M.I.T. are good, but Oona's on Massachusetts Avenue is the best for costume parties. EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES I do tutoring in Boston at the Mission Hill After School Program, and I've been involved in the Undergraduate Council, too. TEAM SPIRIT The biggest football event of the year is the Harvard-Yale game in November. Crew is also popular, and people get really into the Head of the Charles, a regatta on the Charles River. SCHOOL UNIFORM It seems to me that the New England look includes at least one of the following: a Barbour jacket, Tory Burch flats, Hunter boots or a Longchamp bag. MIDNIGHT SNACK Nothing beats Pinocchio's Pizza, which has the best Sicilian slice ever, and Zoe's is great for breakfast food cravings at random hours.
Cameron Russell Columbia University (class of 2012), Majoring in economics and political science
By her third day as a professional model, Russell booked jobs for Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs. Now a 24-year-old economics and political science major at Columbia University, she quickly realized that sexed-up models can sell more than just clothing. Inspired by the Benetton aids awareness ads of the 1990s, Russell recruited fellow models Crystal Renn and Heidi Mount to disrobe with her for a film against global warming (get it? Cool your bodies, cool the planet) that she made in 2009 for 350.org.
BOOKWORM Westsider Books on Broadway and 81st Street has a sweet little selection, but of course it's hard to beat the Strand. PAPER CHASER I love wandering the stacks in Butler Library, but the computer lounge in Havemeyer Hall lets you print without limits! DAILY DOSE A big cup of green tea from Oren's Daily Roast. TRANSIT TALK You'd be crazy to drive a car here - the subway is so much faster. But when the weather is nice, I'll bike up the West Side Highway to class. CAMERON SAYS Have fun, do all the reading and learn how to work in groups.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Buck Shops Here

BYLINE: By JACK HITT

 BODY:
Heather Mann writes a blog called Dollar Store Crafts, which evolved from her occasional trips to the extreme-discount dollar stores near her home in Salem, Ore. Her readers admire her gift for buying really cheap stuff and then making cool and beautiful things from the pile. Her knockoff ''alien abduction lamp'' is jury-rigged from a small light fixture, two plastic bowls (flying saucer), a clear acrylic tumbler (tractor beam) and a small plastic toy cow (abductee) -- all purchased for about five bucks.
As we entered her favorite store, a Dollar Tree in Salem, Mann warned me that I'd have to hustle to keep up with her. ''Look at these,'' she said. ''Cute.'' Before I could even examine her find -- a rack of smushy yellow chickens on sticks (plastic toy? Garden ornament? Edible peeps?) -- she had ricocheted down another aisle, where I found her studying a prominent display garishly pushing a superabsorbent shammy. Mann noted that this was not the famously kitschy ShamWow! but a very cheap imitation called, merely, Wow. The display boasted, ''As Seen on TV.''
''As in, you've seen the real ad on TV,'' she said. 
All around, the stacks of products and aisles of merchandise screamed a technicolor siren song. I found four AA batteries for my tape recorder for a dollar ($5.49 when I spotted them the next day at RadioShack), and dish towels that might have sold for $5 elsewhere were just a buck. Mann now brandished something called a ''wineglass holder'' the way Jacques Cousteau might have held up a starfish. It was a small aluminum device meant to clip onto your plastic picnic plate ''for hands-free dining and socializing.'' At a price of four for a dollar, it's a good deal if your world is overrun with miserly wine connoisseurs.
When I looked up, Mann was already around the corner, having fun with a bottle of discount detergent boasting a ''bingo bango mango'' scent. Just up the way was a bin of brown bags marked either ''A Surprise for a Boy'' or ''A Surprise for a Girl.'' Mann's 5-year-old niece accompanied us on our tour and was crazed with excitement over these, and the truth is, we were all in the same exact mood. All around us, strange things hung here and there, urging us on an unending treasure hunt. Perhaps, like me, you have driven by and occasionally stopped in a dollar store and assumed that there were two kinds of customers, those there for the kitschy pleasure of it all -- the Heather Manns of the world -- and those for whom the dollar store affords a low-rent version of the American Consumer Experience, a place where the poor can splurge. That's true. But current developments in this, the low end of retail, suggest that a larger shift in the American consumer market is under way.
We are awakening to a dollar-store economy. For years the dollar store has not only made a market out of the detritus of a hyperproductive global manufacturing system, but it has also made it appealing -- by making it amazingly cheap. Before the market meltdown of 2008 and the stagnant, jobless recovery that followed, the conventional wisdom about dollar stores -- whether one of the three big corporate chains (Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree) or any of the smaller chains (like ''99 Cents Only Stores'') or the world of independents -- was that they appeal to only poor people. And while it's true that low-wage earners still make up the core of dollar-store customers (42 percent earn $30,000 or less), what has turned this sector into a nearly recession-proof corner of the economy is a new customer base. ''What's driving the growth,'' says James Russo, a vice president with the Nielsen Company, a consumer survey firm, ''is affluent households.''
The affluent are not just quirky D.I.Y. types. These new customers are people who, though they have money, feel as if they don't, or soon won't. This anxiety -- sure to be restoked by the recent stock-market gyrations and generally abysmal predictions for the economy -- creates a kind of fear-induced pleasure in selective bargain-hunting. Rick Dreiling, the chief executive of Dollar General, the largest chain, with more than 9,500 stores, calls this idea the New Consumerism. ''Savings is fashionable again,'' Dreiling told me. ''A gallon of Clorox bleach, say, is $1.44 at a drugstore or $1.24 at a grocery store, and you pay a buck for it at the Dollar General. When the neighbors come over, they can't tell where you bought it, and you save anywhere from 20 to 40 cents, right?''
Financial anxiety -- or the New Consumerism, if you like -- has been a boon to dollar stores. Same-store sales, a key measure of a retailer's health, spiked at the three large, publicly traded chains in this year's first quarter -- all were up by at least 5 percent -- while Wal-Mart had its eighth straight quarterly decline. Dreiling says that much of Dollar General's growth is generated by what he calls ''fill-in trips'' /-- increasingly made by wealthier people. Why linger in the canyons of Wal-Mart or Target when you can pop into a dollar store? Dreiling says that 22 percent of his customers make more than $70,000 a year and added, ''That 22 percent is our fastest-growing segment.''
This growth has led to a building campaign. At a time when few businesses seem to be investing in new equipment or ventures or jobs, Dreiling's company announced a few months ago that it would be creating 6,000 new jobs by building 625 new stores this year. Kiley Rawlins, vice president for investor relations at Family Dollar, said her company would add 300 new stores this year, giving it more than 7,000 in 44 states.
And yet, how do dollar stores expand and make impressive returns, all the while dealing in an inventory that still largely retails for a few dollars? How does a store sell four AA batteries for $1? In part this market takes advantage of the economy degrading all around it. When I asked Dreiling about the difference in the cost of RadioShack batteries, he said that ''RadioShack is probably in a better spot in the same shopping center,'' while Dollar General might be in a ''C+, B site.'' RadioShack pays the high rent, while the dollar stores inhabit a ''no-frills box.''
The dollar-store combination has more to it than low store rents and really cheap products. The labor force needed to run a dollar store is a tiny, low-wage staff. Do the math of Dreiling's announcement: 6,000 jobs divided by 625 stores equals about 10 jobs per store.
Perhaps this is all merely our grandparents' Woolworth's five-and-dime updated by inflation to a dollar and adapted, like any good weed, to distressed areas of the landscape. But a new and eroding reality in American life underwrites this growing market. Yet even deep discounters have limits. In early June, Dollar General predicted that its sales growth would slow slightly for the rest of the year. Dreiling told analysts in a conference call that his company would be very careful about raising prices, even though its costs for fuel and such were rising. ''This sounds almost silly,'' he said, ''but a $1 item going to $1.15 in our channel is a major change for our customer.'' Such delicate price sensitivity suggests what is changing. Howard Levine, the chief executive of Family Dollar, said to me, although ''not necessarily a good thing for our country, more and more people are living paycheck to paycheck.''
Profit margins have always been thin in the dollar stores. But now that they are competing for the shrinking disposable income of the middle class, there is a new kind of consultant out there -- the dollar-store fixer. Bob Hamilton advises the troubled independent-dollar-store manager on the tactics needed to survive and thrive in the dollar-store economy. One afternoon he drove me to Beaverton, Ore., to give me a tour of a Dollar Tree store whose layout and strategy he thinks is exemplary in its competitive cunning.
In Hamilton's view, the secret of a good dollar store is an obsessive manager who can monitor 8,000 to 10,000 items, constantly varying product display tactics, and sense the changing interests of a local customer base. This frenzied drama requires a sharp eye for tiny details. ''The market is moving all the time,'' Hamilton said as we entered the store. Right away, he threw up his arms, thrilled. This was just before Easter, and he pointed out the big holiday display practically in the doorway, an in-our-face explosion of color and delight that herded us away from the exit. ''The natural inclination is to move to the right,'' Hamilton said, nodding at the cash registers on the left. The hunt was on.
Hamilton pointed out that the aisles are about two inches wider than two shopping carts, which themselves are comically tiny, giving the buyer a sense that even a small pile of goods is lavish. Despite the dollar store's reputation for shoddy products, the mise-en-scene nevertheless suggests a kind of luxury, if only of quantity. ''The first thing you feel is this thing is packed with merchandise,'' Hamilton said, pointing out the high shelves along the walls. Helium balloons strained upward, everywhere. Any empty wall space was filled with paper signage proclaiming savings or ''$1'' and framing the store's goods.
But wait! There, in the middle of the aisle, was a tower of candy boxes, razored open and overflowing with cheap sweets. ''They do this a lot with facial tissue or back-to-school items,'' Hamilton said. But it was blocking the aisle -- a deadly error in his view. Worse are the managers who deliberately create cul-de-sacs by closing off the back of an aisle with goods. ''You have to turn around and come back!'' Hamilton said, shaking his head in disbelief. ''You just watch the customers, and they will skip the aisle, every one of them.''
The idea, Hamilton explained, is to create a kind of primal experience and a certain meditative flow. ''My theory was to get them in a pattern, and they will just go up and down and go, 'Oh, I forgot I need that,' and pick it up.''
At one point in the tour, Hamilton spotted patches of bare shelf space and was practically ashamed. His model store was committing egregious mistakes. ''This is probably the worst aisle we've been down,'' he whispered. He dashed to a single barren metal hook and pointed in horror. ''They have an empty peg! People are thinking, I'm getting the last one!'' The stuffed bins, the boxes on wood pallets sitting on the floor, the merchandise piled to the ceiling -- all this breeds an excited sense that everything just got here and you're getting to it first.
''You always keep things full,'' he said. And always keep the higher part of the shelves engorged with product. ''People buy at eye level,'' he added. Hamilton advised that products should be hung in vertical strips so that in a walk up the aisle, the eye can distinguish one item from the next. We arrived to a back wall covered entirely in plastic, pillar after pillar of household cleaning supplies, a kaleidoscopic blaze of primary colors. Bob Hamilton was one happy man.
''Shopping is our hunting and gathering,'' says Sharon Zukin, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College who specializes in consumer culture and suggests that the dollar-store experience is a mere updating of our evolutionary instincts. ''This bare-bones aesthetic puts across the idea that there is nothing between you the consumer and the goods that you desire. You are a bargain hunter, and it's not like a bazaar or open-market situation in other regions of the world. It doesn't require personal haggling between the shopkeeper and the shoppers. Right? The price is set, and it's there for the taking. In many cases the cartons there have not been unpacked! You are getting the product direct from the anonymous large-scale producer. You have bagged the deer: you have your carton of 36 rolls of toilet paper.''
As strange as sociological metaphors sound in this context, this is very close to how the corporate chain executives describe the next stage of dollar-store evolution, as they try to please their new, more affluent customer. Both Dollar General and Family Dollar are moving toward uniformity in their design and layout, throwing off the serendipity that came of buying random lots and salvage goods and was so admired by, say, crafts bloggers. The new design has opened up the front of the stores ''for those whose trip is all about, 'I'm getting what I need and getting out,' '' said Rawlins of Family Dollar. As a result, the design of the store is no longer catch-as-catch-can but built around groupings of products that all make sense for the mission-oriented hunter. Store designers call these groupings ''adjacencies'' and draw them up in fine detail in an architectural schematic called a planogram. Toys, wrapping paper and gift cards, for instance, are laid out in a logical sequence that has been revealed by elaborate customer research and designed with precision.
''A hundred percent of our stores are planogrammed,'' Dreiling of Dollar General says. ''We used to have what was called 'flex space,' and 25 percent of the store was where the store manager could put in whatever they wanted.'' No more. ''Everything is planogrammed now.'''
''Today we have very little in terms of closeouts,'' said Family Dollar's Rawlins. ''Forty-five percent of our merchandise are national brands that we carry every day.'' Even though the goods are still deeply discounted, the stores will begin to have a similar look and layout -- like the higher-end stores already do. Same inventory, same layout, same experience -- from coast to coast.
As all these stores expand into really cheap food, they are creating their own store brands. Just as A.&P. long ago, or Target more recently, pronounced its market significance by creating store brands like Ann Page or Archer Farms foods, Family Dollar now sells Family Gourmet packaged meals, and Dollar General promotes its line of discounted packaged foods with the bucolic handle Clover Valley.
What does all this mean for the independent dollar stores? Is there a place for them in the evolving dollar-store economy? There is, but only if they are willing to hustle for pennies.
I called JC Sales, one of the big warehouse suppliers of independent dollar stores located south of Los Angeles, and talked to Wally Lee, director of marketing and technology. He agreed there was little room for error now. If I wanted to open a dollar store, I asked him, where would he suggest I locate it? ''Right next to a Wal-Mart or a Target,'' he said. And how large should my new store be? ''If you want to be profitable, start with an 8,000-square-foot store,'' he said. ''That is the most optimally profitable among all our customers.'' Stores can be as small as 1,000 square feet and go up to 20,000, but Lee implied that there is practically an algorithm of size, labor and expenses -- 8,000 to 10,000 square feet is profitability's sweet spot. But it's not all science, Lee said. The very absence of a plan/ogram is the other advantage independents can have.
''You need to have a good store manager who loves to talk to people,'' Lee said. ''If it is a Spanish market, then it has to be a Spanish manager to speak to them to see what their needs are. If you don't do that, you'll never beat anybody else.''
In other words, even as the corporate chains standardize their inventory and planogram their stores down to the last Wow shammy, the independents flourish by retaining a Bob Hamilton-like sensibility -- the sense that the market is in motion -- with managers buzzing about the store, constantly tweaking the inventory, moving stuff around, ordering things that people request, changing the lineup again, trying out a different placement, listening, yakking and hand-trucking more product onto the floor.
In the basement of American capitalism, you can see the invisible hand at work, except it's not invisible. It's actually your hand.
The streamlining of the big dollar stores opens up, for other outlets, their original source of cheap merchandise: distressed goods, closeouts, overstock, salvage merchandize, department-store returns, liquidated goods, discontinued lines, clearance items, ex-catalog stock, freight-damaged goods, irregulars, salvage cosmetics, test-market items and bankruptcy inventories.
This secondary market supplies another stratum of retail chains below the dollar-store channel, one of the best known being Big Lots. Hamilton explained that if these guys don't sell the merchandise, it bumps on down the line to another level known as liquidators.
Hamilton drove me out to Steve's Liquidators outside Portland, Ore. It was marked by only a sign on the road. The store itself was an unadorned massive warehouse, with not even a sign over the door, a Euclidean concrete cube painted a bright lime green with lemon yellow trim.
As we entered, a scruffy man exited, pushing a busted cart -- each palsied wheel pulling in a different direction -- into a busy parking lot brimming with older-model automobiles. Inside, the store could not have been more spare, a decrepit imitation of a standard suburban grocery store. Exposed warehouse ceilings above, and below, an unfinished shop floor occupied by metal industrial shelving with aisles wide and deep enough to forklift in the goods. Here is where food products minutes away from expiration hover, on the cusp of becoming compost.
A pallet of giant restaurant-grade cans formed a giant ingot of eggplant in tomato sauce. Hamilton examined the cans, each dented and dinged, labels torn -- all still sitting on a wooden pallet, partly in its shrink-wrap. ''Must have fallen off a truck,'' he mused. There were sparse fruits and vegetables and rows of salvaged canned goods. Scattered throughout and along the sides were whatever else had been left behind at the dollar stores and then the closeout stores and maybe even the thrift shops -- dozens of princess night lights, a single mattress leaning against a wall, a pallet of car oil, an array of carpets, a thousand boxes of the same generic cornflakes, a leaf blower. Back in the car, I asked Hamilton where the merchandise would go if it didn't sell here.
''The Dumpster,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Night Is Young

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KEATING

 BODY:
''WHERE is the school bus to pick up all of these kids?'' a 27-year-old man was wondering aloud around 11:30 p.m., in a parking lot outside the nightclub SL East on Three Mile Harbor Road in East Hampton, N.Y. It was a hot Saturday night in July, and around him girls who appeared to be about 18 were huddled together, illuminated by a chandelier and the sickly hue of their smartphones.
Behind a velvet rope was Ryan Skolnick, 23, a D.J. and promoter: texting, phoning, urging a new wave of fresh-faced arrivals toward the club. ''I saw that there was no one taking care of my age demographic in the Hamptons,'' said the scruffy-cheeked, tanned Mr. Skolnick, a University of Miami student, explaining his decision to work at the club, sometimes with help from his fraternal twin, Matthew, also a D.J. (he is mainly a producer), who goes by the last name Sterling.
The club scene in the Hamptons has always attracted the young, but this summer the crowd has seemed downright larval -- thanks in part to a new breed of promoter, like the brothers, that is barely of drinking age, but has Facebook contacts in the four digits. 
Matthew said he had been a D.J. a few times, and Ryan said that he used to promote at Nello Summertimes in Southampton on Saturday nights, but that the party there ended earlier than it was supposed to, after a New York Post article highlighting under-age drinking and drug use led to a police investigation. Now the brothers have moved operations to SL East, though they are vague about their commitment there.
''I do bring a good amount of people every Saturday, but I just do it to help out and have a good time,'' Matthew said.
Much like the term ''producer'' in Hollywood, the job of promoter is veiled in a certain ambiguity. ''A lot of people claim to be promoters, but they're really just hanging out with the promoter and want to sound like they're cool, like, 'Yeah, yeah, I work there, I work there,''' said Eugene Remm, an owner of EMM Group, a hospitality, lifestyle and management company that also oversees SL East as well as Tenjune, a popular place in Manhattan. ''It's part of the game with people. They're not necessarily promoters there; they just want to be able to get access to whatever pretty girl that they want to invite out or whatever group of guys that are their buddies that they want to say they have some access that someone else doesn't.''
Mr. Remm said that on a typical weekend night his clubs will hire three or four official hosts. ''Those hosts have the ability to hire subpromoters,'' he said, a category also known as ''subs.'' ''I don't necessarily know who they hire, or if they're necessarily paying them. Maybe paid in a couple free drinks and be able to feel like they're part of the team.''
Asked how he decides who gains admission to his clubs, Mr. Remm passed the buck to his doormen. ''We're willing to lose out on a few dollars in order to justify and maintain the brand,'' he said, adding a crowd of young people clamoring to get in can be good for business, even if they aren't allowed. ''It doesn't hurt us. It only creates a better energy at the front door, which allows us to be more selective as to who we invite.''
At SL East, at least, his safety net appeared to be working. A group of six girls had tried to sneak in through the back exit of SL East, walking with as much confidence as they could with their heels getting stuck in the gravel.
''We need security back here!'' a guard shouted.
SL EAST also sporadically employs Jake Truen, 21, who said he has promoted since he was in high school at Half Hollow Hills in Dix Hills, N.Y. In a telephone interview, Mr. Truen said his youth posed a distinctive advantage in the field. ''The kids are the ones spending the money to get into these clubs,'' he said.
Mr. Truen said he ''hates'' promoting (the term has a negative connotation, he said) but does it because he enjoys going to parties. And the process is relatively simple: He sends a mass text message from his BlackBerry telling his 450-person list of acquaintances where to go, and who is the D.J., at a club on a particular night.
''I've made a lot of connections,'' Mr. Truen said, ''so if Avicii is at South Pointe, I will call the owner of the club directly, tell him I'm coming, who I'm bringing, how much money will be spent, and that I want 10 percent of what my clients spend.'' (Jonathan Schwartz, an owner of South Pointe, which is in Southampton, said: ''We don't have any promoters who are 21. The youngest promoter we have on payroll is 26 years old.'')
Mr. Truen said that he can make $1,500 on a typical Saturday night.
(Mr. Remm expressed incredulity at this. ''There is no person that works for me who makes $1,500 a night,'' he said. ''If they did I could quit my job and do that.'' )
Before Mr. Truen's clients head to the club, he said, they e-mail requests for a table. Then he simply forwards the messages to staff members at SL East, and the customers are put into the reservation system as Mr. Truen's ''clients,'' enabling his commission to be calculated.
Though he works for several different venues, Mr. Truen said he considered SL East to be the best establishment in the Hamptons. ''We are responsible for filling one-third of the club with our clients, who are all college students,'' he said. Asked how the clubs monitor under-age clubgoers, he said: ''They won't turn down under-age tables or ignore them, but we're not really their main crowd. They put us in one section toward the side, or the back of the club and it will be like 150 kids I know.''
But the boundaries can be porous, as Nello Balan, the owner of Nello Summertimes, can attest. After the Post article, it was reported that the local police sent an undercover agent to the establishment and arrested a bartender for serving her (two other arrests were made at 75 Main across the street).
The Southampton police didn't return calls for comment, but Mr. Balan said that since the incident he has shaken up his management structure. ''We made a mistake and used a promoter,'' Mr. Balan said. ''It's a bad idea to use promoters. They try and bring as many people as possible, and it's not the same crowd. A lot of places in the Hamptons hire promoters, and it's probably a much younger crowd.''
Mr. Truen argued, however, that allowing junior clients past the velvet rope has become an economic necessity for clubs.
''Older people don't want to go out on a Tuesday or Thursday night,'' he said. ''Kids will, though. They obviously don't have to worry about going to work in the morning and will spend a lot of money to get in.''
Mr. Remm brushed away the suggestion that SL East is a hangout for under-age drinkers. ''Our typical group at SL East mirrors our crowd at SL in New York -- it's an affluent New York demographic,'' he said. And Mr. Schwartz characterized South Pointe's clientele as being ''in their late 20s and 30s,'' adding, ''While some clubs are promoter-driven and cheesy, we've tried to stay away from that.''
But Mark Baker, a nightlife veteran who used to work as a director of operations for Conscience Point in Southampton (infamous for a 2001 incident involving the publicist Lizzie Grubman and an S.U.V.), has noticed a palpable shift to college-age and even younger clientele, and traced it to a time when Manhattan club owners began opening outposts on the East End.
''All of the promoters that they use, a lot of them are kids,'' Mr. Baker, 49, said. ''And they're bringing their kids with them.''
Now, he said: ''There is nowhere for the older crowd to go. Maybe Nobu, on the deck, but it was a very humid summer.''
Some promoters are not even of drinking age. Howard Jameson, 19, a student at Pace University who is now manager of client relations of Riff Raff's at the Hurricane Club in the Flatiron district in Manhattan, said he has been promoting since he was at Soundview Preparatory School in Westchester, logging stints at Marquee and Avenue. Mr. Jameson said he has booked clients from SL in the city for SL East, along with Day and Night, a roving party run by another pair of brothers, Daniel and David Koch.
''They will go out and get bottles,'' Mr. Jameson said with some weariness of the East End under-age crowd, ''and then the next day they will have to listen to their parents bicker about it.''
(One can see why such a summer job might appeal more than, say, scooping ice cream. ''The club pays me cash in full, and then I take that money and subdivide it out to whoever else I have promoting for me,'' Mr. Jameson said. ''A thousand dollars in hand, and I might have two or three guys do all of the promoting, which means I literally do no work.'' )
Marc Henry, a doorman at Georgica Restaurant and Lounge in Wainscott in East Hampton, said that he had noticed the trend of under-age clients -- but not at his club. ''We don't have a single promoter on a Saturday night,'' Mr. Henry said in a phone interview. We don't attract the younger crowd, like some of these other venues do. I've had people leave Georgica, go to other venues, and come back and say, 'Hey we walked into this club, and we just walked right out because it was just all young kids.' ''
At the Surf Lodge in Montauk on that hot July night, Julian Cavin, 21, from Park Slope, Brooklyn, was leaning back on a wicker chair. Mr. Cavin said he has promoted since he was 16, while attending Beacon High School in Manhattan, and said he promoted three times this summer when ''big D.J.'s'' were playing South Pointe. He also D.J.'s for Goldbar. But tonight he decided to chill out at a place where flip-flops are encouraged and bottle minimums don't exist.
Mr. Cavin briefly attended Brandeis University, but dropped out after one year to pursue being a D.J. He already talks about the night-life world with a certain jadedness.
''A lot of kids will just do it to look cool, so they can tweet about it or Facebook about it, so they can bring girls in, pour them a drink in the club and feel like a baller,'' Mr. Cavin said of promoting. ''It's a false sense of reality.''
He described the crowd at South Pointe, where he has drawn crowds for the D.J.'s Avicci, Calvin Harris and Wolfgang Gartner, as ''young hot girls and balding old men.'' And he scoffed at the idea that clubs regulate the age of clientele. ''If Justin Bieber walks up to South Pointe, we are obviously letting him in.'' he said. ''Age is meaningless.''
Though he said he makes a few hundred dollars per promoting gig, Mr. Cavin professed to already being sick of the scene.
''When I'm at South Pointe I feel like I could be on 14th Street in Manhattan in a dark room,'' he said. ''I just want to be on the beach.''

HEADLINE: Scouting the City For Her Characters

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
A SUMMER afternoon in Chelsea, and Sarah Jones was on a recon mission, searching for ... she did not know what, exactly. An accent, for starters. An ethnic wild card. ''Hybridity,'' she said, using a word she uses often to describe her field of urban study.
She noted a young man with a do-rag under his baseball cap and a belt buckle in the shape of a handgun; a Caribbean woman pushing a white baby in a designer stroller; a heavy woman smoking a long, exaggeratedly slim cigarette. ''The slim cigarette trumps the fact that she wasn't talking to anyone,'' Ms. Jones said, turning to follow the woman. ''Nobody smokes those anymore.''
Ms. Jones asked the woman for a cigarette, but got nothing useful in return. ''She didn't say, 'Yeah, honey, you can have one,' '' Ms. Jones said, shifting her voice to sound like a Bensonhurst ashtray, circa 1938. ''I'm looking for something else.'' 
Ms. Jones, 37, might be described as an unlicensed anthropologist, an explorer of the cultural fault lines that unite and divide the city. More plainly, she is a playwright and performer whose one-woman shows carry her through rapid successions of ethnically diverse male and female roles: a Russian immigrant or an elderly Jewish woman; an Italian cop or a Brooklyn rapper seeking treatment for rhyme addiction; an American Indian comedian or a Chinese-American woman whose daughter, to her disappointment, is lesbian.
Since she won a Tony Award in 2006 for her show ''Bridge and Tunnel,'' Ms. Jones has been searching for her next subject and next cast of characters, making one-off appearances at gatherings of business leaders, as a Unicef goodwill ambassador and at the White House, where she performed in 2009. In the interim she got divorced from her husband and behind-the-scenes collaborator, the slam poet Steve Colman, and received a commission from Lincoln Center to develop an unspecified show. She does not know what it will be about.
So the clock is ticking.
MS. JONES agreed to let a reporter follow her on two reconnaissance outings to look for new characters and to do what she does: explore the hidden tensions and weirdnesses that make New York City the global theater that it is.
''This is a new experience for me, to be with someone else,'' she said, straining her ears for fruitful sidewalk disruption. She gravitated toward Zen Bikes on 24th Street, where two women were arguing, alternating in English and Spanish. Ms. Jones pretended to talk on her mobile phone so she could get close and listen.
''She's not happy,'' Ms. Jones said of the older woman. ''And she's not happy in two different languages, which is perfect for me.''
She gave the argument a chance to develop. Was it between a mother and daughter? Were they like her own Dominican relatives, who add spice to the vast stew of her ethnic background?
Ms. Jones edged closer, then backed off, continuing on her surveillance rounds. Barbecue smells wafted from Madison Square Park. A Senegalese woman asked for directions, and Ms. Jones answered her in French. Tourists spoke every language known to man. She walked on. If she was feeling pressure to produce, she did not voice it.
''I'm practicing a kind of meandering faith, or faithful meandering,'' she said. ''I just trust that something is coming. I don't know what it is. But I've been a straphanger all my life; I know what it's like to not know when the next train is coming, but I trust the subway.''
Ms. Jones, the daughter of a white mother and a black father, both doctors, came by her cultural inquisitiveness early, as a child in Baltimore trying to figure out who she was. When she brought home forms from school asking her to designate her race, her mother would cross out the line and write ''human,'' she said.
''My grandmothers are Irish-American and German-American; my grandfather is from the Caribbean,'' Ms. Jones said. ''My father is African-American. My family looked funny. I just started naturally imitating whoever I was talking to. I didn't want to be a phony, but I felt very authentic in the moment. I don't think of it as having a fractured self, but as having many interconnecting selves, concentric identities.''
Things got more interesting when the family moved to Jamaica, Queens, and Ms. Jones attended the United Nations International School, where her background suddenly seemed vanilla compared with her classmates'. Then at Bryn Mawr College, the diversity she had come to take for granted suddenly evaporated. Ms. Jones, who dropped out after two years, had her mission.
On Fifth Avenue she ducked into a Sephora cosmetics store, where for some reason she decided she would be least conspicuous as a tall, caramel-complexioned Russian. No one looked at her funny.
''Excuse me,'' she said to a salesman, an African-American man with giant glasses and a subtle touch of gray. ''We were saying you were like beautiful man, Andre Leon Talley,'' the iconic figure from Vogue magazine and ''America's Next Top Model,'' whose name survived even her linguistic roughhousing.
''Everyone says I look like him,'' the man said. ''I wish I had his money.''
''Never too late,'' the babushka replied.
In truth, the man's lament fit a theme that has been tugging at Ms. Jones as a possibility for her next show: the brutality of the economy and the wedges it has driven through the city. Outside the store, she put on a British accent to talk with a woman selling jewelry on a sidewalk table. Within minutes the woman described how she had been laid off from her job in the fashion industry.
''That's fascinating,'' Ms. Jones said.
She bought a ring for $20. The woman, Lisa Clarke, 48, wrote her name and number for Ms. Jones.
For the playwright, a story line was taking shape.
''How did we get from that woman having a middle-class experience in America in the '70s to now she sells jewelry in the streets?'' she asked afterward. ''I promise you she does not have health coverage. Her father was a piano teacher. How did that happen, and what is that story? It's not going to be a Michael Moore diatribe. But my first thought is just, this is the reality of today, that companies can get away with paying people next to nothing. That's the through line: the guy in Sephora -- 'Oh, honey, if I had his money.' And I know if I just pursue that conversation a little I'll find out how much he makes an hour and if he has health insurance. Every time I overhear something, a financial component is there, and not far behind that is a health story. And those things are very connected up for me. That's where I've been hovering.''
Ms. Jones got her start reading at poetry slams at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in the East Village and her first break on HBO's ''Def Poetry Jam,'' where she performed a feminist rewrite of Gil Scott-Heron's ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' (''Your revolution will not happen between these thighs,'' she recited). Mr. Scott-Heron, who died in May, was a friend of her father's, and gave her the opening slot on a concert tour.
''He was like spoken-word royalty to us,'' she said of Mr. Scott-Heron. But she said she blushed now to see clips of the poem, ''Your Revolution.''
''I was getting up there like, 'Hi, y'all,' '' she said. ''That's part of me, but that's not all of me. I remember going home like, I don't really talk like that. I was telling this all-black story. I was playing a spoken-word artist. I quickly realized it was O.K. for me to bring the other voices onstage, and people would respond to them.''
AFTER a few hours on the streets, Ms. Jones had not found what she wanted. She seemed a bit rusty or unfocused, watching the panorama rather than immersing herself in it. Maybe the problem was that it was a Sunday, she said. Weekends were for tourists. Midweek was when people's wheels squeaked.
A few days later, at a construction site on West 14th Street, Ms. Jones's faith appeared to be rewarded. A Latina Con Edison worker let her long hair fall from under her hard hat. A man in a beret and blazer collected cans. Nearby were a vocational center for people with disabilities, a Salvation Army outpost and the Norwood, a members-only social club to which Ms. Jones belongs. The street was a place for wealth and poverty to mingle and collide, as they do in her shows.
''Today I'm just looking for somebody inspiring,'' she said, zeroing in on the Con Ed woman. ''So far she's my favorite. I'm just looking for some strange juxtapositions, like a petite, long-haired, shirt-too-big, female construction worker. I'm interested in it from a feminist perspective; I'm interested in it from an economic perspective, this moment in New York. Did she used to do something else? She doesn't look that young. Is this a second career? This provided better benefits? How risky is this job? I don't see her every day.''
''And Con Ed workers have the best accents,'' she added. ''These are Lawn Guyland guys, or Jersey.''
But from this group, too, Ms. Jones seemed to be held at a distance. As she expanded her patrol of the area, an explanation began to present itself. The New York she documented so intimately in ''Bridge and Tunnel'' back in 2006 had changed, as it does between any two blinks of an eye. Ms. Jones's explorations were shaping up as a study in loss.
At the playground where she expected to find brown nannies and white children, mothers were the rule. ''This is weird,'' she said. Just feet from her apartment in Greenwich Village she saw a Starbucks she had never noticed before. Even the accents did not crackle and pop where expected.
''There was a time when if you listened to anyone from Russell Simmons to -- I mean, Russell Simmons has a little bit of Ed Koch in his accent,'' she said. ''There's that lovely Eastern European influence on his New Yawkese. It's that hybridity I love. But you can say goodbye to that.''
During her research for ''Bridge and Tunnel,'' she found this hybridity in a Chinese-American woman from Flushing, Queens, who said ''dawta'' for daughter. That dropped ''r'' was a part of New York history, Ms. Jones said, a story of immigration and struggle and unlikely cultural intermingling -- exactly the story she felt born to tell. But it was a story in eclipse, she said.
''That sound is being smoothed out by the influx of Minnesotans and Michiganders and all these people who grew up watching 'Sex and the City' and want to come here and live like Carrie,'' she said. ''And they can and they do.''
FINALLY, she spotted a character who interested her, a transsexual in a bright green minidress, collecting cans on her bicycle. The cans were an economic story at least. Ms. Jones approached her in hopes that more would follow. She was not disappointed.
''I don't know how to explain it,'' the woman said. She wore bright red lipstick and heavy eye makeup and called herself Crystal Scott, using her former first name as her surname. A flag over her bicycle identified her as a ''she-male.'' She was 66 years old and in very good shape. ''My life is totally unbelievable,'' she said.
With encouragement but little prompting from Ms. Jones, the story came out: childhood polio and tuberculosis, military school in the 1960s, addiction to crack cocaine.
''Whatever came my way I adjusted to it and survived, by any means necessary,'' Ms. Scott said. ''And anything I did in life, the means was necessary.''
Ms. Jones owned up that she was a playwright looking for characters. To Ms. Scott this made perfect sense. She had more to tell, so much more.
''Miss Crystal, you're blowing my mind,'' Ms. Jones said. ''I think we are going to meet again.''
She took Ms. Scott's telephone number and promised to call. Maybe something would come of it, maybe not.
It was getting late, and Ms. Scott had more cans to collect.
She got on her brightly decorated bicycle and rode to the next garbage can, in search of New York's unredeemed but ever-so-valuable treasure. Sarah Jones continued on the same search.

HEADLINE: The K.G.B.'s Bathhouse Plot

BYLINE: By VICTOR SEBESTYEN

 BODY:
Victor Sebestyen is a Hungarian-born journalist and the author of ''Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire.''
London
THE plot was hatched at a bathhouse in downtown Moscow. At midmorning on Saturday, Aug. 17, 1991, the head of the K.G.B., Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, summoned five senior Soviet officials for a highly secretive meeting that he told them would be vital for the future of the U.S.S.R.
Wrapped in towels in the steam room, and later while cooling down over vodka and Scotch, the half-dozen die-hard Communist apparatchiks outlined a plan to overthrow the Soviet government. For the Soviet spymaster, the prime minister, defense minister and the other paunchy, half-naked co-conspirators, the stakes could not have been higher. And they had to act quickly.
The country was in a shambles, and the chaos of democracy and nationalism threatened to destroy it entirely, the K.G.B. chief warned. The Baltic states had already moved toward independence and something had to be done to silence Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, the noisy, newly elected president of the Russian republic, whose belligerent, man-of-the-people style made him by far the most popular politician in the country, mainly because of his attacks on the privileges of the Communist Party elite. 
Likewise, the coup plotters insisted, the weak and spineless Soviet president and party boss, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had to go. He had proposed signing a new treaty that would turn the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics into a looser federation of autonomous states, most of which intended to turn their backs on socialism. The treaty would mean the end of the U.S.S.R., and that could not be tolerated.
A plan was hastily formulated. One group of conspirators flew to Crimea, where Mr. Gorbachev was on vacation, with the goal of forcing him to abandon the treaty or resign. If he refused, a regiment of K.G.B. troops would hold him captive indefinitely at his seaside villa. The others would stay in Moscow, ready to take over the levers of power and use force to assert their authority if challenged.
A list was drawn up of the names of 200 people who would be immediately arrested, the first of whom was Yeltsin. The Lefortovo prison in Moscow was emptied in preparation for new prisoners, and 250,000 pairs of handcuffs were ordered to be sent to Moscow from a factory in Pskov.
Not one of the conspirators counseled caution or seemed to consider the law of unintended consequences: within a few days their ill-prepared coup attempt would bring forward all that they feared most. Their ''patriotic action'' would once and for all remove their beloved U.S.S.R. from the map.
The coup was a fiasco from the start. Mr. Gorbachev refused to resign or to shun the treaty. At dawn on Aug. 19, Muscovites woke to the announcement on radio and TV that an Emergency Committee had been formed to govern the country. Then, for several hours, the state-controlled airwaves went dead -- except for a continuous loop of ''Swan Lake'' that played for hours. Most Muscovites were unaffected by the coup; their principal memories of it are the sound of Tchaikovsky.
The drama was confined to one small area -- around the White House in Moscow, home of Russia's Parliament -- and lasted a few hours. The bungling putschists failed to arrest any of their targets or to control communications, and soldiers refused to fire on the crowds outside the White House.
To his own amazement, Yeltsin was not apprehended at the start of the operation. Indeed, the central image of the August coup is of a brave and vigorous Yeltsin climbing onto a tank to make a defiant statement denouncing the plotters. And he retained a telephone line enabling him to coordinate his support. This stirring scene was foolishly allowed to be shown on TV that evening, turning the obscure Yeltsin into a figure of world significance overnight.
The joke swiftly went around Moscow that you knew Communism must be through in Russia when the Bolsheviks couldn't even mount a proper coup. At a news conference that evening, the nominal head of the Emergency Committee, the Soviet vice president, Gennadi I. Yanayev, was seen in public for the first time. A gray 53-year-old bureaucrat with nicotine-stained fingers and a shiny suit, he was visibly drunk. When he told the lie that Mr. Gorbachev was ill, his hands shook and his hairpiece began to slip.
For all the tragedy and farce of those three August days, the world has plenty for which to thank the incompetent conspirators who hastened the fall of an empire. Less than a week after the coup fizzled, two of its leaders killed themselves, the others were in jail and the Communist Party they sought to save was banned. Yeltsin, the party's principal assassin, was the most powerful man in the country.
For a generation, the failure of Soviet Communism had been evident for all to see. The great experiment that once bred idealism ended in food lines and prison camps. Marx believed that man could be made perfect; Communists found that people had an irritating way of refusing to be perfected.
Yet despite the revolutions in Eastern Europe in 1989, hardly anyone in the summer of 1991 predicted that the U.S.S.R. itself would fall apart by the end of the year. It might have limped on for decades, as the Ottoman Empire did in the late 19th century, dying slowly amid civil wars. Yet the second most powerful country in the world simply withered away, not in the classical Marxist sense, but it literally ceased to exist. And the manner of its going was one of the best things. The Soviet people destroyed the Soviet Union, not outsiders, and not through violent conflict.
BUT what followed has not been a democratic idyll. Despite the putsch's failure, some Soviet residue remains -- a ''coup culture'' that breeds a winner-take-all view of politics. In Russia today, there is no concept of a loyal opposition, no separation of powers, no mass participation in political life and a news media that is far from free.
There was a fleeting opportunity for liberal democracy and genuine free markets to emerge in Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed. But Yeltsin did little to develop civil society, the rule of law, the emergence of viable political parties or a modernized economy after the failed 1991 coup. A few people became very rich, adopting methods reminiscent of, but even more ruthless than, the 19th-century robber barons in the United States. But a middle class with a stake in how the country is run barely exists.
Yeltsin's corrupt cronyism encouraged a gangster capitalism from which Russia is still suffering. But the few years that he and Mr. Gorbachev led the country together seem today a halcyon period for freedom in Russia.
Yeltsin's handpicked successor, Vladimir V. Putin, reversed the few fledgling democratic reforms that had been made, turning Russia into a country that merely goes through the motions of democracy every few years while power remains concentrated in the same hands. Mr. Putin replaced a one-party state with a one-clique state of people around him -- a pattern replicated elsewhere in the former Soviet Union -- financed almost entirely by booming oil and gas revenues.
Today, he is one of the few to lament the Soviet Union's passing. Mr. Putin, who in 1991 was a middle-ranking intelligence officer in St. Petersburg, left the K.G.B. during the coup. To him the collapse of the U.S.S.R. was ''a major geopolitical disaster of the century.''
But for the millions who had to endure life under the Soviet yoke -- born in bloodshed and kept alive for decades through intimidation -- its end was long overdue.
Still, 20 years later, as Mr. Putin's continuing influence and popularity attest, the traditional Russian ideal of a strongman in the Kremlin remains. And depressing as it is, if dire economic times come again, a coup d'etat still seems as likely a way as any for political change to occur in Russia or many former Soviet states. The Bolsheviks may have disappeared for good when Yeltsin climbed atop a tank in August 1991, but the legacy of authoritarian rule lingers.

HEADLINE: Guided By Greed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his July 31 review of Jeff Madrick's ''Age of Greed: The Triumph of Finance and the Decline of America, 1970 to the Present,'' Sebastian Mallaby raises objections to what he says is Madrick's thesis -- namely, that ''a cabal of conservatives, driven first by greed and second by 'extreme free-market ideology,' gradually seized power.'' Mallaby points out that not all financial bosses were greedy. But an ''age of greed'' can occur if greedy bosses dominate the financial industry as a whole, and this is compatible with the existence of some bosses for whom greed isn't a ''guiding philosophy.'' 
Mallaby also challenges Madrick's secondary contention, that the era was marked by ''extreme free-market ideology'' -- though he notes that almost all players in the economy embraced free-market ideas. Because some regulatory efforts were made, Mallaby writes, ''the record hardly supports Madrick's argument that policy was captured by free-market extremists.'' This argument parallels his first. Simply because some regulatory efforts were made, it does not follow that free-market extremism failed to carry the day.
Mallaby says Madrick ''does not deliver on his thesis.'' I don't understand how Madrick can be said to have failed to deliver on his thesis that free-market extremism captured policy, if by ''captured policy'' he means that it influenced policy makers and was put into practice. Support for this is found in Alan Greenspan's Congressional testimony. Believing that the self-interest of banks made them fully capable of protecting their shareholders, he said he had been surprised to discover that his assumption had flaws. Greenspan's surprise shows that he and his imagination were captives of free-market extremism. Otherwise, he would have been able to imagine that a person's self-interests can run contrary to those of her employer.

CLASS WARFARE
Inside the Fight to Fix America's Schools
By Steven Brill
478 pp. Simon & Schuster. $28.
Steven Brill is a graduate of Yale Law School and the founder of Court TV, and in his new book, ''Class Warfare,'' he brings a sharp legal mind to the world of education reform. Like a dogged prosecutor, he mounts a zealous case against America's teachers' unions. From more than 200 interviews, he collects the testimony of idealistic educators, charter school founders, policy gurus, crusading school superintendents and billionaire philanthropists. Through their vivid vignettes, which he pieces together in short chapters with titles like '' 'Colorado Says Half of You Won't Graduate' '' and ''A Shriek on Park Avenue,'' Brill conveys the epiphanies, setbacks and triumphs of a national reform movement.
Some of his subjects, like Wendy Kopp of Teach for America, are by now household names; others, like Jon Schnur, an adviser to the Clinton and Obama administrations, are more obscure. But in Brill's telling, they have all come, over some two decades, to distrust or denounce the unions and to promote the same small set of reforms: increasing the number of charter schools and evaluating and improving teacher quality through merit pay and other measures that rely heavily on student test scores. 
Throughout, Brill reminds us he's just an objective reporter. Disinterested, however, is not how he comes across. He recounts an educator's motto to ''teach like your hair's on fire.'' For most of the book, Brill writes like his hair is on fire. His sympathies clearly lie with the unions' most adamant critics, like Michelle Rhee, the controversial former superintendent of the District of Columbia public schools, and Joel Klein, the combative ex-chancellor of the New York City system.
I say this as someone whom Brill might pick for a jury pool. I taught for three years in New York as a charter member of Teach for America and had my own run-ins with the union. (An article I wrote, which praised Kopp's then-/fledgling organization and made some of the same criticisms Brill does, angered my union representative.) This fall, my daughter will be attending public school, and I'll be teaching at a private, reform-/minded urban academy in New Jersey.
Yet, after reading ''Class Warfare,'' I can't convict -- not least of all because in the book's final chapter, Brill undercuts much of his witnesses' prior testimony in an abrupt and jarring about-face. This chapter isn't wrong. But it underscores a truth Brill spends most of the book trying to avoid: his case is not airtight, and reasonable doubts remain about his subjects' prescriptions for reform.
Brill's book grew out of a 2009 New Yorker article about New York's ''rubber rooms,'' where some 600 teachers facing disciplinary review had languished, for three years on average, collecting full salaries and accruing pension benefits as their cases snaked through the labyrinthine, contractually mandated system for terminating employees. Although these men and women represented a minuscule fraction of the city's 89,000 teachers (and the rubber rooms have since been closed), Brill rightly argues in ''Class Warfare'' that rules for dismissing ineffective or even grossly negligent teachers are sometimes absurdly onerous, time consuming and costly to many schools. As he notes, even Albert Shanker, for decades the renowned president of the American Federation of Teachers, used to argue that unions had a vested interest in ridding their ranks of incompetence. Still, until the country's recent economic collapse, New York's problem wasn't just getting rid of teachers; it was also retaining them. Roughly 20 percent quit after their first year alone, and 40 percent after just three years in the system.
Yet Brill wants us to believe that unions are the primary -- even sole -- cause of failing public schools. But hard evidence for this is scarce. Many of the nation's worst-performing schools (according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress) are concentrated in Southern and Western right-to-work states, where public sector unions are weakest and collective bargaining enjoys little or no protection. Also, if unions are the primary cause of bad schools, why isn't labor's pernicious effect similarly felt in many middle-/class suburbs, like Pelham, N.Y., or Montclair, N.J., which have good schools -- and strong unions?
More problematic for Brill's thesis, charter schools, which are typically freed from union rules, haven't succeeded in the ways their champions once hoped. A small percentage are undeniably superb. But most are not. One particularly rigorous 2009 study, which surveyed approximately half of all charters nationwide and was financed by the pro-/charter Walton Family and Michael and Susan Dell Foundations, found that more than 80 percent either do no better, or actually perform substantially worse, than traditional public schools, a dismal record. The study concluded that ''tremendous variation in academic quality among charters is the norm, not the exception.''
Brill obliquely refers to such research in half a sentence. He then counters that other studies have shown better results for charters, without clearly indicating what these studies are or explaining why they should trump a comprehensive, national study. He then points to the ''central evidentiary value'' of the Knowledge is Power Program, KIPP, the chain of roughly 100 charter schools, founded by two Teach for America alumni, that has produced consistently high student test scores and become a media darling. Yet such exceptions to the rule still don't explain why, if unions are the crucial variable, a vast majority of charters haven't equally thrived.
At the heart of Brill's book is a belief that ''truly effective teaching'' can ''overcome student indifference, parental disengagement and poverty.'' For too long, Brill's reformers argue, union leaders have used such factors to excuse failing teachers protected by tenure. Certainly many adults, not just those in unions, have written off economically disadvantaged or minority students far too readily.
Brill cites policy advocates who argue that students who have top quartile teachers several years in a row could (at least theoretically) make remarkable gains. Absent other proven criteria for determining the most effective teachers, these reformers conclude that schools should base hiring, firing and promotion decisions, at least in substantial part, on teachers' ability to generate year-to-year gains on their students' test scores.
Brill, however, glosses over an important qualifier to such research. Teacher quality may be the most important variable within schools, but mountains of data, going back decades, demonstrates that most of the variation in student performance is explained by nonschool factors: not just poverty, but also parental literacy (and whether parents read to their children), student health, frequent relocations, crime-/related stress and the like.
Brill extols the recent documentary ''Waiting for 'Superman,' '' which argues that better teachers are the key to boosting achievement. But surprisingly, what we see in the movie aren't so much good teachers as academically effective parents: mothers and fathers who, despite difficult circumstances, read with their children, push them to do their homework and actively seek out exceptional charters, which (unlike the mediocre or failing ones) are oversubscribed and thus rely on lotteries with long odds for admission.
Yet to Brill and the filmmakers, these parents' love, sweat and tears must be irrelevant, because what really matters is the quality of a child's teacher. To prove the point, Brill cites one study that shows that students who won the lottery subsequently performed better in school than those who lost. ''Same demographics, same motivation, different result,'' he concludes.
But this argument ignores the aggregate effect of student and parental attitudes. Children who don't win a coveted spot at a program like KIPP don't just miss the charter's arguably better teachers; they also lose out on the self-/reinforcing atmosphere of success and striving that comes from attending a school where everyone -- or at least most students and parents -- has demonstrated an especially deep commitment to learning. At KIPP, for example, students go to school longer each day, each year, and also attend classes on alternating Saturdays and in the summers. Families that don't embrace this ethos leave or can be asked to leave, an option not available to regular public schools.
If you don't believe me, believe Geoffrey Canada, the founder of the Harlem Children's Zone, who is featured in ''Waiting for 'Superman' '' and whom Brill lionizes. In Paul Tough's laudatory book ''Whatever It Takes: Geoffrey Canada's Quest to Change Harlem and America'' (2008), Canada decries KIPP's approach as a kind of reverse ''quarantine, walling off the most promising kids from a sick neighborhood's contagion,'' in Tough's paraphrase. In fact, though Brill and the filmmakers never acknowledge it, Canada's philosophy is actually diametrically opposed to KIPP's. Canada insists such charters can't succeed, at least not with all inner-city children, including those who may be disaffected from school, without substantially increased investments in wraparound social services, which Canada's Harlem Children's Zone provides.
Brill, however, insists that only ''union critics of charter schools'' believe successful charters '' 'skim' from the community's most intelligent students and committed families,'' adding, ''None of the actual data supports this.'' But in fact, according to Tough, KIPP's own ''internal statistics'' show that its students in the South Bronx ''arrived scoring better on average on tests than typical children in their neighborhoods.'' And not just a little better: on reading tests prior to entering KIPP, Tough writes, ''students often scored above the average for the entire city.''
KIPP then builds on this sturdy foundation -- and far more successfully than most charters, for which it deserves praise and keen attention to its methods. But KIPP and other successful charters have not yet shown they can succeed with every kind of student within a single school district, or even, for that matter, a single neighborhood. If we can't make such distinctions, how will we ever help all children achieve?
Brill adeptly shows how ideas can become a movement. Many of his subjects met in Teach for America, went on to promote one another's hiring or research and are now being financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. But what Brill regards as the groundswell of a welcome revolution begins to sound worryingly like an echo chamber, with everyone talking to the same few people and reading the same e-mail blasts.
Thanks to these reformers' coordinated push, their agenda is now driving President Obama's ''Race to the Top'' initiative. As Brill reports, educators supporting different, equally plausible reforms were discouraged from competing for the contest's unprecedented $4.35 billion in funding. By design, judges could award points only to those proposals that advanced charters (despite their mixed record) and used student test scores to evaluate teacher performance (in a still-unproven intervention).
This unwillingness to entertain other reforms, I think, is partly what has animated some of the movement's critics, like the education historian Diane Ravitch, who recently reversed her longstanding support for high-stakes testing and charters (and whom Brill dismisses in just four pages, much of which he devotes not to the substance of her arguments but to distracting questions about whether she has ever accepted speaking fees from unions). The problem isn't just that the hard evidence, looked at dispassionately, doesn't always support reformers' claims. It's that the insurgents are in danger of becoming the very thing they once (rightly) rose up against: subject to groupthink, reluctant to hear opposing views or to work with anyone perceived to be on the other side.
At times, I couldn't help wishing Brill had concentrated less on his reformers' similarities than on their differences. According to him, Eli Broad, the billionaire philanthropist who has helped bankroll Teach for America, regards Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, with admirable pragmatism, as someone he can work with. Bill Gates decided not to back Michelle Rhee's reforms in Washington because he regarded her as too much of a ''bomb thrower.'' Gates also expresses wise frustration that none of Brill's favorite data crunchers can actually explain what an effective teacher looks like. (Toward this end, Doug Lemov of the Uncommon Schools charter network has promisingly begun videotaping and analyzing top teachers to identify concrete tools educators can use to improve.)
By book's end, even Brill begins to feel the cognitive dissonance. He quotes a KIPP founder who concedes that the program relies on superhuman talent that can never be duplicated in large numbers. And sure enough, an educator whom Brill has held up the entire book as a model of reform unexpectedly quits, citing burnout and an unsustainable workload at her Harlem charter. Then another reform-/minded teacher at the same school confesses she can't possibly keep up the pace. ''This model just cannot scale,'' she declares flatly. After relentlessly criticizing Weingarten, Brill suddenly suggests, in a ''Nixon-to-China'' move, that she become New York's next schools chancellor. ''The lesson,'' Brill belatedly discovers, is that reformers need to collaborate with unions, if only because they are ''the organizational link to enable school improvement to expand beyond the ability of the extraordinary people to work extraordinary hours.'' But isn't this merely what the reform movement's more thoughtful critics have been saying all along?
Brill likens the battle over the nation's schools to ''warfare,'' but the better analogy may be to the war on cancer. For years, scientists hoped a magic pill would cure this ravaging disease. But increasingly, doctors have recognized that they will have to fight a multifronted war, as cancers (like failing schools) aren't all alike. Each comes with its own complex etiology. Improving teacher quality and working to create better schools, like charters, are part of the arsenal. But such efforts, alone, are unlikely to boost long-term survival rates without a continual, dispassionate look at the incoming data, no matter how counterintuitive, and a willingness to revise tactics midtreatment as we pursue multiple paths in a race for the cure. Although Brill doesn't say so until the book's last few pages, he finally acknowledges just how much we still have to learn.

HEADLINE: Steps-From-Work Housing

WINDSOR
THOUSANDS of apartments, condos, cottages and lofts are coming to this suburb north of Hartford -- and all of the housing is to be set in the heart of the town's sprawling corporate office corridor.
Called Great Pond Village, the $1 billion development is intended to give employees who now drive an average 35 minutes to work at the Day Hill Road office park the opportunity to ditch the commute altogether.
The idea is to ''create the old New England village where we have a walkable, mixed-use village center,'' and enough housing choices to accommodate a variety of age groups, said David Winstanley, a principal with the developer, Winstanley Enterprises of Concord, Mass. The company is working in partnership with the property owner, ABB, a Swiss corporation specializing in power and automation technologies. 
About 80 percent of Windsor's current residential stock is single-family homes, according to Peter Souza, the town manager. Some corporate employers have complained that the lack of housing diversity hurts their efforts to recruit younger workers.
''The town hasn't seen a new rental complex in more than 30 years,'' Mr. Souza said.
The development will mark the renewal of a 653-acre site that has undergone an intensive cleanup over the past decade for radiological and chemical contamination.
Beginning in the 1950s, Combustion Engineering performed research, development and manufacturing of nuclear fuel on the property under a contract with the Atomic Energy Commission. ABB acquired Combustion Engineering in 1990, and took on the lengthy cleanup process.
The final phase of remediation began in August 2009, and ABB anticipates spending a total of $140 million by the time the cleanup is complete, according to Bob Fesmire, a corporate spokesman. The company must satisfy standards set by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the state Department of Environmental Protection. About half the site was declared free of any contamination.
The thriving Day Hill Road office corridor provides some 20,000 jobs in a range of industries, including finance, insurance and transportation. Office buildings and service plazas line either side of the broad boulevard, save for a stretch taken up by fields of shade tobacco, a crop used for cigar wrappers.
The approved master plan for Great Pond Village -- named for a 20-acre pond on the property -- calls for 4,010 new housing units (about half rentals), and 853,000 square feet of commercial space, including 85,000 square feet of neighborhood-style retail.
About half of the acreage in the development will become parks, or be set aside as conservation land. In particular, some 200 acres in the northern portion of the site, which borders the Farmington River and a 500-acre public park, will be left undisturbed.
The size of the project promises a significant expansion of Windsor's roughly 28,500-strong population, but the growth will be gradual. The project has a timeline of 14 to 20 years.
''This is a very forward-thinking land-use pattern,'' Mr. Souza said. ''We're trying to look out over a longer horizon.''
A study conducted by TischlerBise, a Maryland consulting firm, determined that tax revenues generated by the development will exceed town-borne costs for emergency services, schools and infrastructure by as much as $43 million over 20 years.
Windsor is one of a growing number of towns using high-density development to address problems like overburdened highways, unaffordable housing, suburban sprawl and dwindling numbers of young people.
Other towns have sought to place such development near mass transit, which is lacking at the 1970s-era Day Hill zone. Yet by putting housing within that zone, Windsor will help decrease auto dependence in the state capital region by making it easier for people to live near their workplaces, said David Kooris, the director of the Connecticut office of the Regional Plan Association, a tristate group.
Ideally, he added, the town would never have developed ''this massive office corridor that sucked the life out of Hartford. But the reality is, all that office space is not going to go anywhere.''
Windsor does have an Amtrak rail station with limited commuter-rail service. Long-term plans for high-speed rail service linking New Haven, Hartford and Springfield, over the Massachusetts border, may eventually result in shuttle service between Windsor's station and the Day Hill area, Mr. Souza said.
Mr. Winstanley says developers will initially pay for any needed public road and utility improvements. The legislature has granted the project Special Taxing District authority, so bonds may be issued after new buildings go on the tax rolls, and 50 percent of the property tax allocation will go to retire the bonds.
The first phase, which could be under way as soon as 2012, will include 400 housing units, Mr. Winstanley said.
He acknowledged that the poor economy could slow the project's progress, but said that housing market conditions might also work in its favor.
''I think there's going to be more people who can't afford houses or condos,'' he said. ''And more people moving out of their houses because they can no longer afford them.''

HEADLINE: Economic Lessons From World War II

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Hope That Flows From History'' (Economic View, Aug. 14), Christina D. Romer argued that the United States should continue to use monetary and fiscal stimulus, based on the experience of the 1930s and World War II. But there is an important point to consider in this debate: we are now so weakened financially by excesses that stimulus may not work as the column proposes. 
When the Great Depression struck, the national debt was only a small share of gross domestic product. Even at the end of the 1930s' stimulus, the figure was still well less than half of G.D.P. Further, during the 1920s and 1930s, the nation had favorable balances of payments.
But jump ahead to the present, and the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio is moving ever higher, and we have long had highly unfavorable balances of payments.
The column cited the very high ratio -- 109 percent -- after World War II, but that probably does not provide a good argument that more stimulus would be acceptable in the eyes of our creditors and holders of dollars. At the end of World War II, everyone knew that much spending had been temporary. In fact, government spending fell sharply after the war, the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio declined significantly and the balance of trade was very favorable -- none of which are foreseen at this point.
William H. Kuehnle
Alexandria, Va., Aug. 15
To the Editor:
The column argued that a structural mismatch between workers' skills and available jobs is a small factor in today's economy and that monetary and fiscal policy should continue to be the key factor in our economic recovery.
The writer cited the rapid work-force adjustments during World War II, when millions of working men were drafted into the military and other Americans replaced them in factory and other jobs. Today, however, the sophisticated production lines of factories, as well as the technical support needed for many of today's products, cannot be simplified so that unskilled laborers can make such rapid adjustments.
Just recently, Caterpillar's chief executive told CNBC that it could not hire enough service technicians in Detroit because of a lack of trained applicants.
In addition, pre-World War II society offered little or no safety cushion for jobless workers. Today, there is less incentive for the unskilled unemployed to seek a higher-level skill when one may indefinitely access some form of government benefit along with temporary or permanent employment in abundant low-wage service jobs to make ends meet. Loose monetary policy and more fiscal stimulus will perpetuate the malaise.

HEADLINE: 'Really Pretty Much the Only One That, Um, You Know, Got It'

BYLINE: By MAUD NEWTON

 BODY:
Ten years ago, David Foster Wallace admitted in ''Tense Present,'' one of his best and most charming essays, to being a ''SNOOT,'' which he defined as a ''really extreme usage fanatic, the sort of person whose idea of Sunday fun is to look for mistakes in Safire's column's prose itself.'' He outed himself while writing in Harper's on Bryan A. Garner's Dictionary of Modern American Usage, a book, he says, that serves to confirm its author's ''SNOOTitude while undercutting it in tone.''
Ultimately, though, ''Tense Present'' is as much about Wallace's own rhetorical postures as about Garner's, so much so that Wallace might as well be talking about himself. Garner's book is ''so good and so sneaky,'' Wallace contends, because it relies on a ''subtle rhetorical strategy.'' Its ''Ethical Appeal'' amounts to ''a complex and sophisticated 'Trust me,' '' one that ''requires the rhetor to convince us not just of his intellectual acuity or technical competence, but of his basic decency and fairness and sensitivity to the audience's own hopes and fears.'' 
Wallace, too, strived to make ethical arguments while soothing and flattering his readers and distracting them from the fact that arguments were being made. He was inarguably one of the most interesting thinkers and distinctive stylists of the generation raised on Jacques Derrida, Strunk and White and Scooby-Doo, and his nonfiction writings, on subjects as diverse as cruises, porn, tennis and eating lobster, are a compelling, often dizzying mix of arguments and asides, of reportage and personal anecdotes, of high diction (''pleonasm''), childlike speech (''plus, worse''), slacker lingo (''totally hosed'') and legalese (''what this article hereby terms a 'Democratic Spirit' ''), often within the course of a single paragraph. As John Jeremiah Sullivan astutely observed in GQ, Wallace repudiated the demands of ''the well-tempered magazine feature,'' which ''seeks to make you forget its problems, half-truths and arbitrary decisions.'' Yet Wallace's rhetoric is mannered and limited in its own way, as manipulative in its recursive self-second-guessing as any more straightforward effort to persuade.
Geoff Dyer, an essayist as idiosyncratic and perceptive as Wallace but far more economical, confessed recently in Prospect magazine that he ''break[s] out in a mental rash'' when forced to read Wallace. ''It's not that I dislike the extravagance, the excess, the beanie-baroque, the phat loquacity,'' Dyer wrote. ''They just bug the crap out of me. '' Wallace's nonfiction abounds with qualifiers like ''sort of'' and ''pretty much'' and sincerity-infusers like ''really.'' An icon of porn publishing described in the essay ''Big Red Son,'' for example, is ''hard not to sort of almost actually like.'' Within a brief excerpt from that piece in The New York Times Book Review, Wallace speaks of ''the whole cynical postmodern deal'' and ''the whole mainstream celebrity culture,'' and concludes that ''the whole thing sucks.'' Nor is this an unrepresentative sample; ''whole'' appears 20 times in the essay, so frequently that it begins to seem not just sloppy and imprecise but argumentatively, even aggressively, disingenuous. At their worst these verbal tics make it impossible to evaluate his analysis; I'm constantly wishing he would either choose a more straightforward way to limit his contentions or fully commit to one of them.
Of course, Wallace's slangy approachability was part of his appeal, and these quirks are more than compensated for by his roving intelligence and the tireless force of his writing. The trouble is that his style is also, as Dyer says, ''catching, highly infectious.'' And if, even from Wallace, the aw-shucks, I-could-be-wrong-here, I'm-just-a-supersincere-regular-guy-who-happens-to-have-written-a-book-on-infinity approach grates, it is vastly more exasperating in the hands of lesser thinkers. In the Internet era, Wallace's moves have been adopted and further slackerized by a legion of opinion-mongers who not only lack his quick mind but seem not to have mastered the idea that to make an argument, you must, amid all the tap-dancing and hedging, actually lodge an argument.
Visit some blogs -- personal blogs, academic blogs, blogs associated with some of our most esteemed periodicals -- to see these tendencies writ large. My own archives, dating back to 2002, are no exception.
I suppose it made sense, when blogging was new, that there was some confusion about voice. Was a blog more like writing or more like speech? Soon it became a contrived and shambling hybrid of the two. The ''sort ofs'' and ''reallys'' and ''ums'' and ''you knows'' that we use in conversation were codified as the central connectors in the blogger lexicon. We weren't just mad, we were sort of enraged; no one was merely confused, but kind of totally mystified. That music blog we liked was really pretty much the only one that, um, you know, got it. Never before had ''folks'' been used so relentlessly and enthusiastically as a term of general address outside church suppers, chain restaurants and family reunions. It's fascinating and dreadful in hindsight to realize how quickly these conventions took hold and how widely they spread. And! They have sort of mutated since to liberal and often sarcastic use of question marks? And exclamation points! ''Oh, hi,'' people say at the start of sentences on blogs, Twitter and Tumblr these days, both acknowledging and jokily feigning surprise at the presence of the readers who have turned up there.
Wallace isn't responsible for his imitators, much less for the stylized mess that is Gen-X-and-Y Internet syntax. The devices can be traced back to him, though, if indirectly; they were filtered through and popularized by Dave Eggers's literary magazine and publishing empire, McSweeney's, and Eggers's own novels and memoirs, all of which borrowed not only Wallace's tics but also his championing of post-ironic sincerity and his attempts to ward off criticism by embedding all possible criticisms within the writing itself. ''There is no overwhelming need to read the preface,'' Eggers wrote in ''A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius''; in fact, after ''the first three or four chapters'' the book ''is kind of uneven.''
The ur-text of this movement, though, is Wallace's essay ''E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction,'' written in 1993. It's a call for writing that transcends irony and detachment but, itself, comes drenched in both. The essay bemoans what Wallace saw as the near-impossibility of writing inventive, self-aware fiction in a television culture. He concludes by imagining some future group of ''literary 'rebels' '' who would be ''willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs . . . [and] accusations of sentimentality, melodrama.''
In its soaring romanticism, its Orwellian fears, its I'm-just-riffing-here backtracking and its infuriating absence of question marks following interrogatories, this essay prefigures many of the worst tendencies of the Internet. As the Times critic A. O. Scott has observed, Wallace ''wants to be at once earnest and ironical, sensitive and cerebral, lisible and scriptible, R&D and R&R, straight man and clown, grifter and mark.'' Every assertion, consequently, comes wrapped in qualifications, if not partial refutations; a later essay, appearing in ''Consider the Lobster,'' is titled, ''Certainly the End of Something or Other, One Would Sort of Have to Think.''
In a 2000 essay for Feed, Keith Gessen applauds Wallace for ''trying, at last, to destroy'' the oppositions between ''irony and sincerity, self-consciousness and artifice.'' He chastises those critics who in effect suggest that at ''this late date, we might unlearn the postmodern vocabulary and recapture some pre-ironic way of being.'' What we need, Gessen posits, in fiction writing at least, is someone to work ''a sort of Barthelmeic magic'' and ''transform our language of apathy into a cri de coeur.''
How we arrived at the notion that the postmodern era is the first ever to confront the tension between sincerity and irony despite millennia of evidence to the contrary is no mystery: every generation believes its insights are unprecedented, its struggles uniquely formidable, its solutions the balm for all that ails the world. Why so many of our critics are still, after all these years, making their arguments in this inherently self-undermining voice -- still trying to ward off every possible rejoinder and pre-emptively rebut every possible criticism by mixing a weird rhetorical stew of equivocation, pessimism and Elysian prophecy -- is another question entirely. Perhaps even now some Wallacites would argue that we simply have yet to reach that idyllic moment at which our discourse will naturally transform into a sincere yet knowing cry from the heart. I would put it differently.
In ''Generation Why?'' a social-networking jeremiad published in The New York Review of Books last year, Zadie Smith reduces the motivations of the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to one: he wants to be liked. She writes, ''For our self-conscious generation (and in this, I and Zuckerberg, and everyone raised on TV in the Eighties and Nineties, share a single soul), not being liked is as bad as it gets. Intolerable to be thought of badly for a minute, even for a moment.'' Even if you reject, as I do, the universality of her diagnosis, Smith has pinpointed the reason so much of what passes for intellectual debate nowadays is obscured behind a veneer of folksiness and sincerity and is characterized by an unwillingness to be pinned down. Where the craving for admiration and approval predominates, intellectual rigor cannot thrive, if it survives at all.
At 20 I congratulated myself on my awareness of the subjectivity of aesthetic judgments, the arbitrariness of critical proclamations, the folly of received wisdom. I pored over the Deconstructionists and the French feminists and advocated, in complete seriousness, the overthrow of language. (Also, the patriarchy.) Then I went to law school and was forced to confront serious practical and ethical questions -- Brown v. Board of Education, for instance, and Roe v. Wade -- that managed not to be resolved by the insights of Derrida. Now, having entered and abandoned the practice of law and spent roughly a decade straddling legal publishing and the blogosphere, I'm increasingly drawn to directness, which precludes neither nuance nor irony. (For details, see the essays of Mark Twain, who believed that ''plain question and plain answer make the shortest road out of most perplexities.'')
Qualifications are necessary sometimes. Anticipating and defusing opposing arguments has been a vital rhetorical strategy since at least the days of Aristotle. Satire and ridicule, when done well, are high art. But the idea is to provoke and persuade, not to soothe. And the best way to make an argument is to make it, straightforwardly, honestly, passionately, without regard to whether people will like you afterward.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: The Tax When You Fill Up

 BODY:
With the federal gas tax due to expire on Sept. 30, readers debate whether to raise it, and the effects an increase would have.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Re ''The Clear Case for the Gas Tax'' (editorial, Aug. 16):
Gasoline is grossly underpriced; the federal tax has not been raised in 18 years and is now a much smaller percentage of the total price. The current tax does not reflect the military spending incurred to protect our access to cheap energy, the damage to the environment or the long-term implications of future supply disruptions.
The federal gasoline tax should be increased from the current 18.4 cents a gallon to $1 or more a gallon, but the increase should be phased in over several years. A transition period will allow consumers to plan for higher fuel prices by purchasing more efficient vehicles and by choosing homes near public transportation.
The tax revenues should be used not only for highways and bridges but also for better public transportation (only a small percentage now goes to mass transit) and for research into fossil fuel alternatives. 
Oil is not an unlimited resource. We need a higher tax to motivate us to reduce our dependence on oil and to finance alternatives. This needs to happen before we either become victims of economic blackmail by producers or our economy becomes unhinged as a result of supply disruptions.
Critics will say we should let the free market solve our problems. That would be fine, but OPEC does not represent anything resembling a free market, and a free market does not protect our environment.
This is no time to be shortsighted. We need oil, gasoline and energy in the long term, so let's manage them accordingly.
KEITH WINZENRIED Whidbey Island, Wash., Aug. 16, 2011
The writer is a debt finance specialist for a financial services company.
Readers React
I agree that there should be a higher gas tax, but it shouldn't be phased in gradually. The shock value of a large one-shot price increase in the cost of gas would lead to more significant behavioral change.
Car buyers and drivers are more likely to react to a gradual approach by grumbling and making small behavioral changes instead of making big changes such as switching to mass transit, buying a hybrid car or relocating to lessen the need to drive.
Mr. Winzenried's goal of allowing consumers time to adjust can be achieved by notice well in advance of the tax increase.
REMY ZIMMERMANN New Haven, Aug. 18, 2011
As someone who teaches in rural North Carolina, I have become acutely aware of how an admirably purposed gas tax (like the one proposed by Mr. Winzenried) is even more regressive than most consumption levies.
A large percentage of my students' income is spent on gas. Even worse, many of my students cannot afford a new car, and their clunkers get terrible gas mileage. They already pay more at the pump than I do; a surtax would increase this inequity. Nor do they have the option of moving closer to public transportation. It barely exists in this part of the country.
We need to do for driving what was done for cigarettes -- take away the glamour and make fuel inefficiency socially unacceptable. Warnings on low-mileage vehicles and a vigorous advertising campaign would be a start.
A restoration of public transportation in rural areas (we have the tracks here in western North Carolina; we just don't have the trains) would certainly be welcome, as would a revival of the ''cash for clunkers'' program.
But rather than a regressive gas tax, these -- and any other solutions -- should be paid for by a surcharge on our progressive income tax.
TERRY CURTIS FOX Cullowhee, N.C., Aug. 18, 2011
I couldn't agree more with Mr. Winzenried that gasoline is grossly undertaxed (not underpriced!) and that taxes should increase over the next several years. But I disagree that the tax revenue should be used to update roads and bridges.
The additional income should be used solely to support alternative fuel options for consumers. That means expanding the network of E85 (85 percent ethanol) pumps across the nation, increasing the number of charging stations for electric vehicles, and, most important, subsidies and incentives for Americans to get off of petroleum and onto renewable energy.
We are not ready to make the switch right away. Realistically, we need a 5-to-10-year plan to slowly increase the gas tax and make change more feasible, available and widely accepted.
JOEL PYKKONEN Minneapolis, Aug. 18, 2011
The gas tax keeps our roads and bridges from falling down and maintains America's competitiveness. Former Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, David M. Walker, former United States comptroller general, and I have recently proposed a variation of the gas tax to finance our critical infrastructure that includes both a consumer tax and an industry tax.
We suggest the enactment of an oil security tax, a fixed percentage based on the price of a barrel of oil and paid by oil companies for every barrel produced in or imported into the United States.
The consumer gas tax would increase when oil prices fall and consumers get relief at the pump, and the tax would be reduced when oil prices rise. This ''countercycle'' plan will raise the money needed to build America's future while spreading the cost more equitably across both fuel producers and fuel consumers.
Since oil companies benefit from our transportation system, which consumes 70 percent of oil products, this is both reasonable and fair. Simply letting America's vital infrastructure decay is not.
BILL BRADLEY New York, Aug. 18, 2011
The writer is a former senator from New Jersey who is now a managing director at Allen & Company.
I agree, Mr. Winzenried, and make the new tax on diesel fuel slightly less than that on gasoline to reduce the impact on businesses that use diesel and to encourage the market for diesel-powered passenger cars. They are much cleaner-burning than in the past and get mileage comparable to or even better than hybrids -- without using electricity.
JAMIE BALDWIN Redding, Conn., Aug. 18, 2011
While I can see the need for a solution to our dependency on oil, I take issue with a ''one size fits all'' solution, especially when it applies to many areas of the sparsely settled western parts of the United States. Thousands of people live on ranches and farms many, many miles from any town. Our nearest loaf of bread is 70 miles away; our soon-to-be-closed post office is 40 miles away.
There is seldom public transportation between these towns, so glibly suggesting that people move might work for the congested population centers, but not for us.
Fuel expenses have always been one of our major concerns, and in recent years have added considerably to our cost of doing business. There have to be other, more flexible, solutions to our energy crisis.
TOM CLEMMONS Riley, Ore., Aug. 18, 2011
Owners of small or hybrid vehicles should not be penalized equally as someone who drives a gas-guzzling pickup truck or sport utility vehicle. The problem is how to differentiate between them, and the answer lies not at the pump but in automobile registration fees.
When a person registers a noncommercial gas-guzzler, additional fees should be added. This may serve as an incentive for consumers to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles.
MICHAEL HADJIARGYROU Stony Brook, N.Y., Aug. 18, 2011
I agree with Mr. Winzenried about raising the federal gas tax but take issue with his comments about the free market. Using a tax to change demand for gas is employing the free market. Consumers get to decide how or if they will respond to the tax. There are no top-down regulations, no federal fuel economy standards -- just high prices to enforce market discipline and achieve wiser management of a precious resource.
This should be an idea that would appeal to Republican free-marketeers and Democratic environmentalists alike.
DOUG WILCOCK Brewster, Mass., Aug. 18, 2011
Mr. Winzenried is spot on. We as Americans seem to believe that cheap energy, particularly gasoline, is our birthright, and we have been more than willing to defend that right with military might, even at the expense of shedding American blood. We prop up dictators and strongmen so that political instability will not interrupt the flow of oil.
The true cost of oil is not reflected in the prices we pay at the pump. It is visible as our national debt and deficit have exploded and as deaths accrue in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The question is will we pay the true cost at the pump, or keep the blinders on?
CAROL FERNANDEZ Newton, Mass., Aug. 18, 2011
The Writer Responds
The reader responses demonstrate a general consensus about the need to reduce gasoline consumption, maintain our infrastructure and finance alternative energy. The range of ideas illustrates the many options that are available, each with tradeoffs.
Senator Bradley offers an excellent idea: in essence, a combination of windfall profits tax and variable gasoline tax that would act to smooth gasoline price volatility. Consumers could plan better (and not count on a return to unsustainably low gas prices) while we all benefit from having a predictable funding source for infrastructure spending, research and development for energy alternatives, and public transportation.
While the shock value of an immediate, significant increase would certainly get a reaction, as Mr. Zimmermann says, it is unrealistic to expect consumers to suddenly go out and purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles. Consumers need to be able to plan ahead. The economy doesn't need another shock right now either.
Mr. Fox and Mr. Clemmons raise reasonable points -- not all consumers have the same choices. Rural residents may feel the impact of the gasoline tax charge more than non-rural residents, but those same rural taxpayers already benefit from many subsidies not shared with urban residents -- for example, rural electric and phone cooperatives. So rural residents, please enjoy the subsidies you are getting, and help participate in an important change that benefits society as a whole.
The tax is regressive, but a phase-in period would provide time for legislators to make other tax structures more equitable to reduce the impact.
While I agree with Mr. Pykkonen in spirit, his position has flaws. Even if everyone drove electrical vehicles, they would still need to drive over highways and bridges; how will we pay to maintain those? His emphasis on E85 fuel overlooks the fact that ethanol fuel is highly subsidized and energy inefficient, at least as it is now produced in the United States.
Mr. Baldwin raises a good point with respect to diesel fuel, but if diesel is so much more efficient, then consumers should migrate toward using diesel even if the tax is the same as for gasoline.
I think Mr. Hadjiargyrou misses the point: the charge for using fuel should reflect the amount used. The impact on society is much greater from a gas-guzzler driver commuting 80 miles a day than one who lives close to work or uses a large vehicle for short errands. Why let the fuel-guzzling commuter off the hook with a one-time upfront fee? Once paid, there is no further incentive for change.
I agree with Mr. Wilcock -- the market will respond to price incentives. What I meant is that in the case of gasoline, the free market is not capable of providing the right price.
We do need to take off the blinders, as Ms. Fernandez says; America should not blindly hurtle toward the giant potholes, falling bridges and oil shocks that await us all if we don't accept the responsibility to pay for our infrastructure and seek alternatives to total dependence on an unreliable, finite and environmentally damaging resource.

HEADLINE: In Father's Memory, Fighting to Stay in Britain

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
CLAPHAM, England -- The boy was 13 when a dawn immigration raid abruptly ended his father's four-year quest for political asylum in Britain. By nightfall of that day in 2005, father and son were hundreds of miles from home, locked in the privately run Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Center here, scheduled for deportation to their native Angola in the morning.
Instead, shortly after midnight, the despondent father, Manuel Bravo, 35, walked to a stairwell with a bed sheet and hanged himself. The note he left said why: so that his orphaned boy could stay in Britain.
Indeed, the law did not allow immigration authorities to deport an orphan who had no one waiting for him. A British family the Bravos knew through church took the boy, Antonio, home to Armley, the working-class suburb of Leeds where they had settled in 2001. 
Antonio, now 19, is an apprentice electrician who aspires to be an engineer. Not far from his father's hilltop grave, he shares a century-old house with five British roommates and regularly visits the family who raised him. ''I want to make my dad proud and not feel like he gave his life away for no reason,'' he said.
But next month, Antonio faces the threat of deportation all over again. Under changing laws, instead of qualifying for citizenship this year, as he expected, he is not eligible to apply. His temporary residence permit, granted on humanitarian grounds, is expiring with no clear path to renewal.
Antonio's story is emblematic of one nation's escalating efforts to repel unwanted migration, through an enforcement system partly run by private contractors.
Like governments throughout the Western world, Britain's has come under increasing pressure to increase expulsions, cut immigration and restrict citizenship. At stake for officials is ''managed migration,'' a way to maintain an influx of the most desirable settlers and genuine refugees by forcibly excluding the rejected -- in an effort to rein in the hostility toward foreigners that is mounting from Australia and the United States to Norway and France.
''It is ever more important that proper immigration controls are not only in place but are seen to be in place,'' Damian Green, Britain's immigration minister, said last September after opening two new wings of another privately run detention center near Heathrow Airport. ''If we do not create public confidence in our immigration system, we will remain vulnerable to those who want to find scapegoats for social problems.''
But some analysts contend that, on the contrary, the detention and deportation boom has legitimized treating foreigners as scapegoats, ratcheting up public anxieties and broader demands for restriction.
Over the past decade, public targets of crackdowns have shifted from ''bogus asylum-seekers'' to ''criminal aliens'' and now to ''unsustainable net immigration,'' a term that includes perfectly legal settlers, noted Mary Bosworth, a criminologist at the University of Oxford who has tracked the expansion of immigration jails like Yarl's Wood.
''There is this very public display and investment in making these places of confinement look like they're holding dangerous people,'' Ms. Bosworth said. ''It locks the government into the position where it can only get tougher.''
And the rules keep changing. Last year Antonio passed a new ''Britishness test'' -- What is a shadow cabinet? When is Mothering Sunday? -- only to learn that it no longer counts in his case.
''Great for a pub quiz, though,'' he said.
A Family on the Run
At first, the Bravos were a family of four: Mr. Bravo, calm and quiet; his spirited wife, Lidia; their son, Nelio, 3; and Mr. Bravo's son, Antonio, 10, whose own mother died giving birth to him in Angola. In asylum papers, Mr. Bravo described himself as a farmer jailed and abused by the Angolan government because of his role in a pro-democracy party founded by his father. He fled for his life, he said, after security forces raided the family farm and killed his parents and sisters. Angola was then in the 27th year of a civil war.
The Bravos requested asylum when they landed at Heathrow Airport in October 2001. Barred from work like most asylum-seekers in Britain, they were sent to Armley to await a decision. They found support at Christ Church from Catherine Beaumont, a volunteer at its immigrant help center, and the Rev. Alistair Kaye, then the vicar.
But their application had joined a backlog just as the number of new asylum-seekers in Britain soared toward a peak of 84,000 a year in 2002. Public hostility soared, too, over revelations that few of those denied asylum ever left.
The detention center, Yarl's Wood, was then just opening, part of an expansion that the government and its private partners promised would triple the rate of expulsion. Instead, within three months, the $140 million center was gutted by fire during detainee protests over mistreatment.
An inquiry by the prisons and probation ombudsman found in 2004 that it had been shoddily constructed and rushed into operation to meet ''unattainable'' Labour government targets before an election. Of 385 detainees the night of the fire, including 29 children and seven infants, only 46 had a deportation date, the government acknowledged in Parliament.
By the middle of the decade, tighter border controls had cut asylum arrivals by two-thirds from the 2002 peak. But public hostility toward asylum-seekers kept rising, shaped by accusations that many were exploiting the public subsidies in a system that was slow to decide cases and ineffective at expulsion.
Yarl's Wood was rebuilt. Detention for failed asylum-seekers will grow, the home secretary told Parliament in 2005, ''to the point where it becomes the norm that those who fail are detained.''
The declaration fit a two-pronged strategy by Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was then opening doors to many immigrants, including computer specialists from Asia and people from the newest members of the European Union. Simultaneously, he showcased rigor toward rejected asylum-seekers, much as the Bush and Obama administrations highlighted record numbers of detainees and deportations while pursuing, albeit unsuccessfully, more lenient immigration laws.
Mr. Bravo's application was rejected in 2004, by a caseworker who cited insufficient evidence to support it. Mr. Bravo had no lawyer at the appeal hearing. ''He was really demoralized,'' Antonio said. ''He felt useless.'' The long wait for a decision led to conflicts in his father's marriage, he added, and worsened his own difficult relationship with his stepmother.
In fall 2004, the family split up. Taking Nelio, Mrs. Bravo returned to Angola to care for critically ill relatives. She was arrested and fled again, to Namibia, according to messages that trickled back. Mr. Bravo frantically tried to contact them, Mr. Kaye, the vicar, said, and did not live long enough to learn that she had reached Portugal, where she won asylum and dropped from sight.
At dawn on Sept. 14, 2005, eight officers broke into the Bravos' small row house. ''I can't get it out of my head,'' Antonio said. ''They bust in the door, shining lights. They handcuffed us both -- I felt like a criminal, and I did nowt'' -- nothing, in the dialect of northern England.
Later, in a report on the Bravo case, the ombudsman for prisons questioned the need for such a ''robust exercise of state power'' after long inaction, calling it ''frankly cruel.'' But the raid followed standard policy, he concluded, and had been planned down to details like giving Antonio's five pet fish to a neighbor. Nor was protocol breached by the subcontractors who loaded father and son into a caged van.
The Detention Machine
The Bravos had entered the world of outsourced immigration enforcement. In effect, they were in the custody of the Anglo-Danish company now known as G4S.
Its guards drove them past the brick villas and open fields of Bedfordshire to an old military base where the Yarl's Wood detention center, developed by the company in 2001, lies behind barbed wire.
Contractors now run 7 of Britain's 11 immigration detention centers, where capacity has grown 75 percent since 2001. Mr. Bravo's one day in custody is documented in rare detail in inquest records. What still haunts Antonio is the moment when G4S transport guards discovered a brand-new clothesline in his father's bag. They took the rope from Mr. Bravo, who was under treatment for depression, but never alerted Yarl's Wood. G4S declined to comment for this article on its operations, either in general or with regard to the Bravo case.
A nurse at Yarl's Wood, employed by another subcontractor, confiscated Mr. Bravo's antidepressants and did not ask if he was suicidal -- for fear, she testified, of putting the idea in his head. Official inquiries concluded that these lapses made no difference.
Father and son were escorted through eight locked doors to their room, where Antonio waited while Mr. Bravo made last-ditch phone calls.
One was to the vicar, who had been unable to reach government officials. ''He was really struggling,'' Mr. Kaye said. ''He was terrified of going back.''
When Mr. Bravo returned to their room, Antonio said, he brought bad news: their deportation was set for 10:30 a.m. ''He said, 'Whatever happens, be brave and strong and I'm proud of you.' ''
Antonio was sleeping when security cameras recorded his father's suicide. The ombudsman's 2006 report complains that for hours no one accepted responsibility for waking the boy to tell him his father was dead, and later, no one explained that he would not be deported alone.
''I only cried when Catherine came,'' Antonio remembered of Ms. Beaumont's arrival. ''She came and said, 'We love you and we want you to come and live with us.' ''
The staff members refused to let him go, invoking his best interest.
''You're prepared to send somebody back to possible imprisonment and harm in Angola,'' observed Ms. Beaumont, a former nurse and mother of two, ''and the next day you can't send him back to Leeds because you haven't assessed these people.''
Before being allowed to join the Beaumonts, Antonio spent five days with elderly strangers who plied him with tea. ''That's when I made the transition from African to British,'' he said, ''a cup of tea every half minute.''
Assimilated and Rejected
Last fall, after work on a rainy night, Antonio led a visitor to the home where he finished out his childhood. The dog went wild with excitement. In the parlor, beside a glowing hearth, Ms. Beaumont teasingly recalled milestones of his assimilation: feeding pigeons on a day trip to London, climbing a steep hill on a family bicycling holiday in Devon, sulking through a cream tea afterward.
''I think you wished you'd never come to live with the family at that point,'' she said.
Mr. Kaye, who calls Antonio ''a wonderful lad,'' hints at the rougher patches now masked by dry humor. ''They're the ones who had to cope with all the teenage years, the grief and hard times,'' he said.
Despite efforts by London lawyers, Antonio's asylum application was rejected in 2006 because the authorities had already rejected his father's political claim. But he received a five-year grant of humanitarian protection, which at the time could lead to citizenship.
His English took on Yorkshire rhythms; he forgot Portuguese. When his foster care subsidy ended at 18, he was earning his way as an apprentice electrician, at ease as the only black man on the crew, saving up for citizenship fees and university.
''My father told me to be strong and get my education,'' Antonio said. ''And to me, to get a passport is the most important thing.''
But while Antonio tried to become British, British concerns about immigration were growing. A study for the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, drawing on years of public opinion research, shows that even before the economic crisis nearly 7 of 10 Britons felt the country had too many immigrants.
In the recession, attitudes hardened over perceived unfair competition for public services and jobs, and fears of Britain being ''swamped'' by foreigners. While 10 percent of Britain's population was born abroad -- fewer than in France or Germany -- most people believed the figure was 25 percent. One political response was an overhaul of citizenship law that broke the links between temporary residence and settlement. Antonio's decade in Britain, marred by nine months of illegal status as a child, is no longer sufficient to apply to stay indefinitely. He lacks British relatives or exceptional skills, other avenues to naturalization.
His permission to stay expires Sept. 18. In his category -- humanitarian protection -- he must wait until 28 days before that date to apply for an extension, and somehow show that his need for protection has not changed.
Meanwhile, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government has pledged to halve net immigration, now about 200,000 people a year. Since it cannot curb arrivals from the European Union, that means pushing harder to reject non-Europeans.
For Antonio, there is a personal twist: Nelio, 13, came back to Britain on his Portuguese, or European Union, passport. Antonio's former stepmother, who had remarried -- and did not respond to a reporter's e-mail messages -- had sent Nelio to be raised by Portuguese friends near Manchester. She has returned to Angola, now a country at peace that is alien to Antonio.
''My family, they're English,'' he said, referring to the Beaumonts. ''Britain, that's my culture.''

HEADLINE: Sex Offenders: The Last Pariahs

BYLINE: By ROGER N. LANCASTER

 BODY:
Roger N. Lancaster is a professor of anthropology and director of the cultural studies program at George Mason University, and the author of ''Sex Panic and the Punitive State.''
Fairfax, Va.
STARTING in the 1970s, lawmakers across the United States enacted punitive ''lock 'em up'' policies. The prison population more than quadrupled, and the United States became first in the world in both the total number of prisoners (about 2.3 million) and the rate of imprisonment (1 of every 100 adults is behind bars).
Now, budget pressures, court orders and a recognition of the social costs of incarceration have prompted America to reconsider some of these draconian laws. Incarceration rates may be topping out.
But most criminal justice advocates have been reluctant to talk about sex offender laws, much less reform them. The reluctance has deep roots. Sex crimes are seen as uniquely horrific. During the Colonial, antebellum and Jim Crow eras, white Americans were preoccupied with tales of sexual dangers to white women and children. McCarthy-era paranoia, stories of Satanic ritual abuse and other sex panics stirred pervasive anxieties about lurking strangers. Sexual predators play a lead role in the production of a modern culture of fear. 
In fact, the crimes that most spur public outrage -- the abduction, rape and murder of children -- are exceedingly rare. Statistically, a child's risk of being killed by a sexual predator who is a stranger is comparable to the chance of being struck by lightning. The reported incidence of most forms of child abduction, including the most serious, has declined since the 1980s.
The most intense dread, fueled by shows like ''America's Most Wanted'' and ''To Catch a Predator,'' is directed at the lurking stranger, the anonymous repeat offender. But most perpetrators of sexual abuse are family members, close relatives, or friends or acquaintances of the victim's family. In 70 to 80 percent of child deaths resulting from abuse or neglect, a parent is held responsible.
No one can doubt that child sexual abuse is traumatic and devastating. The question is not whether the state has an interest in preventing such harm, but whether current laws are effective in doing so.
A 1994 federal law named for Jacob Wetterling, an 11-year-old Minnesota boy who was abducted, requires convicted sex offenders to register with authorities. Under an amendment to that act, all states adopted statutes collectively known as Megan's Law -- named for a 7-year-old girl who was raped and murdered in New Jersey in 1994 -- that require local law enforcement authorities to notify neighbors about a sex offender's presence in their community. And although registration and notification requirements vary, all states now post searchable online lists of at least some categories of registered sex offenders.
Advocates for laws to register, publicize and monitor sex offenders after their release from custody typically assert that those convicted of sex crimes pose a high risk of sex crime recidivism. But studies by the Justice Department and other organizations show that recidivism rates are significantly lower for convicted sex offenders than for burglars, robbers, thieves, drug offenders and other convicts.
Only a tiny proportion of sex crimes are committed by repeat offenders, which suggests that current laws are misdirected and ineffective. Indeed, a federally financed study of New Jersey's registration and notification procedures found that sex offense rates were already falling before the implementation of Megan's Law. The study also found no discernible impact on recidivism and concluded that the growing costs of the program might not be justifiable.
Contrary to the common belief that burgeoning registries provide lists of child molesters, the victim need not have been a child and the perpetrator need not have been an adult. Child abusers may be minors themselves. Statutory rapists -- a loose category that includes some offenses involving neither coercion nor violence -- are covered in some states. Some states require exhibitionists and ''peeping Toms'' to register; Louisiana compelled some prostitutes to do so. Two-thirds of the North Carolina registrants sampled in a 2007 study by Human Rights Watch had been convicted of the nonviolent crime of ''indecent liberties with a minor,'' which does not necessarily involve physical contact.
Culpability and harm vary greatly in these offenses. Some would not be classified as criminal under European laws, which set lower ages of consent than do American laws. And because sex crimes are broadly defined and closely monitored, the number of people listed in public sex offender registries is growing rapidly: 740,000 at latest count, more than the population of Boston or Seattle. The registration and notification rules -- the result of efforts by victims' rights advocates, crusading journalists and tough-on-crime politicians -- violate basic legal principles and amount to an excessive and enduring form of punishment.
Newer laws go even further. At last count, 44 states have passed or are considering laws that would require some sex offenders to be monitored for life with electronic bracelets and global positioning devices. A 2006 federal law, the Adam Walsh Act, named for a Florida boy who was abducted and killed, allows prosecutors to apply tougher registration rules retroactively. New civil commitment procedures allow for the indefinite detention of sex offenders after the completion of their sentences. Such procedures suggest a catch-22: the accused is deemed mentally fit for trial and sentencing, but mentally unfit for release.
Laws in more than 20 states and hundreds of municipalities restrict where a sex offender can live, work or walk. California's Proposition 83 prohibits all registered sex offenders (felony and misdemeanor alike) from living within 2,000 feet of a school or park, effectively evicting them from the state's cities and scattering them to isolated rural areas.
Digital scarlet letters, electronic tethering and practices of banishment have relegated a growing number of people to the logic of ''social death,'' a term introduced by the sociologist Orlando Patterson, in the context of slavery, to describe permanent dishonor and exclusion from the wider moral community. The creation of a pariah class of unemployable, uprooted criminal outcasts has drawn attention from human rights activists; even The Economist has decried our sex offender laws as harsh and ineffective.
This should worry us, in part because the techniques used for marking, shaming and controlling sex offenders have come to serve as models for laws and practices in other domains. Several states currently publish online listings of methamphetamine offenders, and other states are considering public registries for assorted crimes. Mimicking Megan's Law, Florida maintains a Web site that gives the personal details (including photo, name, age, address, offenses and periods of incarceration) of all prisoners released from custody. Some other states post similar public listings of paroled or recently released ex-convicts. It goes without saying that such procedures cut against rehabilitation and reintegration.
Our sex offender laws are expansive, costly and ineffective -- guided by panic, not reason. It is time to change the conversation: to promote child welfare based on sound data rather than statistically anomalous horror stories, and in some cases to revisit outdated laws that do little to protect children. Little will have been gained if we trade a bloated prison system for sprawling forms of electronic surveillance that offload the costs of imprisonment onto offenders, their families and their communities.

HEADLINE: High-Tech Product, Low-Tech Pitch

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ZERO percent financing on a new car. A mattress sale blowout. Storewide discounts at the local hardware. These are the types of pitches that people expect to hear on the radio. Not commercials for the Barracuda Load Balancer, which sounds vaguely automotive but is actually software related to managing Web site traffic.
Information technology products, like e-mail archivers and Web site security software, are increasingly being promoted on the radio -- not just in major cities but also in smallish ones like Redding, Calif., or Bend, Ore. The economics of radio advertising sometimes make it useful in reaching small but important groups of prospective customers. 
So many of radio's traditional sponsors have moved their ad dollars online that prices for radio commercials have fallen. This has caught the notice of companies like Barracuda Networks, an I.T. business based in Campbell, Calif.
''We discovered radio was unnaturally inexpensive,'' says Michael Perone, Barracuda's executive vice president and chief marketing officer.
Barracuda has customers that include large corporations. Marketing to their I.T. departments is done out of sight of the rest of us -- at I.T. trade shows, in trade journal ads and in calls from Barracuda's field sales force.
The company also sells to medium-sized businesses, defined as those with 300 to 2,000 employees. It can be too expensive to send sales representatives to make the multiple visits necessary to close a relatively modest sale to these customers. But it turns out that radio offers an economical alternative way of reaching the three or four people who might work in the I.T. department of a 300-employee company.
One of Barracuda's commercials, for its Message Archiver, refers to ''e-discovery laws and government regulations,'' but a 30-second spot has no room for details. The commercial's narrator says the product is for ''certain businesses,'' without making clear which ones must worry about e-mail preservation.
Presumably, if you haven't heard anything about such matters, you are professionally absolved from worrying about them.
Marc Wolfe, Barracuda's senior director of marketing, says its radio ads don't aim at people with a particular title but instead are intended to ''ignite a conversation with as many influencers in a single organization as possible.''
Barracuda decided to broadcast its spots not only in the largest markets (Tier 1, in radio parlance) and the midsize ones (Tier 2), but also small ones like Redding and Bend (Tier 3) -- for a total of thousands of stations in North America. In the smallest markets, some radio stations may be struggling to attract even local advertisers. And the task becomes particularly difficult if a lack of commercials is already giving their programming the appearance of a nonprofit public service. Such stations ''need commercials to sound like a radio station,'' says Mr. Perone, who says the radio ad networks that distribute Barracuda's spots can provide the Tier 3 markets at very little additional cost.
All that is required to get ''nearly 100 percent'' of the attention of a prospective customer is making '' a little noise in a quiet place'' like a small radio market, Mr. Wolfe says. He has learned that it's hard to predict, however, who might be reached. He points to this example: ''Someone who lives in a Tier 1 city and is traveling through a Tier 3 city hears the spot and says 'My God, you guys are everywhere.' ''
Citrix is another software vendor that is using radio to sell products to business customers. Its videoconferencing software, GoToMeeting, and other products are featured in commercials on more than 2,000 stations, it says.
Michael Guarnieri, radio media manager at Citrix, says he and his colleagues began to advertise on the radio in 2003, when they worked for Expertcity, before it was acquired by Citrix the next year. The original idea was to advertise only on programs that were about information technology, he says, but ''we discovered there was a finite number of tech radio shows and the audiences were small.'' So, he adds, ''we started going into consumer radio.''
''We identified radio hosts who were influencers who gave us an endorsement and provided third-party validation,'' Mr. Guarnieri says. He supplied an example: a commercial whose script is spoken by Kim Komando, host of a syndicated talk radio show about technology.
''I've been a fan and a customer of GoToMeeting.com for years,'' Ms. Komando enthuses on the commercial. ''And now GoToMeeting.com has added high-definition group videoconferencing. I've seen it, I've used it, it's amazing.''
As with many testimonials delivered by radio show hosts, the listener may understand that it has not been volunteered gratis. But with a product that's meant for personal use, it's relatively easy to picture the host using the product regularly -- and how we might do so, too. With I.T. products, a much more specialized category, the images aren't as direct. (A spokeswoman for GoToMeeting says its endorsers must have personal knowledge of the products.)
In the ad, Ms. Komando expounds on the virtues of GoToMeeting's high-definition video, saying that facial expressions ''often speak louder than words.'' But she says this on the radio. The form of her spoken testimonial undermines the scripted content. Yet GoToMeeting still benefits from the ad because radio as a medium is particularly well-suited for endorsements. On radio, spoken words can create a brief sense of personal connection with each listener, in a way newer media can't really match.
Radio is a congenial home for many advertisers in the hardware business, whether the hardware is lawn mowers or e-mail archivers. All that remains to be added are regular holiday sales for the I.T. products. Maybe the Labor Day weekend will bring a Sale-A-Bration -- for load balancers.

HEADLINE: Lauren Hunt, Blake Brogdon

BYLINE: By PAULA SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Lauren Ashley Hunt and William Blake Brogdon were married Saturday in Fort Worth. The Rev. Dr. Alan L. Lobaugh, a Disciples of Christ minister, performed the ceremony at University Christian Church. 
The bride, 24, who is taking her husband's name, is about to begin her third year of law school at Columbia. She graduated cum laude from Rice University. She is the daughter of Teresa L. Hunt and David S. Hunt of Fort Worth.
The bridegroom, also 24, who is known as Blake, is a financial software developer at Bloomberg in New York. He works in the interest rate volatility research and development group and writes software used to value securities. He also graduated from Rice and received two bachelor's degrees, one in economics and the other in electrical and computer engineering. He is a son of Anne B. Ferguson of Fort Worth and the late William Martin Brogdon Jr. The bridegroom is a stepson of Carter L. Ferguson.
The couple met in kindergarten at the Fort Worth Country Day School.
In the sixth grade, Mr. Brogdon asked her to be his girlfriend. ''I just saw her in the halls, and I thought she looked cute, and I thought it would be a good idea to ask her out,'' he said.
Yet the logistics of actually dating were a little more complicated than they had anticipated. ''We were both so shy and quiet and nervous that we saw each other only at school,'' Ms. Hunt said. They communicated mostly by instant message and by having friends pass notes back and forth after class. Several weeks later, she grew tired of that and told him, ''We can't date anymore because we can't talk.''
Mr. Brogdon remembered that as a somewhat devastating experience. ''She summoned me over to break up with me. I didn't know what dating was like, and all of a sudden I didn't have a girlfriend anymore.''
During the seventh and eighth grades, with no more pressure about dating, they gradually became friends. The relationship turned romantic during their first week of high school, in August 2001, when they saw each other at a dance.
''I asked her to the homecoming dance that was a couple months later,'' he said. The couple said that people usually wait until two weeks before the dance to ask anyone, but Mr. Brogdon was taking no chances. They never broke up again.
Ms. Hunt said of their long relationship: ''It's the only thing I've ever known, and I love him. He's helped shape who I am, and I can't think of what kind of person I would be without him in my life, and hopefully I've done the same for him.'' PAULA SCHWARTZ

1493
Uncovering the New World Columbus Created
By Charles C. Mann
Illustrated. 535 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $30.50.
''There's a chain of events in this best of all possible worlds,'' Dr. Pangloss says at the end of Voltaire's ''Candide.'' ''If you hadn't been caught up in the Inquisition, or walked across America . . . you would not be here eating candied fruit and pistachio nuts.''
''True,'' Candide answers. ''But now we must tend our garden.''
Voltaire would have loved Charles C. Mann's outstanding new book, ''1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created.'' In more than 500 lively pages, it not only explains the chain of events that produced those candied fruits, nuts and gardens, but also weaves their stories together into a convincing explanation of why our world is the way it is. 
Going one better than Voltaire, Mann's book opens in a garden as well as closes in one. The first is Mann's own in Massachusetts; the second, a Filipino family plot in Bulalacao. Despite being half a world apart, the two gardens grow many of the same plants, hardly any of which are native to either place. This, Mann tells us, is the hallmark of the ecological era we live in: the ''Homogenocene,'' the Age of Homogeneity.
''1493'' picks up where Mann's best seller, ''1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,'' left off. In 1491, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were almost impassable barriers. America might as well have been on another planet from Europe and Asia. But Columbus's arrival in the Caribbean the following year changed everything. Plants, animals, microbes and cultures began washing around the world, taking tomatoes to Massachusetts, corn to the Philippines and slaves, markets and malaria almost everywhere. It was one world, ready or not.
Mann generously acknowledges how much of this story line comes from Alfred W. Crosby's classic ''Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900,'' first published a quarter of a century ago. This book has had a huge influence in academia (it was one of the main inspirations for Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize-/winning ''Guns, Germs, and Steel''), but Mann has long felt it needed updating. When he met Crosby, he nagged the historian to write a new edition. Finally Crosby told him: ''Well, if you think it's such a good idea, why don't you do it?''
And so Mann did. ''1493'' is much more than just ''Ecological Imperialism'' warmed over, however. Mann takes the argument into new territory by suggesting that only by understanding what Crosby called ''the Columbian Exchange'' -- the transfer of plants, animals, germs and people across continents over the last 500 years -- can we make sense of contemporary globalization. The lesson of history, Mann argues, is that ''from the outset globalization brought both enormous economic gains and ecological and social tumult that threatened to offset those gains.''
With admirable evenhandedness, he shows how the costs and benefits of globalization have always been inseparable. We cannot have one without the other. Bringing the potato to Europe made it possible for the Irish famine to kill millions when the potatoes were stricken by blight, but it also kept other millions of half-starved peasants alive. Bringing malaria to the Americas depopulated some parts of the New World, but it also kept European armies out of other parts. Mann can even see the point of view of the chainsaw-/wielding loggers who deforested the Philippines so that Americans could have cheap furniture: ''These agents of destruction were just putting food on the table.''
Mann has managed the difficult trick of telling a complicated story in engaging and clear prose while refusing to reduce its ambiguities to slogans. He is not a professional historian, but most professionals could learn a lot from the deft way he does this. The book takes a roughly chronological approach, beginning in 1493 and continuing to 2011, and ranges across almost every continent. It is thoroughly researched and up-to-date, combining scholarship from fields as varied as world history, immunology and economics, but Mann wears his learning lightly. He serves up one arresting detail after another (who knew that ''No Potatoes, No Popery!'' was an English election slogan in 1765?), always in vivid language (as in his description of inland Brazil in the 1970s -- ''bad roads, poor land and lawless violence: 'Deadwood' with malaria'').
Most impressive of all, he manages to turn plants, germs, insects and excrement into the lead actors in his drama while still parading before us an unforgettable cast of human characters. He makes even the most unpromising-/sounding subjects fascinating. I, for one, will never look at a piece of rubber in quite the same way now that I have been introduced to the debauched nouveaux riches of 19th-/century Brazil, guzzling Champagne from bathtubs and gunning one another down in the streets of Manaus.
All historians struggle to get the balance between human will and vast impersonal forces just right. ''Should part of the credit for the Emancipation Proclamation be assigned to malaria?'' Mann asks, and while I'm sure he's right to answer that ''the idea is not impossible,'' this claim (and one or two others) seems a stretch. But that is part of the book's appeal. Almost everyone will find something that challenges his assumptions.
As well as making humans share the stage with other organisms, Mann also wants Europeans to surrender more of the limelight to the rest of humanity. In the 1960s, historians began to flip from casting Europeans as heroic adventurers who created the modern world to casting them as wicked exploiters. But they continued nonetheless to put Europeans in the main roles. Mann repeatedly emphasizes that the numbers do not bear this out. ''Much of the great encounter between the two separate halves of the world,'' he observes, ''was less a meeting of Europe and America than of Africans and Indians.'' As late as the 19th century, Europeans were still in a distinct minority in the New World.
Mann might be faulted for sometimes seeming to forget that since 1492 it has overwhelmingly been Europeans (not Africans or Native Americans) who have put animals, plants and microbes into motion, but his larger points still stand. In setting off the Columbian Exchange, humans rarely knew what they were doing. Once begun, the process ran completely out of human control. And now that it has hit its stride, every animal, plant and bug in the world is caught up in it. Back in the 1870s, for instance, the British government, worried about its rubber supplies, offered to buy every rubber seed that could be smuggled out of Brazil. People didn't ask what this would mean for Laos -- why would they? But 140 years on, the chain of events they set off has brought social upheaval and the threat of ecological collapse to this remote corner of the world. There is nowhere to hide from globalization.
Mann shows that Dr. Pangloss was right: Candide's run-ins with the Inquisition and America's natives were not just random events. The Columbian Exchange has shaped everything about the modern world. It brought us the plants we tend in our gardens and the pests that eat them. And as it accelerates in the 21st century, it may take both away again. If you want to understand why, read ''1493.''

HEADLINE: Just Give Me The Right to Be Forgotten

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
THE marketing pitch came by e-mail: Would you like to make an appointment with your dentist to have your teeth cleaned? And while you're at it, how about recommending him to a friend, or posting a review of your dental care?
I had given my e-mail address and mobile phone number to my dentist's office a couple of years ago, for those rare occasions when he might need to communicate with me. Now, here I was receiving what I deemed unwanted promotional e-mail -- and a text message -- about the dentist's services via Demandforce, a firm in San Francisco that handles customer communications for some 11,000 small business including dentists, spas and automotive shops. (Demandforce describes such messages as appointment reminders.) 
Of course, some people may not mind receiving automated, unsolicited birthday greetings or thank-you e-mails on behalf of their health care providers. But I felt that the conditions under which I had provided my contact information had been violated. I wanted the dentist's office and Demandforce to erase my information.
That proved easy enough -- in this instance. But, as I looked into the matter, I discovered that I, as an American, did not actually have an automatic right to demand that a company erase personal information about me.
Even as Congress and agencies like the Federal Trade Commission propose new privacy measures, it turns out that the United States still lags behind Europe in ensuring some controls. And, as my colleague Suzanne Daley recently reported, Europeans are hotly debating whether to do more.
Already, under the data protection directive of the European Union, people who have contracted with a company generally have a right to withdraw their permission for it to keep their personal data. Under this ''right to be forgotten,'' Europeans who terminate frequent-flier memberships, for example, can demand that airlines delete their flight and mileage records, says Lukas Feiler, a lawyer who specializes in information technology and privacy law.
''If I withdraw my consent to the storage of my personal data, they would not have the right to store it,'' says Mr. Feiler, an associate at Wolf Theiss, a law firm with headquarters in Vienna. But there are exceptions, he says -- for example, when a company has a legitimate reason to store the data that supersedes an individual user's interest.
In the United States, however, personal information about a consumer generally may be kept by the company that processes it -- except for certain regulated industries like credit. Individual companies in many sectors set their own policies on data retention. Some agree to delete information; others don't.
''As a general matter, companies in the United States don't have to recognize your right to be deleted,'' says Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research group in Washington. ''They may choose to accommodate you, but they are not required to.''
Certainly, there are many legitimate reasons for that. Businesses often keep records for tax or auditing purposes. Lawyers' and doctors' offices maintain records for a certain period to protect themselves against malpractice suits.
Now, however, some politicians, regulators and companies want to give Americans more control over their personal information -- with limits on data use and retention, says Christopher Wolf, a lawyer who specializes in privacy and the co-chairman of the Future of Privacy Forum in Washington.
''We need to move more toward that regime in order to empower consumers,'' Mr. Wolf says. But any limits, he emphasizes, would have to carefully balance personal privacy against the right to free speech and public access to information.
A bill introduced in the House last May, called the Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011, includes an ''eraser button'' provision for children and parents. It would require companies, when feasible, to allow users to delete publicly available personal information about minors from a Web site. (So far, there is no proposed equivalent covering grown-ups.)
But in a preliminary report, the F.T.C. has endorsed a related idea -- that companies collect only the data they need about people and keep it no longer than necessary. If businesses minimize data collection from the get-go, there may be less need for an eraser button later, says Jessica Rich, deputy director of the F.T.C.'s bureau of consumer protection.
For now, she suggests that people read company privacy policies and ''figure out ahead of time whether you have the ability to delete your data.''
Mr. Feiler in Vienna says the best hope is market innovation. With people attuned to data proliferation, he says, businesses with enhanced privacy options should prosper. Social networking sites, for instance, could differentiate themselves by offering automatic erasure, giving users the choice to delete their entire records, say, every six months.
''Some consumers would find that very useful,'' Mr. Feiler says. ''Others may want all their data to be available at least as long as they live.''
In the meantime, Americans like me, who would like companies to delete certain personal information, may find themselves depending on the kindness of strangers -- or, at least, acquaintances.
My dentist said his office started using updated, automated communications to keep up with increasingly mobile patients who enjoy social networking but often change their contact information. He immediately agreed to delete some of my details from the system, even though I will now be harder to contact.
Demandforce, the customer communications company, was equally responsive.
Rick Berry, its president, told me that the firm didn't send out unsolicited e-mails; it merely acts like a communications representative of a small business, transmitting digital reminders where a dentist's office might once have mailed postcards. He adds that the firm encrypts user data and adheres to health privacy regulations. If people have privacy concerns, they can easily opt out of further contact.
I, however, shouldn't have received a text message in the first place, said Patrick Barry, Demandforce's vice president for marketing, since I didn't give permission for my mobile number to be used that way.
The dentist's front office ''should have opted you out of receiving even a welcome text message,'' Mr. Barry said. In a follow-up e-mail, he said Demandforce had deleted my record: ''The system has officially 'forgotten' you.''
But in a data economy where personal information is an increasingly valuable currency, a consumer's automatic access to a delete button remains an exception.

SING to me of the man, O Muse -- that cleverest of men, most favored by the gods, most frustrated by them, too. Sing to me of endlessly lost Odysseus, whose 10-year journey home, from the scorched and blood-stained plains of Troy to the Ionian island of Ithaca, was a decade of disaster. Sing to me of the Cyclops, the Sirens, Calypso and Circe, Scylla and Charybdis, of challenges confronted and conquered, destiny delayed and at long last achieved.
So sing to me, I begged the Muse one Friday evening in May, or, hey, you know what? Just send me an intercity bus -- I've gotta get out of here.
''Here'' was the seaside town of Neapoli, at the southeastern end of the Peloponnesian peninsula of Greece, where nearly two weeks of island-hopping from the Turkish coast across the Aegean Sea had come to a sudden and maddening halt. From Cape Meleas -- the last location Odysseus himself recognized before the North Wind drove him into the monster-ridden lands of myth -- all I had to do was hop a bus or two to the port of Patra, and from there a ferry could take me, at long last, to Ithaca, the place Odysseus called home. 
In Neapoli, however, there were no buses until morning, and I had no choice but to spend the night in this cheerful, if sleepy, seaside town. Even a day or two earlier, I wouldn't have minded. In fact, for the previous 10 days I'd been delighted by the capricious whims of bus and ferry schedules. But I was due to fly home to New York from Athens in two days, and now this delay was unbearable.
As I numbed disappointment with ouzo at a waterfront restaurant, I noticed something unusual on the sidewalk before me: a penny-farthing, one of those 19th-century bicycles with an enormous front wheel and tiny rear one. The owner, it turned out, was Jim, a 20-something hairdresser from Athens who was sitting nearby with his girlfriend, Chara, a schoolteacher. They were a sweet couple, definite hipsters, and I smiled when they asked me, as had practically every Greek I met on my journey, how I'd wound up here.
''I've come from Troy,'' I said, ''and I'm trying to get to Ithaca. Like Odysseus: no map, no guidebook, no route, no Internet, no hotel reservations.''
Thus began a tale I'd been telling, and adding to, ever since I'd begun my Odyssey in Turkey outside the city of Canakkale, where ancient Troy was located and, beginning in the late 19th century, unearthed.
But Troy was not where I wanted to linger. It was, for both myself and Odysseus, a starting point. My plan was not to follow the hero's exact route -- it stretched, some say, as far as Gibraltar, and was mythical in any case -- but to stumble in his footsteps and try to get a glimpse into his psyche as he tried and failed and tried again to reach Ithaca, a mere 350 miles away as the crow flies, off the west coast of Greece.
Or maybe that's the wrong way to put it. For Odysseus has no psyche, not in the modern, literary sense. One of the founding works of Western literature may be a travel story about getting lost, but apart from the image of heartbroken Odysseus crying on the shores of Calypso's island, Homer rarely portrays his hero's disconnection and desperation.
How does that lostness feel, I wanted to know, especially in Greece, where the lonely spaces between rough and empty islands are balanced by an unmatched reputation for hospitality? So, with 11 days for the journey -- Odysseus took 10 years, but my wife, Jean, is less patient than his Penelope -- I left Troy to find out.
Immediately, I encountered uncertainty. Several Greek islands -- Limnos, Lesbos, Chios -- lie close to Turkey, but no one was sure when, or if, ferries were running. And that was even before Greece's austerity measures prompted port blockages, transit strikes and sometimes violent demonstrations in Athens. (The ferries, however, have kept running.) The Canakkale tourism office suggested a three-hour bus south to Ayvalik, where I might find a ferry to Lesbos, and if that didn't work, I could go farther south, to Izmir, alleged birthplace of Homer himself, and get the ferry to Chios. So, while Odysseus had sailed north with his 12 black ships to raid the lands of the Cicones, I went the other way.
Unlike Odysseus, I got lucky. In Ayvalik, a lovely Turkish town with a jumble of old streets at its center, ferries were leaving for Lesbos.
The two-hour ride was to be a typical one. Inside the ship, whose homey decor had not been updated in a couple of decades, about 100 families, couples and groups of friends mostly kept to themselves, snacking on sweets packed for the trip. This was a modest ferry; other, larger ones would have free Wi-Fi and show reruns of ''Friends'' dubbed into Greek. Outside was more exciting: the water flat and sparkling with golden-hour light, small sailboats and fishing skiffs cruising near shore, tiny islands silhouetted by the setting sun.
When the ferry docked in Mytilene, Lesbos's main town, night had fallen, and I hurried into the nearest travel agency and learned that a ferry to Chios was scheduled for 8:30 in the morning, 12 hours from now. O.K. So, where could I get to from Chios?
The travel agent did not know, and his ignorance would prove normal for the islands. People might know which ferries left from the local port, but from other ports? Might as well ask about ferries in Indonesia!
This was a challenge. Any embarkation could be a dead end, forcing me to retreat and replan my route. I'd just have to trust Hermes, god of travel, and see what happened.
I would also have to enjoy myself as much as possible, and so I got right down to it in Mytilene, walking through a maze of pedestrian shopping streets until I spotted the Old Market Cafe, which was small, lively and untouristy. But no sooner had I ordered (mint-spiked meatballs, white beans with dill, tomato-cucumber salad) than I heard a commotion outside. Perhaps 200 young people were marching through the dark, chanting slogans and handing out flyers decrying police brutality. (I don't read Greek, but there was a helpful illustration.) It was my first taste of the crisis that has been engulfing Greece since 2008, and I was tempted to follow the marchers and learn more.
''But there's no way to hide the belly's hungers,'' Odysseus once remarked. ''What a curse, what mischief it brews in our lives!'' So I ate, had a couple beers with off-duty soldiers at a bar, and paid too much for a hotel room.
At dawn I boarded the ferry to Chios. Again, a smooth ride through sun-dappled waters. This time, however, my reading material -- ''The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony,'' by Roberto Calasso -- caught the attention of an American couple who used to lead Sierra Club trips around Europe. The man -- who had been visiting Greece since the 1950s, had converted to Orthodox Christianity, and had taken the name Theofilos -- appreciated my endeavor, and urged me to visit Ios, where Homer was supposedly buried. This was precisely the kind of tidbit I'd been hoping for, and I swore I'd try to visit Ios -- wherever Ios happened to be.
First, though, Chios. Once again I stepped off the ferry and into the nearest travel agency, where I learned that a ferry for Samos, to the southeast, was leaving the next afternoon, giving me time -- at last! -- to explore a Greek island.
But where to go? I explained my quest to the travel agents, who told me that the house where Homer had lived was in the village of Volissos, along with a nice cafe. Volissos was, however, 25 miles away, and with no public transportation I'd have to rent a car. O.K.! Minutes later my little Hyundai was navigating switchbacks up cliffs, cruising an arid, boulder-strewn plateau, descending S-curves to the western shores of Chios and finally parking at the edge of Volissos, whose dense, haphazard lanes climbed a steep hill crowned by the ruins of a castle built during 300 years of Genoese imperial rule.
At Pythonas, a simple, spacious cafe across from a church, the owner, Maria Siderias, spoke English with a strangely familiar accent. She was from Astoria, the Greek neighborhood in Queens, she explained as she poured me good local wine and prepared fava beans with garlic sauce, grilled sausage and a tomato-cucumber salad. She had lived in New York until she was 20, she said, but during a family visit to Volissos 19 years ago she realized she didn't want to leave. New York life was volatile; Volissos, land of her ancestors, would be a new start.
By returning, Maria was bucking the trend. Once, she said, 3,000 people had lived here, but ever since the Germans came, so many villagers had left for Athens and abroad that the population was now maybe 200.
''Germans?'' I asked, wondering if she meant European Union bureaucrats, or wealthy Continental property-buyers.
''You know, in the war,'' she said.
Oh, the war: World War II. Those Germans.
Funnily enough, Maria had never sought out Homer's house, but encouraged me to search atop the village hill. All I found, though, were meticulously restored vacation homes and Stella Tsakiri, an artsy Athenian transplant spattered with paint from renovating her rental properties.
''It's rumors,'' she said of Homer's residence. Rather, she said, Volissos had been home to a clan that claimed to have descended from Homer. And even if the poet had lived in Volissos, she added, the village itself had moved around, ascending from its original seaside location in the Genoese era.
Rumors, though, were enough for me, and when I returned that night to the Pythonas Cafe (after stashing my things in the free apartment Stella offered), I listened raptly to Thomas Kanaris, an aging saddlemaker whom Stella called ''the soul of the village,'' tell a different story. According to him, Homer's house had been ''rebuilt and rebuilt and rebuilt'' so many times it was no longer the same structure.
The next morning I drove back to the port of Chios and boarded the ferry for Samos. ''What are they here?'' curious Odysseus would ask of each new island. ''Violent, savage, lawless? Or friendly to strangers, god-fearing men?'' On Chios, I knew the answer.
Samos, however, was not Chios. First of all, where Chios was rocky, Samos was verdant, a fact I appreciated as I cruised its milder coast in another rented car. But finding a place to stop -- welcoming but not touristy, isolated but not abandoned -- was difficult. None of the stunning, cliff-perched hill towns I checked out fit the bill. Tourists there were like olives: ubiquitous, entrenched, almost beneath notice.
Oh, but the driving! I kept on west, rounding the coast until the sun melted into the shadows of the hills and the roiling, wine-dark sea. The momentum, both physical and psychological, carried me through the evening, blotting out the throbs of music from a too-close disco as I slept in the city of Karlovassi.
Over all, I didn't feel let down. On my way back to port the next morning, I stopped for an espresso at North Star Cafe in the beachside village of Agios Konstantinos, and had a nice chat with Little Jim, an old Greek who had worked much of his life in Australia and had the black-and-white photos to show it.
Our conversation ranged from his father (the first villager killed by Nazis) to the troubles engulfing Greece (austerity, unemployment, ethnic strife) to his mother, who had, at the age of 100, returned to die here in the village of her birth. Little Jim's eyes, light brown but rimmed blue-green, were tearing up. Like Odysseus of Ithaca and Maria of Volissos, he had, in troubled times, found refuge in his native land.
The lesson of Samos -- no expectations -- was good preparation for Mykonos, which I knew by reputation as the party island of the Cyclades, a place of beaches, booze, bikinis and stark beauty (treeless cliffs, boxy whitewashed homes, blue-painted shutters). Not where people muse over classical literature.
But Mykonos is also a ferry hub. You can get almost anywhere from there, and it was time for serious decisions about how to reach Ithaca. Some 150 miles to the south, I knew, lay Crete, Greece's largest island, where I guessed there might be a ferry to the island of Kythira, roughly 15 miles off the mainland.
This was a gamble. I could get to Crete and discover that there was no westbound ferry and have to backtrack. But I'd been lucky so far, right? So after a day on Mykonos -- I went swimming, bought handmade sandals and watched an old woman selling vegetables from her donkey -- I boarded a high-speed catamaran bound for Ios.
Yes, Ios, site of Homer's alleged tomb, just happened to be on the way to Crete. I couldn't skip it. And once again, the gods were with me. A portside travel agency booked me into the high-end, modern Liostasi Hotel, a mere 40 euros a night (about $56, at $1.40 to the euro). Spiros, a Liostasi clerk who with his beard, tortoiseshell glasses and ironic mannerisms could have been my neighbor in Brooklyn, told me where to grab dinner. And when, with zero effort, I located his recommendation, Katogi, in the labyrinth of Ios's main village, I bonded with the bartender, Anastasia, who wholeheartedly endorsed my plan to pass through Kythira, her favorite island in all of Greece.
In the morning, with hours to go before the Crete ferry, I drove out to Homer's tomb, which lay, appropriately, at the very end of a small highway. A path led through knee-high bushes of wildflowers to a crest above the sea, and a half-collapsed pile of marble blocks. Could this really be Homer's resting spot? Sure, I thought, why not? I plucked a thatch of fragrant wild thyme and returned to the port.
Arriving after dark in Heraklion, Crete's capital, I had another run-in with Greek provincialism. No one knew when or whether ferries ran to Kythira; one port clerk suggested I wait till morning and call the ferry company.
Wait till morning! Spluttering with rage at these insular islanders who didn't even know how to get around their own country, I stormed out of the port and into the bus station, where I drank a calming beer and boarded a late-night shuttle west. The next day I found a ferry to Kythira, leaving in 24 hours. I'd have to wait till morning again.
So again, a rental car. Then the untamed mountains of Crete: goats on the winding road, azure waters below, olive groves silvering the slopes. Again, an honest taverna lunch: lamb stew, sour wine, a tomato-cucumber salad. I use ''again'' this way not as a complaint, but as an indication of the lush rhythm my life had fallen into. There was a regularity to the joy of discovering these new places, each so similar, none identical.
Below the village of Kampos, I spent hours descending the local gorge, following paths that vanished and reappeared and vanished again, down to a deserted, pristine beach where I felt like the last man alive, or like Odysseus, cast ashore in unknown lands.
Such episodes provoked ambivalence, too. Because as much as I loved them, I also needed to keep moving toward Ithaca. On Kythira, that feeling grew only more acute, amplified by the island's rugged vastness (3,300 people live on 116 square miles), by my inability to rent a car (for the first time, I was asked to show an international driver's license) and by the crack of thunder and a cold downpour of rain, which hit just after I'd hitchhiked to the island's biggest town and settled under a taverna's awning for lunch.
Of course, the rain eventually eased and I found another, kinder rental-car outfit, and I drove back roads through luxuriously arcing hills to reach teeny-tiny Avlemonas, a village recommended by Anastasia of Ios, where the sounds of cool jazz and blues lured me to the waterside Mirodia Kalokairiou Cafe. For a while I sat drinking Belgian beer and watching clouds rise over a ridge with the goateed owner, Stavros, and his employee, Stefanos, a recent cooking-school graduate.
''That one looks like a man,'' said Stefanos.
Stavros agreed: ''Like the god Hermes.''
When Odysseus lost his way after Kythira, he landed 10 days later in the land of the Lotus-eaters. I was there already. The beer, the comradeship, the casual mythological references, the braised goat at Stefanos's family's restaurant, the dramatic gorges and homey cafes and earthquake-ravaged churches -- why move on? If Ithaca represents sought-after home, Stavros said: ''Kythira is the opposite of that. It's the paradise you can never find.''
And yet I had to move on.
So first to Neapoli, then to Corinth and Patra, 230 miles north and west, then to Kyllini, another 30 miles southwest, then by ferry to the island of to Kefalonia, and from there: Ithaca.
After 11 days and untold miles at sea, the island appeared, wreathed in morning mist, mountains lined up, hump to hump, like sleeping green camels. The port stayed hidden from view until the ferry's final approach. Along with several dozen well-dressed Spanish tourists, I stepped onto the land of King Odysseus.
And then nothing. With five hours before the ferry back to Kefalonia, where I'd get a bus to Athens, I took a taxi from the port to Vathy, Ithaca's capital, whose stately buildings edged a shallow bay. There I had a coffee at one cafe, and another at another. I visited an archaeological museum with a collection of coins, pottery and statuettes dug up all over the island. One was a brass figurine, about an inch high, of Odysseus, his chin jutting, his eyes facing the heavens -- in search of signs from the gods?
All around town, wall maps pinpointed the far-flung locations of Homeric sites such as Eumaeus's pigsty, the nymph's cave and Odysseus's palace. Other posters advertised Island Walks, a tour company offering Odyssey-themed strolls around Ithaca. But I ignored them. For Odysseus, Ithaca meant an end to his wanderings, and I wanted to stop moving too, to see how stillness felt.
It felt unnatural. And I knew well why: Odysseus's Ithaca was not my Ithaca. Mine lay elsewhere, back in Brooklyn, or perhaps beyond. And now it was time to go.
Before returning to the port, though, I called up Ester van Zuylen, the Dutchwoman who runs Island Walks (her number was on the posters), and told her about my journey. By chance, she had to drop a friend at the port, so we met there to chat and watch schools of fish swim in the crystalline sea.
For a while she talked about the challenges of getting local government support for her work -- clearing the paths, promoting the tours -- and in general how difficult it was to capitalize on the island's sole claim to fame. This was a place, after all, where Penelope remained a popular women's name, and although no men were named Odysseus, Homer was quite common.
Minutes later, a Mazda pulled up.
''Oh, here's Homer now,'' Ester said.
Homer's arrival signaled my departure, and I took my last looks at the waters I hadn't swum and the hills I hadn't climbed. A day earlier, a friend had e-mailed me Constantine Cavafy's poem ''Ithaca,'' and a few of its lines stuck in my head: ''Ithaca gave you the marvelous journey. Without her you wouldn't have set out. She has nothing left to give you now.'' As I boarded the ferry, there was nothing else I wanted.
IF YOU GO
HOW TO GET AROUND
Since there are no definitive online ferry maps for the Greek islands, if you want to plan ahead the best resource is Ferries.gr, which also lets you book tickets no fewer than four days in advance. Otherwise, you can buy tickets at kiosks and travel agencies in the islands.
Few islands have public transportation, so be prepared to rent cars. All port towns I visited had at least one rental-car outfit. Prices for a manual-transmission compact are 20 to 30 euros a day ($28 to $42, at $1.40 to the euro), including insurance. Some companies insist you have an international driving permit, so get one from AAA ($15; aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html). Scooters, too, require a different driving license.

HEADLINE: If I Were President ...

BYLINE: By JESSE KORNBLUTH

 BODY:
We've heard from the media and from experts -- incessantly. What if we entered a pundit-free zone?
THERE'S a near-total disconnect between our real, large, urgent problems and the who's-up-who's-down cage match that is the daily bread of our pundit class. Unending wars, a bone-dry Southwest and flooded Midwest, the absence of a jobs program -- these have been, at best, of anecdotal interest to the mouths that roar on television. Instead, media-friendly politicians and pundits have been obsessed with two contrived priorities: the debt ceiling and a presidential election that's 15 months away.
''In moments of crisis, style dissolves into character,'' says Warren Bennis, the scholar of leadership who has advised four presidents. And not just for our leaders -- talking heads are also being tested. For all their eloquence, most have nothing to say that we haven't heard them say before. Bored and frustrated, I found myself hoping for ideas that might challenge or inspire. Then I asked a range of Americans who don't labor in politics or the media what they'd do if they were president. -- JESSE KORNBLUTH, a writer and the editor of HeadButler.com
MICHAEL J. SANDEL 
Harvard professor and the author of ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?''
I would lead a campaign against the skyboxification of American life. Not long ago, the ballpark was a place where C.E.O.'s and mailroom clerks sat side by side, and everyone got wet when it rained. Today, most stadiums have corporate skyboxes, which cosset the privileged in air-conditioned suites, far removed from the crowd below. Something similar has happened throughout our society. The affluent retreat from public schools, the military, and other public institutions, leaving fewer and fewer class-mixing places. Rich and poor increasingly live separate lives.
I would invest in an infrastructure for civic renewal -- not just roads and bridges, but schools, transit, playgrounds, parks, community centers, health clinics, libraries and national service. This would put people to work. And it would draw us out of our skyboxes and into the common spaces of democratic citizenship.
SHARON OLDS
Author of ''Strike Sparks: Selected Poems 1980-2002''
I'd grant the very rich the boon of helping them help others, as a form of gratitude for their good fortune. I'd also connect every creative writing program with a hospital, a school, a library, a prison, a neighborhood center -- workshops in the supermarkets! (''Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes!'')
ANDREW WEIL
Founder of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine and author of ''Why Our Health Matters''
I'd tell the nation that I was powerless to control the war machine, Wall Street, big oil and the other interests that run the country, and I would urge Americans to form a new political party not beholden to them.
DANNY MEYER
C.E.O. of Union Square Hospitality Group
Nearly every gut-ripping national debate asks who will get what sliver of a shrinking American pie. Where is there hope in division? Why can't we bake a bigger, tastier pie -- one from which we can all enjoy a slice? If I were president, I'd appoint a blue-ribbon committee of 14 accomplished citizens -- one each representing these nonpolitical walks of American life: arts, science, sports, big business, entrepreneurs, tech, medicine, law, education, environment, defense, religion, farming and philanthropy -- and charge them with imagining innovative industries that put Americans to work and add value to our world. I'd prioritize among the committee's ideas, then advocate for a tax code rewarding sustainable job-rich industries, especially those that liberate us from imported oil. We need to create as well as we consume. If we abandon our appetite for American ingenuity, we're cooked.
JAMES Q. WILSON
Pepperdine University professor and author of ''American Politics, Then and Now''
With my staff, I would decide what my administration was for. Once I had clarified that, I would write several speeches on how to cope with a stagnant economy, how to deal with countries (such as Iran and Syria) that harass their own populations, and how the United States is committed to the survival of Israel. These speeches would not attack the other party or previous presidents but would describe the views I supported. On the economy: do I favor tax cuts or increases, expenditure reductions or increases? On terrorist regimes: what sanctions will I support? On Israel: under what circumstances would an attack on Israel be regarded as an attack on the United States? People would disagree with some of what I said, but they would know where I stand. After delivering the speeches, I would submit to Congress my specific proposals, on which I would ask them to vote.
JENNIFER EGAN
Author of ''A Visit From the Goon Squad''
I'd decide (privately) from the outset that mine would be a one-term presidency. Freed from the stranglehold of ensuring my own political longevity, I would focus entirely on achieving what I think most Americans want: a stable and productive economy; an environmentally viable planet; a humane, efficient government capable of educating its young and protecting its vulnerable members. Americans are less selfish than some of our politicians believe (projection may be a factor here!) and will respond with reason and resilience to passionate clarity.
SISTER MARY DAVID WALGENBACH
Prioress of the Holy Wisdom Monastery of Middleton, Wis.
I would invest half of our defense budget in children, young people and in energy conservation.
I would expand the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps and grow both for the next 10 years. A benefit would be two years of free college for two years of service. I'd ask corporations to fund two years of college or a trade school for young women and men from homes stricken with poverty.
I would fund energy-saving improvements -- insulation of houses, solar panels and replacement of inefficient furnaces for households making less than $30,000 a year and develop a sliding scale for those earning more than $30,000 a year. I would help small businesses retrofit their buildings.
I would require members of Congress to participate in a weeklong workshop on dialogue, negotiation and compromise before the next session. All sessions would begin with 10 minutes of silence.
GEOFFREY CANADA
President of Harlem Children's Zone
I would have a ''grown-up'' talk with the American people, emphasizing that we are facing a crisis and solving it will require a spirit of shared sacrifice. Those of us who have benefited mightily from this country and made billions, as well as those who make the minimum wage, must all sacrifice.
The social contract that we have taken for granted must be updated given our tough economic challenges, and all of us must now pay our great country back -- giving more than we anticipated just a year ago. Those who can give a lot must do so; those of more modest means must also do their part.
All our sacred cows must be reconsidered: Medicare, tax breaks for corporations, Social Security, tax cuts for the wealthy and middle class, military spending, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But there is one group that we must protect at all costs -- our children. We must sacrifice so that our children won't inherit a country that is less than the one our parents left us. Our march toward equity and equality cannot be sacrificed. God bless America and God bless America's children!
PATRICIA RYAN MADSON
Author of ''Improv Wisdom: Don't Prepare, Just Show Up''
I would invite all of the members of Congress to join me in an improvisation retreat. We would spend the time practicing saying ''yes'' to each other and really listening to one another's offers. We would create stories of well-being. We would encourage thinking ''inside the box.'' We would look for innovative ways to use the resources at hand to solve our problems. We would make some mistakes, and we would laugh a lot. Real laughter has been absent in the White House lately.
JAMES DYSON
Inventor and founder of the James Dyson Foundation
I would get America back to what it does best: take risks. Or rather, the right type of risks. The United States was founded on brave, bold and untested inventions, not financial gambles. Real engineering, not endless economic engineering.
The United States still spends more than any other nation on research and development. But others are moving up, not least China. America needs to inspire a new generation of risk takers. And it starts in school.
No Child Left Behind ''rates'' children and schools arbitrarily through multiple choice questions. Standardization and rote learning lead to sub-standard results because they don't inspire or challenge. My solution: get rid of binary right and wrong answers. Experimentation is learning. Only through making mistakes do we find out what works, what to do differently and how to get better. Box-ticking does not correlate with world winning. Certificates won't beat global competition. Creativity will. Engineering and science will. Patents will. Let's inspire children by giving them the freedom to get things wrong. By fostering an environment where learning through failure is celebrated, the United States can get back to ongoing success -- making mistakes, making things.

The question implies that if you swap out one, put in another, then all will be well with America -- as though our leaders are the cause of all ailments.
When you're scientifically literate, the world looks different. Science provides a particular way of questioning what you see and hear. When empowered by this state of mind, objective realities matter. These are the truths on which good governance should be based and which exist outside of particular belief systems.
Our government doesn't work -- not because we have dysfunctional politicians, but because we have dysfunctional voters. As a scientist and educator, my goal, wouldn't be to lead a dysfunctional electorate, but to bring an objective reality to the electorate so it could choose the right leaders in the first place.

1) Name Tom Brokaw and Herbert Allen as my key advisers, along with Mike Nichols, Steve Martin and Fran Lebowitz. Then Jane Rosenthal would be my first lady.
2) Upon being sworn in, a lawmaker would be prohibited from appearing in any still or moving images. (Only candid shots of family and religious gatherings would be permitted.)
3) Immediately after August break, every member of the House and Senate would be required to move for two weeks, with family, to a town or small city in a country outside North America. (Those serving more than one term may only visit an English speaking country once and not on the first trip.)
4) Upon returning to work inside the Beltway, each senator and representative would be required to attend a three-day seminar given by former Senator Alan Simpson on The Integrity of the Deal. Those who fail the exam at the seminar's conclusion will lose their seat/vote with no replacement forthcoming from a state appointment or run-off election. (During some 20-odd years in the senate, Alan Simpson and Ted Kennedy never agreed on one topic. Yet Senator Al swears that when he and Ted reached an agreement, that deal was chiseled in stone. Today, when a deal is struck in either arm of the government it can be counted on until the evening news.)
5) These deal negotiations would be recorded only to be reviewed if a deal was broken. Then ''highlights'' would be released to the public. Every month the Top 10 Busted Deals would have their highlights reviewed on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' with the winners receiving an 18-month, all-expense-paid visit to Danbury.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Silicon Valley, the Night Is Still Young

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER; Miguel Helft contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MENLO PARK, Calif.
LET the rest of the country worry about a double-dip recession. Tech land, stretching from San Jose to San Francisco, is in a time warp, and times here are still flush.
Even now, technology types in their 20s and 30s are dropping a million-plus each on modest ranch houses in Palo Alto in Silicon Valley and Victorian duplexes in San Francisco, and home prices in some parts have jumped nearly 50 percent in the last six months.
Jobs -- good, six-figure jobs, with perks like free haircuts and lessons on how to create the next start-up company -- are here for the taking, at least for software engineers.
And for anyone with a decent idea and the drive to start a company, $100,000 to get it off the ground is easy to come by. 
Yet, for all the outward optimism, even before the recent gyrations on Wall Street, old fears have been creeping in, nagging memories of the dot-com bust. You can sense it at cocktail parties in Menlo Park, at business conferences in Redwood City, inside the hipper-than-thou offices of young Web companies in San Francisco. Maybe, just maybe, these good times won't last, and it will all come crashing down again.
''There's this '90s hangover people still have,'' says Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder and tech investor.
Now the worry is that all the turmoil on Wall Street will spread West. Can Silicon Valley really prosper if the general economy tips back into a recession? Can you make a fortune on your I.P.O. if the market is falling? Probably not. But then, no one should work here unless she is prepared to be lucky. Even in worrisome moments, like now, the essential optimism of this place endures.
''There's a 'greater-fool theory,' '' says Lise Buyer, who was a tech stock analyst during the dot-com bubble and is back with a consulting firm, the Class V Group, that advises on initial public offerings. ''In Silicon Valley, we are as a species wildly optimistic. But if we weren't, we wouldn't have so many entrepreneurs because no one who's being rational would ever found a company.''
And so start-ups are multiplying. Engineers are deciding that this is the right time to create would-be Groupons or Facebooks -- ''me-too companies,'' valley speak for start-ups that are basically copycats of a winning formula -- or yet another local, social mobile app.
Even more than buying a new Prius or jetting off to Cabo for the weekend, the new money set here wants to keep investing -- and believing. Backing another start-up is a status symbol, the No. 1 splurge, and it captures both the tech industry's belief in the future and its fear of missing the next big thing.
''These are nouveau tech millionaires,'' says Adeo Ressi, a coach for entrepreneurs. ''It's not that they don't see the warning signs. It's like roulette.''
Even before the fragility of the stock market became apparent, people here had been asking this question: Are we in a new tech bubble?
The optimists -- or, some would say, the self-interested who stand to profit from the hype -- note that the amounts being invested are nowhere near what they were in 2000, and that the companies this time are generally profitable and mature. The pessimists say yes, a bubble has been inflating, yet even they aren't fleeing. They just hope to be the smart ones who get lucky and get out before it pops.
A bubble looks just like a boom, says Marc Andreessen, who touched off the first boom when his company, Netscape, went public in 1995. Frank Quattrone, the investment banker who took Netscape and dozens more companies public back then, says that today feels less like the height of the bubble and more like 1995, when tech companies were starting to go public but investors weren't yet speculative.
Just four short years ago, social media and the iPhone were the hot new things, and money was sloshing around. But when the recession hit in 2008, Silicon Valley froze. Of course, that didn't last long: by 2010, start-up investing was booming again with money from angel investors playing with their own cash, and this year the I.P.O. markets opened wide to tech companies for the first time since 2007.
Twenty-two tech companies went public in the second quarter alone this year worth $5.5 billion, the highest dollar amount since 2000, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Only six went public in all of 2008.
The valuations of young start-ups, meanwhile, have been defying gravity. Almost 1,000 raised $7.5 billion from venture capitalists in the second quarter, up 19 percent from the first quarter and 61 percent from the same period in 2009.
At first the bubble debate fixated on LinkedIn, which went public in May. Its stock price spiked on the first day of trading, reminding people of the bubble days -- but then again, LinkedIn is a 10-year-old, profitable company. (Its shares have since fallen 16 percent.) Then more companies joined the I.P.O. rush, like the money-losing Groupon, just two years old. By promoting a gauge it called ''acsoi'' (for adjusted consolidated segment operating income) to measure its business performance, it called to mind the initial Internet wave, which offered interesting metrics like ''eyeballs'' and ''mindshare.''
Now, amid the stock market's overall upheaval, people are wondering whether highflying Web companies can still make it on Wall Street.
''Investors don't want stocks with valuations that rival the national debt,'' said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner of I.P.O. Boutique, an advisory firm. ''They're going to have to be pristine, not only on revenue growth but also showing decreasing losses or increasing profits.''
No matter what you call it -- a bubble, a boom or business as usual in a land of optimism -- something has been in the air. It may be harebrained or hopelessly out of touch, but if you don't have a rosy outlook, you don't belong here.
ON a rare sunny June day in southern San Francisco, hundreds of entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs flocked to the Founder Showcase, a kind of ''American Idol'' for start-ups that is held every three months and run by Mr. Ressi. Ten lucky founders, chosen in advance, pitched their companies to a panel of five venture capitalist judges, while the rest watched and voted for their favorites on their cellphones.
The audience members were hoping for money -- or even just a business card or some advice on pitching their own companies -- from the investors among them. The investors were easy to spot: they were the older ones with button-down shirts and slacks.
It was the seventh Founder Showcase. But signaling the appetite for money-making ideas, it had sold 600 tickets, double the number of the previous event.
First to make a presentation was Bundled, a service for merchants that sell coupons on daily deal sites, just one of many start-ups chasing Groupon. But Dave Parker, Bundled's founder, said it was different -- ''the post-daily-deal company for businesses.''
Not different enough, apparently, for some people. ''I've probably seen four of these in the last two weeks,'' said Rebecca Lynn, a judge from Morgenthaler Ventures. The judges held up their scorecards. The average score was 3 out of 5.
Soon came VidCaster, a service for Web sites to add video; it was started by Kieran Farr, a taxi driver turned chief executive. He said his service had absolute stickiness -- meaning that it lures Internet users to stick around for a long time.
''What's the gross margin of the business look like?'' asked George Zachary of Charles River Ventures.
''What does that mean?'' Mr. Farr said.
''That's a problem.''
Average score: 2.8.
Downstairs, free wine and tables of salami and crudites beckoned, but many people lingered to swarm the V.C.'s with their own ideas.
Rory O'Driscoll, a venture capitalist, complained that all the new deals were incredibly overpriced, but he still dismissed bubble talk. ''It's a little bit party-poopy,'' he said, ''to go from the world is ending because no one is investing to the world is ending because everything is so overpriced, without going through the middle part where we all make money.''
HANGING out near University Avenue in Palo Alto or in the SoMa district of San Francisco, you might wonder where all the wealth is. You can't spot many designer suits, diamond tennis bracelets or mansions with columns. Instead, waiting in line at the Off the Grid food trucks in SoMa or at Fraiche frozen yogurt in Palo Alto, you see people in fleeces emblazoned with the names of their start-ups and hear them chatting about their new app or what to do with $30 million.
''You never change the way you dress,'' says an executive at one hot start-up who made a small fortune at a previous one. He wore an orange T-shirt. ''You don't want to flaunt it,'' he adds, ''especially in front of your employees.''
So you might buy a car that's nice but not too fancy -- maybe a Prius or a BMW, but definitely not a Bentley -- and take up a hobby like kite surfing. You occasionally charter a plane to fly privately, especially if it gives you more time to work on your start-up. Efficiency makes sense to engineers; splurging for splurging's sake does not.
At open houses, engineers in their 20s and 30s have offered cash to pay for $1.5 million homes, and are even bidding up the prices of $3,500-a-month rental apartments by a few hundred dollars. In Palo Alto, according to the real estate Web site Trulia, the median home sale price has risen 49 percent in six months, to about $1.2 million.
''You're seeing the new tech money and also the anticipation of new tech money,'' says Alex Lehr of Lehr Real Estate in San Carlos, Calif., as builders buy land and fixer-uppers in preparation for Facebook to go public.
Still, the young tech millionaires are not buying all they can afford. They avoid towns like Atherton and Woodside, where senior executives and rich venture capitalists live, because they don't want to seem showy.
For some, it's a different story. Yuri Milner, the Russian investor who stormed the valley with hundreds of millions of dollars, which he plowed into Facebook, Zynga and Twitter, recently spent $100 million on a French-style chateau with a ballroom, home theater and indoor and outdoor pools.
But it hasn't sat well with some people here.
''Being that ostentatious is O.K. in Russia, but not here,'' says an executive who attended a party at Mr. Milner's house but didn't want to be named, wishing to preserve business relationships.
The new home of Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, is more typical. Mr. Zuckerberg, who Forbes says is worth $13.5 billion, finally stopped renting and splurged on a house. He spent $7 million to buy one that is a century old -- with just one pool (though it is saltwater).
Instead, the biggest splurge for the valley's nouveau riche is angel investing, putting $25,000 or $100,000 into a friend's start-up to keep the cycle going.
''That's where all the money goes,'' says Alex Rampell, a co-founder of TrialPay, an online advertising start-up in Mountain View. ''It's not about making it back. It's about feeling good -- and doing what's accepted.''
At a rooftop party in the hills south of downtown San Francisco, M. C. Hammer was shouting into the microphone as attendees raised their cellphones high to take his picture. ''Today and yesterday -- different tempos, different styles,'' he intoned.
The scene was an office-warming party for Airbnb, a service for people who want to rent rooms in their homes. It had just joined the club of start-ups, including Spotify, Square and Gilt, that were valued at $1 billion or more by their investors; its new office was befitting of a company with $112 million in fresh capital.
The conference rooms had been lavishly transformed into models of some of Airbnb's most enviable properties, like an art-filled apartment in SoHo in Manhattan and a mushroom dome cabin near Santa Cruz. The women's restrooms were painted hot pink and stocked with dry shampoo, Chloe perfume and affirmational notes -- like ''life is lovely'' -- scrawled on the wall. The shelves held multiple copies of books like ''Secrets of the Millionaire Mind'' by T. Harv Eker.
The guests, sipping cocktails and playing Skee-Ball, looked out of place in tech land. They were dressed in short black cocktail dresses and slacks. But once they put on the gray hoodies -- bearing Airbnb's logo -- that were distributed at the event, they were a casting director's dream.
A private security guard and a fire marshal watched with amusement from the sidelines. Many tech companies had been hiring them for parties, they said. The fire marshal said he had worked at one at AT&T Park, the baseball stadium that Genentech had rented out for a concert with ''the guy from 'American Idol' who didn't win but has a rock band now.''
Another night, another office-warming party in San Francisco -- this time for Foursquare, the Web service that alerts your friends to your location. The event was in an airy loft around the corner from the offices of hot start-ups like Twitter.
''Hiring is the main reason for the party, to make some noise that we have space in San Francisco,'' said Dennis Crowley, a Foursquare co-founder who had flown in from New York, where the company is based, on Virgin America, the pink-lit, WiFi-equipped airline that serves as a commuter train for tech types shuttling between the two cities.
A disco ball started flashing, and someone brought Mr. Crowley a gold paper crown. Engineers and venture capitalists cozied up to the bar to order ''the Start-Up'' (gin, tonic and blackberry soda) and ''the Frat House'' (rum and Mountain Dew Throwback). But the guests seemed mostly concerned with checking in to the party on Foursquare and posting about it on Twitter; their messages were broadcast on a giant screen.
Mr. Crowley may have a haircut like Justin Bieber's former shaggy look, but at 35 is old by Silicon Valley standards. During the first boom, he was a tech analyst at JupiterResearch. In 2004, he started Dodgeball, another check-in service, which Google bought for a few million dollars and later shut down.
He scoffed at comparisons to 1999. Today, he said, ''companies get a lot more done with a lot less capital.''
''There are so many more people on the Internet,'' he added. ''My grandmother knows how to shop on Amazon.''
''There is real money to be made.''
THE Twitter message flickered on the screen of Aye Moah's iPhone, just as she was waking up in a Silicon Valley motel. She turned to her boyfriend and business partner, Alexander Moore, and said, ''Get in the car and go.''
The investor Dave McClure had just posted that he needed a ride because his car was in the shop. The payment: he would listen to a start-up pitch from his driver.
Ms. Moah and Mr. Moore had come to the valley to raise money for their e-mail start-up, Baydin, but their meetings hadn't gone well. So they leapt at Mr. McClure's offer.
Mr. Moore jumped into his Chevy Cobalt and picked up Mr. McClure. And by the time they reached his destination 20 minutes later, Mr. McClure had agreed to give Baydin $100,000.
Mr. Moore and Ms. Moah have since moved into an office with cement floors and sweeping views. Almost nightly, they attend networking events with other engineers, or parties like one in San Francisco featuring belly dancers playing with fire. The couple dream of turning their start-up into a big company.
But if the dream is contagious, so is the fear.
The other day, Mr. Moore went to a start-up event to learn about ''quick exits'' -- valley talk for cashing out of your company while you still can -- where executives from large tech companies coached young entrepreneurs on how to sell their nascent start-ups.
Just in case.

HEADLINE: Briefly the New Frontier, Exurbs See a Bust After Boom

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON. 
djohnson@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Far west suburban Yorkville scarcely looks as if it was once one of America's hottest boomtowns. In some subdivisions, lots for big homes are patches of scrub grass and rocky soil. Weeds crawl up around some curbs. A mere handful of houses dot the barren landscape.
''This was going to be the place to be,'' said Jay Waldvogel, a dentist who is one of the tiny number of residents in a lonesome neighborhood of Yorkville, the seat of Kendall County, about 50 miles southwest of the Loop. ''And now it's dead.''
Between 2000 and 2010, Kendall was the fastest-growing county in the United States, with a growth rate of some 110 percent, according to the Census Bureau. In the Chicago area, Kendall was not the only faraway land of big dreams. Population soared, too, in distant suburban Kane, Will and McHenry Counties. Even in DeKalb County, tall-corn country nearly halfway to Iowa, newcomers were drawn by visions of castles on a cul-de-sac.
Now real estate experts say these far-flung housing developments are among the hardest hit by the housing downturn. In Yorkville, with a population of about 18,000, at least 10 subdivisions sit unfinished, with little sign of development soon. 
''The Chicago region has been one of the hardest-hit markets in the country,'' said Erik Doersching, the executive vice president of Tracy Cross & Associates, a real estate analysis firm in Schaumburg. ''And the outlying areas are the most impacted.''
In 2009 and 2010, the top foreclosure rates in Illinois were in Kendall, Kane and Will Counties. On the new suburban frontier along the farthest fringes of the Chicago region, where cheap land and rising prices once triggered a rush of buyers, some newer developments have become ghost towns in places like Yorkville, Frankfort, Sugar Grove and Hampshire.
Even in exurban Sycamore, a 70-mile drive to downtown Chicago, the population roughly doubled, to some 17,000, in the 2000s. Those were heady times.
''We were tripping over buyers,'' said Diane Hammon, the president of the DeKalb Area Association of Realtors, recalling the people eager to build homes in subdivisions carved out of farmland in Sycamore. ''We didn't take the time to stop and think, 'This could come down.' And then all of a sudden, we just fell off a cliff.''
Property values in Chicago and closer suburbs have also suffered. But the distant areas were more vulnerable, according to Prof. Thomas Lys, who teaches classes on the dynamics of the real estate market at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, because they were driven largely by speculation, as buyers bet on rampant growth.
When fuel prices jumped, the distant suburbs lost some appeal, Professor Lys said. ''With $4-a-gallon gas, you're just not going to want to drive 100 miles a day.''
The sudden halt to building in the far suburbs has changed the way people define the contours of the Chicago region, said Mr. Doersching, the real estate analyst. Places that were verging on becoming part of the Chicago area, he said, have reverted to rural status and are likely to stay that way for at least another generation.
In the distant town of Hampshire in far western Kane County, it seemed as if the metropolis had come knocking four or five years ago. A giant new residential project called Prairie Ridge announced a development of homes that would cover 1,300 acres of corn and bean fields with upscale homes.
In a town where people can feel comfortable in overalls, the project promised Hampshire a loftier place in the world. In preparation for the expected rush of newcomers, Hampshire opened a gleaming three-story high school in 2007 that could accommodate a doubling of enrollment, to 2,500.
But the housing market crashed even before Prairie Ridge started digging foundations. Today the would-be development has paved roads, street signs, fire hydrants, even rows of trees -- but only three houses, two of them model homes sold in foreclosure.
Without the expected influx of new students, Hampshire now has a much bigger high school than it needs, and 15 classrooms remain shuttered.
It cost the community $185 million, most of it raised through a bond issue, to build Hampshire High School and upgrade other facilities to prepare for the growth that did not come. Besides paying those bills, the town has been forced to grapple with a shrinking tax base eroded by plummeting housing values.
To make ends meet, the school cut $8 million from its budget this year, the principal, Chuck Bumbales, said. The Hampshire teachers' union agreed to contract concessions, and administrators took a two-year pay freeze.
In places where the boom has fizzled, most people seem certain that growth will come eventually.
In one sparse Yorkville subdivision, Whitetail Ridge, Mike Fuehrmeyer stepped outside to water his bushes. From his front yard he could spot about 10 ''For Sale'' signs on nearby lots and homes.
At the peak of the housing boom in 2007, the subdivision had homes that carried asking prices of well over $1 million, said Mr. Fuehrmeyer, who bought four years ago. He would not reveal what he had paid but said a recent appraisal showed his property had lost 34 percent of its value.
''You just pray the values will go up,'' Mr. Fuehrmeyer said with a shrug.
But those who hope for a quick rebound may be disappointed.
''People think we'll see a recovery and prices will just go back up to where they were,'' Mr. Doersching said. ''That's not how it's going to work. If you have a house that used to be worth $300,000, and now it's worth $220,000, well, maybe in six years it'll be up to $240,000.''
For bargain hunters, the downturn has meant that many recent home buyers can afford a much grander dwelling. Byron Patterson, a 42-year-old highway maintenance worker, moved from Bolingbrook to a stone-and-brick McMansion in Yorkville last November, paying $100,000 less than a list price that had already been discounted.
''It worked out cool for my family,'' Mr. Patterson said.
For people in economic distress, however, losing a house -- whether voluntarily or by foreclosure -- can be emotionally wrenching. It is painful under any circumstances, but in suburbs and small towns, where people tend to know other people's business, the wounds can be rubbed raw.
''I sit at closings with people who are absolutely crushed with embarrassment,'' said Ms. Hammon, the DeKalb real estate broker. ''And I tell them: 'Look, this isn't your fault. You got sick. Or you went through a divorce. Or you lost your job. You're not alone.' ''
Yorkville's superintendent of schools, Scott Wakeley, said educators and counselors needed to be especially attentive to children whose families were under financial pressure. It had been customary in his district for 3 to 5 percent of students to qualify for subsidized lunches, he said. Now that figure ''is in the double-digits.''
''There is a hidden emotional toll that family financial problems bear on the children,'' Dr. Wakeley said. ''We've got kids in our district who have done all the right things, gotten straight A's, scored a 29 or 30 on their ACT, and now they're being told they can't afford to go to that Big Ten school of their dreams. They're going to a community college.
''And we've got kids who used to play three sports, or kids who used to be involved in activities, like the band. And now they're not. They've got to work a job.''

HEADLINE: The Sad Statistic That Trumps The Others

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
THERE'S been a lot of bad economic news lately, yet we may be overlooking the most disturbing development of all: our economic productivity has been weakening. This isn't just a problem for the United States. Because America remains a leader in technology and innovation, it is also a matter of concern for the entire world.
Productivity statistics are hardly exciting reading, but they are important. Our society is wealthy precisely because it can churn out products like automobiles, flush toilets and Google search algorithms at relatively low cost. Productivity slowdowns mean erosion of living standards over the long haul, and they also can lead to short-term crises. If productivity turns out to be much lower than expected, it often means that we have borrowed too much and taken on too much risk. Retrenchment can make a recession longer and deeper. 
The overlooked piece of news came this month from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the second quarter this year, it reported, nonfarm business labor productivity fell by 0.3 percent, the second quarterly drop in a row. And it turns out that it rose only 0.8 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Over the last year, hourly wages have risen more quickly than productivity.
These factors have helped to keep the labor market sluggish and have thwarted a potential recovery.
Yet these numbers don't capture the entire issue, and are themselves plagued by an array of problems. One bias in the economic statistics -- which never shows up in published revisions -- is embedded in the health care sector, where third-party payments, subsidies and care quality are hard to monitor and measure. A result is that a dollar spent on health care does not necessarily mean a true dollar's worth of value added. The United States spends more per capita on health care than any other country, yet without producing measurably superior results. To the extent that some of these expenditures are wasteful, the gross domestic product and productivity numbers overstate economic growth.
Here's another problem: Expenditures on the military and domestic security have risen since 9/11, but those investments are intended to neutralize external threats. Even if you agree with this spending, it generally doesn't produce useful goods and services that raise our standard of living.
One of the most commonly cited productivity numbers describes per-hour labor productivity, but this, too, has intrinsic flaws. Labor force participation has been falling for more than a decade, and low-skilled workers are leaving the work force in disproportionate numbers. Taking some lower-paying jobs out of the mix will raise the measure for average productivity, which is hardly the same as increasing the economic gains from a given set of workers or, for that matter, from putting more people to work by making them more productive.
It is increasingly clear that many of our current economic problems predate the financial crisis, even if the crisis accelerated them or brought them into clearer view. A recent study by E. J. Reedy and Robert E. Litan, both researchers at the Kauffman Foundation, found that sluggish job creation was a long-term trend. For instance, job creation from start-ups has fallen every decade since the 1980s, raising the specter of an America with an innovation shortfall.
Keynesians argue that the economy is suffering from a lack of spending or too little ''aggregate demand.'' That's a valid point, but innovation is one means of stimulating demand. When the iPad and iPad2 arrived on the market, for example, the spending was there to support them, which suggests that more innovation could help turn around the business cycle.
One problem may be offshoring by American companies, as stressed in a study by Michael Mandel, chief economic strategist of the Progressive Policy Institute, and Susan Houseman, senior economist with the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. Some productivity gains from the manufacturing of the iPad are captured by workers in China, who make important parts of the device, rather than by American workers. American companies often save on costs by finding lower wages abroad, not by enhancing the abilities of American workers. That would help explain why measured productivity has often been high over the last decade while despite year-to-year variation domestic wages and job creation have been flat.
My point is not to attack offshoring, which eases innovation and benefits poorer workers in the source countries. In any case, we cannot imprison capital in the United States. The relevant point is that even after the recent downward revisions, the domestic productivity statistics may be understating the bad news.
Finally, there is a growing realization that while the Chinese economy is wonderful for cutting costs and improving manufacturing methods, it will not soon be taking the lead in creating breakthrough products. For all the money spent on R.& D. in China, Chinese scientific papers are not cited much abroad and Chinese patents are filed at a low rate internationally, suggesting that they are less than revolutionary. Dan Breznitz, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Michael Murphree, a doctoral candidate there, have discussed the incremental nature of Chinese innovation in their new, illuminating book, ''Run of the Red Queen.''
In other words, the next wave of major innovation will probably rely on the world's current scientific leaders, many of whom are based in the United States. Recently, though, Americans have not been getting the job done, and it's starting to sink in that the real story is the truth on the ground -- not the published numbers.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Economic View column last Sunday, about the decline in economic productivity, misspelled the name of an organization where researchers had studied sluggish job creation. It is the Kauffman Foundation, not Kaufmann. (Its full name is the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.)

HEADLINE: Barely Missing A Beat

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
BEFORE the financial markets' most recent drubbing, New York City's real estate prices had been flat for the better part of a year. But over the spring and summer, prices in certain pockets of property sprinkled around Manhattan and Brooklyn had rebounded to or beyond pre-recession levels.
These micromarkets could turn up along a particular avenue or even in a specific building, and they tended to be in what brokers describe as prime locations, in neighborhoods like Greenwich Village and Chelsea in Manhattan, and Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope in Brooklyn.
They fell into a few general categories, namely: apartments in move-in condition; family-size apartments with three or more bedrooms; apartments with unusual features like helicopter-level views of Central Park; and almost-new condos in their first resale. Having one of these traits did not guarantee a record-setting price, but apartments achieving that milestone tended to have one or more of them. The apartments often also generated multiple offers, though not quite the frenetic bidding wars that were routine in 2007 and 2008. 
The latest round of economic turmoil will no doubt give buyers pause and may portend a double dip for the real estate market.
''Consumers are going to look at all this economic uncertainty and they're going to be more wary about buying,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a market analyst for Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''It's going to delay the recovery, which was already challenged, and it will probably take the edge off some of the areas that have already seen improvement.''
Despite this, brokers say, the types of apartments that had been getting 2007 and 2008 prices will probably continue to do so.
Shaun Osher, the chief executive of the agency CORE, said he had seen apartments in several developments that opened in 2008 and 2009 easily selling for more than the original owners paid. ''The product is the product,'' he said. ''Even if the markets decline, the units that will continue to fare the best are the resales in new developments.'' For some people, he added, ''the only thing better than buying a shiny new condo is buying one that is still pretty new but has already had any problems vetted out.'' He said the strong sales were helped by a lack of new inventory coming to market.
At 520 West 19th Street in Chelsea, which CORE helped sell out in 2008, a three-bedroom apartment that closed in September 2008 for $2.675 million sold this June for $3.15 million, an increase of nearly 18 percent. Similarly, Streeteasy.com shows that a two-bedroom there resold in April for $2.3 million, 10 percent more than the $2.09 million the original owner paid. The bounce clearly had not yet hit last summer, when another three-bedroom sold for $2.3 million, 13 percent below its original $2.64 million sale price.
The success of 520 West 19th Street, of course, cannot be generalized for all two- to three-year-old buildings.
Doug Perlson, the chief executive of the brokerage RealDirect, said strong resales were ''not the rule for a lot of the developments that came on at the height of the market.'' In Chelsea, he said, some buildings near Eighth Avenue are reselling at a loss, while buildings farther west or farther east are getting a premium.
''There are pockets of activity in West Chelsea near the High Line that are probably going to have success in whatever market we're in,'' Mr. Perlson said. Buildings along the Avenue of the Americas have also been selling well, he added, because ''this neighborhood has become much hotter in the last two years,'' with the opening of a Trader Joe's and the Eataly food court not too far away. He said he had a buyer in contract for a two-bedroom at the Lion's Head Condominium, at Avenue of the Americas and 19th Street, for $2.15 million. The apartment originally sold in 2007 for $2 million.
On the same avenue at the Chelsea Stratus, a 37-story tower at 24th Street that opened in mid-2007, at least eight apartments have resold this year with premiums of 2 to 21 percent, according to data from Streeteasy.com.
Andrew Anderson, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman who led the sales team for the developer and has since resold dozens of units at the Stratus, said that after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008 , about 20 buyers pulled out of their contracts. Those units were resold at discounts of about 15 percent in 2009, he said, but prices started to bounce back in mid-2010.
He said that the Stratus, which towers above its neighbors, was selling well ''because it has something that you can't replicate,'' specifically stunning city views. ''The quality has to be there and the floor plans have to work,'' he said. ''But it's a building's uniqueness more than anything else that will get the prices.''
In general, Chelsea condos, which are primarily in new developments, are selling better than co-ops. The median sales price for condos there has already exceeded the high of $1.49 million it reached in 2008, hitting $1.65 million in the second quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by Miller Samuel. The median price for co-ops, on the other hand, is lagging at $615,000 in the second quarter; the 2008 high was $784,052.
The overall market in Manhattan, however, shows the opposite trend, with co-ops faring better than condos, but both categories still down from the height.
Richard Grossman, the executive director of downtown sales for Halstead Property, said prices had reached previous heights only ''for certain units in certain buildings.'' These tend to be renovated apartments in prime locations, he said. ''It's not happening if it's on the far East or far West Sides of town, or if it's far from a subway stop.'' Other real estate basics will also influence sales price, he added, citing an apartment's condition and whether ''it has something special about it -- view, light or something unusual.'' But when these apartments sell for high prices, other apartments in the same building are likely to appreciate as well.
What defines a building or an apartment as special can vary by neighborhood. In SoHo, where smaller buildings predominate, it could be a doorman or outdoor space. In Greenwich Village, where prewar buildings are common, it could be a signature building of midcentury design.
Two months ago Richard Orenstein, an executive vice president of Halstead, sold a two-bedroom loft at 72 Mercer Street in SoHo a week after listing it. The full-floor apartment had sold for $3 million in early 2008, and it resold at the full asking price of $3.995 million.
''Things in general take longer to sell now, but special apartments sell for special prices,'' Mr. Orenstein said. The SoHo condo stood out because it had a large terrace and also was in a doorman building.
In Greenwich Village in March, Sharon Held, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group, sold a two-bedroom apartment at the Butterfield House for $1.426 million. The apartment was an estate sale and needed work, but it nonetheless drew five bids and sold for a hair above the $1.425 million asking price. The price works out to about $1,200 per square foot, which Ms. Held described as exceeding the $1,100 per square foot that was the norm in 2007 and 2008.
Ms. Held said that interested buyers had been drawn by the building's design. Unlike most postwar buildings, Butterfield House has high ceilings and bay windows.
On the Upper West Side, said Jill Sloane, an executive vice president of Halstead, apartments near either Central Park or Riverside Park have been selling more quickly than others.
She recently helped Diana Lochridge sign a contract to sell her one-bedroom floor-through apartment in a brownstone on West 103rd Street, off of Riverside Park. Ms. Lochridge, who is a vice president at the cable channel truTV, had listed the apartment with two different brokers last year, but there were no takers. She had dropped the price to $799,000 from $895,000 by the time she took it off the market in December and decided to renovate the kitchen.
''It was the only room that wasn't quite done,'' Ms. Lochridge said, ''and I wanted a new kitchen anyway.'' She spent about $16,000 to replace laminate counters and plywood cabinets and to install stainless-steel appliances. ''It was money well spent,'' she said. ''Because I think it sold the place.''
Another broker interviewed by Ms. Lochridge suggested pricing the apartment at $700,000, even after the renovation, but Ms. Sloane put it on the market for $839,000 and it is now in contract for $830,000, a price she believes is close to market highs. She said Ms. Lochridge's apartment merited the high price because it has nearly 1,000 square feet and is now in turnkey condition.
Marie Bianco, an agent at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that she and some of her clients routinely used to buy and renovate apartments in the hopes of reselling them at a profit, but that the practice screeched to a halt in 2009. ''Nobody could make money back then,'' she said, ''so they just rented them out for another year.'' But investors started selling their properties again earlier this year as prices improved.
Ms. Bianco said she listed her two-bedroom apartment at the City Spire, a 72-story tower built on West 56th Street in the 1980s, at the beginning of the year. There was little activity at first, but she sold the place earlier this month to Italian investors for $1.625 million. She bought it for $1.48 million in 2007 and had the kitchen renovated.
In Brooklyn, Jim Cornell, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group, said he was surprised when he reviewed sales data for Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights and found that prices for larger apartments had already rebounded. Family-size apartments are very popular in these areas, especially among Manhattanites seeking more space.
Three-bedroom apartments in these neighborhoods sold for an average of $1.139 million in 2007, and dropped to $1.065 million in 2009. The average price to date for 2011 is $1.226 million, Mr. Cornell said.
''When a seller comes to us,'' he added, ''they usually want to know if they can get as much as what their neighbor got when they sold in 2007. These numbers prove that the answer is yes, maybe even more.''
When Paula Bordelois and her husband, Michael Kamal, bought a three-bedroom in an eight-year-old building in Park Slope a few months ago, they knew they ''weren't buying cheap,'' Ms. Bordelois said. Listed at $1.425 million, the apartment received five offers and sold for $1.4 million.
''A lot of our friends didn't think it was the best financial decision,'' Ms. Bordelois said. ''But this was exactly what we wanted, and we were thinking we would be here for the long term, so it was the right decision.''
The duplex apartment is in an elevator building, and it has two terraces and a roof deck, none of which are easy to come by in brownstone Brooklyn, she said. And, because they had been renting an apartment just a few doors down, their 3-year-old daughter already had friends on the block.
John Gomes, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, described New York's real estate recovery as erratic. He said he had seen listings in TriBeCa languish with prices of $1,000 per square foot, while others asking $2,000 per square foot had sparked bidding wars.
''It all depends on the exact location and the exact product,'' Mr. Gomes said. This is why he advises customers ''to buy something special -- get the corner apartment, get the extra bedroom.''
Even now, in this newly uncertain market, he said, ''if you make a smart choice and don't buy the thing that anyone can buy, you'll weather the storm.''

HEADLINE: Miami's Rising Tides

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
MIAMI BEACH
THE skies last Saturday were fickle, dense gray-yellow clouds threatening a downpour. But visitors to the Soho Beach House, an extravagantly trim and tawny contingent that might have breezed in from the set of ''Entourage,'' were unfazed.
Most were content to stay in the pool, swigging spirits from a pitcher, playing an aquatic form of ring around the rosie and studiously ignoring the wilting heat of August, a time when travelers have traditionally deserted this resort town for more hospitable shores.
''It used to be that August here was slow, reserved mostly for us locals,'' said Carmen Ferreira, a graphic artist, who last week dined poolside with friends at the Soho Beach House, a private club and hotel on Collins Avenue. ''But that just isn't true anymore.'' In Miami Beach, the once-strict delineation between high and low seasons has eroded of late. Rogue squalls and the intermittent threat of hurricanes (and a restiveness fueled by an unstable economy) have done little to stem the tide of tourists thronging restaurants, bars, hotels and shops, and crowding beaches to catch a vagrant gust of wind. 
Their presence has fattened the city's coffers, driving retail sales and boosting hotel occupancy to new seasonal highs, transforming Miami Beach and its environs from a wan summer ghost town into a magnet for visitors of every stripe. ''Summer here has practically caught up with winter,'' said Rolando Aedo, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, which has seen occupancy rates at luxury hotels jump by 16 percent the first week of August, compared to the same period last year.
Torrid temperatures (the mercury last week climbed to the mid-90s) had done little to scare off visitors, he said, since so many were experiencing heat waves at home. In summer here, he said, ''the lines are shorter, the drinks are cheaper, and there's always a breeze on the beach.''
As a result, the gap between the low and high seasons has conspicuously narrowed, with Miami and Miami Beach welcoming 3 million visitors in the third quarter of this year, compared with 3.4 million in the peak months. Deal hunters and heat seekers alike descended on Lincoln Road, the eight-block-long pedestrian street that is South Beach's town center, chattering in Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian -- and a smattering of Brooklynese.
At least half of all visitors are from international markets, Mr. Aedo said, many from Europe but especially Latin America, where, in some parts, winter is just setting in. Some sampled carpaccio di manzo at Quattro or gawked at the perversely skeletal parking garage designed by Herzog & de Meuron, an anchor to the west. Others toted trophy bags from modish shops like Base and AllSaints Spitalfields.
Sales surged this summer at Alchemist, near Drexel Avenue, with the arrival of tourists from Brazil, where a favorable exchange rate has sent vacationers scouting for bargains, and in some instances scouring the city for second homes. The Brazilians are ''their own sort of animal right now,'' said Roma Cohen, an owner of Alchemist. ''Literally, they will call us from the airport, asking 'Do you have the latest Celine or Proenza Schouler bag?' '' he said, and they are prepared to pay $3,300 or more for one of those coveted labels.
Elsewhere in town, patrons jostled for tables at Prime One Twelve on Ocean Drive, where diners in pale linen suits and abbreviated cocktail frocks ordered the chilled crab or the $88 porterhouse, or nibbled fried Oreos, the restaurant's over-the-top rendition of comfort food.
Attractions in this city are nearly as plentiful now as during the hectic winter months. Clubs like Mynt Lounge, Wall and Mansion continue to draw capacity crowds. At Set, which caters mostly to youthful high rollers, guests on a recent Friday after midnight stood four deep at the bar, gyrated atop banquettes waving phallic neon-colored wands and gulped Grey Goose, contributing to the kind of frenzy more commonly witnessed in Ibiza or St.-Tropez.
At any one of the string of strenuously hip hotels lining Collins Avenue, among them the Raleigh and the Delano, and to the north, the W hotel and the fabled Fontainebleau, visitors gossiped and preened in wispy caftans, eyes darting now and then to catch a glimpse, perhaps, of Cameron Diaz, who has been seen around town on the arm of Alex Rodriguez; Jennifer Lopez, who was said to have embarked last week on a whirlwind shopping spree at Hermes, Dolce & Gabbana, and Pucci; or Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, who recently kicked up their heels at the Soho Beach House.
Celebrities busy on a few productions being filmed in Miami this summer, including ''Rock of Ages,'' and TV shows like the coming ''Charlie's Angels'' and ''Magic City,'' set in 1960s Miami Beach, have lured the paparazzi, who perch on rooftops, prowl the beach and stand rooted like sentries near the doors of the city's most fashionable dining spots.
''Those guys will put up ladders on the boardwalk to get to shoot our tiki club on the beach,'' said Lilaj Segal Battista, the marketing director of the Soho Beach House. ''They'll check into a room at the hotel next door, so that they can shoot our pool from the roof. You can't fight them off.'' Clearly, she wouldn't have it any other way.
South Beach is no Hollywood-on-the-Atlantic. But the recent influx of A-list stars has been lavishly chronicled on television tabloids and in print. Such streams of reportage ''publicize Miami as a destination without our having to pay for it,'' said Tony Goldman, the hotel and restaurant entrepreneur. They have been influential, as well, he said, in ''converting Miami in the public eye into a year-round fashion brand, the image of a sexy, cosmopolitan city.''
One that attracts deep-pocketed tourists, who contribute unstintingly to the city's economy. The extravagant spending of many Latin Americans has had ''a knock-on effect,'' said Andre Balazs, the owner of the Standard hotel and spa in Miami Beach, turning Miami ''into a repository for flight capital'' and helping to revive the once-stagnant real estate market. ''On a street level,'' Mr. Balazs added, ''the effect has been contagious,'' boosting the confidence of local entrepreneurs.
The locals have reason to feel sanguine. Room rates had jumped 12.1 percent over the first week of August, according to the visitors' bureau. The Park Central and the Hotel on Collins Avenue were 80 percent occupied, said Mr. Goldman, their owner, compared with about 65 percent at the same time last year. ''We've never done these numbers in August,'' he said.
The 49-room Soho Beach House is booked through the end of this month. Even on the Fourth of July, the hotel was full, said Guy Chetwynd, its national director of sales, with New Yorkers making up 50 percent of bookings. ''That was a huge shock to us,'' Mr. Chetwynd said. ''We thought we would have to beg people to come.''
Lingering over breakfast at the Standard last Saturday, August Miele recalled the highlights of a self-indulgent weekend. The night before, Mr. Miele, a broker of private jets from New York, had splashed out several hundred dollars on cocktails at the Wynwood Kitchen and Bar, a mainland hot spot decorated with raucous street art in the heart of the Wynwood art district. Later, he enjoyed a dinner for four at Smith & Wollensky that set him back ''at least $1,000,'' he said. A wobbly economy had neither dampened his spirits nor made a dent in his wallet, Mr. Miele said. ''Some of us aren't even thinking about this recession.''
In Midtown, a Miami equivalent of SoHo, Mariano Toledo, the Tim Gunn of ''Project Runway Latin America,'' dined with Candela Ferro, a television personality, and Nina Surel, an artist, at Gigi, a Bauhaus-like warehouse-turned-restaurant that is a gathering place for local artists, actors and young entrepreneurs.
''Summer or winter, Miami feels fresh,'' Mr. Toledo said. ''You have the feeling here that everything and anything could be about to happen.''
Having spotted a handful of private art collectors touring the galleries in Wynwood that night, Ms. Surel was no less elated. ''I can't believe the collectors are here already,'' she said. ''Art Basel is months away.'' Their presence this far ahead of the fair in December is but one indication that the city is blossoming, Ms. Surel said.
''Those collectors,'' she said, ''are my bling.''
Correction: August 28, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about a boom in Miami Beach summer tourism misstated the title of Guy Chetwynd at the Soho Beach House hotel. He is the national director of sales, not the general manager.

Shipping News
Q.In reading about the history of New York Harbor, I've come across two similar-sounding companies: the Black Ball Line and the Black Star Line. Can you tell me what they were?
A. They operated in different centuries and had different goals, but each played an important part in history.
The Black Ball Line -- it sounds like something out of ''Treasure Island'' -- was the first regularly scheduled cargo ship service in the world, according to the Encyclopedia of New York City. Before its founding, in 1817, by a group of New York City merchants led by Jeremiah Thompson, commercial ships customarily waited in port, often for weeks, until they had a full cargo. Not only did this cost shippers money, but passengers also had to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. 
Thompson set up a shipping line between New York City and Liverpool, England. He gambled that merchants and passengers alike would be willing to pay higher prices in return for fixed departure dates if he could assemble a large enough fleet to always have a ship ready at each port. His gamble paid off. The line, whose ships were recognizable by the large black ball in the center of the fore topsail, lasted until 1878.
The Black Star Line, according to the encyclopedia, was established in 1919 by Marcus Garvey as a response to complaints about discrimination against black passengers, sailors and African traders. Taking its name from the White Star Line, the British company whose most famous ship was the Titanic, the Black Star Line was part of Garvey's goal of an independent black economy, a fleet that would serve black customers and communities across the continents. Its first ship was rechristened the Frederick Douglass.
Although it closed in 1922 at a loss, the line helped broaden the base of Garvey's organization, the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which spread from Harlem to other black communities in the United States, the Caribbean and Central America. Garvey was convicted of mail fraud over the improper selling of shares in the Black Star Line; his sentence was commuted, and he was deported to Jamaica.
A Name, but No Exit
Q.Why is there no West Fourth Street exit at the West Fourth Street subway station?
A. Deirdre K. Parker, a spokeswoman for New York City Transit, gave this explanation in an e-mail:
''The West Fourth Street station opened on Sept. 10, 1932, as part of the inaugural segment of the IND from 207th Street to Chambers Street. The original intention was to have a West Fourth Street entrance, but it was never built.
''The planned West Fourth Street entrance would have led directly to the midlevel mezzanine between the Eighth Avenue upper level (A, C, E) and the Sixth Avenue lower level (B, D, F, M) platforms.
''While it is not clear why the West Fourth Street entrance was never built, it's possible that the builders of the IND determined that it was either too expensive to build and/or to acquire the necessary real estate.''
As the subway-history site nycsubway.org points out, the streets and the buildings around the station bear scars of the new line's construction, with bits and pieces of blocks sliced off by the southern extension of Sixth Avenue through Greenwich Village to accommodate the new subway. Even in the Depression, land was presumably more congested and expensive than when the first part of the subway system was built 30 years earlier.
The entrances-exits of the West Fourth Street station are on West Third Street and Waverly Place, both at what is now Avenue of the Americas.

HEADLINE: Debating the Old and the New Harlems

 BODY:
Last week's Metropolitan cover article, ''A Summer Idyll, and Then Three Bullets,'' by John Leland, about a shooting near Morningside Park, drew many comments and fostered a debate online about the future of Harlem. Readers also were moved to comment on ''African Chief in Cabby's Garb,'' Christine Haughney's article about Isaac Osei, who runs a taxi company in New York with his wife, Elizabeth, and is a tribal chief in Ghana. Below are excerpts from the discussions on NYTimes.com:
The young people of Harlem need more jobs and a better school system. Did those two things happen when real estate developers and speculators decided the neighborhood around Morningside Park could be ratcheted up in price? No.

Many families came out of Harlem in the same area you are talking about and sent their children to college and beyond. Know your facts. The newcomers see Harlem as a convenience, a place to get a bargain apartment. Native Harlemites see Harlem as a community with a rich history that continues into the present. I have no problem with people getting a bargain and getting a fantastic place to live. But let's not confuse violence in Harlem with the ''old'' people who live there.

The shooting did not occur because the local community board or Police Department do not care about the area around Morningside Park. If they could stop street violence, they would. Furthermore, there are people in your community (in your neighborhood, if not in your social circle), who know which individual carried out the shooting. The people that know, however, do not have very good relations with the police. These people's behavior and interactions with the police are subject to consequences from the most violent members of the community. This tradition is much stronger than the gentrification that you are carrying out in the same area, and is not deterred by million-dollar condominiums, self-righteous indignation or ethical reasoning.

I'm in the park every day playing soccer with a diverse group of men, women and kids and maybe filling the space with a positive vibe for a few hours. But after 20 years in the community, I would be a fool to say kicking a ball around will replace the need for real social equality in Morningside Heights. Neither will creating a barbecue ghetto in the south part of the park. Well-paying jobs that create a career, dynamic education, not teaching to a test, affordable housing and an abundance of recreational activities at nights and weekends for young people would be a decent start. The park remains what it has always been, a public space that continues to be a social laboratory that reflects who we are as an evolving community.
Victor Sanchez,
Morningside Heights
I am a longtime user of Morningside Park, and it has made huge strides. It really is a nice place for families, regardless of these distressing recent events. Crime is down considerably from past years, and the park is in vastly improved physical shape. I didn't like the quote re: the newcomers: ''How were they improving the neighborhood, other than making it more comfortable for themselves?'' Newcomers to any neighborhood have no moral obligation to do anything beyond that expected of all residents. Above all, folks should be decent and respectful. Attempts to divide into gentrifier/gentrified, black/white, old/young, etc. are divisive and unhelpful, especially since these lines that separate are often quite nuanced.

I suppose I fit into the ''new Harlem'' category, having moved here six years ago when my then-rent-stabilized apartment farther downtown went to market value. I was lucky to find another great rent-stabilized apartment in Harlem, which is now beginning to do the same thing and price people out -- a real mistake and shame. I'm now married and have three very young children and we spend at least 4 hours a day in Morningside Park, year round. Until I read the article, I had no idea anyone took issue with the weekend barbecues in Morningside Park. This is a good example of new residents not respecting a neighborhood's traditions.

This article had me smiling from ear to ear. Despite all that may be wrong in the world, the wars, the famine, the global economy, the Oseis serve as a poignant reminder of hard work, dedication and the unwavering human spirit.

I note that Mr. Osei had lost his first business and returned to taxi-driving when he met the future Mrs. Osei, and that she, not he, had the inspiration for and is running their taxi company. Not to slight Mr. Osei in any way, because this is a wonderful story, but the African immigrant who was inspired to start and is now running a taxi company is Mrs., not Mr., Osei. Great couple, but -- you go, girl!

 BODY:
THE MEMORY PALACE, by Mira Bartok (Free Press, $15.) At the center of this unsparing memoir is Bartok's schizophrenic mother: ''The Memory Palace'' begins in the final days of her mother's life, when Bartok, an artist and the author of numerous children's books, learns that the woman she has not seen in 17 years is dying. 
THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF MAF THE DOG, AND OF HIS FRIEND MARILYN MONROE, by Andrew O'Hagan (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.95.) Marilyn's travails, and cultural life in the early 1960s, are narrated by her sharp-eyed Maltese terrier Mafia Honey -- a gift from Frank Sinatra -- in O'Hagan's inventive novel.
RATIFICATION: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787-1788, by Pauline Maier (Simon & Schuster, $18.99.) Maier, a professor of American history at M.I.T., charts the Constitution's long, uncertain course, from its adoption by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia to its ratification by the states a year later. '' 'Ratification' is an ur-text of the Almanac of American politics,'' Richard Brookhiser wrote in the Book Review. ''It has process, issues, arguments, local context, major players, minor players -- and hoopla.''
THE HOUSE ON SALT HAY ROAD, by Carin Clevidence (Picador, $15.) An explosion in a fireworks factory rattles a Depression-era Long Island community in Clevidence's first novel. In the aftermath, two siblings -- orphaned years earlier and taken in by their mother's family -- see their bonds, and those of their makeshift household, tested and frayed.
FACTS ARE SUBVERSIVE: Political Writing From a Decade Without a Name, by Timothy Garton Ash (Yale University, $20.) An Oxford historian, Garton Ash specializes in what he calls (quoting George F. Kennan) the ''history of the present.'' These essays, covering roughly the first decade of the new century, address an array of subjects, including the problems of Muslim integration in Europe, Ukraine's Orange Revolution and the angry youth of Iran.
SWAMPLANDIA!, by Karen Russell (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.95.) Russell's first novel concerns the pleasures and miseries of life in a failing alligator theme park in the Everglades. The narrator is 13-year-old Ava Bigtree. When her mother (the park's headliner) dies of cancer, her sister develops a romantic attachment to a ghost and her brother defects for a rival park, it falls to Ava to save the family business. ''Vividly worded, exuberant in characterization, the novel is a wild ride,'' our reviewer, Emma Donoghue, wrote.
THE RATIONAL OPTIMIST: How Prosperity Evolves, by Matt Ridley (Harper Perennial, $15.99.) In this fast-moving exploration of how culture evolves positively through exchange and specialization, Ridley synthesizes a great deal of material -- evolutionary biology, anthropology, economics, philosophy and world history -- to argue for markets as the dominant source of human progress.
THE HUNDRED BROTHERS, by Donald Antrim (Picador, $15.) First published in 1997, this darkly comic novel presents a fantastically large brood. One winter night, the brothers gather in their crumbling ancestral home to settle differences and search for the lost urn containing their prodigious father's ashes.

HEADLINE: Who Says Companies Aren't Spending?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.

 BODY:
CONVENTIONAL wisdom says the unwillingness of businesses to spend and employ more workers is holding back the economy and the stock market.
''People keep repeating it as if it were a mantra: 'Companies refuse to hire; companies refuse to spend,' '' says James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.
But this criticism isn't quite right, Mr. Paulsen says. 
It's certainly true that most businesses haven't been willing to expand payrolls significantly in the last two years, says Richard Weiss, head of asset allocation strategies at American Century Investments. ''But there's cash being used in less visible ways,'' he adds.
To be sure, this type of spending -- from dividend increases to corporate acquisitions -- may not be enough to pull the economy out of its rough patch. But at least ''it indicates that companies are more confident in the economic recovery'' than some might think, says Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company.
In June, manufacturing and trade sales rose more than 12 percent from June 2010, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. Stripping out petroleum products, whose value was recently inflated by high oil prices, this is still the highest level for business sales in more than five years.
And some companies aren't just continuing to pay dividends despite the sluggish economy -- they are increasing them. (Monsanto and General Mills are just two examples.) This is something that investors didn't see in the 2008 downturn.
So far this year, there have been 241 dividend increases or initiations among Standard & Poor's 500 companies, versus only three dividend cuts, according to Howard Silverblatt, S.& P.'s senior index analyst.
Collectively, those moves have increased payments to shareholders by nearly $29 billion, he says. That's more than double the amount of dividend increases that S.& P. 500 companies delivered in the first eight months of last year and is a reversal from the $41 billion in dividend cuts made from January to August 2009.
''The bottom line is that dividends are doing extremely well,'' Mr. Silverblatt says.
Investors with dividend-paying stocks have also fared relatively well. While most types of equities are down this year on recession fears, dividend-paying stocks have held up far better than average. PowerShares Dividend Achievers, an exchange-traded fund that invests in stocks that have bolstered their annual payouts for at least 10 consecutive years, has lost 3.7 percent year to date, versus a 9.5 percent loss for the S.& P. 500.
Strategists say companies seem comfortable returning profits to shareholders because of stronger-than-expected earnings and all the cash on their balance sheets. S.& P. 500 companies are sitting on $1.13 trillion in cash and short-term investments -- two-thirds more than they had heading into the recession in 2007, according to Capital IQ.
In a slow-growth economy, this cash also gives companies the flexibility to increase revenue and profit growth through mergers and acquisitions, says Richard Peterson, a director at S.& P.'s valuation and risk strategies unit. He notes that domestic companies are on track to post their first year of $1 trillion or more in deal activity since 2006.
What's more, the third quarter is on track to be the busiest period for mergers and acquisitions since the spring of 2007, Mr. Peterson says. About halfway in, some $194 billion in M.& A. deals have been announced, versus $269.8 billion in the full second quarter.
''Despite what's transpired in the markets in the past several weeks,'' he says, ''there are very few signs of a pause in activity.'' Just last week, Google announced a planned $12.5 billion acquisition of the mobile phone maker Motorola Mobility.
Mr. Peterson says the trend is likely to continue, not only because of companies' cash on hand, but also because investment-grade corporations can still borrow cheaply in the bond market, thanks to strong demand for high-quality bonds.
Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance , says that ''this is very different than 2008,'' as companies are in much better shape today.
As for job creation, Mr. Richardson says it always tends to come in the later stages of an economic expansion. But he says that ''if investors wait on the sidelines for the job situation to pick up dramatically, they'll probably be jumping in too late'' to make any money.

HEADLINE: The Grand Staircase, City Hall: San Francisco

BYLINE: By LOUISE RAFKIN. 
louise@louiserafkin.com

 BODY:
The majestic stairs to the Ceremonial Rotunda and the Board of Supervisors Chambers were built with economic stimulus money after the previous City Hall was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake. Designed by graduates of the University of California, Berkeley, the building was constructed in three years -- without power tools -- opening in 1915. 
SLICK NAME
Architects call the stone Tennessee pink marble, but geologists would say compacted limestone. Veining from mineral deposits attests to the sedimentary origins of the rock.
FOR...
The 45 steps are named for Charlotte Shultz, the city's chief of protocol. Married to former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, she was the state's chief of protocol under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and has advised mayors on greeting foreign dignitaries for decades.
...AND AGAINST
In May 1960, protesters against hearings by the House Un-American Activities Committee crammed the staircase. Police Chief Thomas V. Cahill ordered the crowds blasted with fire hoses; 12 people were hospitalized.
UNTIMELY
A clock designed by Albert Samuels, owner of the jewelry store known as the House of Lucky Wedding Rings, overlooks the stairs. The Roman numeral IV is rendered as IIII.
UNLUCKY
In 1954, Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe were married upstairs in a judge's chambers. Monroe filed for divorce 274 days later.
LUCKY AND TIMELY
Under statues of Adam and Eve, volunteers for the county clerk perform up to six weddings an hour near the stairs and Ceremonial Rotunda. Ceremonies doubled in 2008 to accommodate 18,000 gay and lesbian couples during the nearly four months that same-sex marriage was legal in California. They remain legally wed -- unless they've divorced.
ROCK STEADY
During recent renovations, hundreds of rubber and steel pads were inserted into the building's foundation. In an earthquake, the building should be able to withstand the ground's moving up to 27 inches.
ABOVE...
The exterior of the dome above the stairs is embellished with gold leaf. The dome is higher than the United States Capitol's; a federal law prohibits a state's dome -- but not a city's -- from exceeding the Capitol's height.
...AND BEYOND
The building stands on a former cemetery, which once covered about 10 acres in today's Civic Center area.
Correction: August 28, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Local Intelligence column last Sunday, about the majestic staircase at San Francisco City Hall, referred incorrectly to a prohibition against buildings being taller than the United States Capitol. There is no federal law barring a state Capitol from exceeding the height of the federal Capitol.

Be prepared for the seven-day workweek, the whole success and failure resting on your shoulders, no sick days, no vacations and no trusting anymore that the economy will get better. Welcome to the real world. It's not pretty.
S. D., Eugene, Ore.
It does take guts to open one's own business. These people show courage. But I wonder why these folks were so surprised by the work and hours and difficulty. Didn't they first talk to people who had started their own businesses? J. B., Chicago
Starting a business is challenging but definitely rewarding! Trying to pay for health insurance is a huge issue -- that and taking a vacation! There are days when I look back at my so-called ''big'' job in corporate America and miss the perks but I don't miss the politics at all! Omhu, New York
Entrepreneurship certainly isn't ''the easy life.'' It's still work. You're taking on more than one job while being responsible for all the financial risks of the business. It takes a certain kind of personality to thrive in that type of environment. The best way to determine if you're suited to it is to start something on the side while keeping your day job (if you have one). It's grueling, but better to hang on to some financial security until you're certain it's what you want to do and that it's going to be financially viable. You may enjoy building birdhouses out of toothpicks, but that doesn't mean it's a viable business. ''If you build it, they will come'' works only in the movies. Tula, Boston
I spent 27 years doing a 100-mile commute to a high-stress retail management job. Now I walk to work for a wonderful artisan bakery, with job benefits including free bread and produce from our amazing farmers' markets, plus local gym membership. Thanks, Great Recession! Ken Porter,

HEADLINE: As Governor, Perry Backed Wind, Gas and Coal

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
In the opening days of his presidential campaign, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has railed against a favorite target, the Environmental Protection Agency, and declared himself a ''skeptic'' on the subject of humans as the cause of global warming.
If Mr. Perry wins the White House, his national energy policy will focus on cutting federal regulations, especially at the E.P.A., his spokesman, Mark Miner, said.
''The governor's energy priorities will be centered around scaling back the E.P.A.'s intrusive, misguided and job-killing policies, which will empower states to foster their own energy resources without crippling mandates and open the doors for our nation to pursue and strengthen an all-of-the-above energy approach,'' Mr. Miner wrote in an e-mail.
''America is rich in energy resources, both traditional and renewable, and those resources should all be utilized so we can decrease our dependence on foreign energy sources and help generate greater job growth, which our nation desperately needs.'' 
To unpack what this means, it is worth reviewing Mr. Perry's record on energy, a huge driver of the Texas economy. One theme that Mr. Perry often emphasizes, and that Mr. Miner suggested would help shape a nationwide policy, has been energy diversification. Over Mr. Perry's decade as governor, natural gas drilling has surged, and wind last year supplied nearly 8 percent of the electricity on the Texas grid, up from less than 1 percent in 2000, when Mr. Perry took office. The state's first biomass power plant began operating this month, and, contrary to the national trend, Mr. Perry has also backed construction of new coal-fired power plants.
States' rights are another Perry talking point, and he has spoken out against federal constraints on coal, oil and gas, as well as against federal policies to aid ethanol.
Many of the changes -- the gas and wind booms, for example -- might have happened with or without the governor. But he has had a hand in advancing them.
Oil and Gas
Unlike many past Texas governors, including George W. Bush, Mr. Perry is not an oilman. But the oil and gas industries have applauded his policies. Mostly, of course, drillers like Texas' low-tax, low-regulation environment, which Mr. Perry did not create but has maintained. Oilmen cheered his call to end the Obama administration's moratorium on new deepwater drilling after the Gulf of Mexico was damaged by last year's BP oil spill, which Mr. Perry suggested was an ''act of God.''
Natural gas drilling has exploded during Mr. Perry's tenure, with Texas production climbing 28 percent between 2000 and 2010. That is mainly because of the expansion of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the process of sending water, sand and chemicals underground to break up shale and release gas or oil. Fracking, however, has stirred concerns about groundwater and air pollution.
Mr. Perry has spoken out in support of fracking. Last week in Iowa, he accused the Obama administration of ''trying to scare people, and saying that hydraulic fracking somehow or another is going to damage the groundwater.'' He said that e knew of no cases in which fracking had affected groundwater and that ample natural gas might even be lying beneath Iowa.
This summer Mr. Perry signed a bill that required disclosure of many chemicals in the fracking process. State Representative Jim Keffer, Republican of Eastland and the bill's champion, said that while the governor was ''not that involved'' in the legislative process, ''certainly at times where we needed a little push here and there, his staff was willing and able to do that.''
Mr. Perry also signed a bill in 2003 that made permanent (quietly, critics argue) a reduction in the severance tax paid on ''high-cost gas,'' which includes gas retrieved through fracking.
The gas industry is a fan. ''He's been governor for 11 years, and he's had a lot of opportunities to make mistakes and detract from the climate that has allowed us the predictability'' to make investments, said David Blackmon, a Texas official with America's Natural Gas Alliance. ''And he hasn't done that.''
Coal
Under Mr. Perry, Texas has moved eagerly to build coal-fired power plants, even as other states have stopped issuing permits for the plants because of pollution concerns.
In 2005, the governor issued an executive order that allowed a more rapid approval of coal plant permits. A major electric company, TXU, sought to build 11 coal-plant units, though those plans ultimately fell apart after private equity firms bought the company and committed to environmental improvements. ''The biggest thing Perry did on energy was to try to fast-track 11 coal plants,'' said Jim Marston, the Texas head of the Environmental Defense Fund. ''And I think everybody in Texas ought to be glad that Perry's plan failed.''
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the state's environmental agency, which is headed by three Perry appointees, continues to award coal plant permits. Nine proposed plants have received permits. (Nineteen coal plants already operate across the state.)
Mr. Perry, an outspoken fan of ''clean coal,'' also lashes out regularly against the E.P.A., which wants to tighten restrictions on air pollutants like ozone and mercury that could shut down older coal plants. Texas is also leading the fight against federal greenhouse gas regulation.
Renewables
Arguably, Mr. Perry's most interesting energy efforts have related to wind power, which has boomed under his administration. Today, after a decade of rapid growth, Texas is the nation's wind leader. The groundwork was laid by Mr. Bush, who in 1999 signed a bill that -- besides deregulating the electric sector -- established a renewable-energy requirement that kick-started wind development.
But Mr. Perry has added to that. In 2005, he signed a bill requiring Texas to have 5,880 megawatts of renewables capacity by 2015. The state has already surpassed that requirement.
Mr. Perry has also strongly backed a $5 billion project to build transmission lines to ferry power from remote West Texas to big cities. ''He has been a stalwart in defense of wind energy in this state -- no question about it,'' said Paul Sadler, executive director of the Wind Coalition. An extra charge of up to $5 per month on Texans' electric bills will pay for construction of the lines.
But Mr. Perry's backing for renewables has limits. Solar power advocates have been frustrated by his failure to support a requirement for nonwind renewables, which both the Legislature and the Public Utility Commission (whose commissioners Mr. Perry appoints) have considered but not acted on.
Asked why Mr. Perry supported one requirement but not another, Mr. Miner said that the earlier policy ''created a system to incent the development of the most economic renewable generation, which for our state was wind.'' He added, ''If you mandate a specific technology, you run the risk of getting stuck with high costs, and such mandates have failed to pass the Legislature in the past.''

HEADLINE: Perry Mines Texas System To Raise Cash

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Two years ago, John McHale, an entrepreneur from Austin, Tex., who has given millions of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes, did something very unusual for him: he wrote a $50,000 check to a Republican candidate, Rick Perry, then seeking a third full term as governor of Texas. In September 2010, he did it again, catapulting himself into the top ranks of Mr. Perry's donors.
Mr. McHale, a Perry spokesman said after the initial donation, ''understands Governor Perry's leadership has made Texas a good place to do business.''
Including, it turned out, for Mr. McHale's business interests and partners. In May 2010 an economic development fund administered by the governor's office handed $3 million to G-Con, a pharmaceutical start-up that Mr. McHale helped get off the ground. At least two other executives with connections to the firm had also given Mr. Perry tens of thousands of dollars. 
Mr. Perry leapt into the Republican presidential primary this month preceded by his reputation as a thoroughbred fund-raiser. But a review of Mr. Perry's years in office reveals that one of his most potent fund-raising tools is the very government he heads.
Over three terms in office, Mr. Perry's administration has doled out grants, tax breaks, contracts and appointments to hundreds of his most generous supporters and their businesses. And they have helped Mr. Perry raise more money than any politician in Texas history, donations that have periodically raised eyebrows but, thanks to loose campaign finance laws and a business-friendly political culture dominated in recent years by Republicans, have only fueled Mr. Perry's ascent.
''Texas politics does have this amazing pay-to-play culture,'' said Harold Cook, a Democratic political consultant.
Mark Miner, a spokesman for Mr. Perry, said there was no connection between Mr. McHale's contributions and the grant to G-Con. He said that the purpose of the state money was to create jobs and that it was appropriate for Mr. Perry to appoint people who support his vision and policies to state oversight posts.
''These issues have been brought up in previous elections to no avail,'' Mr. Miner said.
Mr. Perry is not the first governor to have taken contributions from contractors or appointees to state commissions and boards, which oversee many of the agencies that in other states are controlled directly by the governor.
But because he has been in office more than a decade, he has had greater opportunity than any of his predecessors to stock the government with loyalists -- he has appointed roughly 4,000 people to state posts -- while enacting policies that have benefited allies and contributors.
And Mr. Perry has been much more aggressive than any past governor in soliciting money from them. According to a study last year by Texans for Public Justice, a watchdog organization, Mr. Perry has raised at least $17 million from more than 900 appointees or their spouses, roughly one dollar out of every five that he has raised as governor.
Among the state boards that have generated the most campaign contributions for Mr. Perry, the study found, were the State Parks and Wildlife Commission and the board of regents of Texas A&M, Mr. Perry's alma mater. Those appointees have donated more than $4 million to his campaigns for governor.
''I know that at least some of the people who were initially approached to be regents have been later turned down because they didn't pass what I would call a loyalty test,'' said Jon L. Hagler, a prominent A&M alumnus and a major donor to the university.
Mr. Perry has also drawn scrutiny for two of his signature economic development efforts, the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund. The enterprise fund, which is intended to be a deal-closing tool for the state as it competes for jobs, has dispensed $435 million in grants to businesses since 2003. The technology fund, which has doled out nearly $200 million to companies since 2005, has a similar job creation mandate.
More than a quarter of the companies that have received grants from the enterprise fund in the most recent fiscal year, or their chief executives, made contributions to either Mr. Perry's campaign dating back to 2001 or to the Republican Governors Association since 2008, when Mr. Perry became its chairman, according to an analysis by The New York Times.
The award to G-Con is just one example of state money paying dividends for Perry benefactors. The company is working with the Texas A&M university system on a pharmaceutical manufacturing effort toward influenza vaccines.
Among G-Con's officers, according to records filed with the Texas secretary of state, is David M. Shanahan, who also has a significant ownership stake in the company. He is also the founder and president of Gradalis, a biotech firm based in Dallas that received a separate $1.75 million grant from the state's technology fund in February 2009.
Campaign finance records show that Mr. Shanahan contributed $10,000 to the governor in November 2009. The following month, G-Con filed its application for an enterprise fund grant, said Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman in the governor's office. (Mr. Shanahan also donated $5,000 in 2007.)
State records from a network of firms associated with G-Con also list Mr. McHale, the longtime Democratic donor, as an officer.
Patricia Haigwood, a spokeswoman for G-Con, said Friday that Mr. McHale, who did not return messages asking for comment, was one of the original board members of G-Con. But she said he left the company in late April 2010 and had not made an investment in G-Con.
Gradalis, however, controls 10 percent of G-Con, corporate records show. And Mr. McHale and James R. Leininger, a San Antonio businessman who has given more than $230,000 to Mr. Perry, have minority interests in Gradalis, Ms. Haigwood said.
Gradalis's technology fund grant came under scrutiny last year when The Dallas Morning News revealed that Mr. McHale and Mr. Leininger, both major Perry donors, had significant financial interests in the company.
Ms. Nashed said that grants from both funds must be approved by the speaker of the Texas House and the lieutenant governor and that all recipients go through rigorous reviews.
Mr. Perry has also drawn criticism for his appointees to the board of the Teacher Retirement System, a $110 billion pension fund that is among the nation's largest. In recent years he has appointed at least four top donors or fund-raisers to the board. Mr. Perry's trustees leaned on the fund to invest more money with hedge funds and private equity firms, as many public pension funds have in recent years. But in some cases, the appointees appear to have pushed for firms whose investors, officers, or partners were Perry donors.
In 2009 an investment manager at the fund, Michael Green, wrote to a board trustee saying that the fund's chief investment officer had pressed him and other employees to set aside their objections to such investments, including allocations to two firms whose partners and former partners have donated more than $1 million to Mr. Perry's campaigns.
When Mr. Green complained about the pressure, a superior dismissed his concerns. Mr. Green's boss, he wrote to the trustee, told him: ''This is the way business is done.'' An internal investigation concluded that no rules had been broken.
Philip Mullins, a trustee, said, ''I think the concerns that were raised were based on a feeling that the chairman and some other people on the board were trying to set up a fund-raising campaign for the governor of Texas.''
Another instance of political donations to Mr. Perry seeming to dovetail with his policy decisions came in 2005, when the TXU Corporation, a utility based in Dallas, sought permits to build coal-fired power plants. That October, Mr. Perry issued an executive order for a review panel to fast-track the application.
In the months that followed, current and retired TXU executives, as well as the company's political action committee, sent Mr. Perry more than $100,000 in donations, including one check dated the same day as Mr. Perry's order. Mr. Perry's office said at the time that the order was unrelated to the contributions. A state judge later blocked the order, ruling that Mr. Perry had overstepped his authority.
In 2003, after a rash of mold-related lawsuits against home construction companies, Mr. Perry championed the creation of a state board, the Texas Residential Construction Commission. The new commission was a priority of Mr. Perry's most generous contributor: Bob Perry, a homebuilder who has contributed more than $2 million to the governor over his career. (The two men are not related.)
The legislation creating the board also sharply limited the rights of homeowners to sue contractors for faulty construction, shunting most disputes to the commission. After its passage, Bob Perry and his wife sent two $50,000 checks to the governor's campaign. Three weeks later, the governor appointed an executive of Perry Homes, Bob Perry's company, to the commission, which was abolished in 2009.
In 2009, as Mr. Perry was running for re-election, Jose Cuevas Jr., a restaurateur and the governor's appointee as chairman of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, used a personal e-mail account to solicit donations for Mr. Perry from the owners of dozens of restaurants and bars overseen by the board.
In an interview last week, Mr. Cuevas said he saw nothing wrong with asking the owners, many of them business contacts, for donations. It was important, he said, for Mr. Perry's appointees to support his broader mission of smaller government.
''When you personally know someone,'' Mr. Cuevas said, ''and know their abilities and vision, you're willing to raise as much money as hard as you can for that person.''

HEADLINE: Of Dystopias And Alphas

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
President Obama was on the way to Alpha when a plea came for him to be, well, more alpha.
LuAnn Lavine, a real estate agent from Geneseo, a rural town just up the road from Alpha, Ill., the last stop on the president's Midwestern bus tour, told The Times's Jeff Zeleny: ''Everyone was so hopeful with him, but Washington grabbed him and here we are. I just want him to stay strong and don't take the guff. We want a president who is a leader, and I want him to be a little bit stronger.''
Hers was a gentler message than the sign stuck on a post outside Alpha: ''One Term President.'' 
But her three words summed it up: Washington grabbed him. Why did this man whose contempt for Congress is clear, who ran on the idea that he could transform a broken Washington, surrender to its conventional timetable and bureaucratic language?
The ''supercommittee'' that's supposed to save us just sounds like more government bloat -- supersizing something just as unhealthy as McDonald's.
Is Obama so isolated he can't see that Americans are curled up in a ball, beaten down by a financial crisis, an identity crisis, a political crisis and a leadership crisis?
He got the job by blaming Washington. But once you're in the White House, you are Washington. It's like the plumber who came to fix the sink waiting for the sink to fix itself.
I covered the first President Bush when he took a slide from Iraq war hero to one-term president. A turning point came in the fall of 1991, when Americans were getting jittery about the economy. Conservatives urged Bush to adopt an aggressive agenda and a muscular stance toward Congress. But relying on the disastrous advice of his budget adviser Richard Darman, Bush waited for more than a month until the State of the Union address and repackaged the same tepid agenda.
President Obama bashed Congress on his bus tour. But after delegating to Congress time and again with disastrous results, he continues to play the satellite to Congress.
He shouldn't be driven by the Washington schedule. He should be setting it.
At long last, he promised a clear economic plan. Unfortunately, he had the fierce urgency of next month, when Congress gets back to town.
Americans are rattled and want action. They don't know or care what Congress's schedule is. They just see the president not doing anything.
Cruising white Midwestern hamlets in his black bus, Obama tried to justify not calling lawmakers back to D.C. by saying they'd just continue to bicker. But what does he think they'll do in September? The truth is, he doesn't want them back in the capital any more than they want to be back. It would have screwed up his vacation and upset Michelle, who already feels trapped in the Washington bubble.
If Clinton wanted to be president 25 hours a day and W. wanted to be president four hours a day, Obama wants to be president for about 14 hours a day. And that's fine, as long as you don't look like you're phoning it in when the country is dialing 911.
White House officials must be worried about the 10-day Martha's Vineyard idyll because, in a rare move, they put out a picture of the president with furrowed brow and Nike shirt getting a briefing from John Brennan, his top counterterrorism adviser.
There were no pictures allowed of him at the Vineyard Golf Club, only shots of the president shopping for books with his daughters. He was seen in the Bunch of Grapes bookstore on Friday holding ''Brave New World.'' Maybe he was brushing up on dystopias and alphas.
He might also want to pick up a volume of Robert Frost for some insight on why Democrats waste time trying to reconcile with ruthless foes. The president still believes he can use his enchanting powers to convert the other side, even though Republicans regard every Obama legislative achievement as the beginning of a campaign to recall it. Heck, they're still trying to repeal the New Deal.
Obama was truly stung by his budget experience with John Boehner. And now, Senator Tom Coburn, whom Obama called ''not only a dear friend, but also a brother in Christ'' at February's National Prayer Breakfast, tells a town hall in Oklahoma that Obama's views are ''goofy and wrong,'' and that the president wants to ''create dependency'' because ''as an African-American male,'' he had received ''tremendous benefit'' from government programs.
There is no way to sell the idea that being a black man in America gives you tremendous benefit.
How does Obama feel after his brother in Christ painted him as something akin to a welfare queen and an affirmative-action president?
Let us take today's lesson from Frost, who deliciously wrote in ''The Lesson for Today'':
I'm liberal. You, you aristocrat,
Won't know exactly what I mean by that.
I mean so altruistically moral
I never take my own side in a quarrel.

HEADLINE: Laser Advances Raise Fears Of Terrorist Nuclear Ability

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Scientists have long sought easier ways to make the costly material known as enriched uranium -- the fuel of nuclear reactors and bombs, now produced only in giant industrial plants.
One idea, a half-century old, has been to do it with nothing more substantial than lasers and their rays of concentrated light. This futuristic approach has always proved too expensive and difficult for anything but laboratory experimentation.
Until now.
In a little-known effort, General Electric has successfully tested laser enrichment for two years and is seeking federal permission to build a $1 billion plant that would make reactor fuel by the ton. 
That might be good news for the nuclear industry. But critics fear that if the work succeeds and the secret gets out, rogue states and terrorists could make bomb fuel in much smaller plants that are difficult to detect.
Iran has already succeeded with laser enrichment in the lab, and nuclear experts worry that G.E.'s accomplishment might inspire Tehran to build a plant easily hidden from the world's eyes.
Backers of the laser plan call those fears unwarranted and praise the technology as a windfall for a world increasingly leery of fossil fuels that produce greenhouse gases.
But critics want a detailed risk assessment. Recently, they petitioned Washington for a formal evaluation of whether the laser initiative could backfire and speed the global spread of nuclear arms.
''We're on the verge of a new route to the bomb,'' said Frank N. von Hippel, a nuclear physicist who advised President Bill Clinton and now teaches at Princeton. ''We should have learned enough by now to do an assessment before we let this kind of thing out.''
New varieties of enrichment are considered potentially dangerous because they can simplify the hardest part of building a bomb -- obtaining the fuel.
General Electric, an atomic pioneer and one of the world's largest companies, says its initial success began in July 2009 at a facility just north of Wilmington, N.C., that is jointly owned with Hitachi. It is impossible to independently verify that claim because the federal government has classified the laser technology as top secret. But G.E. officials say that the achievement is genuine and that they are accelerating plans for a larger complex at the Wilmington site.
''We are currently optimizing the design,'' Christopher J. Monetta, president of Global Laser Enrichment, a subsidiary of G.E. and Hitachi, said in an interview.
The company foresees ''substantial demand for nuclear fuel,'' he added, while conceding that global jitters from the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan ''do create some uncertainty.'' G.E. made those reactors.
Donald M. Kerr, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons lab who was recently briefed on G.E.'s advance, said in an interview that it looked like a breakthrough after decades of exaggerated claims.
Laser enrichment, he said, has gone from ''an oversold, overpromised set of technologies'' to what ''appears to be close to a real industrial process.''
For now, the big uncertainty centers on whether federal regulators will grant the planned complex a commercial license. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is weighing that issue and has promised G.E. to make a decision by next year.
The Obama administration has taken no public stance on plans for the Wilmington plant. But President Obama has a record of supporting nuclear power as well as aggressive efforts to curtail the bomb's spread. The question is whether those goals now conflict.
The aim of enrichment is to extract the rare form of uranium from the ore that miners routinely dig out of the ground. The process is a little like picking through multicolored candies to find the blue ones.
The scarce isotope, known as uranium 235, amounts to just 0.7 percent of mined uranium. Yet it is treasured because it splits easily in two in bursts of atomic energy. If concentrations are raised (or enriched) to about 4 percent, the material can fuel nuclear reactors; to 90 percent, atom bombs.
Enrichment is so difficult that successful production is quite valuable. A pound of reactor fuel costs more than $1,000 -- less expensive than gold but more than silver.
The Laser Race
The first laser flashed to life in 1960. Soon after, scientists talked excitedly about using the innovation to shrink the size of enrichment plants, making them far cheaper to build and run.
''It was in the air,'' recalled Leonard R. Solon, a physicist who worked for a New York company that in early 1963 suggested the idea to the federal government.
The plan was to exploit the extraordinary purity of laser light to selectively excite uranium's rare form. In theory, the resulting agitation would ease identification of the precious isotope and aid its extraction.
At least 20 countries and many companies raced to investigate the idea. Scientists built hundreds of lasers.
Ray E. Kidder, a laser pioneer at the Livermore nuclear arms lab, estimated that the overall number of scientists involved globally ran to several thousand.
''It was a big deal,'' he said in an interview. ''If you could enrich with lasers, you could cut the cost by a factor of 10.''
The fervor cooled by the 1990s as laser separation turned out to be extremely hard to make economically feasible.
Not everyone gave up. Twenty miles southwest of Sydney, in a wooded region, Horst Struve and Michael Goldsworthy kept tinkering with the idea at a government institute. Finally, around 1994, the two men judged that they had a major advance.
The inventors called their idea Silex, for separation of isotopes by laser excitation. ''Our approach is completely different,'' Dr. Goldsworthy, a physicist, told a Parliamentary hearing.
An old black-and-white photograph of the sensitive technology -- perhaps the only image of its kind in existence publicly -- shows an array of pipes and low cabinets about the size of a small truck.
'Game Changing' Technique
In May 2006, G.E. bought the rights to Silex. Andrew C. White, the president of the company's nuclear business, hailed the technology as ''game-changing.''
Mr. Monetta of Global Laser Enrichment, the G.E.-Hitachi subsidiary, said the envisioned plant would enrich enough uranium annually to fuel up to 60 large reactors. In theory, that could power more than 42 million homes -- about a third of all housing units in the United States.
The laser advance, he added, will promote energy security ''since it is a domestic source.''
In late 2009, as G.E. experimented with its trial laser, supporters of arms control wrote Congress and the regulatory commission. The technology, they warned, posed a danger of quickening the spread of nuclear weapons because of the likely difficulty of detecting clandestine plants.
Experts called for a federal review of the risks. In early 2010, the commission resisted.
Late last year, the American Physical Society -- the nation's largest group of physicists, with headquarters in Washington -- submitted a formal petition to the commission for a rule change that would compel such risk assessments as a condition of licensing.
''The issue is too big'' to leave to the federal status quo, Francis Slakey, a physicist at Georgetown University and the society official who drafted the petition, said in an interview. He added that Mr. Obama or Congress might eventually have to get involved.
This year, thousands of citizens, supporters of arms control, nuclear experts and members of Congress wrote the commission to back the society's effort. Many of them cited well-known failures in safeguarding secrets and detecting atomic plants.
But the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group in Washington, objected. It said new precautions were unnecessary because of voluntary plans for ''additional measures'' to safeguard secrets.
A commission spokesman said the petition would be considered next year. In theory, the risk-assessment plan, if adopted, could slow or stop the granting of a commercial license for the proposed laser plant or could result in design improvements.
A POSITIVE ASSESSMENT
G.E., seizing the initiative, did an assessment of its own. It hired Dr. Kerr, the former director of Los Alamos and a former senior federal intelligence official, to lead the evaluation. He and two other former government officials concluded that the laser secrets had a low chance of leaking and that a clandestine laser plant stood a high chance of being detected.
''It's a major industrial facility,'' Dr. Kerr said of the planned Wilmington complex in an interview. ''Our observation was this was not something that would sit in a garage or be easily hidden.''
Global Laser Enrichment declined a request by The New York Times for a copy of the Kerr report. It said the document ran to seven pages.
In the interview, Mr. Monetta, the company's president, said the Kerr review had confirmed that the laser complex would ''not result in the proliferation of enrichment technology.'' His position seemed to go beyond Dr. Kerr's citing of likelihoods.
Mr. Monetta added that the technical complexity and ''significant size'' of the laser plant were major barriers to its covert adoption abroad.
Global Laser Enrichment plans to build its complex on more than 100 acres at the Wilmington industrial park, with the main building covering nearly 14 acres. That, like Iran's main enrichment plant, is roughly half the size of the Pentagon.
But critics say a clandestine bomb maker would need only a tiny fraction of that vast industrial ability -- and thus could build a much smaller laser, perhaps like the modest apparatus in the old photograph. Each year, they note, the enrichment powers of the Wilmington plant would be great enough to produce fuel for more than 1,000 nuclear weapons.
Iran began its laser program in the 1970s during the global rush. But it kept the results secret. The silence violated Iran's agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, an arm of the United Nations that is based in Vienna and acts as the world's nuclear police.
The cover-up ended in early 2003. Soon, the I.A.E.A. learned of contracts, enrichment runs and even a prototype plant. Iran insisted that it dismantled the facility in May 2003 and dropped laser enrichment.
But then, out of the blue, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in February 2010 praised Iranian scientists for their ''relentless efforts'' to build lasers for uranium enrichment. Ever since, the I.A.E.A. has sought unsuccessfully to learn more.
When experts cite possible harm from the commercialization of laser enrichment, they often point to Iran. The danger, they say, lies not only in pilfered secrets, but also in the public revelation that a half-century of laser failure seems to be ending.
Their concern goes to the nature of invention. The demonstration of a new technology often begets a burst of emulation because the advance opens a new window on what is possible.
Arms controllers fear that laser enrichment is now poised for that kind of activity. News of its feasibility could spur wide reinvestigation.
Dr. Slakey of the American Physical Society noted that the State Department a dozen years ago warned that the success of Silex could ''renew interest'' in laser enrichment for good or ill -- to light cities or destroy them.
That moment, he said, now seems close at hand.

HEADLINE: With North Korea in Need, Kim Jong-il Goes to Russia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il, rumbled across the border into Russia aboard an armored train early Saturday amid growing hopes for a resumption of talks over ending his country's nuclear weapons program.
It was Mr. Kim's first visit to Russia in nearly a decade, part of a return to the international stage that experts say may have been prompted by an urgent need for economic aid to assuage a spiraling food crisis at home. 
Yet, as in past visits abroad, Mr. Kim, who reports say lives in constant fear for his security, has kept the details of his trip secret. The Kremlin released a terse statement on Saturday, saying the North Korean leader would visit sites in Russia's Far East and Siberia, and meet with the president, Dmitri A. Medvedev.
Russian news media reported that the two leaders would meet this week, though the day and place were not announced.
Mr. Kim stopped Saturday morning in the Russian border town of Khasan, meeting briefly with the governor of the Primorsky Krai region, according to media reports.
His visit comes after several meetings among high-ranking North Korean officials and their counterparts in South Korea, China and the United States, who, along with negotiators from Japan and Russia, have been locked for years in on-again-off-again negotiations over ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The so-called six-party talks stalled in 2008 amid an impasse over measures to verify North Korea's compliance with an agreement to halt its nuclear activities. Since then, the country has detonated a nuclear device, launched a long-range nuclear-capable missile and unveiled a large-scale uranium enrichment program.
But Mr. Kim's defiance, at times unshakeable, has been known to soften when politically expedient. In the past he has used his country's nuclear activities as leverage to gain concessions, particularly economic aid from his negotiating partners.
In recent months, North Korea has been reeling under the effects of a food shortage brought on by a combination of bad weather and years of economic negligence. The European Commission recently said that the situation there had grown so severe that people had resorted to eating grass.
On Friday, Russia's Foreign Ministry announced that Russia had made the first delivery of an expected 50,000 tons of food aid to North Korea. The United States and South Korea have also pledged assistance.
''We view this humanitarian operation as a contribution to the strengthening of our traditional neighborly relations between the peoples of our countries,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Though Moscow and Pyongyang were allies during the cold war, relations faltered after former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union established diplomatic ties with South Korea on Sept. 30, 1990, and cut back economic and military subsidies to the North.
But ties between the countries revived under Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's paramount leader and currently its prime minister. Mr. Kim made his first visit to Russia in 2001, early in Mr. Putin's first term as president, spending three weeks on a train trip from Russia's Far East to Moscow and St. Petersburg.
He visited again in 2002, touring factories and a bakery in eastern Russia.
The visit this week offers a chance for Mr. Medvedev to flex his diplomatic muscles ahead of presidential elections scheduled for 2012. It remains unclear whether he or Mr. Putin, his mentor and predecessor, will run, though he has indicated an interest in keeping his job.
The trip will also offer an opportunity for Mr. Kim, whose health is waning, to shore up support from Moscow for his heir apparent, Kim Jong-un, his youngest son.
Mr. Kim left lasting impressions on his previous trips to Russia, amazing his hosts with his opulence. He is said to be enamored of expensive whiskey and other luxury goods, despite his country's grueling poverty.
After Mr. Kim's first trip to Russia, a Siberian official wrote of being impressed by the leader's affinity for platform shoes, fine dining and Russian women.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Aug. 21 about a visit to Russia by Kim Jong-il, the North Korea leader, misstated the history of the Kremlin's diplomatic recognition of South Korea and reduction of economic and military subsidies to North Korea. Official diplomatic ties with South Korea were established on Sept. 30, 1990, by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union -- not by Boris N. Yeltsin, who succeeded Mr. Gorbachev as president of Russia after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Gary Lures Hollywood With a Bounty Of Decay

BYLINE: By MERIBAH KNIGHT. 
mknight@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Inside City Methodist Church in downtown Gary, Ind., mushrooms grew next to a pile of rubble and a wooden cross. Old theater seats were scattered about, the backs snapped from their cushioned seats as if a giant had smashed them in a fit of rage.
Nearby, two books lay open with dirt and dust caked onto their pages; their titles: ''A Guide to Managing People'' and ''Rampage.'' 
''That pretty much tells the whole story,'' Ben Clement, executive director of the Gary Office of Film and Television, said when he saw the titles.
When Gary was booming, the city's factories churned out smoke, steel and prosperity. When the steel industry went bust, so did Gary's economy.
The steel industry never returned, but the crumbling remains of Gary's last viable economy are offering some small hope of a new one.
Last year the action blockbuster ''Transformers: Dark of the Moon'' was filmed at City Methodist, which is falling apart from the inside out. The year before, scenes of ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' were shot there.
In 2010 Gary was the location for 24 movies, most of them attracted by the city's visually arresting decay. With 26 productions already shot in 2011, this year is a record one for Gary's nascent film industry.
''It is a significant economic development driver already, and we are still fledgling,'' Mr. Clement said of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that flow into Gary from movie productions.
Mr. Clement was unable to supply specific numbers, but said the financial benefits came from film fees paid to the city, wages for locally hired security, grips, gaffers, caterers and carpenters, and money spent on accommodations for cast and crew members.
A booming industrial city through the 1950s, Gary suffered a rapid decline as steel production shifted overseas. The city's population has declined 22 percent since 2000, to 80,294 residents from 102,746, according to 2010 census data. The median income for residents, according to the 2009 American Community Survey, is $24,821, and 30 percent of families are below the poverty line.
Unable to afford the costs of demolition, Gary has been left with an abundance of large, abandoned structures that have proven to be an attractive destination for urban explorers, photographers and filmmakers.
For the new ''Transformers'' movie, the director, Michael Bay, turned a former cement plant on the edge of Lake Michigan into a replica of Chernobyl.
''In a sense it's kind of like the right place for all the wrong reasons,'' said Al Cohn, a location scout and manager based in Chicago, who sought locations for ''Transformer'' in Chicago and in Gary. ''There are still locations that offer a window into the past and its faded glory. And faded glory is still a visually interesting backdrop to filmmaking.''
In 1997, Mr. Clement opened Gary's film office to capitalize on that interest.
''We started to see that there was value in our infrastructure,'' he said.
Since then, Gary has been used as a location in productions as disparate as the movies ''Pearl Harbor'' and ''Soul Survivors'' and the History Channel program ''Life After People.''
''When they are bombing Tokyo, they are bombing Gary,'' Mr. Clement said of the city's role in ''Pearl Harbor.''
But he insisted the city's goal was not to become a theme park of urban decay.
''I am not preserving these buildings for that purpose,'' he said. ''As long as they're here, I am taking lemons and making lemonade.''
Mr. Clement said some citizens felt he was allowing Hollywood to exploit their battered city.
With all of the city's challenges -- Gary, for example, no longer has even one movie theater to show the productions it stars in -- courting the film industry seemed frivolous to some residents, Mr. Clement recalled. But he insists there are benefits for the city beyond the income generated.
When he saw children lined up outside the Methodist church to get the autograph of the actor Tyrese Gibson after a day of filming, their smiles confirmed his mission to bring such productions to Gary, Mr. Clement recalled.
One of those children ''could be the next Spike Lee because he saw a Hollywood production in his front yard when he was 5 or 6,'' he said.
At the Horace Mann apartments, a mixed-income housing complex a block from the church, children recalled watching the big-budget productions in action.
''It's good publicity,'' said Jamal Mayes, 17. ''Because right now it's kind of like a ghost town here.''

HEADLINE: The Stomachs of Strongmen

BYLINE: By ANN LOUISE BARDACH

 BODY:
Ann Louise Bardach is a writer at large for Newsweek and the author of ''Without Fidel: A Death Foretold in Miami, Havana and Washington.''
Santa Barbara, Calif.
THE tribute concert Aug. 12 for Fidel Castro's 85th birthday, at the Karl Marx Theater in Havana, was billed as the Serenata de la Fidelidad (the Serenade to Fidelity). In terms of flat-footed plays on the name of Cuba's maximum leader, I prefer ''The Fideliad'' -- which speaks to his epic, exhausting and endless run, which began in 1959.
Some 5,000 concertgoers turned out for the homage by 22 singers, including Omara Portuondo of the Buena Vista Social Club, but the guest of honor was not present. Instead, he settled for a quiet celebration with family, his 80-year-old brother and presidential successor, Raul, and his devoted disciple, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. The irrepressible Mr. Chavez broke the news on Twitter late Saturday: ''Here with Fidel, celebrating his 85th birthday! Viva Fidel!'' 
Over the last decade, the two leaders have celebrated quite a few birthdays together. For his 75th in 2001, Mr. Castro trooped to Caracas for a bash with Mr. Chavez, who hosted a Champagne gala, followed by a nautical tour of Venezuela's rainforests. The visit, Mr. Chavez said, ''gives us an opportunity to let him know how much we love him.''
It's unclear how many birthdays are left for either leader. Both are now facing their greatest challenges yet, not from opposition movements or dissidents, but from their own failing bodies. Mr. Castro nearly died in 2006 during a botched colon surgery to treat a pernicious case of chronic diverticulitis. He passed his 80th birthday lying in a hospital bed, connected to an antibiotic and nutrient drip. Sitting beside him was Hugo Chavez, who has been there at every stage of Mr. Castro's five-year convalescence, casually jetting into Havana as if it were a stroll around the block.
Now the 57-year-old Venezuelan is fighting for his own life, after a baseball-size tumor was removed from his abdomen in Havana's top hospital in June. It was Fidel Castro, not an oncologist, surgeon or family member, who delivered the bad news to Mr. Chavez post-surgery, and who outlined his prognosis and treatment -- along with his usual tips on public relations and political strategies. It is likely, based on his surgeries, symptoms and treatment, that Mr. Chavez has metastasized colorectal cancer. After surgery and radiation, he is probably undergoing at least six months of chemotherapy, again in Havana, where he just finished his second round.
As it turned out, Mr. Castro spent much of his birthday giving his friend a pep talk. ''We spoke about everything,'' Mr. Chavez related upon his return to Caracas. ''He said to me: Chavez, 'You yourself can begin to convince yourself that everything's over. ... No, no, it's not over.' ''
Ironically, the hemisphere's most indomitable strongmen and determined foes of the United States and free market economics have both been felled, at least for now, by abdominal woes -- their guts, as it were. It's just one more anomaly shared by the leader of the country with the world's largest reserve of oil and that of a debt-saddled island in the Caribbean.
The symbiosis between Cuba's emeritus or former (and in most ways, still de facto) commander in chief and the Venezuelan colonel-turned-oil-sultan is the most powerful and fascinating political alliance in the Americas. Five years before becoming president in 1999 and two years after a failed coup attempt, Mr. Chavez was released from prison and flew to Havana in hopes of meeting his revolutionary hero. Waiting to welcome him at the airport was the man himself. It's been a lovefest ever since, with Mr. Chavez declaring that Venezuela is sailing in Cuba's ''sea of happiness.''
More crucially, after Cuba lost its Russian patron and plummeted into economic free fall, Mr. Chavez gave his friend one of the most magnanimous gifts in history -- around 100,000 barrels of oil every day, gratis, with no strings attached -- for as long as Cuba wanted it. In exchange, Mr. Castro sent thousands of doctors to Caracas -- a deal derided by some critics as ''oil for ointment.'' No one doubts who got the better deal.
Unlike the quid-pro-quo-demanding Soviets, who picked up most of Cuba's tab for three decades, Mr. Castro now receives adoration from a leader who happily calls him ''mi padre.''
Not without reason. In 2002, when a coup appeared to have dislodged Mr. Chavez from power, it was Mr. Castro who spent night after night on the phone, tutoring his charge in a strategy to regain power and dispatch his enemies. ''Don't resign! Don't resign! I kept telling him,'' Mr. Castro recounted in his autobiography.
Since then, Ramiro Valdes, Cuba's pre-eminent policeman and spymaster, has made Caracas a second home, reorganizing Venezuela's military, police force and Internet services (a fiber-optic cable connects the two countries like an umbilical cord). Cuban advisers are dotted throughout Venezuela's ministries, offering counsel on everything from literacy to opposition movements and elections. There will not be another coup, or many more elections.
''Deep down,'' says the Venezuelan convalescent in chief, ''we are one government.'' They don't call it ''Venecuba'' for nothing.
Hence, if the health of either man further fails -- and both are walking the razor's edge -- all bets are off. One cannot overstate the symbolism that surrounds Fidel Castro in Latin America; Mr. Chavez's legitimacy as a Bolivarian revolutionary depends, in large part, on his being mentored by Mr. Castro. And if Mr. Chavez succumbs to illness or is (somehow) voted out, Cuba's oil spigot could well be turned off by a less generous successor. Raul Castro, who is trying to salvage Cuba's bankrupt economy with all manner of fixes and reforms, is especially dependent on Venezuelan munificence.
Despite the ailing titans, change is happening in Cuba -- in ways big and small and previously unthinkable. Take for instance the marriage of a transsexual woman and an H.I.V.-positive gay man on Mr. Castro's birthday. Hailing it as their ''gift'' to him, the happy couple cruised in a convertible through Havana, where gay men could once be hauled into work camps for being ''anti-revolutionary.'' The bride had her sex change surgery at the National Center for Sexual Education, run by Mariela Castro Espin, Raul Castro's free-spirited daughter, who has turned Havana into the San Francisco of the Caribbean.
Tolerance for entrepreneurship is also increasing. Cubans will soon be able to sell their homes, for the first time since the Castros took power. And the Obama administration has lifted many of the pointless and onerous restrictions on travel to Cuba.
Of course, if Marco Rubio, the hard-line Cuban-American senator from Florida, snares the vice-presidential slot for the Republicans, Democrats will feel pressure to tighten the screws of the embargo once again. And should the Republicans prevail in 2012, relations will almost certainly return to the Stone Age of nonengagement -- hinged on the mantra that ''Fidel will go any day now.''
While he appeared frail and off balance during his one brief ''live'' appearance at the Communist Party powwow in April, I would argue against any bet on Mr. Castro's date with his maker. A worthy rival of Lazarus, he has survived three major surgeries and the loss of a good deal of abdominal viscera, not to mention the administrations of 10 United States presidents.
Certainly, there are enough family members in key government ministries -- most notably Raul Castro's powerful son and sons-in-law -- to ensure a degree of dynastic rule into the future. But the lavish concern and solicitation of the elder Mr. Castro toward his Venezuelan charge suggests a deeply felt fear should his island lose Mr. Chavez's patronage.
That said, in case Mr. Chavez slips his mortal coil before his Cuban ally does, the uber-strategist Fidel Castro has no doubt cobbled together some sort of contingency plan -- as he was forced to do after the Soviets pulled out. Trust and sentimentality are not part of his political credo. Discussing an early betrayal by a companero turned informer, Mr. Castro said he learned a crucial lesson: ''You shouldn't trust someone just because he's a friend.'' Or depend on him.
''Fidel is a force of nature,'' observed his friend the writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez. ''With him, you never know.'' Or as they lament in Miami, ''Immortal until proved otherwise.''

HEADLINE: Surely They Can Read a Spreadsheet: Business needs to speak out for a balanced approach to growth and the deficit

 BODY:
When the federal government was on the brink of default and the economy hung in the balance, the nation's business leaders had a chance to step forward and push for a long-term solution. They could have supported a grand bargain that cut spending and raised tax revenue. They could have warned House Republicans that it was far too risky to use the debt ceiling for political leverage.
Instead, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Financial Services Forum and other important players wrote a series of weak letters to the White House and Congress saying, in essence, ''just don't default.'' 
Business leaders had reason to worry. Unlike many Republican politicians who saw the standoff as political theater, or a chance to bring ''big government'' to its knees, they knew what default would mean for their bottom lines. But just avoiding that cataclysm is not enough. The economy is in profound trouble, and the political system is in desperate need of responsible voices promoting sound ideas for both growth and deficit reduction.
This is not the time for the usual demands by business for fewer regulations and lower taxes. The economy is too fragile and the deficit too high -- in no small part because the George W. Bush administration spent eight years giving business and the wealthy exactly what they asked for.
Instead, business leaders should be pushing Washington for what is needed to avoid another recession: more near-term spending to stimulate the economy, more revenue to help pay for it, and a balanced approach to the long-term deficit by reducing health care costs and strengthening the tax base.
If Republicans continue to obstruct President Obama's proposals to coax the economy back to life, it will not be just the unemployed who will suffer -- it will be corporate bottom lines as well.
It will be difficult for business leaders to change the minds of the Tea Party lawmakers, even those who rode to office on ads paid for by the chamber and similar groups, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't try. A responsible argument by business for a balanced approach to reviving the economy and reducing the deficit could change the debate in Washington. President Obama is moving -- although too slowly -- in the right direction; the American public knows that jobs, not tax cuts, are the No. 1 priority; and the House leadership may even be willing to compromise if business leaders give them cover.
Business has already blown several chances. In mid-July, nearly 500 executives (including the chamber's) wrote a letter to the White House and Congress saying the obvious: default would be ruinous and long-term deficits should be reduced. The Washington Post reported that the signers could not reach agreement on whether Republicans should accept the president's proposed compromises on taxes, which offered to cut spending in exchange for much smaller revenue increases. As a result, the letter said nothing about revenue. A similar letter was sent two weeks later by the Financial Services Forum, which includes the big banks and investment firms.
Last week, the chamber wrote a letter to the Congressional ''supercommittee'' demanding that it ''address entitlements'' -- meaning cut the benefits of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- and restructure the tax code. But it said nothing about raising revenues or asking for greater shared sacrifice through higher income and estate taxes for the wealthy.
The chamber, along with the Business Roundtable and others, has urged greater government spending on rebuilding roads, bridges and the power grid. The chamber joined with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in supporting the creation of an infrastructure bank, one of the White House's top priorities to help kick-start the economy. We hope they back it up with real lobbying in Republican offices.
The Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable want tax cuts too. But how exactly do these executives imagine this spending would be paid for, if not through higher taxes? Or do they really want the elderly and low-income families to give up some of their safety-net benefits to widen interstate highways, while high-income money managers sacrifice nothing?
Last week, Warren Buffett stepped forward to demand that his taxes, and all those on the wealthy, be raised to cut the deficit. Except for a few Democratic millionaires, that idea has received virtually no support from the nation's business leaders. Until they ante up, they will remain part of the problem, not the solution.

WHERE CREDIT CARDS
CAN LEAD TO JAIL TERMS
For years, banks in the United Arab Emirates all but threw credit cards at the foreigners who come here in droves to work the malls and fill the office towers. The workers, many of them raised in poor countries and new to easy credit, spent beyond their means. Staggering losses followed, with jail terms common for those who could not pay. Whether cast as reckless lending or heedless borrowing, their stories offer an unusual glimpse of the hidden emotions -- webs of pride, guilt and family obligation -- that follow millions of migrants across the globe.

One of the most powerful insurgent groups in Iraq, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, released a statement warning that it had launched a 100-attack campaign to exact revenge for the killing of Osama bin Laden. Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia has long claimed an affiliation to Bin Laden's group, and has clearly taken inspiration from the larger group. Page 10
KIM JONG-IL VISITS RUSSIA
In his first visit to Russia in nearly a decade, Kim Jong-Il, the reclusive leader of North Korea, rumbled across the border into far eastern Russia aboard an armored train amid growing hopes for a resumption of talks over ending his country's nuclear weapons program. The Kremlin released a terse statement saying the North Korean leader would visit sites in Russia's Far East and Siberia, as well as meet with Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev. Page 10

FEARS THAT FARMERS' MARKETS
HAVE OUTSTRIPPED DEMAND
Farmers in pockets of the country say the growing number of farmers' markets has outstripped demand, a consequence of a clamor for markets that are closer to customers and communities that want multiple markets. Some farmers say small new markets have lured away loyal customers, while other say they must add markets to their weekly rotation to earn the same money they did a few years ago. Page 11
A SHIFT AT CATHOLIC HOSPITALS
Nuns or priests serve as chief executives at only 8 of 636 Catholic hospitals, according to the Catholic Health Association, illustrating the transition of Catholic health care from religious to lay leadership. The shift has caused angst in many Catholic hospitals about whether the values imparted by the nuns, concerning the treatment of both patients and employees, can withstand bottom-line forces without their day-to-day vigilance.

HEADLINE: Fairies, Witches And Supply And Demand

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Motoko Rich is an economics reporter for The New York Times.
As any parent devoted to bedtime reading knows, the best children's books never resort to icky ''teachable moments.'' Understated messages about loyalty, friendship and bravery thrum like bass lines beneath the melody of character and narrative.
These days, perhaps because I'm covering the national economy -- or because current economic troubles are too much to ignore -- I often stumble across passages in children's books that inadvertently teach economic principles. 
I'm not talking about books that overtly give lessons on financial literacy, like ''Alexander, Who Used to Be Rich Last Sunday,'' by Judith Viorst, one of my 4-year-old son's favorites. Nor am I referring to classics that historians and literary critics argue were written as economic allegories. (Is ''The Wizard of Oz'' a parable about monetary policy and the gold standard? Discuss.)
It's just that once economics is on the brain, it suddenly seems to pop up a lot in children's literature.
Earlier this year, I picked up ''The Saturdays,'' by Elizabeth Enright, to read to my 7-year-old daughter. The novel, originally published in 1941, is about a family of four children being raised by their father and housekeeper.
I was struck by the chapter where Rush, one of the children, stops to watch a large snow-blower at work on a Manhattan street. A crowd gathers, and an old man grumbles that ''hundreds of fellas'' used to shovel the snow. ''Nowadays they do it all by machinery. Ain't no work for nobody.''
Aha! Capital vs. labor. And in ''The Pushcart War,'' by Jean Merrill, tenacious pushcart vendors battle a trio of trucking companies who band together to try to put the pushcarts out of business, leveraging cozy relationships with the mayor. Can you say cartel?
According to John Conant, director of the Center for Economic Education at Indiana State University, children's books provide ripe material because literature deals with everyday life -- a terrain shared with economics. Mr. Conant tries to help teachers tease out economic lessons from the books they regularly use in class.
One of the most common themes in books for young people reflects parents' fears that their children will become ''bad'' consumers, said Marah Gubar, director of the children's literature program at the University of Pittsburgh.
That often means rampant consumers are cast as villains, or at least losers. Take Roald Dahl's ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,'' in which Augustus Gloop and Veruca Salt are spoiled brats whose parents buy them whatever they want. And even in ''Harry Potter,'' Ms. Gubar noted, the appalling Dursleys shower their son, Dudley, with presents, a pointed symptom of the family's wickedness.
Such common tropes irk Ms. Gubar, an avowed liberal. ''In children's literature,'' she said, ''there is often this offensive classism whereby the poor are virtuous and the rich are evil.''
Some children's books teach young readers what happens when there is an underdeveloped market economy. Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, said ''Little House on the Prairie'' showed his 8-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son how difficult life was in the absence of specialization. ''For these guys, it was so tough,'' Mr. Bloom said. ''Pa built his own house, they grew their own food, they sewed their own clothes. You realize how easy it is to live now.''
Even advanced concepts, like organized labor, show up in children's literature. Justin Wolfers, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, cited ''Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type'' by Doreen Cronin and Betsy Lewin, a book about cows that withhold milk from a farmer until he provides electric blankets. Mr. Wolfers read the book to his 1-year-old daughter, Matilda, during the Wisconsin protests against Gov. Scott Walker's attack on union rights.
Mr. Wolfers said the book also illustrated economic efficiency. A duck, the liaison between the cows and the farmer, persuades the farmer to install a diving board in the pond. ''That costs the farmer almost nothing but the ducks really value it,'' Mr. Wolfers said. ''The diving board is a public good.''
Sometimes, economists think that children's books get things wrong. Dr. Seuss's ''The Lorax,'' about the destruction of a forest by a greedy industrialist, ''assumes that there is no economic system in place,'' Mr. Conant said. In a modern capitalist economy, he said, the trees ''would get very valuable as they got scarce, and the person with the property rights would harvest them at an economically reasonable rate.''
By and large, the economic lessons in children's books lean left of center. ''I think the writers are not particularly sympathetic to or don't understand how a market works,'' said Gary S. Becker, the Nobel laureate who teaches economics at the University of Chicago. ''It's not easy to convey that to a child. It's not always easy to convey it to grown-ups.''
For the most part, the economic concepts conveyed in the books reflect values like generosity and equity rather than competition. Raymond Fisman, an economist at Columbia University, said his 3-year-old daughter's favorite books teach the importance of sharing and gift-giving, values that might not lead to the greatest wealth in the real world. But, he added, ''I doubt that 3 is the age where you start teaching people the brutal economic truths of grown-up commerce.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Will Health Care Reform Survive the Courts?

BYLINE: By PHILIP M. BOFFEY

 BODY:
The legal battle over the constitutionality of the health care reform law will determine how far government can go in helping to improve people's lives. Ultimately, the Supreme Court will have to decide this question. Until then, the pileup of lower federal court rulings -- responding to some of the more than two dozen lawsuits filed against the law -- is confusing and sharply divided, especially on the requirement that individuals buy or obtain health insurance or pay a penalty.
So far, six federal judges have ruled that this ''individual mandate'' is constitutional while five have found that it is not. (While most of those judges appointed by Republicans ruled against the mandate and most of the Democratic appointees upheld it, two judges broke away from the partisan pattern.) Two appellate courts -- one in Cincinnati and one in Atlanta -- have reached opposite conclusions. Three other cases are now awaiting appeals court decisions. Here is a scorecard of the rulings and trends emerging in the lower courts. 
CONTESTED BATTLEGROUND The core fight is whether Congress, under its powers to regulate interstate commerce, can require people to buy private health insurance if they don't want to. Although the law has many elements, the mandate is an important tool for reaching the goal of near-universal coverage -- and needed to make health insurance reforms work.
The new law requires insurers to accept all applicants, even those with pre-existing conditions, and prohibits charging higher rates based on health status. Those highly popular changes will drive up premiums for private policies unless healthier people are forced to take out insurance, too. Without a mandate, many of those who lack insurance would typically end up with charity care (as they do now), where the costs are shifted to health care providers and taxpayers or are paid for through higher premiums for everyone else.
The health system's interconnectedness is central to the reasoning of the 2-to-1 majority on the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, which ruled that Congress can require Americans to buy insurance as part of its power to regulate both the insurance markets and the markets for delivery of health care services that virtually everyone uses.
The concurring opinion by Judge Jeffrey Sutton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, is particularly compelling. ''No matter how you slice the relevant market -- as obtaining health care, as paying for health care, as insuring for health care -- all of these activities affect interstate commerce, in a substantial way,'' he wrote. Because not paying for insurance is an economic decision, Congress was within its power to regulate that action. In fact, he noted, decisions not to buy insurance have more impact on interstate commerce than some activities that the Supreme Court previously found could be regulated, such as a farmer growing wheat for his own use or an individual growing marijuana for her own use.
The 2-to-1 majority on the 11th Circuit appeals court rejected that view, ruling this month that Congress has no authority under the commerce clause to impose the mandate. The judges called the mandate ''a wholly novel and potentially unbounded assertion of Congressional authority: the ability to compel Americans to purchase an expensive health insurance product they have elected not to buy, and to make them repurchase that insurance product every month for their entire lives.''
WOULD IT ALL COLLAPSE? The rulings so far suggest that the rest of the law would remain standing even if the mandate was struck down -- only one district judge has ruled that the whole law would have to be declared unconstitutional. The 11th Circuit appellate court found that all other provisions could survive without the mandate (how well they would function is a separate question) and that Congress would likely have passed the law even without the mandate included.
MEDICAID EXPANSION The law would substantially expand Medicaid, the joint state-federal health program for the poor. Twenty-six states have sued to strike down that expansion, which would enroll many millions of the uninsured, contending that it would encroach on state sovereignty and coerce them into spending more on Medicaid. That argument was dismissed by the 11th Circuit appellate court, which found that the expansion was not coercive since the federal government would pay most of the added costs and the states have ample time to set up alternative programs.
WHAT THE MARKET NEEDS While the individual mandate may not be popular in opinion polls, health insurance reforms, like coverage of pre-existing conditions, are exceedingly popular. Those reforms would work far less well without an individual mandate. The Supreme Court could take up any of these issues, skirt them, base its analysis on principles that the lower courts have avoided, or even create new law transcending its own past decisions.
Health care spending now accounts for 16 percent of the national economy, yet 50 million Americans are uninsured. How strange if Congress were disempowered in this critical arena. We hope the court will show judicial restraint and let elected political leaders determine what health care reform should be.

HEADLINE: Going South

BYLINE: MEREDITH HINDLEY


HIGHLIGHT: The one-man secession of Kentucky's John C. Breckinridge.

 BODY:
Even after the brutal battles at Bull Run and Wilson's Creek had made clear the depth of the conflict awaiting North and South, the people and communities along the border were still trying to decide where their true allegiances lay. Many of them - in Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri - tried to find a middle, neutral ground. 
While all four states eventually sided with the Union, countless individuals went the other direction, with most of them moving to the Confederacy and even taking up arms. Perhaps no one embodies the difficulty, and irony, of such decisions than the former vice president, and future Confederate general, John C. Breckinridge.
When the war broke out, Breckinridge was a senator from Kentucky, having lost his 1860 bid for president from the Southern wing of the Democratic Party. A Constitutional Unionist to his bones, Breckinridge believed that slavery could be resolved without resorting to war. Yet as the late spring and summer of 1861 dragged on, he increasingly found himself a lone voice of dissent against the Lincoln administration's bellicose policies and at odds with the sentiments of the state that sent him to Congress. 
Such dissent wasn't what you would expect from a man as steeped in national politics as Breckinridge. Born into a prominent Whig family in Lexington, Ky., in 1821, Breckinridge was raised on stories of his grandfather, who represented Kentucky in the Senate and served as Thomas Jefferson's attorney general. By the age of 30, Breckinridge had already established a respectable law practice, served in the Mexican War, won a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives and won election to the United States House of Representatives. Much to his family's dismay, he joined the emerging Democratic Party, which he found more compatible with his political sensibilities. 
From early on, Breckenridge put slavery at the center of his political worldview. In statements made before the Kentucky House, he made clear his belief that the Constitution left it to the states to decide the slavery question, and that Congress did not have the jurisdiction to regulate or outlaw it. Breckinridge himself had a complicated relationship with slavery. As a young man, he advocated the return of slaves to Africa, yet he purchased slaves to help manage the needs of his growing family. He also represented freed men as part of his legal practice. And he refused to join the Southern fire eaters, who increasingly advocated secession to defend the institution.
Breckinridge's potential did not go unnoticed by aging Kentucky statesman Henry Clay, who publicly endorsed the young Democrat. Clay's crowning of Breckinridge as his heir led to Breckinridge running for Congress. During his two terms in the House, Breckinridge forged ties with Stephen Douglas, helping the Illinois senator muster support for the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. They and others who supported the popular sovereignty approach to slavery hoped that it would settle the issue. Instead, the act had the opposite effect, touching off a brutal and violent struggle between pro-slavery and abolitionist forces. 
After two terms in Congress, Breckinridge returned to his law practice, but national politics called again. This time, the Democrats nominated him as James Buchanan's running mate in the 1856 presidential election. Breckinridge's youth - he was only 35 - and his oratorical prowess complimented the older, more taciturn Buchanan. His Kentucky roots also made the Pennsylvanian more palatable to Southern voters. When the Democrats triumphed in November, Breckinridge became the youngest vice president in the nation's history, a distinction he still holds. 
Unfortunately, Buchanan had no use for his vice president. Breckinridge had originally backed Douglas as the Democratic candidate, which made him suspect in Buchanan's eyes. After spending four years on the political sidelines - he could count on one hand the number of times he met with the president - Breckinridge looked forward to taking up his new post as one of Kentucky's United States senators, where he would hold the same seat once held by his grandfather and the legendary Clay. 
But presidential politics again intervened: In the spring and summer of 1860, the Democratic Party split into Northern and Southern factions over the slavery issue. The Northern Democrats drafted Douglas as their candidate, while the Southern Democrats recruited Breckinridge. "It is well to remember that the chief disorders which have afflicted our country have grown out of the violation of State equality, and that as long as this great principle has been respected we have been blessed with harmony and peace," he wrote upon accepting the nomination. The party he represented, however, advocated states' rights, slaves as personal property and enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law. Breckinridge may have regarded himself as defending a constitutional principle, but the new party defended slavery. And many in the party were prepared to secede if the Republicans were elected. 
The Democratic split helped deliver the election to Lincoln, though Breckenridge did surprisingly well. Douglas beat Breckinridge in the popular vote, but Breckinridge came in second overall in the Electoral College. Still, he refused to make himself the poster-child for secession. With emotions running high in the wake of Lincoln's victory, Breckinridge called for "moderation, forbearance and compromise." Believing that moderation on the part of the Border States and Upper South might calm the radical sentiment roiling the Lower South, he attempted to organize a convention of the Border States at the beginning of 1861. The effort failed when Virginia and North Carolina refused to participate. 
In February 1861, Breckinridge returned to Washington to carry out his final duties as vice president. As president of the Senate, he oversaw the Electoral College as it took the official vote for president; with political nerves already frayed, rumors swirled in Washington that Breckinridge might try to spoil the results, prompting extra guards to be posted in the Senate chamber. Those who whispered such rumors did so out of wishful thinking. Breckinridge may have lost, but he was not a man to usurp a legitimate election. The vote count went off without a hitch. 
In March 1861, Breckinridge swore in the new vice president, Hannibal Hamlin, and took his seat in a greatly reduced Senate. He had the tricky task of representing the opposing views held by his fellow Kentuckians, whose economic fortunes had plummeted since the election. The Unionists believed Kentucky needed to side with the Union because of its strong economic ties to the North. The secessionists believed that state's economic woes would be resolved by standing with the Confederacy. 
Even though his heart lay with the South, Breckinridge had come to Congress, he told his fellow Senators, "with a lingering hope that something might yet be done to avert a war." He warned them, however, that if a resolution couldn't be found to reunite the country, Kentucky would look to the Southern states and "unite with them to found a noble Republic, and invite beneath its stainless banner such other States as know how to keep the faith of compacts, and to respect constitutional obligations and the comity of the confederacy."
Like many along the border, Breckinridge hadn't given up on the Union - he wanted its peaceful preservation above all else - but he was prepared to accept secession if it meant avoiding war. Douglas and the other pro-Union Democrats, however, regarded him as a traitor. They too wanted to avoid war, but they would fight to preserve the Union. Rather than resuming their partnership of old, Breckinridge became Douglas's foil, showing how futile a peaceful solution had become by that spring. The Confederacy, meanwhile, saw Breckinridge as an ally - their man in the Senate - which did little to help Breckinridge's reputation (though he had no known contact with the Confederate leadership). 
In the weeks following Fort Sumter, Breckinridge watched as Virginia and North Carolina - they very states he had hoped to find common ground with - joined the Confederacy, along with Arkansas and Tennessee. Kentucky remained neutral, a strategy that both the Union and the Confederacy would tolerate only for so long given the state's strategic position. But Breckinridge believed that neutrality offered a way forward: he urged his home state to call a convention to draft a peace plan that could be used to prevent the conflict from expanding. The idea, like many solutions proposed in 1861, never coalesced. 
When the Senate reconvened in July, the chamber was short one man: Stephen Douglas had died on June 3 after a fatal attack of rheumatism. That left Breckinridge and James Bayard of Delaware as the only Democrats of stature capable of challenging the Republicans. Speaking from the same spot once frequented by Clay, Breckinridge rained down a constant stream of criticism against the Lincoln administration. He opposed the blockade of the Southern coast. He railed against what he regarded as the president's persistent usurpation of the Constitution. And he cast the only vote in the Senate against a resolution pledging the full resources of the Union to fight the rebellion, on the grounds that he could not commit the country to use of force. 
It wasn't long before Breckinridge's loyalties began to give way. His biographer, Kenneth C. Davis, believes that by the summer of 1861, Breckinridge was already giving "moral aid" to the South: "Whether he realized it or not, he no longer represented his constituents. He was committed to neutrality, to embrace neither side, and while he did not embrace the South, his wholly one-sided attacked on the northern regime constituted an unbalanced representation based upon ignoring the Confederacy, and assaulting the North." 
Breckinridge had come to Washington looking to preserve the Union, only to find that the Union he had revered throughout his life had transformed into an institution he no longer recognized as deserving of his allegiance. At the end of the Senate session, he returned to Lexington, only to watch as both Union and Confederate troops invaded Kentucky during the fall. When Kentucky renounced its neutrality and sided with the Union, anti-Confederate fever swept the state; Breckinridge became a wanted man, and fled South. There he joined the Confederate cause, assuming the rank of brigadier general; he would later lead the Southern forces at the 1864 Battle of New Market, near Lexington, Va. 
It was, in the end, a role he chose willingly. In a manifesto published in October 1861, Breckinridge explained that Lincoln's despotism had forced him to abandon the Union: "I exchange with proud satisfaction a term of six years in the United States Senate for the musket of a soldier."

HEADLINE: Huntsman Calls His Rivals 'Unelectable'

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor who has been stuck in the second tier of candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, took an aggressive new tone during a televised interview on Sunday, saying that recent remarks from two of his major rivals were "extreme" and "unrealistic."

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor who has been stuck in the second tier of candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, took an aggressive new tone during a televised interview on Sunday, saying that recent remarks from two of his major rivals were "extreme" and "unrealistic."
He was referring, respectively, to two of the most conservative Republican candidates - Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and the latest entry in the contest, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas - both of whom have far overshadowed him in polling of Republican voters.
Mr. Huntsman singled out two areas of commentary by Mr. Perry that have drawn particular criticism - Mr. Perry's skepticism about the human causes of global warming as an unproven theory, and his suggestion that actions by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, to give the economy a boost might be "treasonous."
He warned against the Republican Party becoming what he called "the anti-science party," which he said would create "a huge problem" in 2012. In an appearance on the ABC News program "This Week," Mr. Huntsman added, "I think when you find yourself at an extreme end of the Republican Party, you make yourself unelectable."
Mr. Huntsman also scoffed at Mrs. Bachmann's suggestion that, if elected president, she would help bring the price of gasoline to below $2 a gallon.
"I just don't know what world that comment would come from," Mr. Huntsman said. "That is completely unrealistic. And, again, it's talking about things that, you know, may pander to a particular group or sound good at the time, but it just simply is not founded in reality."
The former governor, who served as ambassador to China under President Obama before quitting that post this year to pursue the presidency, has tried to stake out a middle ground in a contest where the loudest voices have come from what he referred to on Sunday as "the fringes."
Mr. Huntsman insisted that the American public was "crying out for a sensible middle ground." He described the United States as a center-right country and said that was precisely where he stood.
Mr. Huntsman fared poorly in the Ames straw poll last weekend in Iowa, a state to which he had devoted little attention. He received less than 1 percent of the vote; Mrs. Bachmann won with 29 percent.
But his comments on Sunday suggested that he might have learned a lesson from a fellow Republican whose campaign bore some similarities to his own: Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota.
Mr. Pawlenty is another former two-term governor with a record as a relatively mainstream conservative. But at times, Mr. Pawlenty came across as too soft-spoken and moderate in a year of unusually heated partisan passions, some political analysts have said.
They said one of his biggest mistakes was to pass on an opportunity, during an early debate, to follow up on his own criticism of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate, for the health-care plan he shepherded in that state. Mr. Pawlenty quit the Republican race within hours of having placed third in the Ames straw poll.
Mr. Huntsman, who began his candidacy with calls for civility and respect, spent much of the time during his appearance on "This Week" seeming to position himself as a teller of blunt truths.
He criticized Republicans, including Mrs. Bachmann, who had suggested that a default on the nation's debt might not be a terrible thing. On the contrary, he said, it would have been "catastrophic."
He was also asked why, during a Republican debate, he had held up his hand along with all the other candidates when asked if they would reject a hypothetical debt deal that would have cut $10 in spending for every $1 in tax increases. He does oppose tax increases, he said, but he dismissed the show-of-hands approach as "nonsense."
Another Republican candidate, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, took a more indirect swipe at Mr. Perry's candidacy on Sunday, saying that as Republicans look to the 2012 election, "We're going to win Texas, no matter who the nominee is." He said the party would need to carry Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, and "I've got the track record to do that."
Mr. Santorum also criticized the Obama administration for what he suggested was a tepid response to the harsh Syrian crackdown on the protest movement there. The administration called on Thursday for President Bashar al-Assad to leave office, but Mr. Santorum said that "certainly from the very beginning I would've called for Assad to step down."

HEADLINE: Spend Now, Save Later, Bond Fund Leaders Say

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Two leading bond traders offer their prescriptions for the faltering economy.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Early in Bill Clinton's presidency, his populist advisers saw their spending plans crash into resistance from Wall Street, which demanded deficit-cutting austerity.
"I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or a .400 baseball hitter," Mr. Clinton's political strategist, James Carville, lamented at the time. "But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everyone."
So it is relevant to ask: What does the bond market want at this moment of economic peril?
As it happens, two leading bond traders have strong opinions - though not what the Clinton-era populists would have expected.

Austerity? Yes, say Bill Gross, a Republican, and Mohamed El-Erian, a Democrat, the chief investment officers of the giant bond fund Pimco. They support curbs on entitlement spending.
But that is for the long term. Right now, they argue, the government needs to arrest America's dangerous economic slide.
In fact, their prescriptions are more aggressive than any the White House has proposed or appears to be contemplating for President Obama's planned speech in September. Among them: direct federal hiring to reduce unemployment and increase lagging demand.
Mr. Gross, a billionaire acclaimed for his early warnings that the dot-com and subprime mortgage bubbles would burst, said, "Capitalism in its raw form can't pull us out of this hole."
Five Weak Spots
Mr. El-Erian, who ran the nation's largest university endowment as head of the Harvard Management Company, says the United States needs to move simultaneously to fix five overlapping structural problems.
The first is housing, staggered by fallen prices, foreclosures and "underwater" mortgages that exceed the value of the homes they financed.
One critical step, Mr. El-Erian said, is for government to ease refinancing rules for homeowners who remain current on their payments but do not meet borrowing criteria. (Mr. Gross observed that these lower-interest-rate refinancings would cost Pimco money on its mortgage investments.)
The second is the labor market, which has steered too many workers toward the housing, retail and leisure sectors, which will not fully recover anytime soon. To create new and better jobs, the government needs a renewed focus on improving math, science and engineering education, as well as job retraining programs to make workers more competitive.
While waiting for education investments to pay off, however, Mr. Gross says the government should finance immediate job creation to shore up the third structural weakness: America's fraying infrastructure. Updating roads, bridges and airports would provide an engine for reducing unemployment faster.
"You've got to create a demand for labor," Mr. Gross said. "The private sector is not going to do it." Even if the government must do it directly, he said, "Putting a shovel in the hands of somebody can be productive."
The fourth weakness lies in lending. Banks, still smarting from the loan losses that resulted from the financial crisis, want to lend to big companies that don't need money, but not to small businesses that do.
"Credit pipes are clogged," Mr. El-Erian said. One way to unclog them is a program of public-private partnerships, like the Infrastructure Bank that the Obama administration has proposed.
On the fifth problem, the government's questionable long-term solvency, the Pimco executives say Republicans and Democrats are both right. Spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security entitlements must be curbed, and taxes must go up - on the affluent and perhaps the middle class, too.
Given the scale of the problem, Mr. Gross says the tax increases proposed in the "grand bargain" that Mr. Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner sought earlier this summer were too small. Instead of $1 in tax hikes for every $3 in spending cuts, he wondered, "How about one-to-one?"
Short-Term Vision
Actually, Mr. Gross knows why not: tax increases are unpopular. Nor does he hold illusions about the political feasibility of other steps that he and Mr. El-Erian insist make economic sense.
Easier refinancing for underwater borrowers would require new loan guarantees by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both symbols of the country's failed housing policy.
New spending for education, infrastructure, lending or job creation would collide squarely with Washington's bipartisan turn toward budget austerity. Both sides of the "grand bargain" are loaded with electoral risk.
A comprehensive economic solution requires the country to "step back and say, 'Where do we want to end up in five years?' " Mr. El-Erian said. Neither voters nor elected officials typically show such patience.
So in reality, neither bond king feels that he has much political clout.
Mr. El-Erian said he rarely talks with the Obama economic team, especially after his recent public complaints about weak leadership in Washington.
Mr. Gross remains a registered Republican, but an independent one who notes that if bond-buying "vigilantes" on Wall Street ever could have imposed their wishes on government, they can't anymore.
"The true vigilantes," he explained, are the Chinese and the Federal Reserve. Which reflects the depth of America's economic problem.

HEADLINE: Did Newark Bet On the Wrong Sport?

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
NEWARK -- When the first pitch was thrown, there wasn't much of a crowd in the ballpark to see it. Entire sections were unoccupied. The flow of people through the front gate was a trickle. The most fan-generated noise came from a children's birthday party on a concourse in the right-field corner.
The Rev. Joe Kwiatkowski, among the few in attendance, said this was not the loneliest feeling he had ever had at Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium, capacity 6,200.
''I've been here on nights when I literally counted the crowd and it's been like 90 to 100,'' he said from a seat behind first base. ''Tonight will probably be a little more because they've got fireworks.'' 
It was an overcast Saturday evening, rain on the way, but that only partly explained the meager attendance to watch the Bears play the Quebec Capitales in an independent Can-Am League game.
After a promising start to the return of minor league baseball here 13 years ago, a persistent dark cloud has settled over the Bears and their cozy ballpark near the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. In recent years, the team has changed ownership several times, gone into bankruptcy and emerged to an almost nonexistent fan base and grim financial reality.
The Bears are more than $800,000 in arrears on rent to Essex County and have provided little in ticket and sponsorship revenue due the county. Whatever the team's fate, the county and the city must each pay $1.1 million a year in debt service on the ballpark until 2029.
Given the large soccer constituency in the city's Portuguese and Latino strongholds, did Newark get its demographics crossed and build the wrong field of commercial dreams? Did the city bet on the wrong sport?
A Yankees fan who said his priest's salary was better preserved by spending a few dollars at a minor league game than paying a small fortune at Yankee Stadium, Kwiatkowski, 54, who has a Roman Catholic parish in Glen Rock, N.J., has attended Bears games because he once lived in Newark's Ironbound district and hoped that a successful team could contribute to the city's revitalization.
''I was within walking distance, right over there,'' he said, lifting his chin in the direction of the outfield fence.
Within the hour, a multitude of fans ''over there,'' in the Ironbound, would stream from restaurants on Ferry Street and across a nearby bridge to help pack another area sports facility, the 17-month-old Red Bull Arena, in the neighboring town of Harrison.
While Major League Soccer was growing in Harrison, minor league baseball appeared to be dying in Newark, along with the expensive dream of restoring a slice of its vintage past.
Shift Away From Baseball
''It's two different things, totally separate,'' said Philip Alagia, the chief of staff for Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr., the executive for Essex County, which partnered with Newark to build the baseball stadium for $34 million, including cost overruns. ''The Red Bulls get major media coverage. You don't get that with minor league baseball.''
Alagia called the ballpark an important recreational site for Newark, hosting numerous high school and college games, and community events. He said it would continue to operate if the Bears were to go out of business and no team could quickly be attracted to take their place.
A soccer fan himself, Alagia said he parked in the Ironbound and walked to Red Bull Arena with many of the ticket-holders who filled restaurants and bars before games. In other words, the soccer stadium -- while situated in another town and county (Hudson) -- has also served Newark's business interests.
But how much better off would Newark be if Newark had pursued professional soccer instead and had Red Bull Arena to go along with the Prudential Center and other development projects, including a $7 million movie theater renovation spearheaded by Shaquille O'Neal?
While the Bears fend for scraps, the Red Bulls averaged 18,796 fans for their first 12 home games this season -- and that does not include the sellout for the M.L.S. All-Star Game and other exhibition matches.
Although the Newark-Harrison story is an extreme and somewhat unusual case, it reflects an urban cultural shift on which soccer hopes to capitalize as an emergent and faster-paced sport in 21st-century America. Still enormously popular in many markets, baseball has lost traction with young people, especially African-Americans, with a 26 percent decline in youth participation between 2000 and 2009, according to the National Sporting Goods Association.
''In terms of drawing people, the soccer stadium in Harrison has been a success,'' said Rick Cerone, a former Yankees catcher and the Bears' original owner, who grew up in Newark and lobbied county and city politicians for the return of the Bears, a popular Yankees farm team more than half a century ago.
He acknowledged that misjudgments might have been made about the Newark of then and now.
''Probably the best thing to do would have been a soccer stadium or maybe coordinate one stadium that could have been used for both,'' Cerone said. ''But, you know, it's easy to look back.''
According to Cerone, the original plan for the baseball revival included a 12,000-seat soccer stadium in the area of Riverbank Park in the Ironbound. But neighborhood opposition to the complex mounted, and Cerone preferred the less-congested and more easily accessible site along McCarter Highway where the ballpark was built.
On the subject of a clear vision for which sport Newark's population was best suited to support, Jim Hague, a longtime Newark-area sportswriter and the Bears' publicist and stadium announcer until this season, said: ''No one could see the forest through the trees. If they had built a soccer stadium in Newark, it would have been a huge success. But you also have to remember that at that time M.L.S. had grand glories of selling out bigger stadiums.''
The league has since opted for smaller, soccer-specific arenas that have fueled hopes for sustained growth and long-term profitability. Meanwhile, the baseball project in Newark went forward with the blessing of Sharpe James, then the city's mayor.
''It was a political arrangement,'' Alagia said. ''The previous county executive had to build a new jail and the mayor said, 'You can build a jail in Newark, but we want something, too.' ''
James and James W. Treffinger, then the county executive, dismissed concerns about investing in independent baseball, which many consider to be a risky proposition. James called the project ''affordable family entertainment that will change the image of Newark forever.''
Cerone said he would naturally have preferred a major league affiliate but struck out with George Steinbrenner in that pursuit.
''I said to him, 'Let's be partners in Newark,' '' Cerone said. ''He said, 'I'm not interested in minor league baseball.' A year or so later, he did the deal to put a minor league team in Staten Island.''
Without territorial permission to pursue another affiliated team, the Bears became members of the Atlantic League, which has operated a successful franchise in Bridgewater, N.J., owned by the car dealership magnate Steve Kalafer.
In 2003, Cerone sold controlling interest of the Bears to Kalafer, whose father was a bat boy for the original Bears and who had warm memories of the city as a child.
''When I came in, I believed with all my heart that the Bears could be just as successful in Newark as the Somerset Patriots in Bridgewater,'' Kalafer said. ''I just had no idea how broken it was, not the city, but the franchise infrastructure. There was no community involvement whatsoever.''
Kalafer soon took on a partner, Marc Berson, and divested himself completely in 2005. Three years later, the team was in bankruptcy.
''Independent ball is very much like a restaurant: how it starts is how it ends,'' Kalafer said. ''If there is not a community infrastructure, it's empty within six weeks.''
Jerry Izenberg, the influential sports columnist for The Star-Ledger of Newark, grew up in Newark rooting for the Bears and pushed hard for their resurrection. He said the early focus was too much on drawing suburbanites and not enough effort was spent on developing relationships within the city.
''My Newark Bears didn't need the suburbs; they were totally supported by the city,'' said Izenberg, now a columnist emeritus who lives in Las Vegas. ''I realize I was emotional and sentimental. People tell me I'm living in the past, and obviously the soccer constituency is different and large, but I still believe that baseball could have made it again in Newark. They just did everything wrong.''
Cerone disagreed. ''We had the most diversified crowd of any minor league team,'' he said, blaming a lack of individualized and fully attentive ownership after he left for the Bears' failure.
''I've taken some hits on this,'' he said. ''That I was a typical baseball owner and that I took my money and ran. But I put my heart into it -- slept in a trailer next to the stadium while they were building it and basically wore myself out to the point where I had two stents put in my heart.''
Cerone said that he made a profit as the Bears' owner and from the sale and that he occasionally got calls -- even from the new owners -- ''trying to get me back in.''
So far he has decided to pass.
Fighting to Pay the Bills
While the Bears went about the competitive business of baseball, Danielle Dronet, the team's co-owner and chief executive, sat in her office before a recent game and explained the current challenges of the complicated business of the Bears.
In a one-word nutshell: bills.
''None were taken care of -- vendors, utilities, suppliers, everything,'' she said, her long, dark hair flowing out from under a Bears cap with a large old-fashioned N.
As if to validate her claim, soon there was a knock on the door from an agent of the Internal Revenue Service. She directed him to the office of the team's chief financial officer.
''See what I'm saying?'' she said.
Dronet and her boyfriend, Dr. Douglas Spiel, wrested control of the team from a former partner, Tommy Cetnar, an ex-police officer, and his girlfriend, Shelley Garrett, in July, ending a one-year partnership that was awash in disputes.
Spiel, a radiologist, opened a medical office inside the stadium to go with several others in New Jersey. Dronet, who ran a marketing agency for models, dancers and showgirls in New Orleans, is tending to the Bears on a daily basis.
''Is there a way we can turn this around?'' she said. ''Yes, I think there is. We're in it for the long haul.''
For the time being, she and Spiel have been sorting through invoices, renegotiating contracts and cutting corners and salaries while trying to lighten a scheduling load of community events that have taken their toll on the playing surface, which needs to be replaced.
She has her own revenue-generating plans, including holiday parties at the ballpark and a reality television series starring the Bears -- or maybe their owners -- and titled ''The Real Spiel.''
But some lament the harsh reality of affordable and family-oriented minor league baseball in Newark given the city's reputation as a dangerous place. While crime and murder rates in the city reflected national trends and fell after Cory A. Booker succeeded James as mayor in 2006, there has been an uptick the last two years, particularly after Booker was forced to lay off 167 police officers last December.
Hague, the former Bears publicist, said his car was stolen one night during a game. Father Kwiatkowski, the minor league fan, said that he had never felt unsafe going to a Bears game but that perception became reality for suburbanites. He has failed in his attempts to organize outings from his parish in Glen Rock to Bears games.
''They'll go to the games on the Montclair State University campus but not here,'' he said, referring to the New Jersey Jackals, Can-Am League rivals who play at Yogi Berra Stadium in Little Falls.
Dronet said that the crime fears were overstated and that the majority of the fans who did come semi-regularly were from the suburbs. There just are not enough to support a team.
''We do have groups and camps from Newark,'' she said. ''That's where I'd like to highlight next season. It's very important to build that relationship, but there's a lot of mending we have to do.''
From her office window she can see Red Bull Arena beyond the scoreboard with the big 42, honoring Jackie Robinson, and said she had called and e-mailed the soccer team, hoping to foster a partnership on promotions.
''I've never heard back from them,'' she said. ''Maybe their system is down.''
A New Arena's Problems
Over in Harrison, where the Red Bulls entertained a sellout crowd of 25,177 on the rainy Saturday night, tying the Chicago Fire, 2-2, the soccer team had its own problems despite a surge of fan interest.
Traffic on narrow streets leading into the arena was snarled, parking around the handsome arena was a challenge and that was the least of the dissatisfaction brewing between the team and the blue-collar town of 14,000.
In June, Bloomberg News reported that the Red Bulls were involved in a $1.4 million property tax dispute with Harrison, which had to borrow $3.1 million last December to make its annual payment on the $39 million debt it incurred to buy and clean up the land used for the stadium. (The Red Bulls spent $200 million to build the stadium.)
In addition, Moody's Investors Service in May downgraded Harrison five levels to a junk-bond rating, and the town had to close a $6 million budget gap with painful cuts.
Mayor Raymond McDonough, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told Bloomberg that he had had ''some sleepless nights'' over the situation but that ''it'll work out in the end.''
According to a person with direct knowledge of the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the Red Bulls are contending that Harrison officials made the tax claim to save face and raise money in desperate times. The person said that Harrison was hurting because state aid for distressed cities was cut and the recession delayed development projects near the arena that were supposed to pay down the land debt.
''The timing of the stadium opening was just bad,'' said Norman Guerra, the executive director of the Hudson County Improvement Authority, through which the bonds for Harrison's land purchase were sold. ''But what I'm hearing is that some of these things are starting to be resolved.''
He mentioned that a 331-unit townhouse development was close to completion and that the county had been making good commuter use of the 1,400-car garage it built for $45 million.
Conversely, another planned housing development has yet to begin, leaving a large grassy lot in front of the stadium and a backdrop of abandoned warehouses that at night creates the look of a spooky movie set.
''The happy story there is running through the operation of the club,'' said Erik Stover, who as Red Bulls managing director until he resigned in June was a key player in getting the stadium built. ''The team has only been there two years. When the development gets done, when it's all complete and the tax ratables start flowing, I think it will be a success story.''
How long it takes for a residential community to attract the promised commercial development in this economy is anyone's guess. In Harrison, at least there is hope. In Newark, there is only the sight of fans crossing the bridge, out of town.
Back at the ballpark, where the Bears have listed their season's attendance average as 916, Father Kwiatkowski settled in for the game with plenty of room to stretch out.
''I've been coming since the beginning, about 15 games a year,'' he said. ''I don't know if it was the novelty, but they used to get two or three thousand a night.''
Making a sweeping gesture with his hand, he added, ''But this is so sad to see.''

Accounts
United Continental Holdings, Chicago, chose two agencies to handle the creative and media accounts for the airline -- which will be called United -- that is being formed from the merger of United and Continental. Spending has not been determined; it was estimated at $65 million to $100 million. McGarryBowen, part of the Dentsu Network West unit of Dentsu, will handle the creative assignment, and Horizon Media will handle the media assignment. The Continental agency had been the Kaplan Thaler Group, part of the Publicis Groupe. The United agency had been Barrie D'Rozario Murphy. McGarryBowen and Horizon were selected after a review that also included two other creative and media teams. One team, owned by the Omnicom Group, was composed of TBWA/Chiat/Day and PHD. The other team, owned by Havas, was composed of Arnold Worldwide and MPG. 
United States Olympic Committee selected Y&R Advertising and VML, part of WPP, to handle brand and digital assignments to support the committee's marketing efforts. Spending was not disclosed. VML will also work on a redesign of the teamusa.org Web site. The committee works with agencies on a project basis; the most recent agency it worked with was McGarryBowen, part of the Dentsu Network West unit of Dentsu. The new assignment is the first for Y&R since the arrivals of two new executives, Tom Sebok, president and chief executive for North America, and Jim Elliott, chief creative officer of Y&R New York.
The Boston Bruins named Arnold Worldwide, Boston, part of the Havas Worldwide unit of Havas, as agency of record for an integrated marketing campaign to promote the hockey team's 2011-12 season. Spending was not disclosed. The team, which won the Stanley Cup in the 2010-11 season, had previously worked with Mullen, Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
People
George Carens, president of the Kantar Media SRDS and Kantar Media Healthcare units of Kantar Media, part of WPP, was named president of Kantar Media Intelligence North America. He succeeds Mark Nesbitt, who left, the company said. Steve Davis, senior vice president for sales and client service at Kantar Media SRDS, was named to succeed Mr. Carens as president of Kantar Media SRDS.
Karen Monahan joined @Radical.Media, New York, as managing director for design and digital, a new post. She had most recently been director for interactive production at the New York office of Wieden & Kennedy.
Miscellany
Rockfish Interactive, Rogers, Ark., a leading digital agency, was acquired by the WPP Digital division of WPP. Financial terms were not disclosed. Rockfish, which has offices in Cincinnati, Dallas and Little Rock, Ark., works for clients like Cisco, Procter & Gamble, Tyson Foods and Wal-Mart Stores. Rockfish will operate as an autonomous unit of WPP Digital, and Kenny Tomlin will remain chief executive.
Prospects for growth in worldwide advertising spending have diminished somewhat, according to a new Warc consensus forecast of leading predictions on the subject. The forecast calls for an increase in ad spending of 4.4 percent this year compared with 2010. The most recent previous forecast from Warc, in the spring, called for an increase of 5.1 percent. A 4.4 percent increase is more in line with the forecasts made last November (up 4.5 percent) and in August 2010 (up 4.3 percent).
The national spot radio market is ''slowly picking up speed'' in the second half of the year, according to a report from the Katz Radio Group, with gains in the third quarter in categories like automobiles, fast food and professional services. ''We're extremely confident,'' the report said, despite ''the continued economic weakness'' and the fallout from ''the recent political gridlock in Washington.''
Diageo signed an agreement with Madonna for its Smirnoff vodka brand. Financial terms were not disclosed. Under the deal, consumers will be encouraged to enter a contest sponsored by Smirnoff; the prize is a chance to become a dancer on Madonna's next tour. The contest is part of a campaign called the Nightlife Exchange Project. Agencies involved in the project include JWT, New York, part of WPP, and Profero, London, the new lead worldwide digital agency for Smirnoff.
Interpublic Group of Companies, New York, will form an agency dedicated to a large client, L'Oreal, which now works with Interpublic agencies like Gotham and the McCann Worldgroup. The agency will be named Beauty Village.
Petco Animal Supplies, San Diego, introduced a logo redesign and changed its longtime theme, ''Where the pets go,'' to ''Where the healthy pets go.'' The brand strategy and logo work were handled by Lippincott and an internal brand creative team at Petco.
The decision last week by Hewlett-Packard to leave the tablet market came despite the high scores achieved by several television commercials to promote the Hewlett-Packard TouchPad in a recent report by Ace Metrix. The report showed two of the TouchPad spots, featuring Russell Brand and Manny Pacquiao, had ranked in the top 10 ''most effective tablet ads of 2011,'' finishing fourth and 10th, respectively. The leader was a commercial, ''Feel Free,'' for the Samsung Galaxy Tab. The decision underscored the difficulty for tablet makers in competing with the market leader, the iPad sold by Apple.
Beiersdorf USA, part of Beiersdorf, withdrew a print advertisement for the Nivea for Men line of grooming products and apologized to consumers who were offended by its contents. The ad was part of a campaign that ran in Esquire magazine and showed well-groomed young men holding in their hands cavemen-style heads that were meant to represent their previous, badly groomed selves. The complaints were generated by an ad showing a young black man holding a head with a luxuriant Afro and beard; the headline read, ''Re-civilize yourself.'' After complaints on Twitter that the ad was racist, Beiersdorf USA said it would ''never be used again.'' There was another ad in the campaign, showing a young white man holding a head with an unkempt beard and hair; that ad carried the headline ''Sin City isn't an excuse to look like hell.'' A blog post on Adage.com on Friday suggested the controversy could have been avoided had the headlines been switched between the ads.

HEADLINE: Steps to Solving A Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By PETER THAL LARSEN

 BODY:
The crisis of 2008 is repeating itself in reverse. Three years ago, European governments stepped in to save the banking sector. Today, the euro zone's indebted sovereigns are threatening to cause a full-scale bank panic and possibly even another credit crisis. Europe's lenders must be insulated from their governments and vice versa. Five radical steps could break the bank-sovereign ''doom loop.''
STEP 1: SOLVING THE CAPITAL CONUNDRUM Europe's weaker banks need capital if they are to be prevented from pulling the system down. The most pressing problems are Spain's cajas, or savings banks, and those Italian lenders that barely scraped through Europe's latest stress tests. Among those that failed the tests were Banco Pastor, Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo, Banco Grupo Caja3, CatalunyaCaixa and Unnim. Private markets are effectively closed, and Italy and Spain are scarcely able to afford bailouts. The solution is to repurpose Europe's sovereign bailout fund to inject capital directly into banks -- much the same way America retooled its Troubled Asset Relief Program in late 2008. 
While the European Financial Stability Facility can already make loans to countries for the purpose of recapitalizing banks, this shift would be controversial. It would mean governments ceding control of financial institutions to a pan-European body. Still, the fund could get a big bang for its buck: bolstering the core Tier 1 capital ratios of Europe's 90 largest lenders by one percentage point would cost 100 billion euros, or less than the price of Greece's second bailout.
STEP 2: SOLVING THE FUNDING FREEZE European banks, especially those in Italy and Spain, risk a liquidity crisis if wholesale markets do not reopen to them by autumn. And even if they are able to issue longer-term debt, it is likely to be expensive. That could choke off credit to the economy. The answer again lies in reinventing the stability fund to offer temporary financing guarantees. The idea, first proposed by Morgan Stanley analysts, has worked before. The United States and several European countries restored calm after the collapse of Lehman Brothers by guaranteeing bank finances.
STEP 3: PREVENTING BANK RUNS Even with capital and wholesale funding worries addressed, banks would still be vulnerable to a loss of confidence by depositors. Bank deposits are guaranteed by a lender's home country, and when savers fret about their government's finances, they tend to move their cash -- something particularly easy to do in the euro zone. Deposits at Greek banks have shrink by roughly 15 percent since the beginning of 2010, according to European Central Bank data. But if there were a single pan-European deposit plan, savers would be more likely to stay put.
STEP 4: SAY NO TO BANKS PROPPING UP THEIR GOVERNMENTS Regulators have unwittingly cemented the sovereign-bank link by encouraging lenders to hold larger reserves of liquid assets, mainly in the form of sovereign bonds. Banks in troubled countries have also come under pressure to prop up their governments by buying even more of their debt. To break this potentially fatal embrace, banks should be subjected to strict limits on their exposure to any single country's bonds.
STEP 5: A PAN-EUROPEAN REGULATOR WITH TEETH If the first four steps were taken, the risk would be that sovereign-bank codependency would re-emerge, but on a pan-European level. Preventing that from happening requires creditors to face real losses if a bank falls over. Big lenders must also be structured so they can be safely wound down. Achieving that would require a single euro zone financial supervisor -- something national regulators would no doubt resist. But America provides a good model, with the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation overseeing the system with the help of regional bodies.
THE CAVEAT These ideas would not instantly fix the sovereign debt, large deficits and stagnant growth that plague the euro zone. But removing banks from the equation would lift one large potential fiscal burden from governments. And banks no longer shackled to sovereign fortunes would find it easier to extend credit.
As ever, the problem is politics. This plan would be a big lunge forward in European integration. Politicians and voters who balk at lending to other countries would have to be persuaded to underwrite the euro zone's financial system. But if Europe's squabbling leaders have a better alternative, let them get on with it.

HEADLINE: Sharper Surveillance and NATO Coordination Aided Rebel Advance

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As rebel forces in Libya converged on Tripoli on Sunday, American and NATO officials cited an intensification of American aerial surveillance in and around the capital city as a major factor in helping to tilt the balance after months of steady erosion of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's military.
The officials also said that coordination between NATO and the rebels, and among the loosely organized rebel groups themselves, had become more sophisticated and lethal in recent weeks, even though NATO's mandate has been merely to protect civilians, not to take sides in the conflict. 
NATO's targeting grew increasingly precise, one senior NATO diplomat said, as the United States established around-the-clock surveillance over the dwindling areas that Libyan military forces still controlled, using armed Predator drones to detect, track and occasionally fire at those forces.
At the same time, Britain, France and other nations deployed special forces on the ground inside Libya to help train and arm the rebels, the diplomat and another official said.
''We always knew there would be a point where the effectiveness of the government forces would decline to the point where they could not effectively command and control their forces,'' said the diplomat, who was granted anonymity to discuss confidential details of the battle inside Tripoli.
''At the same time,'' the diplomat said, ''the learning curve for the rebels, with training and equipping, was increasing. What we've seen in the past two or three weeks is these two curves have crossed.''
Through Saturday, NATO and its allies had flown 7,459 strike missions, or sorties, attacking thousands of targets, from individual rocket launchers to major military headquarters. The cumulative effect not only destroyed Libya's military infrastructure but also greatly diminished the ability of Colonel Qaddafi's commanders to control forces, leaving even committed fighting units unable to move, resupply or coordinate operations.
On Saturday, the last day NATO reported its strikes, the alliance flew only 39 sorties against 29 targets, 22 of them in Tripoli. In the weeks after the initial bombardments in March, by contrast, the allies routinely flew 60 or more sorties a day.
''NATO got smarter,'' said Frederic Wehrey, a senior policy analyst with the RAND Corporation who follows Libya closely. ''The strikes were better controlled. There was better coordination in avoiding collateral damage.'' The rebels, while ill-trained and poorly organized even now, made the most of NATO's direct and indirect support, becoming more effective in selecting targets and transmitting their location, using technology provided by individual NATO allies, to NATO's targeting team in Italy.
''The rebels certainly have our phone number,'' the diplomat said. ''We have a much better picture of what's happening on the ground.''
Rebel leaders in the west credited NATO with thwarting an attempt on Sunday by Qaddafi loyalists to reclaim Zawiyah with a flank assault on the city.
Administration officials greeted the developments with guarded elation that the overthrow of a reviled dictator would vindicate the demands for democracy that have swept the Arab world.
A State Department's spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said that President Obama, who was vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, and other senior American officials were following events closely.
Privately, many officials cautioned that it could still be several days or weeks before Libya's military collapses or Colonel Qaddafi and his inner circle abandon the fight. As Saddam Hussein and his sons did in Iraq after the American invasion in 2003, the Libyan leader could hold on and lead an insurgency from hiding even after the capital fell, the officials said.
''Trying to predict what this guy is going to do is very, very difficult,'' a senior American military officer said.
A senior administration official said the United States had evidence that other members of Colonel Qaddafi's inner circle were negotiating their own exits, but there was no reliable information on the whereabouts or state of mind of Colonel Qaddafi. Audio recordings released by Colonel Qaddafi on Sunday night, which expressed defiance, were of limited use in discerning his circumstances.
Even if Colonel Qaddafi were to be deposed, there is no clear plan for political succession or maintaining security in the country. ''The leaders I've talked to do not have a clear understanding how this will all play out,'' said the senior officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to maintain diplomatic relationships.
The United States is already laying plans for a post-Qaddafi Libya. Jeffrey D. Feltman, an assistant secretary of state, was in Benghazi over the weekend for meetings with the rebels' political leadership about overseeing a stable, democratic transition. A senior administration official said that the United States wanted to reinforce the message of rebel leaders that they seek an inclusive transition that would bring together all the segments of Libyan society.
''Even as we welcome the fact that Qaddafi's days are numbered and we want to see him go as quickly as possible, we also want to send a message that the goal should be the protection of civilians,'' the official said.
The administration was making arrangements to bring increased medical supplies and other humanitarian aid into Libya.
With widespread gunfire in the streets of Tripoli, Human Rights Watch cautioned NATO to take measures to guard against the kind of bloody acts of vengeance, looting and other violence that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein's government.
''Everyone should be ready for the prospect of a very quick, chaotic transition,'' said Tom Malinowski, the director of the Washington office of Human Rights Watch.

HEADLINE: The Hidden Costs of Higher Ed

BYLINE: By NOAH S. BERNSTEIN. 
Noah S. Bernstein is an education program associate at the New World Foundation.

 BODY:
OVER the next few weeks, millions of Americans will be heading off to college, and despite the promise of need-blind admissions, more of them than ever will be struggling to pay for it. It's not just the economy's fault: even as they publicize lavish financial aid packages, colleges and universities are making it harder for average American families to afford higher education, while making it easier for the wealthy.
In the past, families and students covered their tuition with lump payments at the beginning of each semester. To ease the burden of such large bills -- recent data shows that tuition and fees have increased 439 percent from 1982 to 2007 -- many colleges have instituted monthly payment plans, while charging zero interest. Even many families that could afford to pay an entire semester upfront find such plans appealing. 
Though such plans have undoubtedly allowed a greater number of modest-income students to go to college, they can actually end up unintentionally raising tuition costs. While the plans typically don't charge a fee for payments made by check or direct deposit, they tack on a hefty charge for credit card payments.
Why? Because most institutions outsource the management of their plans to private companies, which have to make a profit. They charge universities a fee for processing credit card payments, and the schools pass those costs on to students and families, amounting to over a thousand dollars or more per year in some cases.
For example, some of the top liberal arts colleges in America, including Williams, Amherst and Wellesley, use a company called Tuition Management Services, where the fee is 2.99 percent for each payment made by credit card. At Amherst, where tuition, room and board cost $53,370, that's an extra $1,595 if all payments are made by credit card. Even at Swarthmore, which runs its plan in-house, the fee is 2.6 percent, or an extra $1,330 a year.
This hits the middle and working classes particularly hard. Struggling families often face rough patches during which they don't have enough cash on hand to make such payments, and so have to go to their credit cards -- and pay the fees. Meanwhile, wealthy families that can afford to simply write a check upfront each month avoid both credit card fees and interest payments.
To be fair, monthly payment plans intend to help lower-income families afford college. But they have also had the unintentional consequence of creating bonuses for the wealthy and added impediments to the less well-off.
Another way colleges and universities stack the deck is by allowing students or their parents to front the costs of two, three or even four years of school, thereby locking in current tuition prices; some schools even offer discounts for prepayment. Families receiving financial aid are typically excluded from prepayment options.
Of course, only the wealthy can afford to pay even a single year of college upfront, let alone multiple years. And yet, with annual tuition increases running between 4 percent and 10 percent, those who can afford to pay early end up paying significantly less.
Why do colleges and universities, which promote themselves as need-blind, even have programs like this? The original justification was to bolster their revenues quickly, so they could invest them in the stock market. But with the current economic malaise and unreliable financial markets, colleges can no longer depend on consistent or high returns.
Monthly payment plans, and prepayment plans, thus pack a double punch. On one hand, they make it more expensive for struggling families to send their children to college. On the other hand, they make it cheaper for wealthy families to do so. And given how long it takes these days to pay off college debt, these disparities will have ramifications long after students have graduated from college.
Our institutions of higher learning cannot continue to offer their best deals to a privileged few. Our country needs colleges and universities to recruit and cultivate talented young people from diverse backgrounds. To do so, we must ensure that children from working families have the mechanisms not only to obtain college admission and afford to attend without compromising their studies, but also to be free to enter the economy relatively unburdened by debt.

HEADLINE: Are There Any Big Ideas Anymore?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I couldn't disagree more with Neal Gabler (''The Elusive Big Idea,'' Sunday Review, Aug. 14). His conclusion that soon ''there won't be anything we won't know'' would be quickly corrected by a trip across campus to talk to students in science and engineering.
The world is changing fast, driven by new ideas -- on how the brain works, future energy sources, new forms of communication and so on. We are developing ways to manipulate materials and organisms in radically new ways, and these ideas will change the world more than Marie Curie's radioactivity. 
The problem isn't a lack of ideas; it's that the resurgent conservative movement is highly resistant to new ideas (witness the candidates in Iowa last week). They have all the answers and are oblivious to the changes and challenges appearing all around them. No wonder the world and the rating agencies have a low opinion of America's ability to govern itself.
JAMES MAYER Kenmore, Wash., Aug. 14, 2011
The writer is a professor of chemistry at the University of Washington.
To the Editor:
Thank you, Neal Gabler, for your article about the paucity of ideas. The overload of information creates a false sense of security because we believe that the future will be taken care of by this easy access to information. This creates an artificial sense of comfort that makes us fear change and dread the future.
With so many crises looming -- global warming, overpopulation, lack of drinking water and the diminishing supply of oil -- grand ideas are immediately required to build and sustain a positive vision of and for the future.
ROBERT LEACH Denver, Aug. 14, 2011
To the Editor:
The world is bursting with great ideas. Recent ones in the humanities? How about Jared Diamond and Kwame Anthony Appiah for starters. In the sciences? String theory. Human affairs? The Arab spring. Medicine? Global distribution of services.
The marketplace of ideas is more competitive now than when Freud and Einstein walked the earth, but that is good. In a complex world, the cream takes longer to rise.
MICHAEL TENZER
Vancouver, British Columbia
Aug. 14, 2011
The writer is a professor of music at the University of British Columbia.
To the Editor:
Neal Gabler's article is remarkable for decrying the absence of ideas in public discourse over the last decade while providing, as examples of what we lack, Marx, Freud and Einstein; the greatest economist of the early 20th century; and two art critics and several academics active from the 1950s to the 1970s.
What this assemblage has in common is hard to surmise, but it's not anything we've lost from the popular conversation. Theoretical physics and cosmology proceed apace. Behavioral economics creates as much public discussion as countercyclical fiscal policy. Art is as theory-driven as it's ever been.
Academic philosophers like Peter Singer and Cornel West create far greater public interest than John Rawls or Robert Nozick. And surely the Internet cannot have impeded the influence of engineers on social engagement, since engineers invented the Internet.
Where Mr. Gabler sees a public distracted by trivia, I see a public absorbed with abstract debates over government, economics, religion, war, technology, the environment, sex, education, family and more. We might wish that the quality of discourse were higher, but it's hard to see that we've lost the ability to engage in it.
JONATHAN COHEN New York, Aug. 14, 2011
To the Editor:
Neal Gabler hopscotches around eras and among disciplines picking out, with the benefit of hindsight, selected big ideas, and then bemoans the lack of equally history-making thoughts in our own time. It's not always possible to know which ideas will become big or what their shelf life will be. Elsewhere in the Sunday Review (''A Russian Plot? No, a French Obsession'') it was noted that the prominent French philosopher Roger Garaudy predicted that the 20th century would be ''the century of the victory of Communism.''
Big ideas, like lifelong affections, are mostly judged after the fact.
STEVEN BERKOWITZ New York, Aug. 14, 2011
To the Editor:
Neal Gabler proposes that ''we are living in an increasingly post-idea world.'' What an interesting idea!

HEADLINE: Local TV Newscasts Expanding

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
ST. LOUIS -- Coming soon to this city's television screens: more news at 4 in the morning, again at 10, and at 4 in the afternoon.
KSDK, the local NBC affiliate, is adding newscasts to those time slots next month, giving it six and a half hours of local news each weekday, its highest count to date.
As in many other markets, the news is starting earlier than ever in the morning, and replacing ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in the afternoon. To supply it in St. Louis, KSDK is hiring 10 people and buying new cameras and trucks. 
This is what the rebound in local television looks like. Three years after the business buckled under the weight of the advertising recession, the more popular stations in markets like St. Louis are adding newscasts and in some cases employees -- though not as many as were dismissed during the downturn.
Station economics affect the nation's news diet because local TV news is consistently identified in surveys as the top news source for most Americans.
A study commissioned by the Federal Communications Commission concluded earlier this year that although there were pockets of excellence in local news, there was still a heavy reliance on thinly stretched staffs and predictable crime and weather coverage.
Three trends have benefited the local station business. First, advertisers have streamed back, especially in the automotive sector that is so important to local media.
Steve Ridge of Frank N. Magid Associates, which consults with local stations nationwide, said local TV ad revenues were up almost 25 percent in 2010 compared with 2009, buttressed by political ad spending. So far this year, even without political ads, the owners of several big groups of stations reported slight upticks in ad revenues versus 2010.
Second, cable and satellite companies have agreed in many cases to pay retransmission fees to stations, and bigger stations in local markets can command bigger fees. Even though stations are splitting those fees with their network partners, like NBC and ABC, they ''really have been an infusion of stability,'' Mr. Ridge said.
Third, the downturn became a rationale not only to cut costs but to innovate and experiment within news divisions, which have historically been profit centers for stations. The benefit of the industry's bad times, executives say, is that it forced a hard look at news operations.
''Our view was that local broadcasting had gone on autopilot,'' said Dave Lougee, the president of Gannett Broadcasting, which owns KSDK. Industrywide, he said, newscasts had ''become sort of commoditized and formulaic -- arguably in many cases irrelevant.''
Lynn Beall, the president and general manager of KSDK, said the turbulence ''helped us put our focus more on the customer.'' KSDK's anchors and reporters now interact with some of those customers on Facebook and Twitter, making them more aware of community interests. Some of KSDK's newscasts now include commentary segments. And perhaps most important, many employees have been trained to be what Gannett calls multimedia journalists, also known as one-man bands, able to record, produce and report pieces from start to finish.
''We have more people gathering content than we did a year ago, because more people are trained on more platforms,'' Ms. Beall said.
Such arrangements have been a source of grumbling for TV journalists for years, but for those who have never experienced the old way -- a reporter, a videographer and sometimes a producer and a sound technician -- the new way is more acceptable, and sometimes even preferable.
Some of the changes, Ms. Beall acknowledged, were born out of necessity. During the recession, employees at KSDK were furloughed; at other stations across the country, longtime reporters and anchors were ushered out. Gannett consolidated the graphics and master control operations of its stations to a centralized location, eliminating more workers.
Now, Mr. Lougee said, with ''the cost of technology coming down while the quality is going up,'' stations have steered a greater percentage of their staffs toward producing content.
It is clear that investments are being made selectively. Because weather is consistently identified as the most important part of local newscasts, KSDK recently hired a fifth full-time member of its weather team and is adding dashboard cameras to its trucks to transmit live video via the Internet during severe weather.
The macroeconomic landscape for stations is still unsettled given the splintering television audience and the emerging Internet sources for news and entertainment that undermine the concept of a one-to-many broadcast. Uncertainty abounds about the reassignment of broadcast spectrum from television to new wireless uses.
But for now, some stations can still draw big audiences, both on TV and increasingly to their Web sites. A period of station buying and selling is anticipated by industry analysts this year, as shown by McGraw-Hill, which put its four full-power stations up for sale earlier this summer.
The rebound has not treated all stations equally. Mr. Ridge said he sensed that the downturn and the measured recovery since then ''widened the gap between the haves and the have-nots.''
''The stronger stations are now poised to really dominate in these markets, and the smaller stations are now less able to compete, because all around, the economics are not working for them,'' he said.
That manifests itself in so-called shared-services agreements, in which one station in a market runs part or all of another station. The Communications Workers of America union said last year that it had identified at least 25 local markets where such outsourcing agreements were in place, and criticized them for reducing journalistic competition and ''the diversity of local voices in a community.''
In St. Louis, KSDK is now paid to produce two newscasts a day for KDNL, the city's ABC affiliate, which is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. KDNL had stopped producing its own newscasts nearly a decade ago; Ms. Beall characterized the work as a partnership.
Employees at local stations, for the most part, are not getting much breathing room. Bob Papper, a Hofstra University professor who surveys local television staffs, found a gain of 750 jobs in 2010, which made up for the 400 lost jobs in 2009, but made only a small dent in the 1,200 lost jobs in 2008.
At the same time, ''the average amount of news went up 18 minutes per weekday in 2010,'' he said via e-mail, adding, ''I suspect we could see an even bigger jump in 2011.''
That is in part because of the shake-up in the syndication market. Without Ms. Winfrey's show, KSDK is spending less on syndication, Mr. Lougee said; now it has more to spend on news.

HEADLINE: On Wall St., A Big Split On Outlook

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Amid all the grim economic data and a chorus of warnings of a fresh recession, one group on Wall Street has remained remarkably optimistic despite the dangers that may lie ahead -- the research analysts who track individual companies.
Typically bullish in the best of times, this group has barely budged on its expectations for earnings in the second half of 2011, even as the economists and strategists at the big brokerage firms have steadily ratcheted down their forecasts for overall economic growth.
That disconnect could prove painful for investors. On Friday, shares of Hewlett-Packard were punished after the technology giant reported results below analysts' projections and warned them to bring down future numbers. Earlier in the week, similar shortfalls caused shares of Dell and Urban Outfitters to sink.
The 17 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since late July suggests investors already suspect earnings growth may not be as robust as forecast when the summer began. But if more analysts start cutting their estimates in the coming weeks, that could provide yet another incentive for traders to sell. 
Investors are clearly anxious. Stocks fell more than 4 percent last week as the wild swings on Wall Street continued, including a 419-point drop for the Dow Jones industrial average on Thursday.
''Absolutely, the numbers look too high to us,'' said Doug Cliggott, a United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ''In the last two or three weeks, we've had a slew of data showing our growth could be slowing a lot more than expected.''
All this means that September could be a make-or-break month for the stock market. ''A lot of Wall Street folks come back after Labor Day and sharpen their pencils,'' said Adam Parker, United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.
When they do return, they will have plenty of numbers to crunch that suggest a further slowdown is possible. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that unemployment rose in 28 states and the District of Columbia in July, while it fell in only nine states. A day earlier, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia announced that manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region shrank sharply in August.
Traders will be closely watching a range of figures due out this week for more signs of a so-called double-dip recession. On Tuesday, the government is to report on sales of new homes for July, followed by a report on durable goods orders on Wednesday. Data on initial jobless claims and consumer sentiment in August will follow later in the week.
In spite of the lackluster economic numbers in recent weeks, analysts' expectations for earnings growth of the typical company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have edged downward only slightly. The current consensus for the third quarter calls for 15.6 percent earnings growth, not far from the 17 percent analysts forecast on July 1, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.
In the fourth quarter, analysts expect growth of 17 percent, just 0.6 of a percentage point below where the projections were at the beginning of July.
By contrast, economists at the big brokerage houses have been busy slashing their projections for overall growth, with JPMorgan Chase weighing in on Friday while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs trimmed their numbers the day before. JPMorgan now expects fourth-quarter economic growth to be 1 percent, down from an earlier projection of 2.5 percent. Morgan Stanley warned that the United States and Europe were ''dangerously close to recession.''
While they may work for the same bank, analysts and economists don't necessarily see eye to eye.
In the argot of Wall Street, broad economic growth projections are called top-down forecasts because they incorporate a wide range of macroeconomic factors, like manufacturing output and the unemployment rate.
That contrasts with the bottom-up estimates arrived at by tallying the earnings projections of analysts who follow individual companies. The two groups usually work independently -- and can project different results.
Often, critics say, company analysts are too slow to adjust what are characteristically more positive projections. Rather than act before bad news hits, analysts often wait for companies to lower their forecasts. That can blindside investors. For example, shares of Hewlett-Packard fell 20 percent on Friday and contributed to a 1.5 percent decline in the overall market.
''They are a bunch of lemmings and are impacted by their counterparts in the corporations they follow,'' Douglas Kass, a hedge fund manager and founder of Seabreeze Partners in Palm Beach, Fla., said of company analysts. ''They look at things in the rear-view mirror.''
To be sure, analysts seeking information are heavily dependent on the companies they cover, and those companies often wait until the last minute to disclose disappointing results. What is more, many executives at big companies go on vacation in the second half of August, making it harder to glean new data on factors like sales and income.
Despite the gloomy outlook in the United States and Europe, some positive factors could still prop up earnings in the third quarter, which ends Sept. 30.
For some multinational corporations, business has held up in developing markets in Latin America and Asia, while others are benefiting from stronger earnings overseas as a result of a weaker dollar. In addition, some manufacturing and technology companies may have already booked profits on orders locked in until the end of the year, so their income may not fall off until 2012.
Even so, in some sectors the numbers are dropping much faster than in others. With the downturn on Wall Street, along with new regulations and tighter lending margins, the consensus estimate for earnings growth at financial companies has dropped to 13.8 percent now from 15.6 percent on July 1, according to research compiled by Thomson Reuters.
Nevertheless, the financial sector remains vulnerable to disappointments, Mr. Parker of Morgan Stanley said, as do companies in the consumer discretionary category, which includes retailers, restaurants and apparel makers.
Analysts expect earnings for consumer discretionary companies to increase 19.5 percent in the third quarter, just a bit below the 20 percent gain they forecast on July 1. Mr. Parker said the risk of big disappointments was lower in sectors where expectations were not so aggressive, like utilities, health care and telecommunications services.
More reductions in top-down estimates of overall growth by Wall Street economists are expected this week, only heightening the likelihood that earnings projections will eventually have to come down, too.
''It's hard to imagine that as people are ratcheting down economic expectations, everyone can keep these numbers where they are at,'' said Tobias M. Levkovich, Citigroup's chief United States equity strategist. ''There is going to have to be some ratcheting down to match those economic forecasts.''

HEADLINE: The Hidden Costs of Higher Ed

BYLINE: By NOAH S. BERNSTEIN. 
Noah S. Bernstein is an education program associate at the New World Foundation.

 BODY:
OVER the next few weeks, millions of Americans will be heading off to college, and despite the promise of need-blind admissions, more of them than ever will be struggling to pay for it. It's not just the economy's fault: even as they publicize lavish financial aid packages, colleges and universities are making it harder for average American families to afford higher education, while making it easier for the wealthy.
In the past, families and students covered their tuition with lump payments at the beginning of each semester. To ease the burden of such large bills -- recent data shows that tuition and fees have increased 439 percent from 1982 to 2007 -- many colleges have instituted monthly payment plans, while charging zero interest. Even many families that could afford to pay an entire semester upfront find such plans appealing. 
Though such plans have undoubtedly allowed a greater number of modest-income students to go to college, they can actually end up unintentionally raising tuition costs. While the plans typically don't charge a fee for payments made by check or direct deposit, they tack on a hefty charge for credit card payments.
Why? Because most institutions outsource the management of their plans to private companies, which have to make a profit. They charge universities a fee for processing credit card payments, and the schools pass those costs on to students and families, amounting to over a thousand dollars or more per year in some cases.
For example, some of the top liberal arts colleges in America, including Williams, Amherst and Wellesley, use a company called Tuition Management Systems, where the fee is 2.99 percent for each payment made by credit card. At Amherst, where tuition, room and board cost $53,370, that's an extra $1,595 if all payments are made by credit card. Even at Swarthmore, which runs its plan in-house, the fee is 2.6 percent, or an extra $1,330 a year.
This hits the middle and working classes particularly hard. Struggling families often face rough patches during which they don't have enough cash on hand to make such payments, and so have to go to their credit cards -- and pay the fees. Meanwhile, wealthy families that can afford to simply write a check upfront each month avoid both credit card fees and interest payments.
To be fair, monthly payment plans intend to help lower-income families afford college. But they have also had the unintentional consequence of creating bonuses for the wealthy and added impediments to the less well-off.
Another way colleges and universities stack the deck is by allowing students or their parents to front the costs of two, three or even four years of school, thereby locking in current tuition prices; some schools even offer discounts for prepayment. Families receiving financial aid are typically excluded from prepayment options.
Of course, only the wealthy can afford to pay even a single year of college upfront, let alone multiple years. And yet, with annual tuition increases running between 4 percent and 10 percent, those who can afford to pay early end up paying significantly less.
Why do colleges and universities, which promote themselves as need-blind, even have programs like this? The original justification was to bolster their revenues quickly, so they could invest them in the stock market. But with the current economic malaise and unreliable financial markets, colleges can no longer depend on consistent or high returns.
Monthly payment plans, and prepayment plans, thus pack a double punch. On one hand, they make it more expensive for struggling families to send their children to college. On the other hand, they make it cheaper for wealthy families to do so. And given how long it takes these days to pay off college debt, these disparities will have ramifications long after students have graduated from college.
Our institutions of higher learning cannot continue to offer their best deals to a privileged few. Our country needs colleges and universities to recruit and cultivate talented young people from diverse backgrounds. To do so, we must ensure that children from working families have the mechanisms not only to obtain college admission and afford to attend without compromising their studies, but also to be free to enter the economy relatively unburdened by debt.

HEADLINE: Criticizing Rivals, Huntsman Tries to Claim Middle Ground

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor who has been stuck in the second tier of candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, took an aggressive new tone during a televised interview on Sunday, saying that recent remarks from two of his major rivals were ''extreme'' and ''unrealistic.''
He was referring, respectively, to two of the most conservative Republican candidates - Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and the latest entry in the contest, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas - both of whom have far overshadowed him in polling of Republican voters. 
Mr. Huntsman singled out two areas of commentary by Mr. Perry that have drawn particular criticism - Mr. Perry's skepticism about the human causes of global warming as an unproven theory, and his suggestion that actions by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, to give the economy a boost might be ''treasonous.''
He warned against the Republican Party becoming what he called ''the anti-science party,'' which he said would create ''a huge problem'' in 2012. In an appearance on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Mr. Huntsman added, ''I think when you find yourself at an extreme end of the Republican Party, you make yourself unelectable.''
Mr. Huntsman also scoffed at Mrs. Bachmann's suggestion that, if elected president, she would help bring the price of gasoline to below $2 a gallon.
''I just don't know what world that comment would come from,'' Mr. Huntsman said. ''That is completely unrealistic. And, again, it's talking about things that, you know, may pander to a particular group or sound good at the time, but it just simply is not founded in reality.''
The former governor, who served as ambassador to China under President Obama before quitting that post this year to pursue the presidency, has tried to stake out a middle ground in a contest where the loudest voices have come from what he referred to on Sunday as ''the fringes.''
Mr. Huntsman insisted that the American public was ''crying out for a sensible middle ground.'' He described the United States as a center-right country and said that was precisely where he stood.
Mr. Huntsman fared poorly in the Ames straw poll last weekend in Iowa, a state to which he had devoted little attention. He received less than 1 percent of the vote; Mrs. Bachmann won with 29 percent.
But his comments on Sunday suggested that he might have learned a lesson from a fellow Republican whose campaign bore some similarities to his own: Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota.
Mr. Pawlenty is another former two-term governor with a record as a relatively mainstream conservative. But at times, Mr. Pawlenty came across as too soft-spoken and moderate in a year of unusually heated partisan passions, some political analysts have said.
They said one of his biggest mistakes was to pass on an opportunity, during an early debate, to follow up on his own criticism of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate, for the health-care plan he shepherded in that state. Mr. Pawlenty quit the Republican race within hours of having placed third in the Ames straw poll.
Mr. Huntsman, who began his candidacy with calls for civility and respect, spent much of the time during his appearance on ''This Week'' seeming to position himself as a teller of blunt truths.
He criticized Republicans, including Mrs. Bachmann, who had suggested that a default on the nation's debt might not be a terrible thing. On the contrary, he said, it would have been ''catastrophic.''
He was also asked why, during a Republican debate, he had held up his hand along with all the other candidates when asked if they would reject a hypothetical debt deal that would have cut $10 in spending for every $1 in tax increases. He does oppose tax increases, he said, but he dismissed the show-of-hands approach as ''nonsense.''
Another Republican candidate, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, took a more indirect swipe at Mr. Perry's candidacy on Sunday, saying that as Republicans look to the 2012 election, ''We're going to win Texas, no matter who the nominee is.'' He said the party would need to carry Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, and ''I've got the track record to do that.''
Mr. Santorum also criticized the Obama administration for what he suggested was a tepid response to the harsh Syrian crackdown on the protest movement there. The administration called on Thursday for President Bashar al-Assad to leave office, but Mr. Santorum said that ''certainly from the very beginning I would've called for Assad to step down.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: World Looks for Reassurance That the Fed Will Take Steps

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
With the global economy sputtering and financial markets on the rocks, the world is looking for reassurance that the United States central bank stands ready to save the day.
Much attention will focus on a speech on Friday by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where policy makers and academics are meeting as part of an annual symposium. 
Last year, Mr. Bernanke used the forum to suggest that the Fed could help growth by buying long-term bonds, a prelude to a program that did just that.
However, no grand new plan is expected this year, in part because the Fed already pledged this month to keep interest rates near zero into 2013.
''Markets are increasingly hoping there will be some signs that the Fed will come running to the rescue,'' said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. Many economists said they expected Mr. Bernanke to explain what was in his policy toolbox while promising to use those tools if necessary.
One danger looming over the world economy, which could compel Mr. Bernanke to act, is the prospect that the European sovereign debt crisis could worsen.
Investors are becoming more nervous daily that a new recession threatens.
Economists see rising risks that growth could evaporate in the United States, while Europe languishes in a debt crisis. Even strong performers like the economies of China and Brazil show signs of slowing.
Moreover, stocks have plunged, further threatening the economy because consumers could pull back if they sense their retirement savings are dwindling.
Investors have rushed into United States Treasuries as a haven, and the yield on the 10-year note last week fell below 2 percent for the first time since at least the early 1960s.
Already, worries over European debts are rattling the markets, leading investors to demand that some European governments pay higher interest rates to borrow.
Investors have shunned the debt of Ireland, Portugal and Greece, and now market forces appear to be tilting against larger countries, threatening to create a much larger crisis.
Policy makers are scrambling to contain this, with the European Central Bank buying Italian and Spanish bonds this month.
But the European Central Bank is internally divided over that move, increasing anxiety for investors. On Monday, the central bank will release figures that could show how committed it is to propping up Italy and Spain.
A bad reaction by investors to that data, or to revised readings due this week on United States and British second-quarter economic performance, could increase pressure on Mr. Bernanke to act.

HEADLINE: China and U.S. Choose Safe Site for Biden Visit

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
DUJIANGYAN, China -- The choice of sites for visits by foreign leaders is always the product of careful deliberations, but those calculations were particularly evident on Sunday when Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. stopped at a school here.
Chinese and American officials knew that whichever school was selected in Dujiangyan, in the western province of Sichuan, it had to reflect the resilience of residents in recovering from the devastating earthquake of May 12, 2008, which left more than 86,000 dead or missing. 
But Chinese officials were no doubt careful to steer Mr. Biden away from any school that would evoke memories of the thousands of students killed when classrooms collapsed, spurring angry, grieving parents to press the government for investigations into what they suspected was shoddy construction. The government bought the silence of many parents with compensation money or detained those who were especially troublesome.
And so on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Biden's entourage drove up to Qingchengshan High School, set against a backdrop of green mountains wreathed in mist. The original buildings had been badly damaged during the earthquake, but no students had died, and the school was not considered one that had particularly suffered from ''tofu construction,'' now a catch phrase among Chinese for anything poorly built.
That meant that the school was a good fit for a photo opportunity. Moreover, the N.B.A. had helped build four basketball courts here after the earthquake, and the United States Agency for International Development and Cisco Systems had equipped classrooms with electronic whiteboards. Mr. Biden and Vice President Xi Jinping, presumed to be the next leader of China, chatted with dozens of students in white uniforms who were playing basketball on the outdoor courts.
Just hours earlier, Mr. Biden had brought up the issue of human rights during a speech to 400 people at Sichuan University. ''Maybe the biggest difference in our respective approaches are our approaches to what we refer to as human rights,'' he said.
''I recognize that many of you in this auditorium see our advocacy of human rights as at best an intrusion and at worst an assault on your sovereignty,'' he added. But for Americans, he said ''there is a significant moral component to our advocacy.''
Mr. Biden's words, though coming from a man of power, do not resonate as much across China as the memory of the victims of the collapsed schools -- an official estimate said 5,335 students had died -- and of the suppression by the government of the voices of the grieving parents and their demands for justice. Critics say the crackdown by the government was one of the worst abuses of human rights in recent years.
And parents in China are increasingly asking whether a child's right to a safe life should be considered a human right, universal to all and somehow guaranteed by the government. Since the collapsed schools first galvanized that sentiment, scare after scare has followed. In the fall of 2008, news spread of a tainted milk scandal -- six infants had died and 300,000 had fallen ill -- and of the government scramble to buy off or detain angry parents. In the spring of 2010, a series of unrelated school stabbings prompted questions about the ability of officials to ensure security at schools. This year, food safety is a bigger issue than ever before.
''But of course we're angry,'' Tian Wenyao, the mother of a 12-year-old boy who died in the collapse of Xinjian Primary School here in Dujiangyan, said in June 2008. ''Who wouldn't be angry? In the morning, my child said to me, 'Mama, I'm going to school.' In the evening, he turned up a corpse.''
Ms. Tian was among a group of mothers who had peacefully protested in front of government offices only to have the police break up the demonstration and drag away some parents.
The most famous human rights case this year, the three-month detention of the artist Ai Weiwei, also has ties to the school collapses. One of Mr. Ai's most political projects in recent years was to direct a team of volunteers in trying to compile a list of names of students who had died in the collapses. He created an exhibition with children's backpacks to symbolize the deaths, and he traveled in 2009 to Sichuan to lend support to Tan Zuoren, an advocate of the parents who was being tried for inciting subversion. Mr. Ai was beaten by police officers, and Mr. Tan was sentenced to three years in prison.
On Sunday, sticking to diplomacy, Mr. Biden did not mention the grieving parents in any public manner when meeting with Mr. Xi. The two first spoke together in a large gathering outside the Qingchengshan school, then walked over to the basketball players. Mr. Biden tried making a shot six times before finally succeeding on the seventh. He and Mr. Xi signed a basketball; Mr. Biden scrawled ''U.S.A.''
This was not Xinjian Primary School, nor was it Juyuan Middle School, in a suburb of Dujiangyan, where 900 students had died in a cascade of concrete. But the gym teacher here, He Zhengzhong, still shook his head when asked about the earthquake. ''We were out here in prefabricated buildings for 10 months,'' he said.
Inside a classroom, Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi sat in front of a semicircle of 31 students studying English and took questions. Mr. Biden talked about the dedication of his wife, Jill, to teaching (she has worked at community colleges), and he urged one girl to go into that profession. Mr. Xi sat and listened with little expression. But he became animated toward the end of the session, speaking to the children and smiling when he paraphrased a famous line from Mao. ''The young people are like the sun in the morning,'' Mr. Xi said. ''The world belongs to you.''

HEADLINE: German Leaders Reiterate Opposition to Euro Bonds as a Way to Ease Crisis

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Sunday re-emphasized her opposition to issuing bonds backed by all the euro zone countries, a position that will be greeted enthusiastically by many of her fellow citizens but could unsettle investors at the beginning of what could be another difficult week in global financial markets.
Mrs. Merkel told ZDF television in an interview broadcast Sunday that the so-called euro bonds would be an option only in the distant future. 
''It will not be possible to solve the current crisis with euro bonds,'' she said. She added that ''politicians can't and won't simply run after the markets.''
''The markets want to force us to do certain things,'' she added. ''That we won't do. Politicians have to make sure that we're unassailable, that we can make policy for the people.''
The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, echoed Mrs. Merkel's comments, saying that common debt would make it easier for governments to avoid pursuing responsible fiscal policies. In any case, he told the newspaper Welt am Sonntag, it would take too long for countries in the euro zone to amend the treaty on monetary union, which would probably be required to allow the issuance of such bonds.
''We have to solve the crisis within the existing treaty,'' Mr. Schauble said.
The statements by the German leaders are in tune with public opinion in Germany as well as in other countries, like the Netherlands. The Dutch finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager, told the magazine Der Spiegel in an interview published Sunday that Mrs. Merkel should remain firm in her opposition to euro bonds.
That is not what investors want to hear, however.
Stocks around the world plunged last week amid widespread concern that political leaders were unwilling to take bold steps to address the European sovereign debt crisis, at the same time that indicators were pointing to sharply slower growth in Europe and the United States. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped 6 percent last week, with banks suffering some of the biggest drops.
Any further drop in investor confidence could also put pressure on the European Central Bank, which has been intervening in bond markets to hold down yields on Italian and Spanish debt and keep borrowing costs for those countries from reaching dangerous levels.
So far the central bank's bond market intervention, which began two weeks ago, has kept Italian and Spanish yields below 5 percent, Frank Engels, an analyst at Barclays Capital in Frankfurt, wrote in a note. In October, the European Financial Stability Facility, the bailout fund, will be able to buy government bonds. But that may not be enough to keep yields within bounds, he said.
Mr. Schauble told Die Welt that he did not think it would be necessary to increase the size of the bailout fund. Such comments may come as a particular disappointment to investors because Mr. Schauble is regarded as one of the most pro-European members of the German cabinet, and among the most willing to agree to national sacrifice in the interest of saving the common currency.
But Mr. de Jager, the Dutch finance minister, said he would be willing to increase the size of the bailout fund.
Since the beginning of the debt crisis, Mrs. Merkel has resisted being swayed by bond investors; she waited until pressure became intense before agreeing to aid for Greece and other measures that were unpopular with German voters.
She also said she saw ''nothing that points to a recession in Germany.'' She acknowledged that political leaders needed to regain the confidence of financial markets but said the best way to do that would be to reduce debt.
Mrs. Merkel expressed opposition to euro bonds after a meeting in Paris last week with the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, during which they pledged to improve economic coordination among euro members.
In the interview with Die Welt, Mr. Schauble said he personally would be willing to cede some control over fiscal policy to a European finance minister, as Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, has proposed. But Mr. Schauble added, ''We can only go as fast and as far as we can convince citizens and their representatives in Parliament.''
Separately, Der Spiegel reported that the German Finance Ministry had calculated that euro bonds would cost Germany an additional 2.5 billion euros, or $3.6 billion, in interest payments in the first year of issuance, and as much as 10 times that sum each year after a decade. Germany's borrowing costs are typically among the lowest in the world, but could rise if the nation's reputation for fiscal prudence was diluted by closer association with countries like Italy.
A Finance Ministry spokesman said he could not confirm the Spiegel report, which the magazine said was based on estimates by unidentified ministry experts.
Opposition to euro bonds is strong within German political circles and among the country's conservative economics establishment because of the perception that the country would wind up subsidizing its neighbors.
But some economists argue that euro bonds would be cheaper even for Germany, because the volume of the bond market would rival that of United States Treasury securities and promote the euro as a reserve currency. That would increase demand for the bonds and lower interest rates.
There is some support for euro bonds in Germany. Leaders of the opposition Social Democrats and Green Party have spoken in favor of common European debt. In addition, the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper quoted several members of Mrs. Merkel's governing coalition in Parliament on Sunday as saying that Germany should not rule out euro bonds forever.
While rejecting the bonds, Mr. Schauble said that Germany would defend the euro ''under all circumstances'' and that the government categorically rejected suggestions that Greece should leave the euro zone, as some economists have proposed.
If Greece dropped out, he said, Europe would suffer ''a dramatic loss of trust and influence.''

HEADLINE: Spend Now, Save Later, Bond Fund Leaders Say

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Early in Bill Clinton's presidency, his populist advisers saw their spending plans crash into resistance from Wall Street, which demanded deficit-cutting austerity.
''I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or a .400 baseball hitter,'' Mr. Clinton's political strategist, James Carville, lamented at the time. ''But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everyone.''
So it is relevant to ask: What does the bond market want at this moment of economic peril? 
As it happens, two leading bond traders have strong opinions - though not what the Clinton-era populists would have expected. Austerity? Yes, say Bill Gross, a Republican, and Mohamed El-Erian, a Democrat, the chief investment officers of the giant bond fund Pimco. They support curbs on entitlement spending.
But that is for the long term. Right now, they argue, the government needs to arrest America's dangerous economic slide.
In fact, their prescriptions are more aggressive than any the White House has proposed or appears to be contemplating for President Obama's planned speech in September. Among them: direct federal hiring to reduce unemployment and increase lagging demand.
Mr. Gross, a billionaire acclaimed for his early warnings that the dot-com and subprime mortgage bubbles would burst, said, ''Capitalism in its raw form can't pull us out of this hole.''
Five Weak Spots
Mr. El-Erian, who ran the nation's largest university endowment as head of the Harvard Management Company, says the United States needs to move simultaneously to fix five overlapping structural problems.
The first is housing, staggered by fallen prices, foreclosures and ''underwater'' mortgages that exceed the value of the homes they financed.
One critical step, Mr. El-Erian said, is for government to ease refinancing rules for homeowners who remain current on their payments but do not meet borrowing criteria. (Mr. Gross observed that these lower-interest-rate refinancings would cost Pimco money on its mortgage investments.)
The second is the labor market, which has steered too many workers toward the housing, retail and leisure sectors, which will not fully recover anytime soon. To create new and better jobs, the government needs a renewed focus on improving math, science and engineering education, as well as job retraining programs to make workers more competitive.
While waiting for education investments to pay off, however, Mr. Gross says the government should finance immediate job creation to shore up the third structural weakness: America's fraying infrastructure. Updating roads, bridges and airports would provide an engine for reducing unemployment faster.
''You've got to create a demand for labor,'' Mr. Gross said. ''The private sector is not going to do it.'' Even if the government must do it directly, he said, ''Putting a shovel in the hands of somebody can be productive.''
The fourth weakness lies in lending. Banks, still smarting from the loan losses that resulted from the financial crisis, want to lend to big companies that don't need money, but not to small businesses that do.
''Credit pipes are clogged,'' Mr. El-Erian said. One way to unclog them is a program of public-private partnerships, like the Infrastructure Bank that the Obama administration has proposed.
On the fifth problem, the government's questionable long-term solvency, the Pimco executives say Republicans and Democrats are both right. Spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security entitlements must be curbed, and taxes must go up - on the affluent and perhaps the middle class, too.
Given the scale of the problem, Mr. Gross says the tax increases proposed in the ''grand bargain'' that Mr. Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner sought earlier this summer were too small. Instead of $1 in tax hikes for every $3 in spending cuts, he wondered, ''How about one-to-one?''
Short-Term Vision
Actually, Mr. Gross knows why not: tax increases are unpopular. Nor does he hold illusions about the political feasibility of other steps that he and Mr. El-Erian insist make economic sense.
Easier refinancing for underwater borrowers would require new loan guarantees by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both symbols of the country's failed housing policy.
New spending for education, infrastructure, lending or job creation would collide squarely with Washington's bipartisan turn toward budget austerity. Both sides of the ''grand bargain'' are loaded with electoral risk.
A comprehensive economic solution requires the country to ''step back and say, 'Where do we want to end up in five years?' '' Mr. El-Erian said. Neither voters nor elected officials typically show such patience.
So in reality, neither bond king feels that he has much political clout.
Mr. El-Erian said he rarely talks with the Obama economic team, especially after his recent public complaints about weak leadership in Washington.
Mr. Gross remains a registered Republican, but an independent one who notes that if bond-buying ''vigilantes'' on Wall Street ever could have imposed their wishes on government, they can't anymore.
''The true vigilantes,'' he explained, are the Chinese and the Federal Reserve. Which reflects the depth of America's economic problem.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Messing With Texas

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas hasn't lost an election in 10 tries. Among his vanquished opponents, this streak has inspired not only the usual mix of resentment and respect, but a touch of supernatural awe. ''Running against Perry,'' one of them told Texas Monthly, ''is like running against God.''
Perry's 2012 rivals can't afford to entertain such thoughts. If either Mitt Romney or Barack Obama hopes to snap the Texas governor's winning streak, the election will need to become a referendum on Perry himself, in all his heat-packing, secession-contemplating glory. If it becomes a referendum on his home state instead, Perry's 11th campaign will probably turn out like all the others. 
Perry's critics don't like to admit this. After he launched his campaign with an extended brag about Texas job creation, there was a rush to cut Texas down to size -- to dismiss the Lone Star economic miracle as a mirage conjured by population growth, petro-dollars and low-paying McJobs.
But the more the Internet's hive mind worked through the data, the weaker this critique looked. Yes, Texas's growing population has contributed to the job boom, but the boom has driven population growth as well. The influx of people has been too extraordinary to just be chalked up to, say, snowbirds seeking 105-degree retirements. More likely, thousands of Americans have responded to hard times in their home states by moving to Texas in search of work.
As the policy blogger Matthias Shapiro pointed out in an exhaustive analysis, the jobs they're finding aren't unusually low-paying: the state's median hourly wage is close to the national average, and since the recession started, Texan wages have increased at the sixth-fastest pace in the country. Nor are the jobs confined to the oil and gas industries: ''Take the energy sector completely out of the equation,'' Shapiro noted, ''and Texas is still growing faster than any other state.''
On Friday, in a Bloomberg Television interview, Education Secretary Arne Duncan tried to open up another anti-Texan front, saying he feels ''very, very badly for the children'' in Texas's supposedly underfinanced public schools. But here, too, the evidence doesn't back up Duncan's criticism. Texas does have higher high school dropout rates than the average American state. But then again, Texas isn't an average state: it's an enormous melting pot that shares a porous, 1,969-mile border with Mexico. Once you control for demographics and compare like with like, the Texan educational record looks much more impressive.
When a 2009 McKinsey study contrasted Perry's home state to the similarly sized and situated California, it found that Texas students were ''one to two years of learning ahead of California students of the same age, even though Texas has less income per capita and spends less per pupil than California.''
When it comes to minority achievement, Texas looks even better: On the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress math exam, black eighth graders in Texas outscored black eighth graders in every other state.
To be sure, the Texas model doesn't always impress. (Twenty-seven percent of Texans lack health insurance, for instance, compared with 21 percent of Californians.) But Perry can credibly claim that his state delivers on conservative governance's two most important promises: a private sector that creates jobs at a remarkable clip, and a public sector that seems to get more for the taxpayers' money than many more profligate state governments.
The question is whether Perry himself deserves any of the credit. Here his critics become much more persuasive. When Perry became governor, taxes were already low, regulations were light, and test scores were on their way up. He didn't create the zoning rules that keep Texas real estate affordable, or the strict lending requirements that minimized the state's housing bubble. Over all, the Texas model looks like something he inherited rather than a system he built.
This means that unlike many of his fellow Republican governors, from Mitch Daniels to Chris Christie to Scott Walker -- or a Democratic governor like Andrew Cuomo, for that matter -- Perry can't claim to have battled entrenched interest groups, or stemmed a flood tide of red ink. Instead, many of his policy forays have been boondoggles or train wrecks, from the failed attempt to build a $175 billion Trans-Texas Corridor (the kind of project conservatives would mock mercilessly if a Democrat proposed it) to an ill-designed 2006 tax reform that's undercut the state's finances.
But of course none of those reforming governors are currently in the race against him. Instead Perry faces an unloved Republican front-runner, with a weakened incumbent president waiting in the wings.
Which bring us back to that 10-election winning streak. Maybe God really is on Rick Perry's side. Or maybe Perry just knows how to pick his opponents.

HEADLINE: Homeowners Need Help: The real fixes for what ails the housing market have not yet been tried

 BODY:
Neither Congress, nor federal regulators, nor state or federal prosecutors have yet to conduct a thorough investigation into the mortgage bubble and financial bust. We welcomed the news that the Justice Department is investigating allegations that Standard & Poor's purposely overrated toxic mortgage securities in the years before the bust. We hope the investigative circle will widen.
But a lot more needs to be done to address the continuing damage from the mortgage debacle. 
Tens of millions of Americans are being crushed by the overhang of mortgage debt. And Congress and the White House have yet to figure out that the economy will not recover until housing recovers -- and that won't happen without a robust effort to curb foreclosures by modifying troubled mortgage loans.
Instead of pushing the banks to do what is needed, the Obama administration has basically urged them to do their best to help, mainly by reducing interest rates for troubled borrowers. The banks haven't done nearly enough. In many instances, they can make more from fees and charges on defaulted loans than on modifications.
The administration needs better ideas. It can start by working with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-run mortgage companies, to aggressively reduce the principal balances on underwater loans and to make refinancing easier for underwater borrowers. If the president championed aggressive action, and Fannie and Freddie, which back most new mortgages, also made it clear to banks that they expect principal reductions, the banks would feel considerable pressure to go along.
The housing numbers are chilling. Sales of existing homes fell in July by 3.5 percent, while prices were down 4.4 percent in July from a year earlier. In all, prices have declined 33 percent since the peak of the market five years ago, for a total loss of home equity of $6.6 trillion.
There's no letup in sight. Currently, 14.6 million homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, and nearly half of them are underwater by more than 30 percent. At present, 3.5 million homes are in some stage of foreclosure. Nearly six million borrowers have already lost their homes in the bust.
Reducing principal is a better solution than lowering interest rates, because it reduces payments and restores equity. Bankers resist, because it could force them to recognize losses they would prefer to delay. The administration has resisted, in part because principal reductions are seen as rewarding reckless borrowers.
But many of today's troubled borrowers were not reckless. Rather, they are collateral damage in a bust that has wiped out equity and hammered jobs, turning what were reasonable debt levels into unbearable burdens.
Housing advocates and bankruptcy experts are calling for the administration to try new approaches. One would have Fannie and Freddie urge banks to let underwater borrowers who file for bankruptcy apply their monthly mortgage payments to principal for five years -- in effect, reducing the loan's interest rate to zero.
Another solution would be for Fannie and Freddie to ease the rule for refinancing underwater mortgages for borrowers who are current in their payments. The lower payments on refinanced loans would help to prevent defaults and free up money for borrowers to use for paying down principal or consumer spending.
President Obama is reportedly planning to include housing relief measures in his new jobs plan. Unless the plan includes strong support for principal reductions and easier refinancings, it will not get at the root of the problem: too much mortgage debt and too little relief.

HEADLINE: Assad Says He Rejects West's Calls To Resign

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID and NADA BAKRI

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- President Bashar al-Assad of Syria dismissed American and European calls for him to step down as ''meaningless'' on Sunday, and he declared that Syria's ailing economy could withstand escalating international sanctions.
In an interview with Syrian television, Mr. Assad hardly mentioned the hundreds of thousands of protesters this summer who have posed the gravest challenge to his family's four decades of rule. 
He seemed intent on portraying a sense of strength and stability to a population growing ever more anxious over the violence that has erupted across Syria and the country's increasing isolation.
''Syria will not fall unless there will be a crisis that will finish Syria and this can't happen,'' he said, wearing a blue suit and seeming relaxed. ''I am reassured that the Syrians will come out of this crisis. I am not worried, and I want to reassure everybody.''
Referring only obliquely to the protests, he suggested that the solution was ''political.'' But despite insistent calls for him to refrain from using violence against demonstrators, he suggested that the security forces would continue the crackdown.
''The solution is political, but there are security situations that require the interference of security institutions,'' he said.
Given the scope of the crisis, some Syrians expected him to take more drastic steps. Instead, as he has done in his speeches since the uprising began in March, he offered far more tentative measures, dwelling on the familiar tropes of his ruling Baath Party: laws, priorities and committees.
His statements suggested a yawning divide between the large segment of the population that wants him to step down and his government, which believes its notion of reform can satisfy demonstrations that have briefly wrested two of Syria's five largest cities from state control and turned another into an urban battlefield.
Even for a government accustomed to bouts of isolation, the pressure from the United States and Europe is unprecedented. Last week, President Obama joined with European leaders in demanding that Mr. Assad surrender power ''for the sake of the Syrian people.'' The United Nations commissioner for human rights said a withering crackdown that, by the count of activists, has killed more than 2,000 people amounted to crimes against humanity. In August alone, the Syrian military and security forces assaulted many of Syria's biggest cities: Hama, Deir al-Zour, Latakia and, most recently, Homs.
More sanctions lie ahead. The European Union is expected this week to ban imports of Syrian oil, one of the government's central sources of revenue. Though Syrian oil exports are a tiny share of the global supply, an estimated 90 percent of them are shipped to Europe.
Still, Mr. Assad insisted Sunday, ''We can get all the resources and materials we need.''
When Mr. Assad assumed power in 2000, many Syrians looked to him as a potential reformer in one of the Middle East's most authoritarian countries. He did help transform the economy, bringing at least a veneer of prosperity and consumerism to Syria's two biggest cities, Damascus and Aleppo.
But political change was scant, and many of the ideas he discussed in the interview on Sunday -- a new law that would allow multiple political parties, for instance -- have been on the table since 2005.
He called the months ahead ''a transitional period,'' promising a new election law in addition to the legislation to allow parties in a country where the Baath Party leadership is enshrined in the Constitution. As he did in his last speech, in June, he said the Constitution could be revised, and he promised new parliamentary elections by February.
The government's past steps have been dismissed by opposition figures as too tentative or even meaningless. Mr. Assad lifted nearly five decades of emergency law in April, but the crackdown that ensued, with more than 10,000 arrested and reports of rampant torture, belies the claim that civil rights are now in force.
While it remains unclear how far the political reforms may go, many analysts and diplomats expected them to move the country no farther toward democracy than what Egypt looked like under President Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown in February: a tame opposition, a somewhat more vocal media and a semblance of contested elections.
Mr. Assad reserved his harshest criticism for the international pressure on Syria, casting the steps against his government as part of a long history of outside interference. He called American and European calls for his resignation ''meaningless.''
''This cannot be said to a president who was elected by the people,'' said Mr. Assad, who won, officially, 97.6 percent of the vote in a referendum in 2007. (As usual, there was no other candidate.) ''It can be said for a president who was brought by America and to a people who are submissive to America and take orders from it.''
He suggested that no step he took would satisfy the West.
''No matter what you do, they would still tell you it is not enough,'' he said.
His leadership still enjoys some backing, particularly among the country's minorities and in Damascus and Aleppo. But there are signs of growing anxiety, even among the government's pillars of support, and some government supporters complain that the crackdown has so far failed to stanch dissent.
Since the beginning of the unrest, the government has said that while some protesters have legitimate grievances, the uprising is driven by militant Islamists with foreign backing. Mr. Assad said that he believed the protests had become more militant lately, especially last week, though he was not too concerned.

HEADLINE: What Would You Do If You Were President?

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: How would you finish the sentence "If I were president. . ."?

 BODY:
In the ArtsBeat blog post "If I Were President ...," Jesse Kornbluth asks two professors, three writers, an entrepreneur, a medical doctor, a prioress, a youth advocate, a painter, an astrophysicist and an inventor share what they would do if elected to the Oval Office. Excerpts from their statements include these:
MICHAEL J. SANDEL: I would invest in an infrastructure for civic renewal - not just roads and bridges, but schools, transit, playgrounds, parks, community centers, health clinics, libraries and national service. 
SHARON OLDS: I'd grant the very rich the boon of helping them help others, as a form of gratitude for their good fortune.
ANDREW WEIL: I'd tell the nation that I was powerless to control the war machine, Wall Street, big oil and the other interests that run the country, and I would urge Americans to form a new political party not beholden to them.
DANNY MEYER: I'd appoint a blue-ribbon committee of 14 accomplished citizens - one each representing these nonpolitical walks of American life: arts, science, sports, big business, entrepreneurs, tech, medicine, law, education, environment, defense, religion, farming and philanthropy - and charge them with imagining innovative industries that put Americans to work and add value to our world.
JAMES Q. WILSON: With my staff, I would decide what my administration was for. Once I had clarified that, I would write several speeches on how to cope with a stagnant economy, how to deal with countries (such as Iran and Syria) that harass their own populations, and how the United States is committed to the survival of Israel. These speeches would not attack the other party or previous presidents but would describe the views I supported.
JENNIFER EGAN: I'd decide (privately) from the outset that mine would be a one-term presidency. Freed from the stranglehold of ensuring my own political longevity, I would focus entirely on achieving what I think most Americans want: a stable and productive economy; an environmentally viable planet; a humane, efficient government capable of educating its young and protecting its vulnerable members. 
SISTER MARY DAVID WALGENBACH: I would require members of Congress to participate in a weeklong workshop on dialogue, negotiation and compromise before the next session. All sessions would begin with 10 minutes of silence.
GEOFFREY CANADA: I would have a "grown-up" talk with the American people, emphasizing that we are facing a crisis and solving it will require a spirit of shared sacrifice. Those of us who have benefited mightily from this country and made billions, as well as those who make the minimum wage, must all sacrifice.
PATRICIA RYAN MADSON: I would invite all of the members of Congress to join me in an improvisation retreat. We would spend the time practicing saying "yes" to each other and really listening to one another's offers.
STEPHEN HANNOCK: Immediately after August break, every member of the House and Senate would be required to move for two weeks, with family, to a town or small city in a country outside North America. (Those serving more than one term may only visit an English speaking country once and not on the first trip.)
JAMES DYSON: The United States still spends more than any other nation on research and development. But others are moving up, not least China. America needs to inspire a new generation of risk takers. And it starts in school.
NEIL deGRASSE TYSON: When you're scientifically literate, the world looks different. Science provides a particular way of questioning what you see and hear. When empowered by this state of mind, objective realities matter. These are the truths on which good governance should be based and which exist outside of particular belief systems.
Students: Tell us what you think of these ideas. Which are most helpful? What would you do differently if you were president? How would you try to solve the problems facing the United States?

HEADLINE: What Drives Cities' Runaway Growth?

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: The world's urban areas will continue to expand at a rapid rate, especially in coastal zones most exposed to the dangers of sea-level rise, a new analysis said.

 BODY:
Urban areas are growing even faster than urban populations are, and by 2030 urbanized land around the globe will expand by 590,000 square miles - an amount almost equal to the land mass of Mongolia, according to a newstudy.
The rapid urbanization occurring around the world, particularly in China and India, is the product not just of population growth or economic growth. Other factors, including land-use policies, government agricultural subsidies and the cost of transportation are also driving the trend, according to a new analysis of about 300 studies of cities around the world conducted from 1970 to 2000.
And, in a finding unsurprising to anyone who knows the history of cities like Los Angeles, the authors write that "urban growth is driven, at least in part, by the economic incentives of local officials to increase their revenue by obtaining rural land and transferring land use rights to developers." 
The highest rates of urban growth are in the developing regions of China, India and Africa, but the greatest absolute loss of rural land to cities occurred in North America.
While shifting variables make predictions about future growth difficult, the authors write, a few things are clear: because two-thirds of urban areas with populations exceeding five million are in coastal zones at risk from sea-level rise, "inadequate responses to protecting coastal urban areas would be devastating to the economies and infrastructure of 13 percent of the world's urban population."
The study, which was just published in the journal PLoS One, analyzed 326 other studies that used remote-sensing images to track changes in land use. The authors were Karen C. Seto of Yale's School of Forestry and Environment Studies; Michail Fragkias of Arizona State University's Global Institute for Sustainability; Michael K. Reilly of Stanford's Department of Environmental Earth System Science; and Burak Guneralp of Texas A&M.

HEADLINE: The Happiest States of America: North Dakota on the Rise

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: North Dakota is not only the most employment-rich state in the country. It's also on its way to becoming the happiest, according to new data from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.

 BODY:
North Dakota is not only the most employment-rich state in the country. It's also on its way to becoming the happiest.
According to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, based on a daily survey of Americans that tries to measure the elements of "the good life," North Dakota is the second happiest state, behind Hawaii. (Hawaii has been the happiest state forawhilenow.) North Dakota has been in the Top 10 list for the last couple of years, but has been steadily climbing its way upward.
North Dakota's Well-Being Index score has also moved up proportionally more than any other state in the last year.
The index is based on an average of six component indices, which reflect Americans' answers to questions about how they evaluate their lives; their emotional health; how they feel about their work environment; their physical health; the kinds of healthy behaviors they do (or don't) engage in; and how much access they have to basic necessities. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the state's fleet-footed job growth, North Dakota's score benefited most from respondents' views of their work environment.
Poor West Virginia once again claimed the lowest rank in the latest Well-Being Index report, a spot where it has languished for several years. In general, Southern and Rust Belt states rank lowest on this index, while the Plains states and Pacific states rank best, as shown in the interactive map above.
The latest scores are based on daily polls conducted from January through June 2011, in which more than 177,000 American adults were surveyed.

HEADLINE: Economic Lessons in Children's Literature

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Some offerings of books that teach about the way the economic world works.

 BODY:
An article of mine in the Sunday Review section looked at finding economic lessons in children's books, with lots of contributions from economists and fellow parents. The list in the story was obviously just a start, and many readers had their own thoughts. 
Pamela Paul, the children's book editor of The New York Times, mentioned "Cheaper by the Dozen," and Radhika Jones, an executive editor at Time Magazine, recommended "All-of-a-Kind Family" by Sydney Taylor, a series of books about a large immigrant family living on the Lower East Side before World War I.
And with the price of gold rising as investors scramble for safe havens, Jon Scieszka, author of "The True Story of the Three Little Pigs" (a great piece of media criticism, by the way) and "The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Fairy Tales," suggests that we should now read "The Goose That Laid the 'Now Apparently $1,700-an-Ounce' Egg."

 Over on Marginal Revolution, Alex Tabarrok said, "I read my kids 'The Little Red Hen' -- sort of like 'Atlas Shrugged' for children." Have a look at the comments, too.
 Inevitably, some economists disagreed with the interpretations in the article. At Gametheorist, Joshua Gans wrote that "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was not so much about the evils of rampant consumerism as it was about "innovator rights and the use of trade secrecy as a means of intellectual property protection." He added: "And, by the way, the moral message on that is in favour of such protection."
For more examples of children's books and their economic lessons, grouped by subject matter, there is an excellent resource compiled by the Rutgers University Project on Economics and Children. You can look up books that teach subjects as diverse as incentives and opportunity cost, or savings and scarcity. And contrary to the notion that children's authors don't understand the market economy, the site offers five books on markets and competition.
Another resource is on the University of Delaware Web site, with examples like "A New Coat for Anna," which teaches about bartering, or "The Great Brain" books by John Fitzgerald, which might be more fitting for aspiring business school graduates.

HEADLINE: Shared Meals, and Lives

BYLINE: NIHARIKA MANDHANA


HIGHLIGHT: Residents of ElderSpirit, a senior cohousing venture in Virginia, have built a community where neighbors know one another, share weekly meals and help in times of need.

 BODY:
When Carol Edwards, 86, returned home after rotator cuff surgery, her right arm in a sling, she could not bathe, make her bed or fix a meal. She lived alone with no family close by. Still, the thought of a six-week recuperation did not faze her.
She lives in ElderSpirit, a cohousing community in the Appalachian town of Abingdon, Va. 
An 89-year-old neighbor helped tackle Ms. Edwards's morning chores. Another resident shuttled her to doctors' appointments. Several brought over home-cooked meals.
"My every need was taken care of," said Ms. Edwards, who has lived in ElderSpirit since its inception five years ago. "That's the kind of care you can't get from places that are professionally run."
Continuing care retirement communities and assisted living facilities hold no appeal for residents of ElderSpirit, an eclectic group of 44 older people, including a retired teacher, nurse, artist, minister, corporate executive and several nonprofit administrators, who moved here from 15 states across the country. While anyone over age 55 can join the community, most residents are in their 70s. 
They see senior cohousing as a low-cost alternative that allows them to remain independent while living in a community where neighbors know one another, share weekly meals and help in times of need. 
"I didn't want to be lonely and useless and helpless in my old age," said the founder, Geraldine Peterson, 82. "This takes care of all those issues."
And, she added, with mutual support and perhaps hired help, people can die at home: "I expect to."
Built on 3.7 acres, ElderSpirit is a cluster of 29 gray and white residences flanked by a Spirit Center, where members congregate for meditation and prayer, and a two-story Common House, where they eat a group lunch on Tuesdays and make consensus decisions at monthly meetings. 
Since residents live within shouting distance of one another, in what is sometimes called an intentional community, they have come to share their lives in many ways. One group swims in nearby Holston Lake once a week; another has a Friday night Netflix ritual. The community establishes "clearing house" sessions to resolve disputes, and nominates "care coordinators" to check on residents' health. 
"It makes growing older easier when you're with people who are also growing older," said Nancy Hunter, 74, a former social worker from Alaska. 
Most residents have enjoyed stable health, said Dr. Anne Glass, a gerontologist at the University of Georgia who has followed the community since its opening. One reason may be that community members are not isolated and lead active lives, shown to enhance senior health, she said.
With only two part-time staffers, residents manage and maintain the community themselves. Through committees, they clean the common areas, organize exercise programs, draft policies, admit new members and control the ever-so-tight budget. 
ElderSpirit is a mixed-income development, so more than half the units are state-subsidized rentals for low-income seniors, who pay $325 to $463 a month. The other units, one- and two-bedroom condos, initially sold for $100,000 to $130,000. (They now sell for $160,000.) Owners also pay a monthly maintenance fee of $150. If they sell their homes, they contribute half the profits to the community.
Although there are 250 multi-generational cohousing communities in the United States, there are just three other senior cohousing projects -- in California, Colorado and New Mexico -- despite enthusiastic testimonials from residents. One reason is the protracted process of building one. ElderSpirit was the product of 10 years' planning and cost $3.8 million, raised by a team of dogged seniors through a patchwork of public grants and private donations and loans. 
The recession and crash in the housing market also have hobbled the movement, said Kathryn McCamant, an architect and developer in the Bay Area who coined the term cohousing. A 30-unit project in Grass Valley, Calif., for instance, was poised for construction in 2009, but then the group lost its financing, and some buyers pulled out when they feared they could not sell their homes. After a two-year hiatus, the group, with down payments from 23 buyers, has acquired construction loans and is set to open next summer.
Senior cohousing communities also confront the question of whether the model will hold as the health of residents deteriorates. In the last two years, residents of ElderSpirit have weathered several medical emergencies, including a heart attack and a broken pelvis, plus three joint replacement surgeries. 
Susan Apthorp, 76, supported by her neighbors after a fall two years ago, acknowledged that if a resident developed dementia and needed round-the-clock care, he might be forced to move into an institution. 
Still, she said, "We'll definitely live in our homes longer than most people do."

HEADLINE: Farewell to a Master of Energy, Mobility and Vibes

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Recalling the contributions of a gifted data analyst focused on energy and transportation.

 BODY:
Lee Schipper, who died last week after losing a battle with pancreatic cancer, was an unsung hero in efforts to underpin energy and transportation policies with data and to foster cleaner, smarter transportation systems in fast-growing cities around the world.
He was too big for one school, holding appointments at both Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley. His value lay in part in his determination to follow the data, whether or not the resulting conclusions were politically correct. Watch his 2009 lecture "When the Rubber Hits the Road: The Real Story on Fuel Economy" to get a dose. The Times obituary by Matt Wald captured that facet of Schipper well in describing his dim view of some electric cars: 
Analyzing the Chevy Volt, the new sedan that is supposed to go 40 miles on batteries and then use a gasoline engine, he calculated that because of inefficiencies in electricity generation, its fuel economy was no better than a Toyota Prius hybrid running on gasoline, while its price was roughly double that of the Prius.
"Does the extra $20,000 justify the overall fuel and possible carbon dioxide savings?" he asked. "If two drivers switched to Prius, the overall savings of oil likely would be larger than one driver switching to a Volt, for the same money." [Read the rest.]
He was passionate about alerting people to the abundant energy-saving "no brainers" all around us. He regularly sent me snapshots illustrating energy waste, like this one from a Berkeley supermarket (like the one I just shopped at in Fishkill, N.Y.) where refrigerated products are available without the inconvenience of an insulating glass door:
He was passionate believer that energy in the United States is far too cheap, as he articulated here in a "Your Dot" contribution last year. (He left the politics of how to raise the price to others.)
Schipper's value also lay in his creativity in sifting data from variegated sources to discern trends in energy and transportation choices and habits. One of his last contributions (with Adam Millard-Ball) was a paper noting what appears to be "peak travel" -- meaning that in eight countries with rising affluence, personal mobility doesn't keep rising (pdf of paper). Their hopeful conclusion?
If these trends continue, it is possible that accelerated decline in the energy intensity of car travel; stagnation in total travel per capita; some shifts back to rail and bus modes; and at least somewhat less carbon per unit of energy could leave the absolute levels of emissions in 2020 or 2030 lower than today.
But his respect for data came with a determination to emphasize, even when it was inconvenient, that data -- particularly related to human behavior -- sometimes revealed enormous and durable uncertainty. That was a prime point of another paper he co-authored last year, "Psychohistory Revisited: Fundamental Issues in Forecasting Climate Futures." Here's one core conclusion, echoing Vaclav Smil and Stephen Schneider, among others:
Constraining the uncertainty of the future remains an important task for many important areas of inquiry, but scientists should be meticulous and open-minded when making such arguments. Quite simply, our quantitative understanding of social systems falls far behind that of physical systems.
Then there was music. I met up with him periodically, but -- to my great regret -- never got to jam with him. His undergraduate major was music, and his vibraphone skills were well known to attendees of many transportation and energy conferences. Here he is as part of Lee Schipper and the Mitigators, performing at the Better Air Quality conference in Singapore last year:
I solicited reflections on Schipper from others focused on the questions that he pursued, and you can read them below. Add yours if you knew him or his work.
Dan Kammen, chief technical specialist for renewable energy and energy efficiency, World Bank Group:
For me Lee has always been the most wonderful combination of lightning speed and of intellectual depth. Nobody I have ever met ever responded to fast and in so mangled a spelling as Lee, who, "inVentd hiz onw rapd-fiRE prose online." Lee was SMS before there was SMS... But his nuggets, once deciphered, were like riddles and clues to treasures of data on any topic.He had the knack of interdisciplinary data mining, to cut to the heart of social responses to bus-rapid-transit in Xian or Makati, or to the illogic of cash for guzzler programs that claim one thing yet deliver another, or to a longitudinal housing preference survey that could me mined for data on the economics of transport choices.Lee saw the forests and the trees in a dance as whimsical as his Jazz.
Jim Sweeney, an economist at the Hoover Institution focused on energy:
In the early years of energy analysis -- the 1970s -- Lee became a collector of energy intensity data. Heating fuel per building square meter, building square meters per family, vehicle miles per car, gasoline per vehicle mile. While others were speculating why energy use was high or low somewhere, Lee was collecting data and using that data to quantify energy consumption. He was passionate about data quality, insisting on primary sources when possible. For Lee, collecting data often meant visiting some country, say France, Germany, or Sweden, conversing with knowledgeable people from industry or government, of course in their native language, drinking wine -- preferably good wine -- with his new friends, and coming home with a database of energy indicators, made available to him during his visit. Perhaps a jazz club would be part of the visit, and a good bottle of wine and an available vibraphone could turn Lee into one of the music makers.
Lee turned his attention to transport, keenly aware of transport-related pollution and congestion choking large cities. He proposed and advocated the idea of a bus-rapid transit system for Mexico City and was forever proud that his idea became reality. He was particularly concerned about the seemingly unstoppable growth of motorization in Asian countries and the resulting pollution and congestion. Yet even here he remained optimistic, ending many talks with his photo of a moss-covered car -- a car that would absorb its own carbon dioxide emissions.
Lee was non-stop personal energy, jumping from one idea to another in rapid sentences. He could tire almost anyone's mind while intellectually stimulating them. At Stanford this energy motivated a sequence of students to write transportation papers with Lee, many that found their way into journals or conference proceedings. He left as a legacy many students who are going on to be professionals in the transportation policy area.
John P. Holdren, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, sent a mix of notes about Schipper's professional contributions and his character. I'll post them as a standalone document. Here's an excerpt: 
In the aftermath of the Arab-OPEC oil embargo in 1973-74, there was a lot of interest in energy in this country. One reflection of this was a TV ad campaign put on in California by Atlantic Richfield (then a major oil company, for the younger readers!), in which viewers who had "a better idea about energy" were invited to send it in, and the winning ideas would be featured in these TV spots. One of these showed a father and a son sitting beside Lake Tahoe, almost 200 miles from the Bay Area, talking about the high-speed train that allowed the father to commute to a job in San Francisco while living at the lake. Lee was so offended by this that he sent in his own "better idea", which would really save energy: "Let's all live five hundred miles from work and call in sick every day!"
Charles Komanoff, a consultant on energy and transportation issues:
After three-and-a-half decades of admiring Lee's work, and exchanging hundreds of e-mails on every energy and transportation subject under the sun, I finally had an in-person, one-on-one connection with Lee last September, when he put me up at his house in Berkeley during a trip to the Bay Area. This was before Lee's illness, and he was in great form. Before my visit was through, we had bonded over the central imperative of "pricing" the "external costs" of carbon emissions, urban driving, etc.; bemoaned the state of U.S. governance and public policy; enjoyed a strenuous bike ride into the Berkeley hills; and jammed on Miles Davis's "In A Silent Way" (Lee on vibraphone, his friend and student George Ban-Weiss on string bass, and me on piano somehow keeping up with these world-class musicians). The connections were so strong -- it was almost like meeting a long-lost twin (we were born the same year, 1947), though one with a higher-kilowatt mind. I was looking forward to our brand-new friendship flourishing and growing. Lee's death is a loss for the world and poignant for me personally - finding in him a soul mate after 35 years, only to have him leave so soon.

HEADLINE: Financial Analysts Coming to a Bookstore Near You

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Michael Mayo and Richard X. Bove, two of Wall Street's most outspoken stock analysts, will soon be published authors.

 BODY:
Michael Mayo and Richard X. Bove are two of Wall Street's most outspoken stock analysts. 
They may soon have another title in common: published authors. 
Mr. Bove's tome, which will examine how the actions taken after the financial crisis served to deepen America's economic woes, is still a work in progress. He is playing around with titles, including "The Crisis Created by the Crisis" and "The Day After the Crisis." 
Mr. Mayo's effort -- "Exile on Wall Street: One Analyst's Fight to Save the Big Banks From Themselves" -- is all but done. It's due out in November, in time to capture holiday sales. And John Wiley & Sons, which is publishing the book, makes it sound like a real financial kiss-and-tell. 
"In 'Exile on Wall Street,' star banking analyst Mike Mayo reveals for the first time the details of his ongoing battle with Wall Street firms to come clean and proves that all the factors leading to the financial crisis (dodgy accounting, the separation of risk from reward, outsized executive pay) are still happening," writes Wiley of the book on its Web site. 
Mr. Mayo, who works at Credit Agricole Securities, is a fixture in financial circles. Wiley's book blurb boasts that the tough-talking analyst got fired from Credit Suisse and was barred from talking to the media at Deutsche Bank. Mr. Mayo is often at odds with bank executives, confronting them on quarterly conference calls. 
"If you ever hear me on a conference call saying, 'Good quarter, guys,' put a fork in me," he once said.
His book, Wiley says, will offer an "analysis of the regulation and fallout stemming from the financial crash and points out the relationships that many supposed outsiders have with the insiders." It will also provide "solutions to Wall Street's messy antics. This includes more capitalism in a system where there simply isn't enough of it."
Mr. Bove of Rochdale Securities said he wanted to focus what had happened since the crisis and how it had "done nothing to alleviate the crisis". Firms, he said, have to hold more capital, have less leverage and are the subjects of a series of rules that have inhibited their ability to generate revenue. All this, he says, will result in higher fees for consumers and will pave the way for more foreign banks like Toronto-Dominion Bank, which has been expanding in the United States in recent years, to enter the market. 
Mr. Bove says he has agreements with a handful of Wall Street executives, who have offered to share with him internal data on this issue. "Right now, my issue is trying to find time to get it done," he said.

HEADLINE: A Sales Tax on Wall Street Transactions

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: A small tax on financial transactions would raise billions and have little impact on investors, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Most of us pay state and local sales taxes on most things we buy, and most casino gambling is subject to state taxes ranging from up to 6.75 percent in Nevada to 55 percent on slot machines in Pennsylvania. 
But speculative purchases of stocks, bonds and other financial instruments in the United States go untaxed but for a tiny fee (less than a half-cent) on stock trades that helps finance the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In Britain, by contrast, a 0.5 percent tax on stock transactions raises about $40 billion a year. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany recently announced plans to introduce a similar tax in the 27 nations of the European Community. 
It is variously called a "transactions tax," a "financial transactions tax," a "security transaction excise tax" or a Tobin tax (after the Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin, who famously argued for its application to foreign exchange purchases in the late 1970s). 
By any name, Wall Street hates it, because it would cut into trading profits. But proponents like Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research assert that it would primarily affect short-term "noise traders" and discourage speculation rather than productive investment.

Less speculation could lead to less volatility in prices, encouraging long-term investors.
Further, a sales tax on Wall Street of 0.5 percent could raise up to $175 billion in tax revenue a year, even if, by discouraging frequent trades, it cuts the total number of transactions in half. 
A small financial transaction tax proposed by Representative Peter DiFazio, Democrat of Oregon, and supported by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, the Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Act (with specific details of a co-sponsored bill still being negotiated) is likely to raise less revenue. 
Plenty of highly respected economists support the basic concept, and plenty disagree. In a recent review of the literature, Neil McCulloch and Grazia Pacillo of the Institute of Development Studies in Britain conclude that it is unlikely to reduce speculation but nonetheless represents a relatively good source of tax revenue. A recent report by Thornton Matheson, published by the International Monetary Fund, expresses negative views.
An engaging summary of the pros and cons can be found in a videotaped debate sponsored by the Center for the Study of Responsive Law on July 8 as part of its "Debating Taboos" series. 
My University of Massachusetts colleague Robert Pollin argues in favor, while James Angel of Georgetown argues against.
Professor Angel insists that short-term traders are not primarily speculators and describes them as a healthy part of the financial ecosystem that might be killed off. Professor Pollin's view, with which I agree, is that short-term trading has increased enormously in recent years, with no positive impacts on economic efficiency. In any case, I don't think a 0.5 percent tax on transactions will cause serious fatalities. 
Professor Angel also points out that a tax on financial transactions will be passed on, at least in part, to all investors, with negative consequences for retirement savings. But all taxes are passed on, at least in part, to consumers. I agree with Professor Pollin when he argues that the effect of a financial transactions tax on most people would be very small compared with other sales taxes. 
Economists point out that sales taxes discourage consumption, which is better than discouraging investments that can pay off in the future. But many consumption decisions that ordinary people make have important consequences for future productivity. 
As Professor Pollin points out, current sales taxes bite those who buy materials to increase energy conservation in their homes or purchase a more fuel-efficient car. 
My own research emphasizes that parental expenditures on children, as well as public spending on health and education, represent a form of investment in human capital. 
Most state and local sales taxes are very regressive, with low-income families paying more as a percentage of their income. A proposed national sales tax, or a value-added tax, would have an even more negative impact on families at the bottom. 
Our current tax policies favor speculative investment in financial instruments over productive investments in human capabilities. This imbalance helps explain why nurses' unions in the United States have been particularly outspoken advocates of a financial transactions tax.
As they put it: "Heal America. Tax Wall Street."

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Watching Armageddon From an Armchair

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: What do you most need to be doing right now?

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Economy: Credit Where Credit Is Due
Kevin Drum says he feels like he's "watching Armageddon from an armchair." President Obama says that a strong recovery begins with small business and plans a speech on the economy for September. Support for the president's economic policies hits a new low. A.I.G.'s chief sees a 'core of strength' in the economy. Rural businesses are doubtful of the latest government plan. Fitch, another credit bureau, disagrees with Standard & Poor's and reaffirms America's AAA credit rating. Starbucks' chief tells politiciansto stop fighting and start creating jobs. Amid skepticism, the newly formed debt panel is pressed for a deal and is told by a business group to revamp taxes and cut Medicare. Politicians and investors often rely on incomplete economic data. Meanwhile, Robert Reich offers an alternative (and funny!) explanation for the credit downgrade.
The Data: Leading Indicators Are Up?
The market ends down 4 percent.Dell cutsits forecast. Wal-Mart reports higher profits and weaker sales. Jobless claims go up. Bank of America plans to lay off3,500. TLC lays off Kate Gosselin. Gallup reports a risein unemployment. The A.I.A. architecture billings index drops yet again. Housing starts fall 1.5 percent. Existing home sales are down in July but up sharply from a year ago. Builder confidence holds steady and the homeremodeling index hits a record high. United States industrial production resumes its growth but Fed surveys in both the Empire State and Philadelphia show significant contraction. Core inflation rises the most in six months and construction material prices have risen 8.9 percent this past year, but Paul Krugman says inflation fears are receding. Leading indicators are up, and oil falls to $81 a barrel.
Taxes: Warren Buffett Wants to Pay More
Warren Buffett wants to raise taxes on the rich, and President Obama agrees. Harvard's Jeffrey Miron disagrees: "The way to promote a hard-working, entrepreneurial and innovative society is to celebrate great wealth so long as it has been earned by legitimate means. When this is not the case, policy should target the wrongdoing directly, not demonize everyone who hits it big." A tax expert says Mr. Buffett misses the facts: "Mr. Buffett chose to leave most of his fortune to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and, thus, avoided an estate tax that could potentially give 55 percent of his wealth to Uncle Sam."
Starting Up: Winter May Be Coming for Tech Start-Ups
According to the Angry Bear, new data implies that net job creation comes largely from the creation of new establishments and that few of them manage to survive over the long run. A start-up offers employment to locked out N.B.A. players. Seattle's "green" job programs is a bust. If your green start-up is also suffering, here are 10 ways to wind it down. The Kaufmann Foundation's Jonathan Ortmans has an update on Startup America. One entrepreneur believes that anybody can build a consumer start-up, but selling to enterprises "separates the men from the boys." And tech start-ups be warned: some think winter is coming.
Red Tape Update: Hide Your Accounting Software
Republicans focus their anti-regulatory attacks on the Environmental Protection Agency. Many of us should pay attention to upcoming patent reforms. Lobbying is a booming business in Florida. Independent contractor rules continue to be narrowed. An accountant warns that the I.R.S. may be after our accounting software. Cyndia Zwahlen says that "small-business owners who work at home might not have to worry about a commute, but figuring out their taxes could make the 405 Freeway at rush hour seem like a piece of cake." Fran Tarkenton talks up small business (he's not a fan of the president).
Marketing: Too Important to Be Left to The Marketing Department?
Major Web sites such as MSN.com and Hulu.com have been tracking people's online activities using "super cookies." Facebook is showing sharp declinesin usage for certain activities, and an analyst thinks both Facebook and Groupon are in trouble. Time lists its 50 best Web sitesof 2011. A former "Nightline" producer shares his 10 commandments of media outreach. Isabelle Mercier Turcotte lists 13 ways to respond to the complaint, "it costs too much." A blogger shares 20 marketing quotesthat inspire him, including one from David Packard: "Marketing is too important to be left to the marketing department." A marketing engineer explains how some manufacturers are using social media effectively. Here are seven ways you can strengthen your customer relationships. Or better yet, just try to be more like Morton's Steakhouse.
Management: It Pays to be Mean
Abercrombie & Fitch offers to pay the Situation NOT to wear its clothes. Almost one in two small-business owners have experienced late client payments in the past 12 months, according to a new report, with a quarter facing serious cash flow shortages as a result. Amy Levin Epstein shares tips on how small-business owners can get paid on time, every time. James Gardner shares 10 epic idea management fails. A survey finds that 72 percent of small-business owners who go away on holiday are unable to leave work behind. Hilton welcomes the Chinese. The Chinese are not very welcoming to the Georgetown Hoyas. But they do seem interestedin our technology. Nick Morgan's podcast explains how to be a passionate communicator. Michael Hess offers foolproof diet and exercise tips - for businesses. A study finds that mean people earn more.
Contests: America's Favorite Small Business
Check maker Deluxe Corporation begins a yearlong marketing lab that gives small-business owners tools and resources. Dell, MasterCard and Microsoft are offering $75,000 to America's favorite small business.
Opportunities: It's All Science
Cars are expected to surpass laptops as the largest lithium battery market. A company reports that tomorrow's pacemakers could be powered by light. Beth Goodbaum writes about a handful of recent developments in materials science that have significant business potential. A new preservative could extend shelf life for five years. Are these the most honest people in the world?
Finance: Opening Up the Spigots (a Little)
A soon-to-expire government initiative aimed at spurring small-business lending has barely gotten off the ground. Here's where you should never, ever use a business credit card. Capital One issues a new cash-back card for small business. An angel investor network debuts in Minnesota.

HEADLINE: Rick Perry's Scientific Campaign Method

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A conversation with the author Sasha Issenberg about how the Texas governor's campaigns have been shaped by rigorous social science testing.

 BODY:
Sasha Issenberg, a former Boston Globe reporter who has also written for Monocle, Slate, Philadelphia and The New York Times Magazine, has been writing a book about the new science of campaigns, called "The Victory Lab." It's scheduled for publication next year.
But given the interest in Rick Perry, the Texas governor and new Republican presidential candidate, the portion of "The Victory Lab" about Mr. Perry will be published on Tuesday as an electronic book, "Rick Perry and his Eggheads: Inside the Brainiest Political Operation in America." Mr. Issenberg is previously the author of "The Sushi Economy." An e-mail exchange between Mr. Issenberg and me - slightly condensed - follows:
Mr. Issenberg: No candidate has ever presided over a political operation so skeptical about the effectiveness of basic campaign tools and so committed to using social-science methods to rigorously test them.
As the 2006 election season approached, the governor's top strategist, Dave Carney, invited four political scientists into Perry's war room and asked them to impose experimental controls on any aspect of the campaign budget that they could randomize and measure. Over the course of that year, the eggheads, as they were known within the campaign, ran experiments testing the effectiveness of all the things that political consultants do reflexively and we take for granted: candidate appearances, TV ads, robocalls, direct mail. These were basically the political world's version of randomized drug trials, which had been used by academics but never from within a large-scale partisan campaign.
The findings from those 2006 tests dramatically changed how Carney prioritized the candidate's time and the campaign's money when Perry sought reelection again in 2010 and will inform the way he runs for president now.
Mr. Issenberg: The eggheads controlled Perry's schedule for three days and randomly assigned his travel across Texas. During that time, they conducted a massive volume of polling calls - large enough to discern significant movement in each city - and tracked contributions and volunteer activity. They found that Perry's presence in a city had an impact: his approval ratings went up, and contributions and volunteer signups increased after he did a public event.
Because they had randomized the schedule, the eggheads were able with confidence to attribute the changes to Perry's presence. It wasn't a novel conclusion - candidates have been doing whistle-stop tours and rallies and visits to businesses forever under the impression that they would be helped locally - but no one ever had the tools to isolate the effect of the visit on these different variables.
Mr. Issenberg: Carney became convinced that the highest-value use of Perry's time as a campaigner was to do public events around the state. (An hour of a candidate's time, it turns out, is the one thing that campaigns have always been able to accurately price: it's roughly equal to the amount of money he or she could take in if the time were spent making fund-raising calls.) In Texas, as is the case in many large states, there had been an entirely sensible tradition of placing a candidate like Perry in an Austin satellite studio and having him do quick two-way interviews with television affiliates; the idea was that in an afternoon he could get on the local news in most of the state's 20 media markets without wasting any time on travel.
But as part of the 2006 experiments randomizing Perry's itinerary, the eggheads did a content analysis of media coverage in the markets as he traveled, and found that his presence had an impact. Perry just got much better press when he was in Lubbock or Beaumont than when newspapers and TV stations there relied on stories out of Austin, which tended to be much more cynical or negative. As a result, Carney came to appreciate that such an afternoon might be more effectively spent by having Perry fly to just one of the markets and appear personally there.
By 2010, the campaign operated under the principle that having Perry set foot in a coffee shop or BBQ restaurant - even if there was only a small crowd to witness it in person - was the best media strategy available.

Mr. Issenberg: I've been doing a bit of reporting on the ways Obama's 2008 campaign used data for other parts of my book, "The Victory Lab." Like Carney, Plouffe is a ruthless empiricist who helped instill an analytical culture that pervaded the Obama organization. Everything that could be measured was measured, and data was used to judge the relative effectiveness of campaign techniques, both old and new.
The big difference was in methodology. As best I can tell, the Obama campaign never used randomized trials to test its operations offline. (Basic experiments, comparing e-mail subject lines or Web-page layouts, are a staple of the online world.) That reflects the fact that most of the people doing analytics within the Obama campaign, unlike the eggheads, didn't come out of the academic social sciences, where after 2000 randomized field experiments became an increasingly popular tool for measuring basic political communication techniques. The great use of randomized trials - as in medicine or agriculture or development policy - is that they can not only find relationships between sets of data, but can explain causality. So there's a different level of authority in some of the Perry findings than anything that came out of Obama's headquarters, which helps to explain why Perry already leads Obama in at least one head-to-head metric: the number of scholarly papers published based on campaign research.
Mr. Issenberg: Those are probably reasonable odds, as the fundamental structure of the race looks to be in Perry's favor at the moment. He's basically built for this primary, this year. He is ideologically in sync with the Republican energies of the moment, has the country's best claim to successful economic stewardship and a long record of governing and winning elections that can convince primary voters he would be a credible nominee to challenge Obama.
The difficult part, of course, is accounting for the serendipity of campaigns. Does he perform well in debates and interviews? What comes out about his record that we didn't know before? One of the real challenges Carney faced in trying to learn from the eggheads' projects is how much you can universalize from a single experiment. Were the effects they measured specific to the 2006 campaign, with its peculiar dynamics? In another year, with different opponents and a different environment - let alone running for national office - do the effects still apply? That's what we'll soon find out: does a Rick Perry campaign stop have the same positive effect on public opinion in Ottumwa and Ossipee that it did when the eggheads measured it in Odessa?

HEADLINE: Romney's Home Rebuilding Plan Draws Attention

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The news that Mitt Romney is planning to quadruple the size of his $12 million oceanfront property in San Diego came at a particularly awkward time for the former Massachusetts governor.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has never claimed to be a middle-class man of the people.
But the news that he is planning to quadruple the size of his $12 million oceanfront property in the La Jolla section of San Diego, first reported by The San Diego Union-Tribune on Saturday evening, came at a particularly awkward time. Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, had spent much of the previous week on the campaign trail criticizing President Obama for vacationing in Martha's Vineyard when many Americans are still out of work.
The Union-Tribune's Christopher Cadelago reported that Mr. Romney, who was expected to attend several fund-raisers in San Diego this weekend, recently filed an application to bulldoze his 3,009-square-foot, three-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom home and replace it with an 11,062-square-foot, two-story residence. The current single-story house sits at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac and overlooks a white sand beach. A date to consider the project has not yet been set.
A campaign official confirmed the report, noting, "Construction will not begin until the permits have been obtained and the campaign is finished." The official also explained that the large renovation is family-motivated.
"They want to enlarge their two-bedroom home because with five married sons and 16 grandchildren, it is inadequate for their needs," the official explained. 
And while Mr. Romney has been critical of the president's 10-day Vineyard vacation, Mr. Romney himself will actually overlap with Mr. Obama this Saturday, when he heads to Martha's Vineyard to host a $2,500-per-person fund-raiser there.
The Romney campaign pointed out that it is not unusual to see Mr. Romney in Massachusetts, and that he is simply fund-raising and then leaving, not vacationing.
"The president has responsibility for the economy and should be engaged full time with the issue of putting people back to work," a Romney official said.
Mr. Romney is not the first presidential candidate to encounter trouble when it comes to lavish abodes. In the 2008 campaign, Senator John McCain of Arizona stumbled when asked about the number of homes he and his wife, Cindy, owned. (The answer was at least eight.) And John Edwards, a candidate for the Democratic nomination who had fashioned himself a defender of the working class hoping to eradicate poverty, was mocked and criticized after The Carolina Journal reported that he had plans to move into a 28,200-square-foot mansion in North Carolina that was valued at more than $6 million.
For the record, the Romneys own three homes - in addition to the La Jolla house, he and his wife keep a vacation home near the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire (the whole family retired there earlier this month), as well as a town house outside Boston.

HEADLINE: Milken's Gift Stirs Dispute at U.C.L.A. Law School

BYLINE: JULIE CRESWELL and PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: With education dollars under pressure, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, contends that a $10 million gift from Lowell Milken poses ethical problems.

 BODY:
When the U.C.L.A. School of Law announced a $10 million gift from Lowell Milken to establish a business law institute in his name earlier this month, the university described him as a "pioneer in education reform" and a "leading philanthropist."
Behind the scenes, Mr. Milken's big donation has set off an internal debate at the school. While many faculty members welcomed the money, one of the University of California, Los Angeles's top business law professors has said the gift poses deep ethical problems and reputational risks, given Mr. Milken's run-in with securities regulators two decades ago.
"The creation of a Lowell Milken Institute for Business Law and Policy will damage my personal and professional reputation, as I have devoted my career to arguing for investor protection and honest and ethical behavior in business," Lynn A. Stout wrote in a letter last month to the president of the University of California and U.C.L.A.'s chancellor.
Ms. Stout, a specialist in corporate governance and moral behavior, said in an interview last week, "I think it's somewhat distressing that so few people seem to be aware of Lowell and Michael Milken's business history."
The Milken name is still a lightning rod on Wall Street and in legal circles. Michael Milken and his younger brother, Lowell, were central figures in creating the booming junk-bond market of the 1980s and the subsequent collapse of the investment bank where they worked, Drexel Burnham Lambert.
In a controversial deal with the government, Michael pleaded guilty to securities law violations after the government agreed to drop criminal charges against Lowell. Michael served a 22-month prison term and paid $600 million in fines and restitution.
As part of a settlement in a related civil matter, the Securities and Exchange Commission permanently barred the two brothers from the securities industry.
Lowell Milken did not admit to any wrongdoing.
Kenneth W. Graham Jr., a retired U.C.L.A. law professor, said it was a mistake to take the gift from Mr. Milken, a 1973 graduate of the school and longtime donor to it. "To say that I was outraged would be something of an understatement," wrote Mr. Graham in an e-mail.
But other U.C.L.A. law professors disagree with the objections and are thrilled with Mr. Milken's largess. Since their legal woes, the Milken brothers have become prominent philanthropists, donating hundreds of millions of dollars to a variety of causes, most notably in the areas of medical research and education.
"Save for one dissident professor, the entire business law faculty is grateful for this gift," Kenneth N. Klee, a bankruptcy law scholar, said.
The current debate surrounding Lowell Milken's gift highlights the quandary that public universities across the country face as the fiscal woes of states have forced them to look increasingly to private corporations and wealthy alumni for financial support. Law schools are typically among a state school's most profitable graduate programs.
"We're staring down the barrel of another round of cuts in California and relying on alumni giving is essential for us to be able to provide a quality education," said Stephen Bainbridge, a U.C.L.A. corporate law professor. "If it wasn't for these sorts of gifts we'd have even tighter budgetary constraints."
When asked to respond to complaints about Mr. Milken's gift, Bonnie Somers, a spokeswoman for the Milken Family Foundation, issued a written statement.
"Basic fairness requires that individuals be evaluated solely on the basis of their own conduct and Lowell Milken's life of accomplishment and service speaks for itself," her statement said. She added that the foundation respected the fact that U.C.L.A. "understands that in the United States of America, its citizens are presumed innocent until proven otherwise."
Lauri Gavel, a law school spokeswoman, also issued a written statement: "Only one member of the business law faculty has expressed anything less than gratitude - and that concern was surprising, given that this professor was involved early in the process, has been a beneficiary of the donor's philanthropy, and did not raise objections until quite recently."
This is not the first time a Milken has generated controversy at U.C.L.A. In 1994, the university severed its ties with an education company controlled by Michael R. Milken that planned to sell videotapes of a lecture series he gave at the school. The company agreed to remove any identification of U.C.L.A. from the tapes after the school said it received many complaints from state officials who did not want the university's name associated with Mr. Milken.
While Lowell Milken's gift was the capstone of the law school's $100 million fund-raising campaign, several other benefactors made donations and in return had buildings, conference rooms, professorships and scholarship funds named in their honor.
Mr. Milken is not the only leading donor in the current campaign that has tussled with regulatory authorities. The capital drive also led to the creation of the Stewart and Lynda Resnick Endowed Fund in Support of Public Interest Law. The Resnicks are the Beverly Hills beverage industry entrepreneurs who own Fiji Water and Pom Wonderful.
Last fall, the Federal Trade Commission filed a civil lawsuit against the Resnicks, accusing them and their company, Pom Wonderful, of making "false and unsubstantiated claims" that their pomegranate juice product helped reduce the risk of heart disease and erectile dysfunction.
Jill Gottesman, a spokeswoman for Pom Wonderful and the Resnicks, which are fighting the charges, has called the government's allegations "completely unwarranted."
Law professors unaffiliated with U.C.L.A. say that even though the economic environment makes it challenging for public schools to finance vital programs, they need to consider the potential risks in accepting private money. Thane Rosenbaum, a law professor at Fordham University, said that U.C.L.A.'s gifts from Mr. Milken and the Resnicks reflect a kind of "academic cynicism."
"Here is a major law school, with state funding in California deteriorating, now taking its money from people engaged in questionable behavior," said Mr. Rosenbaum. "It's unbecoming to a great university."
Other schools have in the past refused money, or taken other actions, when their benefactors have become involved in corporate wrongdoing. In the 1980s, Princeton returned money from Ivan Boesky to build a Jewish Center after the government charged the Wall Street financier with insider trading crimes. Seton Hall removed the name of L. Dennis Kozlowski from an academic building in 2005, after the conviction of the former Tyco chief executive for looting his company.
Inside the halls of U.C.L.A., the protests of Ms. Stout, a tenured professor whose most recent book is "Cultivating Conscience: How Good Laws Make Good People," has caused consternation among her colleagues.
Mr. Bainbridge, the corporate law professor, said that though he considered Ms. Stout a friend, he disagreed with her position.
"I believe that Lynn genuinely thinks that this hurts the school by giving Milken the U.C.L.A. imprimatur of being a good guy and an ethical person," said Mr. Bainbridge.
"I think it's unfortunate that we're dragging up stuff that happened a quarter of a century ago - and for which any debt to society has long been paid - to taint something that is going to help our students tremendously."
