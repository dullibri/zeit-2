 BODY:
PEDALING REVOLUTION
 How Cyclists Are Changing American Cities
 By Jeff Mapes
 228 pp. Oregon State University Press. Paper, $19.95
 Full disclosure: I've ridden a bike around New York as my principal means of transport for 30 years, so I'm inclined to sympathize with the idea that a cycling revolution is upon us, and that it's a good thing. Like Jeff Mapes, the author of ''Pedaling Revolution: How Cyclists Are Changing American Cities,'' I've watched the streets fill over the years with more and varied bike riders. It's no longer just me, some food delivery guys and a posse of reckless messengers. Far from it. 
 That said, the revolution isn't here just yet. Hedge fund managers and General Motors executives aren't riding to work (though don't laugh, they will), and this book is not likely to reach beyond the already converted, which includes me, other cycling advocates, and people in the city-planning and transportation universe. But the book is useful -- for those of us who occasionally find ourselves on the defensive, Mapes provides names, dates, facts and figures. He details how cities from Amsterdam to Paris to New York to Davis, Calif., have developed policies encouraging cycling in recent decades, and how other towns are just beginning to make way for bikes. He lays out in an easily digestible way a fair amount of material on trip patterns, traffic safety and air pollution. He quotes the relevant studies and shows how those studies have been either heeded or ignored. All this information is great ammunition for those of us who would like to see American cities become more bike-friendly but may be a tough sell for the people on the fence -- the ones who've taken the occasional Sunday ride along a riverfront greenway or in a park, or have a vague feeling that they might possibly bike to work somehow someday. 
 ''Pedaling Revolution'' is not all facts and figures. Mapes, a journalist who covers politics for The Oregonian, describes how he gained weight and started feeling a bit down when he was forced to exchange his 10-mile daily bike commute in Portland for a ''super-sized, 50-mile'' drive to the Legislature in Salem. He argues that cycling promotion can raise society's level of general fitness, since people exercise more when it seems less like exercise and more like something mostly enjoyable that also performs a function, like getting to work. ''Bike and walking advocates,'' he writes, ''have been rebranding their cause as 'active transportation,' which manages to come off as nonthreatening to your average couch-bound American while carrying a nice touch of gravitas as well.''
 Mapes finds the experience of riding around Portland -- North America's most bike-friendly city (though I think Vancouver is close) -- so enjoyable that he takes as a given that it's a positive thing, something that more communities should accommodate without question. But as he and I know, there's a lot of opposition. The United States is as much a car culture as ever, even if the companies that helped make us that way are now in ruins. And governments and urban planners have all been in on the game, helping make the idea of cheap, effortless transportation and a car of one's own a dream every American might aspire to. 
 ''Pedaling Revolution'' is not about mountain biking the Moab sandstone formations in Utah or the network of bucolic paths that link some of the rural Massachusetts colleges; it's not about racing, Lance Armstrong or what kind of spandex to buy. Nor is it about the various forms of extreme biking that have arisen lately: bike jousting on specially made high-horse bikes, BMX tricks or the arcane world of fixed-gear bikes, or fixies. For decades, Americans have too often seen cycling as a kind of macho extreme sport, which has actually done a lot to damage the cause of winning acceptance for biking as a legitimate form of transportation. If your association with bikes is guys in spandex narrowly missing you on the weekends or YouTube videos of kids flying over ramps on their clown-size bikes, you're likely to think that bikes are for only the athletic and the risk-prone. Manufacturers in the United States have tended to make bikes that look like the two-wheeled equivalent of Hummers, with fat tires and stocky frames necessitating a hunched-over riding position that is downright unsafe for urban biking and commuting. But that's been changing for at least a few years now. Whew.
 As Mapes points out, when more women begin riding, that will signal a big change in attitude, which will prompt further changes in the direction of safety and elegance. I can ride till my legs are sore and it won't make riding any cooler, but when attractive women are seen sitting upright going about their city business on bikes day and night, the crowds will surely follow. A recent article in a British newspaper showed the pop singer Duffy on a pink bike. The model Agyness Deyn claims never to be without hers, and Courteney Cox reportedly presented Jennifer Aniston with a Chanel bike last year. Tabloid fodder does not a revolution make, but it's a start.
 Toward the end of the book, Mapes gets into debates over bike lanes (are they really safer?), safety rules (should cyclists have to obey stop signs?) and traffic ideologies (should cyclists claim a full space in a lane, or stick to the edge of the road?) that only an obsessive or an advocate (hello!) is likely to be interested in. But the debates he presents may end up helping us all. Greenways, safer bike lanes, pedestrian zones and bike parking places will make our cities not only more comfortable and enjoyable, but also, as Janette Sadik-Khan, the New York City transportation commissioner, said recently, more economically competitive as well, as more of them become places where people with ideas and creative ambitions want to both live and work.

HEADLINE: Are Women Less Happy or Simply More Honest?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Liberated and Unhappy,'' by Ross Douthat (column, New York Times on the Web, May 26):
 In their economics paper on the decline of women's happiness, Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers write in their discussion, ''Women may now feel more comfortable being honest about their true happiness and have thus deflated their previously inflated responses'' about their happiness. 
 They conclude that subjective measures of happiness may no longer reflect improved objective measures of happiness (as exemplified by declining suicide rates among women), and that the problem may be in the measures that psychologists and economists use to measure happiness -- not, as Mr. Douthat writes, in women's lives.
 Perhaps women now have the freedom to say what they actually feel. Few would argue that it would be worth reversing that.
 Michael J. Ostacher Cambridge, Mass., May 26, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Ross Douthat calls for ''some kind of social stigma'' to discourage single motherhood. Some bones to pick:
 The idea of a social stigma in any form in a liberal democracy is retrograde and repugnant. To lay that on single mothers, who are most in need of our support, and whose condition may be no fault of their own, is cruel and irrational.
 The proposed stigma against single mothers must not be about their having sex out of wedlock; it must be about their failure to use protection. And yet, in many if not most elementary and high schools in America, sex education is off the table. Even if a woman wants to use protection, it is often, if not primarily, the man who refuses, in which case the stigma's object is misplaced.
 I would be fascinated to know how the new social stigma -- not rooted in the old sexism -- that Mr. Douthat alluded to would work. If a single mother said, ''Good day,'' would you ignore her? If she applied for a job, should a mother who is married or at least part of a (heterosexual) couple be given preference? Should President Obama denounce single mothers?

HEADLINE: Same Cash, Different Package

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
HYUNDAI has been good at generating marketing buzz during the economic downturn, and now the company is at it again.
 In January, it announced the Hyundai Assurance program, which allows consumers to return their new cars without hurting their credit if they lose their jobs. Then there was Assurance Plus, a one-time payment to the lender that is equal to 90 days of a loan or lease payment. Now a new commercial tells consumers that if they buy a vehicle between now and June 30, Hyundai will send them money for six months. 
 What the commercial doesn't say is that the company isn't offering new money, but simply repackaging existing customer rebates. 
 You have to go to the consumer Web site (hyundaiusa.com) to learn that, under the Hyundai Assurance program, you can either get the six months of payments or use existing rebates to reduce the purchase price of a vehicle. 
 The Web site shows payments to customers that range from $166 a month on a 2009 Tucson (instead of a $1,000 price reduction) to $650 for a 2008 Veracruz (in place of a $4,000 price reduction).
 Hyundai said that it was trying to clear out its inventory and that the offer applied to all vehicles that had cash-back rebates. 
 When the $650 in six monthly payments for the Veracruz added up to $3,900, $100 short of the $4,000 cash reduction, I asked a Hyundai spokesman why a consumer making that choice wasn't getting the full rebate. He replied in an e-mail message that the customers would actually receive the full amount of $666.67 a month and that Hyundai advertised $650 only because of the negative connotation associated with the number 666.
 Hyundai said there was no economic benefit to the company if a consumer chose one option or the other, and there were no income tax consequences for those who took the six-month payments. 
 Hyundai said it was simply offering consumers another way to finance a vehicle and more flexibility in managing their finances. 
 If consumers elect the six months of payments, they get Visa cards that can be used like debit cards. Hyundai applies the appropriate amount each month. Hyundai said there were no fees from Hyundai, but a retailer could charge a fee for use of the debit card.
 Payments continue through the end of the year. Hyundai Assurance is valid on any new, leased or financed vehicle for 12 months from the purchase date. The program covers up to $7,500 in negative equity, which is the difference between what a consumer still owes on a vehicle after two payments and what it is worth after depreciation when it is turned in.

Promoting Trouble
 In the economics of baseball, one of the most common themes is control. For the first six years of a player's career, the team that brought him up controls his rights. But after a player's third year of service, he gains back some of the control in the form of arbitration, where he can request a much higher salary and his team must make a counteroffer. 
 It is a process in which salaries go from near-minimum levels to well into the millions of dollars. Ryan Howard, Philadelphia's first baseman, made $900,000 in 2007 but was awarded $10 million in arbitration for the 2008 season.
 One of arbitration's quirks will go on display in the next few days as some of baseball's top prospects, like Baltimore catcher Matt Wieters, are summoned to the majors in an attempt to get nearly a year of baseball out of them without starting their arbitration clock.
 Known as Super Two players, the rules say that if a player, like Howard in 2008, has at least 2 years 86 days of service time after his third season, he will be eligible for arbitration if his service time ranks in the top 17 percent of all the players in his class. Teams try to exploit this rule by planning the promotion of their prospects to fall within the window in which they will not qualify, thus gaining the so-called free year.
 The cutoff date actually varies, with it ranging as high as 2 years 140 days of service time. A team that later realizes it gambled poorly by calling up a player too early can choose to option the player to the minors.
 Other than Wieters, who got his first two major league hits Saturday night, two potential impact players who may soon get the call are infielder Sean Rodriguez of the Los Angeles Angels and starting pitcher Tommy Hanson of the Atlanta Braves. BENJAMIN HOFFMAN
 Who's Lumbering Now?
 The A.L. has been viewed as the league of the lumbering designated hitter, while the N.L. was the realm of the double-switch and small ball. But in terms of stolen bases, the conventional wisdom is not holding true.
 The A.L. is outpacing the N.L. this season in steals, and was on pace for a per-team average of 122 through Thursday. The N.L. was on pace for an average of 97. Since 2000, the largest gap between the leagues was in 2001, when the A.L. averaged 118 and the N.L. averaged 91. In most seasons, the gap between the leagues is only a few steals. 
 If the A.L. maintains its lead, it would be the sixth time in the last 10 seasons it has triumphed.
 Much of the difference can be accounted for by the high success rate in the A.L. (75 percent through Thursday, which was the highest of either league since 2000) and the aggressiveness of the Tampa Bay Rays, who had stolen 82 bases. That was 22 bases more than the second-place Angels, and 33 more than the N.L.-leading Mets. 
 Not helping matters for the N.L., the Brewers, with 11 stolen bases, and the Braves, 10, had by far the lowest team totals. Their combined total trailed the Rays' Carl Crawford, who had 30. BENJAMIN HOFFMAN

HEADLINE: Precision Taps, Off-Center Orchestration

BYLINE: By SYLVIANE GOLD

 BODY:
With its Victorian turrets looming grandly over the trees along the wide Connecticut River, the Goodspeed Opera House couldn't be more removed from the hurly-burly of Times Square. But step inside the door, and the blaring squawk emanating from the orchestra pit and the rat-a-tap-taps pounding the stage will carry you straight to ''that glittering gulch'' where tough-guy directors drill fresh-faced chorines and the underworld meets the elite.
 Yup, those dancing feet are back on ''42nd Street,'' along with Peggy Sawyer from Allentown, Julian Marsh from Broadway and Dorothy Brock from 
 Divaland, all trying to put on a happy-go-lucky show in the midst of bread lines, unemployment and crashed stocks.
 It's possible that Goodspeed's management chose to bring back this musical paean to the cliches of musicals because its story of pluck and luck among the chorus kids of Depression-era Broadway would resonate in our post-boom economy. Or maybe the decision had to do with the fact that in our post-boom economy, a surefire ticket-seller would be, well, sure to sell tickets. Whatever the intention, ''42nd Street'' has already justified Goodspeed's reasoning: the show has proven so popular that its run was extended by a week.
 But the fact of the matter is that ''42nd Street'' is about the Depression in the same way that ''The Sound of Music'' is about World War II. What makes it a hit in 2009 is exactly what made it a hit in 1980, in its original Broadway incarnation; in 2001, in the Broadway revival; and in the many other productions around Connecticut and around the world. There is, quite simply, something irresistible in the sight and sound of dozens of taps striking the floor in unison. (Just ask the producers of ''Riverdance.'')
 With 14 pairs of tap shoes in the ensemble and several more among the principals, Rick Conant has been able to fill the small Goodspeed stage to bursting with the precision choreography this show demands. And he has paid attention not just to the feet but to the arms and heads of the dancers as well, giving the dance routines an elegant snap that eludes less careful workmanship. The director, Ray Roderick, keeps the intervals between the dance numbers moving briskly, and that's all it really takes to send audiences home happy from ''42nd Street.''
 It's not as if anyone expects to be involved with the characters or moved by the plot -- these were already throwaways in 1933, when Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell starred in the movie on which the show is based. Julian Marsh may be a genius director down on his luck, but he's also an unrepentant heel who puts his show, ''Pretty Lady,'' above all else. How much can you admire a hero who says of the performer he is mercilessly coaching, ''By tomorrow night I'll either have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl''?
 Said performer, Peggy Sawyer, has come to New York City from Pennsylvania with 40 cents, which even in 1933 would not have gotten her very far. And Dorothy Brock, the spoiled, has-been star of ''Pretty Lady,'' is not just capricious but downright out of her mind. (And that's probably the reason she has agreed to star in the show in the first place: the excerpts that provide ''42nd Street'' with many of its retro musical numbers never make a lick of sense.)
 So it helps when the cast can win over the audience with charm. Mr. Roderick is only partly successful on this score. The show is fine when James Lloyd Reynolds and Kristen Martin are on the scene. He gives Julian Marsh a knowing bluster, and her Peggy Sawyer brims with toothy eagerness to please. But Laurie Wells does not seem to be having any fun as Dorothy Brock and Austin Miller seems to be having too much as Billy Lawler, the tenor who befriends Peggy and gives her career a push.
 The supporting performers fare better. Dorothy Stanley, as one of the been-around-the-block authors of ''Pretty Lady,'' has the easy sass that allows her to deliver a line like, ''You're a looker, you chirp like a bird, and you're pretty hot stuff in the steps department too,'' without sounding utterly ridiculous. Playing her writing partner, Dale Hensley exudes a kindly gruffness that nicely fills out the flatness of the character. Similarly, Erick Devine's big, genial personality adds some heft and color to the underwritten role of the moneybags underwriting ''Pretty Lady.''
 But the real stars of this ''42nd Street'' are not the spiffy dance numbers or the hardworking ensemble in their smart, ice-cream-colored costumes (by David H. Lawrence). The standouts in the production turn out to be the honking, bluesy orchestrations of Dan DeLange.
 His credits say he conducted a touring company of ''Chicago,'' and you can hear the jaunty, vaudeville-flavored timbre of that show in his almost dissonant treatment of the Harry Warren tunes (with lyrics by Al Dubin) anthologized in ''42nd Street.'' The bent notes and off-center arrangements lend an element of surprise to familiar standards like ''We're in the Money,'' ''Lullaby of Broadway'' and, of course, the title song. Come on along and listen.
 ''42nd Street,'' by Michael Stewart and Mark Bramble, with songs by Harry Warren and Al Dubin, is at Goodspeed Opera House, Route 82, East Haddam, through July 4. Information at (860) 873-8668 or goodspeed.org.

HEADLINE: Back to Nature, in Pictures and Action

BYLINE: By JORI FINKEL

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 SEBASTIAO SALGADO sounds as if he's slightly allergic to Los Angeles. It's not just that this celebrated Brazilian photojournalist has been sniffling since he arrived in the city, explaining: ''I was born in a tropical ecosystem. I'm not used to these plants.'' It's also that he peppers his description of the city with words like strange and crazy, noting that he was mesmerized by the sight of the endless stream of automobile traffic as his plane made its descent.
 The urban sprawl of Los Angeles is, in any case, a far cry from the remote, sparsely populated jungle and desert locations where he has been traveling for his epic, ecological work in progress ''Genesis.'' Famous for putting a human face on economic and political oppression in developing countries, Mr. Salgado is photographing the most pristine vestiges of nature he can find: pockets of the planet unspoiled by modern development. He has visited the seminomadic Zo'e tribe in the heart of the Brazilian rain forest and weathered desolate stretches of the Sahara. Next up: two months in the Brooks mountain range of Alaska on the trail of caribous and Dall sheep. 
 But this brand of environmentalism is costly enough to send him back to major cities for support. That's what brought him here for a three-day whirlwind of talks, meetings and parties. One night he gave a slide show featuring new work from ''Genesis'' to a sold-out crowd at the Hammer Museum. The next evening he was a guest of honor at a fund-raiser at the Peter Fetterman gallery in Santa Monica, where some of his new work appears in his show ''Africa,'' through Sept. 30. After that it was off to San Francisco for a benefit dinner given by Marsha Williams before returning to Paris, which he considers home along with Vitoria, Brazil.
 It might sound like a punishing schedule, but the 65-year-old photographer says he doesn't mind and doesn't lose focus on work even when flocked by art collectors and celebrity backers. Sitting down at the Peter Fetterman gallery, with his image of zebras in Namibia hanging overhead, Mr. Salgado compared his time away from nature to the potentially disruptive moment when he has to change the film in his camera, when he likes to close his eyes and sing so as not to lose concentration. 
 ''I came here for special things, but my head is there, my body is there,'' he said with an intent expression and a gentle Portuguese accent. ''I might be sleeping in a hotel room in Los Angeles, but in my mind I am always editing pictures.'' 
 For ''Genesis,'' an eight-year project now more than half completed, he is piecing together a visual story about the effects of modern development on the environment. Yet rather than document the effects of, say, pollution or global warming directly, he is photographing natural subjects that he believes have somehow ''escaped or recovered from'' such changes: landscapes, seascapes, animals and indigenous tribes that represent an earlier, purer -- ''pristine'' is a favorite word -- state of nature. 
 In this way ''Genesis'' is a grand, romantic back-to-nature project, combining elements of both the literary pastoral and the sublime. Mr. Salgado also describes it as a return to childhood, as he was raised on a farm in the Rio Doce Valley of southeastern Brazil -- then about 60 percent rain forest -- that suffered from terrible erosion and deforestation. Years later, in 1998, he and his wife, Lelia, founded the Instituto Terra on 1,500 acres of this land to undertake an ambitious reforestation project. His wife, who also designs his books and exhibitions, is the institute's president; he is vice president and the institute's most famous spokesman. Or, as Ian Parker wrote in The New Yorker, Mr. Salgado is more than a photojournalist, ''much the way Bono is something more than a pop star.''
 In short, while the Instituto Terra is the locally rooted arm of his environmental activism, ''Genesis'' is its globally minded, photo-driven counterpart. Since undertaking the series in 2004, he has visited some 20 different sites across 5 continents.
 He began with a shoot in the Galapagos Islands that paid homage to Darwin's studies there. (Mr. Salgado says his title, ''Genesis,'' is not meant to be religious.) ''Darwin spent 37 to 40 days there,'' he said. ''I got to spend about three months there, which was fabulous.'' He was thrilled to see for himself evidence of natural selection in species like the cormorant, a bird that lost its ability to fly after a history of foraging for food underwater, not by air.
 Last fall he spent two months in Ethiopia, hiking some 500 miles (with 18 pack donkeys and their owners) from Lalibela into Simien National Park to shoot the mountains, indigenous tribes and rare species like a very hairy baboon known as the Gelada. ''I was traveling in this area in the same way people did 3,000 to 5,000 years ago,'' he said.
 Well, almost the same way. He did carry a satellite phone, which made him the point person for receiving news of the United States election in November. ''When we found out that Obama won, everyone driving these donkeys, everyone was jumping up and down,'' he said. He called Mr. Obama's election ''a victory for the planet.'' 
 He is cautiously optimistic about his own environmental work. ''I'm 100 percent sure that alone my photographs would not do anything. But as part of a larger movement, I hope to make a difference,'' he said. ''It isn't true that the planet is lost. We must work hard to preserve it.'' 
 His earlier projects were also driven by a sense of urgency. Before becoming a photographer he did doctoral work in agricultural economics at the University of Paris and served as an economist for the International Coffee Organization in London. You can see this training in the scope and complexity of his photography. 
 ''Workers,'' a seven-year project completed in 1992, featured images of laborers from 26 countries, including his acclaimed pictures of the Serra Pelada miners in Brazil. ''Migrations,'' a six-year project spanning some 40 countries that was completed in 1999, focused on migrants, refuges and other displaced populations that are financially and often physically vulnerable. (Both series became coffee-table books.)
 A Getty Museum curator, Brett Abbott, who is including ''Migrations'' in his 2010 exhibition survey of narrative photojournalism, called this ''epic approach'' one of the Mr. Salgado's hallmarks: ''Of all the photographers I'm looking at, he's probably taken on the biggest conceptual frameworks. He's always looking at global problems.''
 In this way ''Genesis'' represents less of a departure than it might at first seem. Even though he recently switched to a digital camera for large-format printing, his pictures have a consistent sensibility. He still generates contact sheets. He still likes to backlight his subjects, emphasizing -- or romanticizing, his critics say -- their forms. He still works in black and white. And his work still culminates in photo essays that, through a network of smaller stories, reveal something about an entire species. His fundamental subject is social systems, and now ecosystems.
 His longtime gallerist, Peter Fetterman, also sees a strong through line in his career. While initially surprised by the turn to lush landscapes (''When I first saw the contact sheets, I thought maybe I was in the wrong studio, or the Ansel Adams archive''), he called Mr. Salgado's empathy for subjects an overarching trait. ''Other photojournalists go in and out for a day,'' Mr. Fetterman said. ''Sebastiao goes and lives with his subjects for weeks before he even takes a picture.''
 Mr. Salgado also emphasizes the continuities between his various projects. ''There is no difference photographing a pelican or an albatross and photographing a human being,'' he said. ''You must pay attention to them, spend time with them, respect their territory.'' Even landscapes, he said, have their own personality and reward a certain amount of patience. 
 His goal for ''Genesis'' is to produce a total of 32 visual essays, which he hopes to display in major public parks as well as at various museums starting in 2012. ''It's my dream to show the work in Central Park, not in some building but outside among the trees,'' he said. 
 So far financial support from the project has come from gallery sales and reproduction deals with magazines like Paris Match in France and Visao in Portugal. Two Bay Area foundations -- Susie Tompkins Buell's and the Christensen Fund -- have lent support. Eventually, to raise money for printing, he plans to issue a limited edition of 20 platinum photographs, a first for Mr. Salgado, who is known for rather democratically printing as many pictures as there are orders.
 That's just one of the elements that makes ''Genesis'' seem like a legacy project: a veteran photojournalist's carefully planned and well-meaning contribution to his children, grandchildren and the world at large. But he said he did not think it would not be his last. While admitting that he might not attempt another 500-mile hike over the Simien Mountains, he said he had no plans to retire any time soon.
 ''I don't know any photographer who stopped working because he turned 70,'' he said, adding that as a breed they tend to live a long time. He mentioned Henri Cartier-Bresson, who died at the age of 95, and Manuel Alvarez Bravo, who lived until 100. 
 ''I was in Mexico City for Alvarez Bravo's 100th-birthday celebration,'' Mr. Salgado said. ''He was sick, with his feet inside a tub of hot water, but he still had his camera. So he was photographing his feet.''

HEADLINE: Investors See the Market's Clouds Parting

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market rallied again last week and commodity prices surged to their biggest monthly gains since 1974, while Treasury yields bounced up and down. 
 For the month of May, the MSCI World index rose 8.7 percent, its best monthly performance in more than 30 years, according to Bloomberg. The futures price of a barrel of crude oil in New York settled at $66.31 a barrel on Friday, up from $61.67 the previous week, and its highest close since November. 
 These gains appeared to reflect a growing belief, which spilled over into the stock and bond markets, that the global economic downturn was easing. The University of Michigan consumer confidence index rose in May to 68.7, up from 67.9. The yield on 10-year Treasuries closed at 3.46 percent, up from 3.45 percent the previous week, but rose to 3.74 percent on Wednesday, its highest close since November. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 223.01 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 8,500.33. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 32.14 points, or 3.6 percent, to close at 919.14. JEFF SOMMER

LENGTH: 1001 words

HEADLINE: Hello Kitty, Your Car Is Waiting

BYLINE: By EZRA DYER

 BODY:
NORMALLY, I try to tune out the marketing mumbo-jumbo dished out to the press at new-car introductions. That's typically quite easy, since hearing about ''prioritized messaging points'' and ''bi-modal buyer distribution'' is boring whether the subject is an economy car or a Ferrari 430 Scuderia. But in the case of the new 2009 Cube, I think Nissan's marketing strategy for its boxy creation says a lot about the car's mission. 
 In explaining the Cube gestalt, Nissan uses the tagline ''mobile device,'' and the company clearly hopes that this car will gain the social cachet of an Apple product (a point driven home in a Cube PowerPoint presentation showing photos of an iPod, an iPhone and the iTunes logo). 
 The problem with this comparison is that Apple products tend to be sexy and expensive relative to their competition -- they're status symbols -- whereas the Cube is defiantly offbeat and affordable. If you're looking for the automotive iPhone, it's not the Cube. It's the BMW 335i. 
 The Cube is more like a Nintendo Wii: accessible, fun and deeply strange in an authentically Japanese way. Originally introduced in Japan in 1998, this is now the third iteration of the Cube and the first one to find its way to the United States. 
 My view on bringing wacky Japanese-market cars here is that companies should strive to keep the product as un-Americanized as possible. Offer a shrimp-scented air freshener and a holographic hood ornament and a GPS system that includes maps of other planets: the whole appeal lies in cultural authenticity. This kind of car should be so Japanese that it makes me want to wear a Hello Kitty backpack, watch incomprehensible game shows and eat whales. I mean, research whales. 
 The Cube is undiluted Tokyo chic, from its asymmetrical rear window to its shag-carpet dashboard pad to the bungee cords on the doors, which Nissan says are useful for holding ''stuffed driving mascots.'' 
 Speaking of stuffed driving mascots, Nissan is prepared for a couple of those to occupy the front seats, as one of the Cube's available accessories is an eight-inch seat belt extender. I suspect that this option isn't popular in Japan.
 The interior is rife with interesting touches. The headliner is imprinted with a ripple texture that spreads in concentric circles from the dome light. Available LED ambient lighting bathes the footwells and console in the hue of your choice. To the left of the steering wheel, there's a small cup holder that seems so narrow as to be useless. I wondered what would fit in there and then it dawned on me: a slim can of Red Bull. 
 The fact that Nissan sees the Cube as a design statement first, and a car second, comes through in the driving experience. Unlike a Scion xB, which maintains some pretense of performance (plus-size rims and a supercharger are available, for instance), the Cube's hardware is resolutely mellow. You get 15- or 16-inch wheels, a 1.8-liter 122-horsepower 4-cylinder engine and either a continuously variable automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual. 
 There are four Cube trim levels, beginning with the $14,710 Cube 1.8 and culminating with the $20,090 1.8 Krom. The largest standalone option, available on the midlevel models, is the $2,550 ''Ginormous package,'' which includes an exterior aero kit and interior accessories like illuminated door-sill kick plates. 
 If you don't see the point of tacking aerodynamic gear on something named the Cube, then maybe your appetite for accessories is neither gigantic nor enormous enough for the Ginormous package. 
 The 1.8 S model, at $15,410, is the lowest-price Cube available with the automatic transmission. Normally, I'd counsel a manual transmission over the variable automatic, but the C.V.T. seems well-suited to the Cube's persona. If you're driving in a relaxed manner, the C.V.T. matches the mood by keeping the engine speed low and constant, imparting the feeling that the car is propelled by some kind of distant unseen force, rather than by an engine borrowed from the Versa subcompact. The C.V.T.'s ability to make the most of the 1.8-liter motor is reflected in its impressive city fuel economy rating of 28 miles a gallon (30 m.p.g. on the highway). The manual Cube manages 24/29. 
 And the C.V.T.'s consistent disdain for high r.p.m.'s helps to disguise the 4-cylinder's unpleasant, overexerted buzz at high speeds. 
 But then, the Cube isn't about speed. It's about delivering raw Japanese funkiness to people who don't particularly care about cars -- or don't have a full say in the matter, anyway, since their parents are footing the bill. 
 On one hand, you might want your high-school or college-age progeny driving around in a Cube because it's slow, has six air bags and a stability-control system. On the other hand, it also features a ''Jacuzzi lounge'' interior layout. I'm not sure what a Jacuzzi lounge is, but I don't think I approve.
 The Cube is cheerfully bizarre, and I appreciate that. It's not a riot to drive, but in this case, the driving experience is really beside the point. The kids don't care about that noise, pops. They want connectivity. They want a car that's a rolling Tweet about a new iPhone app from the Jonas Brothers. 
 I, however, want a car that doesn't look like a myopic washing machine, but I'm a lame old guy of 31 who remembers listening to CDs and saying things like, ''My modem is taking forever to load this Kozmo.com order.'' 
 Among the subset of weird little boxy Asian runabouts (including the Scion xB, Honda Element and Kia Soul), the Cube is the most outrageous. It's easy to poke fun at some of the Cube's egregious silliness, but I admire a car that takes chances the way the Cube does.
 As with an avant-garde piece of architecture, some people are going to get it and some people aren't. Either way, it forces you to have an opinion, because the Cube is brimming with an attribute not usually abundant in a $15,000 car: personality.
 INSIDE TRACK: Adventurous design for modest money.

LENGTH: 504 words

HEADLINE: No Mere Walk in the Park

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
Adrian Benepe, 52, has been the New York City parks and recreation commissioner since 2002. He and his wife, Charlotte Glasser -- they were married in Central Park -- live on the Upper West Side with their son Erik, 18. Their other son, Alex, is 22.ALAN FEUER 
 RISE AND SHINE I'm up pretty early -- usually by 8 o'clock. I've lost the ability to sleep late in middle age. The first thing I do is have a cup of coffee, make some sort of breakfast and look at the paper. I usually cook myself an omelet: jalapeno peppers, onions, scallions and some kind of cheese. 
 THE SUNDAY PAPER I have this bad habit, according to my wife, of squirreling away the sections I haven't read yet. Right now, the pile's about a foot and a half tall. If I have a light weekend and I'm not working, I'll go through 50 or so old papers and clip out photographs. I save them for decorating presents. I wrap the gift with regular paper, then put a picture on it and make some sort of comment. It's kind of a family tradition.
 THE WORKOUT Generally, in the late morning or early afternoon, I'll get in some extended vigorous exercise, usually a long run or a bike ride or a walk in Central Park or Riverside Park or the Hudson River waterfront.
 AND THE WORK The only problem is, I can't relax in a park. My wife went walking with me recently in Central Park and said, ''This isn't a walk. This is a sector patrol.'' It's way beyond taking mental notes. My BlackBerry has a camera, which has actually become the bane of all parks department employees. I take pictures and e-mail them to people right away. Or I'll see someone stomping through a flower bed or letting their dog run where it shouldn't and I have to get involved. When people ask me ''Who are you,'' I usually tell them I work for the parks department.
 AND THE PAPERWORK Every Sunday, I go through the biweekly reports from my senior managers. When the weather's nice, I'll take it outdoors and sit on a bench and watch people go by. Riverside Park is my backyard. I once read a piece about a guy who wrote a novel on a bench in Riverside Park. I'm pretty sure I've seen that guy.
 FOOD I don't do brunch. I just can't see spending too much time indoors on a Sunday and I can't see drinking alcohol that early. But Sundays are one of the few nights at home when I actually have time to cook. I'll make a homemade spaghetti sauce, heavy on vegetables, or a tomato sauce with something interesting like ginger, anchovies, capers and hot peppers -- sort of an arrabbiata-puttanesca combination. My wife doesn't eat meat, so it's always vegetarian or, if we've thought about it in advance, I'll cook some seafood. Occasionally, in the winter, I'll make a beef stew.
 IDLE, AND HAPPY Sunday is the one day I can count on not doing something. I'm usually at functions five nights a week and I'm always doing something even on a Saturday. It might be taking 50 economic-development people from Amsterdam on a bike tour down the West Side waterfront, but it's still work. Sundays, I relax.

 THE NEWS North Korea threatened to launch military strikes against South Korea if any of its ships were stopped or searched as part of an American-led effort to intercept vessels suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The escalating tensions followed the North's testing of a nuclear device -- its second test in three years -- and the launching of several short-range missiles. South Korea responded by joining the interdiction effort; later it raised its alert level to reflect a ''grave threat'' from the North. At the United Nations, efforts were afoot to enforce sanctions against the North, which the North says would amount to a declaration of war.

 THE NEWS Conservative groups began laying the groundwork to portray Judge Sonia Sotomayor as a judicial activist in upcoming hearings on her nomination to the Supreme Court.
 BEHIND THE NEWSPresident Obama emphasized her ''extraordinary journey'' from modest beginnings to the Ivy League in nominating her to become the first Hispanic justice. But she is likely to face questions from Republicans about past comments on how her sex and ethnicity shaped her opinions, and the role of appeals courts in making policy. On one culture-war issue her views remain a mystery: she has never directly ruled on whether the Constitution protects a woman's right to an abortion. 
 Same-Sex Marriage
 THE NEWS A new battle over same-sex marriage loomed in California after the state's Supreme Court upheld a ban on the marriages, ratifying a decision made by voters last year.
 BEHIND THE NEWS A year ago, the same court upheld the right of same-sex couples to marry. But a furious backlash led to Proposition 8, a voter initiative that banned the marriages. Now same-sex marriage advocates may start a ballot measure of their own, to effectively nullify the court's latest decision. At the same time, two of the nation's top litigators, who opposed each other in the contested 2000 Florida vote count won by President Bush, said they have sued together to overturn Proposition 8.
 Iran
 THE NEWS Iran restored access to the social networking site Facebook on Tuesday, three days after the government blocked the site and was accused of trying to muzzle the opposition during the presidential campaign.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The controversy reflected a larger and longstanding battle between moderates and religious conservatives over the nation's direction. Mir Hussein Moussavi, a moderate and former prime minister, has used Facebook to rally support among the nation's predominantly young electorate. He is seen as the strongest challenger to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a religious conservative widely criticized for Iran's economic malaise. 
 Myanmar
 THE NEWS The leader of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement, who has been in detention for most of the last two decades, defended herself in court last week against charges that she had broken the terms of her house arrest.
 BEHIND THE NEWSDaw Aung San Suu Kyi has been a rallying symbol since her party won a huge victory in 1990 but was denied power by the military junta. Her house arrest was lifted briefly in 2002, but she was locked up again after ecstatic crowds gathered wherever she went. Now the government is seeking to jail her for five years for allowing an uninvited American intruder to stay for two days after he swam across a small lake to her house.

HEADLINE: The Battle Over the Coyotes Is a Hockey Fight That May Have Lasting Effects

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The dispute over the fate of the Phoenix Coyotes is a classic showdown between a struggling owner needing to sell, a would-be white knight eager to buy and move the club, and a league trying to maintain control.
 Tussles like these typically take place out of view of the public because most teams are privately owned and disclose as little as possible about their finances. The secrecy gives them an advantage in negotiations with potential buyers, as well as creditors who want to get paid. 
 But because the team and the company that runs the arena have filed for bankruptcy, this fight is taking place in court, where some of the Coyotes' financial laundry -- including a list of its creditors and the more than $100 million that they are owed -- is being disclosed for everyone to see.
 This may put the National Hockey League and its 29 other teams in an awkward position. Other teams and the companies that do business with them are surely happy to get a glimpse of at least part of the Coyotes' finances. In an industry where operational data is closely guarded, any information that helps teams and their vendors benchmark themselves against their competitors is valued.
 But disclosure works both ways. The financial data could also give negotiating leverage to investment bankers who broker ownership stakes, advertisers who sell ads and naming rights in stadiums and critics of public subsidies for sports teams.
 And because so little data about clubs' finances is in the public domain, any public figures from the Coyotes could have an impact on other teams if they become a yardstick that investors use to measure the worth of franchises.
 ''It could cast a shadow over other franchises in the league,'' said Vince Gennaro, the author of ''Diamond Dollars: The Economics of Winning in Baseball'' and a consultant to several teams. ''A lot of people could misinterpret the core economics of the league.''
 Gennaro and other industry analysts say that successful, well-established franchises like the Boston Bruins and the Detroit Red Wings are in no danger of being compared to the Coyotes. But younger franchises in Sun Belt cities that are perceived to be weaker markets could be compared to the Coyotes, suppressing their potential value, they say.
 Information about the arena deal between the Coyotes and the city of Glendale, Ariz., could also make it harder for teams like the Islanders to get a new home built with public assistance if opponents point to the 31-year deal between the Coyotes and Glendale -- where the team's arena is located -- to bolster their case. At this point, 26 years remain on the deal and Glendale stands to lose tens of millions if the Coyotes move from Jobing.com Arena.
 ''The next owner who wants a stadium deal is going to have a harder time,'' said Raymond Sauer, who teaches the economics of sports at Clemson University. ''These deals stink, pure and simple. And in the current recession, we're having everything redrawn.''
 The Coyotes have been in dire straits for months. But the dispute took an odd turn when Jerry Moyes, the Coyotes' owner, filed to place the team under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 5. The N.H.L., which has been helping finance the team since November, argued that Moyes did not have the right to declare the club bankrupt.
 James L. Balsillie has offered to buy the club out of bankruptcy from Moyes for $212.5 million and move it to Hamilton, Ontario. Another investment group is thought to be interested, but with a lower bid.
 This turmoil comes at a delicate time for the N.H.L. Attendance rose 1.1 percent this season, according to the league, but many of those tickets were sold before the financial crisis took hold last September. Since then, many corporations have decided not to renew their luxury suites and season tickets. 
 The spectacle of one of its franchises tangled in a tug of war in bankruptcy court has not helped the league's image, and that could affect interest from prospective owners. The value of teams in all leagues depends on success of their operations -- ticket revenue, television and player contracts and so on -- but also on the more slippery ''ego factor,'' or the premium that buyers are willing to pay to own a franchise.
 ''There are only 30 teams and it's an elite group, and you have to figure out how much that's worth,'' said Chad Lewis, who rates debt issued by sports teams and others at Fitch Ratings. 
 If the court proceedings hurt the team's performance on the ice, in the stands and in the news media, investors may shy away from or make lower offers to buy clubs, other analysts said.
 Of course, the Coyotes are not the first team to get tangled in messy financial proceedings. In recent years, the Ottawa Senators, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Buffalo Sabres have flirted with bankruptcy, considered moving or were close to being sold. All three clubs have emerged with new owners and, many would argue, stronger futures.
 The Sabres were bought by Tom Golisano, a billionaire who helped revive the team. The Penguins, who were set to leave Pittsburgh, have qualified for the Stanley Cup finals for the second straight year and plan to move to a new arena.

HEADLINE: Food Bloggers of 1940

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MILES. 
Jonathan Miles contributes the Shaken and Stirred column to the Sunday Styles section of The Times. His novel, ''Dear American Airlines,'' is out in paperback.

 BODY:
The sun is hot and yellow, gas is cheap again, the fun's gone out of flying, and America, proud and resilient, beckons anew. Citizens, it's time for a road trip. Pick your road, any road: the ''holyboy road, madman road, rainbow road, guppy road,'' to quote from Jack Kerouac's guidebook, though good luck plugging those into MapQuest. It might be better to try, say, I-95, that nice fat highway that loosely hugs the Atlantic coastline. The highlights of any road trip, of course, are the pit stops for food, and -- on paper at least -- I-95 should offer a cornucopia: Maryland crabs, North Carolina barbecue, Virginia ham, Georgia boiled peanuts. Yet as we're all sourly aware, Interstate exits rarely, if ever, yield memorable culinary pit stops. Without strenuous preplanning, road food is almost always bad food, sad food, chain food, clown food. 
 So what's a spontaneous road tripper, equipped with a functioning palate, to do? Here's one line of advice -- pertaining to Virginia travelers seeking native fare like Brunswick stew or chess pie -- worth considering: ''If the tourist does not find the Virginian foods along the highway, he should knock at some farmhouse door, register his complaint against American standardization, and be served after a manner that conforms to the ancient rules of hospitality.''
 On second thought, don't consider that advice. That's bad advice. That's the kind of advice that could earn you a black eye, or at least a solid cussing. Not to mention that, behind that farmhouse door, there's a good chance they're eating McDonald's anyway. 
 That line, found amidst the higgledy-piggledy assortment of Depression-era food writing collected in THE FOOD OF A YOUNGER LAND (Riverhead, $27.95), edited by Mark Kurlansky, is just one vivid example of how much America, and its food, has changed in the last seven decades. But also how much it hasn't: note the denunciation of ''American standardization,'' a charge that predated fast-food chains, the Interstate highway system, frozen dinners, the rise of artificial flavorings, high-fructose corn syrup, widespread factory farming, genetically modified foodstuffs and all the other developments that have flattened the landscape of American eating, on the road and off. If there are surprises to be found in reading these dispatches from bygone dinner tables, the greatest may be the elegiac tone that suffuses some of the entries. It's always twilight, it seems, when it comes to American food.
 Like many archaeological finds, ''The Food of a Younger Land'' comes with a rich back story. In 1939, Katherine Kellock, the Federal Writers' Project editor responsible for the travel guidebooks that succored many unemployed writers through the Great Depression (Saul Bellow, John Cheever and Richard Wright among them), hatched a new idea: a book, to be entitled ''America Eats,'' about ''American cookery and the part it has played in the national life.'' Writers fanned out across the republic to document -- via field reports, essays, stories, poems, recipes and interviews -- what academics have taken to calling ''foodways.'' Among the topics covered were New York soda-luncheonette slang, Georgia possum cookery, Minnesota lutefisk, geoduck clams in Washington State, Montana's fried beaver tail, Colorado food superstitions (''You will receive mail from the direction in which your pie is pointing, when it is set down at your place at the table''), a Choctaw ''funeral cry'' feast and ''a Los Angeles sandwich called a taco.'' Throughout 1940 and 1941, raw copy flowed into Washington, D.C., where it was farmed out to rewriters -- including Nelson Algren -- for shaping into book form. Then came Pearl Harbor. The Federal Writers' Project -- ''one of the noblest and most absurd undertakings ever attempted by any state,'' as W. H. Auden described it -- morphed into the Writers Unit of the War Services, and ''America Eats'' went down as a war casualty. All that remained of it was a stack of onionskin carbon copies ''almost two feet high,'' according to Kurlansky, that Kellock deposited in the Library of Congress.
 In unpacking this time capsule, Kurlansky did nothing to the entries save cull and collate -- misspellings and other errors abound, and woe to the reader tempted to put some of the recipes to use in the kitchen. (One description calls for cooking cod for two weeks straight, which would yield some mighty well-done fish.) The fun is in the sifting. Couched between a selection of black Mississippi recipes transcribed in dialect (''wrop cakes in a collard leaf, place on dese coals coverin wid some more hot so hot'') and the Christmas dinner menu at the Brown Hotel in Louisville, Ky., is a stunning prose poem by Zora Neale Hurston about a mythical place in African-American folklore -- a kind of barbecue version of Shangri-La -- known as ''Diddy Wah Diddy.'' Eudora Welty also makes a cameo, with some pamphlet prose about Mississippi fare; ditto Nelson Algren, with ''A Short History of the American Diet.'' For the most part, however, this is no literary trove. Of the 4,500 writers employed by the F.W.P. in 1938, only 29 were ''established,'' and it shows. Wandering through these pages is like canvassing food blogs: some wheat, but lots of chaff. One of the odder entries, in fact, is a baffling rant against mashed potatoes that, with its over-the-top bluster and narrow scorn (not only should there be a law against serving mashed potatoes, the writer argues, but ''a law against even the use of the words on menus''), could have been lifted from a present-day blog.
 That's not the only echo, stylistic though it may be, of contemporary food writing, with its tender regard for simpler, more authentic times. When the mashed-potato-hater writes of ''bursting into nostalgic tears,'' she's not alone. One writer, in his report on Northeastern clambakes, leads off with a sigh: ''The clambake, as prepared at its best, has almost vanished.'' The 1930s and '40s were a hinge moment for American cookery, which was transformed by the technological and cultural upheavals of the '50s and '60s, and some of the writers saw it coming. Farm women, wrote one correspondent, ''are not so dependent upon the home-prepared foods as they once were. Bread may be delivered at the mailbox in time for dinner. The cream may be sold at the cream station and butter purchased from the groceryman. Canned vegetables are replacing the home-grown ones to a large extent.'' The Slow Food movement may be a recent development, but the impulses behind it run deep. 
 It would be easy, of course, to bemoan the loss of many of the food traditions recorded herein, and to chart just how grimly warranted those fears of ''standardization'' were, and to romanticize an era when eating locally and seasonally was a given rather than an ethical decision, but that would be unfair to the new food traditions -- especially those of Asian and Latin American immigrants -- that have taken root in the decades since. It might be difficult, these days, to find a steaming bowl of Brunswick stew off the highway in Virginia, but with a little searching, there's a good chance you might find a bowl of pozole. America may have been a younger land back then, as Kurlansky's title suggests, but with its boundless appetite, it's far from finished growing.

HEADLINE: Shanghai Buys Itself A Makeover Before a Fair

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Xie Qing contributed research.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Less than a year after Beijing hosted the Summer Olympics, Shanghai is gearing up for its own mega-event: the 2010 World Expo.
 Although the World Expo may have lost much of the luster it had when it was better known as the World's Fair, and though the global financial crisis drags on, apparently no one has told Shanghai: the city is planning to spend $45 billion, more than was spent on the Beijing Olympics, to upgrade Shanghai's infrastructure, build new transportation links and create what organizers promise will be the biggest and most extravagant Expo ever.
 Architects and city planners say Shanghai is using the Expo as an excuse to go on a huge spending spree that will help stimulate a weakening local economy but also push forward an already breathtaking transformation in this city of 18 million. 
 ''Every city has its own historical moment to transform and develop itself, and now it is Shanghai's moment,'' said Tu Qiyu, a professor of urban studies at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.
 The Expo is also advancing a larger government goal of bolstering the economy and turning Shanghai into a global financial center and a world-class city.
 The makeover's scope is spectacular. By the time the six-month-long exposition opens next May, Shanghai will have two new airport terminals, a subway system that is nearly as large as New York's and a $700 million promenade in its historic riverfront district. New parks, roads and bridges are already opening.
 Among the biggest worries for city officials is the possibility that the United States may not be able to take part in the exposition, which is held every five years.
 Because of a federal law that restricts the use of government funds, American participation in an exposition depends on donations and corporate sponsors. Washington is supporting a nonprofit group trying to raise $61 million to build and operate an American pavilion.
 With the economic downturn hampering fund-raising, the group has managed to raise only about $6 million. But Franklin L. Lavin, the chairman of the committee charged with financing the pavilion, remains optimistic. ''We have about $36 million under negotiation and we are on schedule to reach our target,'' he wrote in a recent e-mail message.
 Participation in the Expo is no small matter to the Chinese government, which views the event as another opportunity for China to celebrate its re-emergence as a global power. So the government has declared the fair a national priority and even pressed Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during her visit in February to commit to an American presence here.
 Expo organizers realize that a vast majority of the 70 million people expected to visit next year will come from neighboring Chinese provinces. But the city is still eager to impress the world.
 Following Beijing's example, Shanghai is asking residents to study English and vowing to teach etiquette to one million local families. The city also plans to ban smoking in public places and curtail pollution during the event.
 The Expo site itself is a bold statement about the Chinese government's resolve. The city says that to clear a huge site along the Huangpu River, which snakes through the heart of Shanghai, it relocated 18,000 families and about 270 factories, including the colossal Jiang Nan Shipyard, which employs 10,000 workers.
 The city then handed about 1,300 acres of riverfront land over to the Expo.
 ''They can mandate these things,'' said Koon Wee, an architect based in Hong Kong who is working on an Expo project. ''Remember the Three Gorges Dam? They knew they had to drown villages. But they did it.''
 Today, the Expo area is a vast construction zone. Rising on the south bank of the Huangpu River is the Chinese pavilion, a giant structure that looks like an upside down pyramid.
 Nearby, construction is under way on a $270 million sports arena and performing arts center. The building, which is shaped like a flying saucer, will be partly operated by a venture created with the National Basketball Association, which is eager to expand its image in China. 
 The Expo has, however, had its problems. A corruption scandal in 2005 toppled Shanghai's powerful party boss, Chen Liangyu, a prime driver of the Expo. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison last year for corruption and ties to big spending projects.
 City officials also say that some Expo participants are scaling back their plans. And they admit that the largely government-financed Expo could lose $120 million. The budget for the Expo alone is about $4.2 billion -- more than the cost of the Beijing Olympics. And some analysts say it could be multiples of that because the Expo budget does not include some costs, like relocating families and factories.
 And despite a multiyear marketing blitz, the Expo has failed to inspire many residents here.
 ''I'm not excited about it; it creates lots of problems and inconveniences,'' said Shi Yuan, a 24-year-old postgraduate student in Shanghai. ''Everywhere is under construction, every road. It's hard to get anywhere.''
 Wang Yi, an accountant, said the Expo was seen as a kind of cure-all for the economy. ''The government needs something to boost the economy, and let people feel confident,'' she said.
 The city's riverfront is getting the biggest makeover, with parks, promenades and entertainment areas. 
 Officials have also approved a plan to go ahead with the Shanghai Tower, a 2,073-foot-tall building that, when completed in 2014, will stand about 70 percent taller than the Empire State Building.
 Here in Shanghai, the potentially monstrous building is already being called the Dragon.

HEADLINE: Warmer, Fuzzier: The Refreshed Logo

BYLINE: By BILL MARSH

 BODY:
The world economy is in mid-swan dive. Wallets are in lockdown. So how does a company get people to feel just a little bit better about buying more stuff? (And perhaps burnish a brand that has taken some public relations lumps?)
 Behold the new breed of corporate logo -- non-threatening, reassuring, playful, even child-like. Not emblems of distant behemoths, but faces of friends. 
''A logo is to a company what a face is to a person,'' said Michel Tuan Pham, a professor of marketing at the Columbia Business School. ''It's hard to memorize facts about a person when you only know their name but you haven't seen their face.'' So logos remind consumers about companies' traits and pluck at emotions -- ''the glue that ties all the information about the brand name together,'' Mr. Pham said.
 The economy, environment, image repair -- new logos may address all of these. They are also meant to stand out in a crowd, but there are striking similarities among recent redesigns.
 TONED-DOWN TYPE Bold, block capital letters are out. Their replacements are mostly or entirely lower case, softening the stern voice of corporate authority to something more like an informal chat.
 ''Logos have become less official-looking and more conversational,'' said Patti Williams, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ''They're not yelling. They're inviting. They're more neighborly.''
 Blogs and e-mail, Ms. Williams said, may be encouraging a quieter, calmer, lower-case branding vernacular. Who isn't tired of screeds that assault the reader via THE CAPS LOCK KEY?
 Letterforms in many new emblems are lighter and rounder -- an extended family of homogenized fonts that would be comfortable on a local newsletter or generic Web page.
 FRIENDLY FLOURISHES Kraft Foods has joined Amazon.com and Hasbro, all represented by logos that smile. And to further lighten the corporate mood, whimsy in the form of sprigs and bursts has been appended to several big brands.
 Wal-Mart's old mark was navy blue, but it felt Red State. The company has been under heavy attack for its labor and environmental practices, bruising its brand in bluer quarters.
 A major image overhaul is under way, and a new logo is starting to appear across the country. The military-style Wal-Mart star has given way to a yellow twinkle that punctuates a new message: this is a company that cares, with fast and friendly service and a fresh, innovative outlook, according to Linda Blakley, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman.
 Ms. Williams, of Wharton, said the softer Wal-Mart logo serves another purpose: to stand apart from the bright reds and louder typography of its main competitors, Kmart and Target. While Target's design says bold and cutting-edge, Wal-Mart's sends a signal that it is approachable and sincere, she said.
 HAPPIER COLORS ''The economy is the No. 1 influence this year,'' said John H. Bredenfoerder, a color expert and design director at Landor Associates, the brand-consulting company that produced the new Cheer detergent emblem. Amid all the gloom, he said, ''people need a little joy in their lives.''
 Cue the new logos: electric blue type with accents in school bus yellow, red, purple, orange and green.
 Last year's top influence, green for sustainability, remains; leaves still sprout across the corporate landscape.
 Mr. Bredenfoerder said that blue was also gaining as a stand-in for the environment (think of earth's blue orb as seen from space, or clear blue waters) as well as for fresh optimism. But please, make it a joyful sky blue -- not dark, corporate-titan navy.

HEADLINE: A Wealth of Municipalities, And an Era of Hard Times

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
AS many recession-racked communities slash their payrolls and cut services to survive the economic downturn, Joseph Carvin is promoting a more radical solution that would cost him his job: dissolving the Town of Rye in Westchester County, where he is the supervisor.
 ''We've reached a point where the taxes are becoming unsustainable -- people can't afford to live here,'' Mr. Carvin said of Rye Town, which is composed of the Villages of Port Chester and Rye Brook and a section of the Village of Rye Neck. ''Something has to change.''
 The proposal is part of a wave of consolidations, mergers and sharing of services being considered by local governments in the New York region as falling revenues and rising unemployment force elected officials to make an unpalatable choice between property tax increases and service cutbacks. 
 Recently, even some states, like Minnesota and Wisconsin, have taken to sharing services to split costs. 
 New York State has given $29 million over the past two years to help 140 local governments consolidate services, yielding $250 million in savings, said Lorraine A. Cortes-Vasquez, the secretary of state. Gov. David A. Paterson and legislative leaders in Albany are pushing a bill to encourage mergers.
 New Jersey -- which has 566 municipalities, the most of any state in the country per capita and, not coincidentally, the nation's highest property taxes -- started slashing aid to more than 300 communities with populations below 10,000 last year to try to pressure them into combining police, fire and trash collection services. Now the state is moving to encourage 20 tiny ''doughnut hole'' communities to merge with the larger municipalities that surround them.
 Despite stiff resistance, Connecticut, which decades ago eliminated county government, is moving ahead with a plan to consolidate its probate courts.
 Efforts to streamline government have encountered a backlash from residents, employees and local elected officials. Bart Russell, executive director of the Connecticut Council of Small Towns, warned that the ''myopic metro-mania'' would not deliver the tax savings being promised and would end up costing public servants their jobs, communities their identities and residents the level of local service they had come to expect. 
 But as the recession grinds on, many government officials expect that the move to reduce the amount of government will intensify.
 ''It's Hamilton versus Jefferson all over again,'' said Joseph V. Doria Jr., New Jersey's commissioner of community affairs and a former mayor of Bayonne. ''Jefferson's model was the small agrarian communities. Hamilton was in favor of more centralized government. And right now, Hamilton has the momentum.'' 
 The crazy quilt of municipal governments that ring the metropolitan area grew for an assortment of personal, cultural, economic and political reasons, most having little to do with the best use of tax dollars or the quality of services. Some were established along highway routes or commuter rail lines, some to provide housing near up-and-coming manufacturing centers or to establish a political fief, and others to separate racial, ethnic or religious groups.
 In New Jersey, Florham Park was founded by a wealthy couple -- Florence Vanderbilt, granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and Hamilton McKown Twombly -- who wanted to pay lower taxes. Tavistock (population 24) was created in 1921 to sidestep the blue laws that prevented members of the Tavistock Country Club from golfing on Sundays. 
 The proliferation of government bodies -- and the money they consume -- has become the stuff of legend: New Jersey recently voted to phase out more than 20 school districts that had administrators and offices but no schools. New York State has 6,900 special taxation districts to pay for municipal water, sewer and trash collection services, and some of these districts have more cars and supervisors than workers.
 In New York, nine small upstate communities are considering dissolving themselves and being absorbed by neighbors, though only one -- the Village of Pike (pop. 382 ) in Wyoming County -- has voted to do so. 
 Next could be the Town of Rye, which has an annual budget of $2.8 million to oversee parks and provide administrative services, like tax collection, for the three villages it unites. If the town disappeared, the villages would have to provide those services to their residents. 
 In New Jersey, one community has disbanded in recent decades, in 1997, when Hardwick Township absorbed Pahaquarry (pop. 7). Two mergers are being seriously considered in the state: one involving Sussex Borough and Wantage Township, the other between the Village and Borough of Chester.
 In New York, the bill supported by Mr. Paterson would encourage county leaders to draw up reorganization plans to reduce the size and number of municipal governments and make it easier for voters to place such proposals on the ballot. 
 Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, who supports the bill, said that sharing services made sense for the vast majority of New York communities, ''if you care more about your children than your sewer pipes.'' 
 The most pitched battle in New York over scaling back government involves the special districts, which assess taxes for libraries, sewers, trash collection and water systems but have little accountability to voters and -- until recently -- have received little scrutiny from state officials. In Nassau County alone there are more than 200 such districts that levy $500 million a year in taxes and have been criticized in audits for wasteful spending and duplicating the efforts of other government agencies. 
 ''These districts are the last bastion of the Nassau County political machine,'' said Jeff Guillot, of the Long Island Progressive Coalition, a nonpartisan community group. ''They hire lobbyists with taxpayer dollars to fight against bills to restrict their power.''
 But advocates of small government bodies say that they can be more cost-efficient than larger bodies. And, these advocates say, smaller entities provide people the chance to get involved in local issues, preserving a hallmark of states with a strong tradition of ''home rule'' or autonomy in local governance.
 When Gov. M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut won legislative approval this month for a plan to reduce the number of probate courts to 50 from 117, dozens of local officials converged on Hartford to protest the move, which is moving forward despite their objections.
 Tom Marsh, a first selectman in Chester, said fewer courts would prove inefficient and alienate tax payers.
 ''All of the representatives and senators will tell you that the most fiscally accountable form of government is the town meeting,'' Mr. Marsh said. ''So why would we be moving away from that form of government to address a fiscal issue?'' 
 A commission in New Jersey working on reorganizing government has tried to offer some clarity on the debate about the efficiency of large and small governments. It recently issued a report saying that, generally, government is most cost-effective when it serves populations between 25,000 and 250,000. Reed Gusciora, a state assemblyman from Princeton, is trying to force dozens of communities in his district to merge or lose state aid. 
 ''We've tried everything to coax these communities to the altar,'' said Mr. Gusciora, who sponsored the bill on the so-called doughnut hole communities. ''What we need now is a few shotgun weddings.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''Turning the Infrastructure Into Profits,'' Ventures, May 24), about infrastructure investments: 
 We must remember that the goals of the public, the nominal owners of these assets, don't necessarily align with those of private investors. People expect infrastructure to deliver reliable services at an equitable price. For the most part, they don't really care if it provides investors with, as the article describes, ''predictable cash flow, largely impervious to economic and market fluctuations.'' 
 Although the tax allocation model that's been in place for half a century is no longer a sustainable funding source, the public correctly views infrastructure as more than just an emerging asset class. 
 If private capital is to play the significant and necessary role that it must in recapitalizing these systems, the investment community will need to make a convincing case that the public interest will be served as well. Richard G. Little
 Los Angeles, May 26

HEADLINE: The Six-Minute Test

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
FOR two decades, Steven Leeds and Rachel Hott lived in Montclair, N.J., an hourlong train-and-subway commute to their office near Union Square in Manhattan. But with their two children almost grown, Mr. Leeds, in particular, wanted a quick trip to work. A short walk was his ideal.
 The idea of a move back to the city was fine with his wife. After 25 years of marriage, ''it was a little bit of his turn,'' Dr. Hott said. Back then, ''I wanted to raise a family in a home with a backyard and he wanted to stay in Manhattan in an urban setting.'' Now, Daniel, 23, and Maya, 20, ''were really old enough to be O.K. with not having to be in their childhood home anymore,'' she said.
 Mr. Leeds, 58, who is from Flushing, Queens, and Dr. Hott, 53, from Great Neck, N.Y., met while studying neuro-linguistic programming, or NLP, a kind of self-help therapy designed to promote positive life changes. In 1986, they founded the NLP Center of New York (nlptraining.com), where they do coaching, training and hypnotherapy. 
 For a few years, they discussed returning to the city, where they had previously lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn. .
 ''It wasn't a 'have to' move -- it was a 'want to' move,'' Mr. Leeds said. They were daunted by how much stuff they had collected and the difficulty of uprooting themselves. But ''we had been talking about it enough,'' he said. ''Either we stop talking about it or we do something about it.'' 
 The couple hoped to spend around $1 million or a bit more for a two-bedroom in a prewar building. A pet-friendly building was needed for their dogs, Ollie and Lucky, but ''pet friendly'' sometimes meant cat-friendly, one-dog-friendly or breed-friendly. A low floor was preferable, too. ''I was being very practical,'' Dr. Hott said. ''I don't want to wait for an elevator to get in and out with the dogs, and don't want to climb too many stairs.'' 
 In their price range, nothing within walking distance of their office was sufficiently spacious. A sunny corner two-bedroom co-op on Gramercy Park South, for around $1 million, was typical -- the second bedroom was child-size.
 They decided they really needed three bedrooms. ''We would like our kids to be independent and have their own places,'' Mr. Leeds said, but with the economy weak, they wanted to provide a home base if necessary.
 This winter, they included a note with their holiday cards, asking if anyone was interested in buying their Montclair house. A cousin in California knew someone. The house sold, unexpectedly and effortlessly, for $765,000.
 Now, they were committed to moving. ''I was excited about the idea of moving, but was wondering whether we would find a place that is compelling and that we really were motivated to move to,'' Mr. Leeds said.
 Their son suggested Williamsburg, Brooklyn, just three stops from their office on the L train. 
 ''I think they heard it was too hipster, but I don't think they were afraid of that,'' said Daniel, a Kenyon College graduate. ''Where they work is right around N.Y.U. and the New School campuses, so they are used to that young vibrancy.'' 
 And McCarren Park, on the Williamsburg-Greenpoint border, ''is so family-oriented that you wouldn't really get the impression it is a young area.''
 When a friend remarked the couple was too old for Williamsburg, ''it felt like maybe we were,'' Dr. Hott said. But when visiting, ''I saw a few people older than me.'' 
 Their agent, Bruce Meakem of Bellmarc Realty, lined up buildings to visit. Though the waterfront views were enticing, Northside Piers on North Fifth Street ''was a little too chichi for us, with every amenity possible,'' Dr. Hott said. ''It felt like a vacation spot, and we don't go on those vacations.'' Nor did they want a modern building or a glass high-rise. 
 But they changed their mind when they reached the Aurora, on Bayard Street flanking McCarren Park. ''I said to Bruce, after walking this circuitous route, 'I hope this is not the one I love,' '' Mr. Leeds said. It was, of course. The three-bedroom two-bathroom two-balcony condominium included 1,400 square feet, with the park below and Manhattan in the distance.
 ''They were very explicit about wanting to time the walk,'' from the Bedford Avenue subway station, Mr. Meakem said. With a direct route, ''we were able to get it to between five and six minutes.'' 
 The building had everything they needed. It was an ''emotional moment,'' Dr. Hott said. ''We could live here.''
 The couple bought the apartment, which was listed at about $1.2 million, for $999,000, moving in earlier this month. Monthly charges are around $1,200. ''Instead of waiting for prices to come down further, we made an offer we thought would be fair in this economy,'' Mr. Leeds said.
 He was always a bit regretful at leaving the city, so he is thrilled to be back. ''I am a native New Yorker who has come home,'' he said.
 Daniel, who currently lives with roommates in Bushwick, is freelancing and interning in the arts field, and plans to stay with his parents at least for the summer. Maya, a student at the University of Michigan, will be there, too. 
 The couple plan to give up their cars, renting a Zipcar when needed. One big change is losing the ''suburban mentality of going to the grocery store and packing up the car with groceries,'' Dr. Hott said. Now, they shop at the supermarkets near Union Square, buying only what they can carry. 
 They are inspired by McCarren Park. ''I have never seen so much activity,'' Dr. Hott said. ''There is break dancing and tai chi and soccer.'' While walking the dogs, ''I talk to everybody who has dogs, and lots of people have just moved here,'' she said.
 The trip to work includes the six-minute walk to the L train on the Brooklyn side, and a four-minute walk on the Manhattan side. ''With the subways, we leave when we want to leave instead of looking at a schedule,'' Mr. Leeds said. 
 ''I thought I would read every morning, although it is such a fast ride that you can't really read much,'' Dr. Hott said. By the time she deals with the crowd and locates her glasses, the trip is over.

 BODY:
Niall Ferguson claims ''that crises are more often caused by bad regulation than by deregulation'' (May 17). Our current credit problems have been caused by both. Only a few commentators remember that it was Henry Paulson, who then was chief executive at Goldman Sachs, who led the 2004 request for the S.E.C. to exempt investment banks' brokerage units from the old net-capital rules that limited their debt leverage. Furthermore, William H. Donaldson, who was the S.E.C. chairman, and his staff decided to rely on the investment firms' own computer models to measure investment risk. A recipe for disaster was in place. One can hope that Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, as well as Mary Shapiro, the current S.E.C. chairwoman, will reinstate some effective form of the old net-capital rules. The ''haircuts'' required worked well for many years. They can and must do so again. 
 JAMES ZUCKER New York
 Why do we never learn the right lessons from financial crises? I find pertinent the comments of William Tecumseh Sherman, the Civil War general, when he was a banker in San Francisco during the 1854 recession (as quoted from Arthur Quinn's ''Rivals,'' a California history): '' 'The temptation of large profits is the soul of gambling, and business here has partaken of that character.' Again and again he returned to this theme. 'My opinion is the very nature of the country begets speculation, extravagance, failures and rascality. Everything is chance, everything is gambling.' '' Bankers he thought, were no better than the rest.

 BODY:
NETHERLAND, by Joseph O'Neill. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.95.) This ode to New York City, one of the Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2008, ''provides a resonant meditation on the American Dream,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The Times. Its narrator, a Dutch financier deserted by his British wife after 9/11, finds solace in the vibrant outer-borough subculture of immigrant cricket, a game described with casual grace. He falls in with a charismatic Trinidadian entrepreneur, a hustler and dreamer ''who comes across as a combination of Jay Gatsby and one of Philip Roth's long-winded, comic cranks,'' Kakutani said. 
 THE POST-AMERICAN WORLD, by Fareed Zakaria. (Norton, $15.95.) ''We are moving into a post-American world,'' Zakaria writes, in which the distribution of ''industrial, financial, educational, social, cultural'' power is ''shifting, moving away from American dominance.'' He is less concerned with American decline than with the ''rise of the rest'' -- China, followed by India -- but believes that the United States can retain a vital economy if it adjusts to the challenges it faces. 
 THE FOREVER WAR, by Dexter Filkins. (Vintage, $15.) In the tradition of Michael Herr's ''Dispatches,'' Filkins, a New York Times reporter who was embedded with American troops during the attack on Falluja, has written a stunning account of the human side of the Iraq war. Our reviewer, Robert Stone, praised Filkins's ''eloquence and humanity'' and said that ''his writing is one of the scant good things to come out of the war.'' This was another one of the Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2008. 
 DICTATION, by Cynthia Ozick. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $13.95.) Four novellas, full of insight and humor, display Ozick's mastery. In the title story, Henry James and Joseph Conrad, rivals and temperamental opposites, hire a pair of contrasting secretaries as each works on a tale about doubles. 
 APPLES AND ORANGES: My Brother and Me, Lost and Found, by Marie Brenner. (Picador, $15.) The apples and oranges are Marie Brenner, a New Yorker and a writer at large for Vanity Fair, and her brother, Carl, an apple grower in Washington State with an N.R.A. sticker on his truck. When Carl receives a diagnosis of cancer shortly after 9/11, Marie tries to repair their bond. She brings a journalist's tools to understanding apple-growing and sibling relationships and a sister's broken heart to portraying her maddening, admirable brother. In the Book Review, James Panero called this a ''majestic little book, . . . a meditation on family and fate.'' 
 BEGINNER'S GREEK, by James Collins. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.99.) Boy meets girl, boy loses girl's phone number, boy gets girl 400 pages later in Collins's sunny first novel. Collins, no stranger to the haute WASP world in which the novel is set, has an insider's eye and an amiable prose style. 
 DEAN ACHESON: A Life in the Cold War, by Robert L. Beisner. (Oxford University, $19.95.) This thoughtful and well-researched account of Acheson's years as undersecretary and then secretary of state shows him to be a man of sweeping views but pragmatic and definable policies. 
 THE PRINCE OF FROGTOWN, by Rick Bragg. (Vintage, $14.95.) In the third memoir about his family, Bragg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, comes to terms with the memory of his father, who drank himself to death. Bragg's musical prose evokes the fatalism and poverty of life in a Southern mill town. 
 NAZI LITERATURE IN THE AMERICAS, by Roberto Bolano. Translated by Chris Andrews. (New Directions, $13.95.) This encyclopedia, complete with a bibliography and biographies of secondary figures, describes a network of far-right litterateurs and tastemakers who share a love of symmetry and order. None of them actually existed, but, Bolano suggests, they easily could have. 
 NIXONLAND: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America, by Rick Perlstein. (Scribner, $20.99.) Perlstein's sprawling, readable story of Nixon's ascent focuses on the reaction against the counterculture of the 1960s that this ''serial collector of resentments'' exploited. Nixon's abiding legacy, Perlstein says, is the ''notion that there are two kinds of Americans.'' 
 IN DEFENSE OF FOOD: An Eater's Manifesto, by Michael Pollan. (Penguin, $15.) ''Most of what we're consuming today is no longer, strictly speaking, food at all, and how we're consuming it . . . is not really eating,'' Pollan writes in this witty attack on what he calls ''nutritionism.'' His advice is: ''Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.'' 
 SOMEDAY THIS PAIN WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU, by Peter Cameron. (Picador, $13.) One summer, a sensitive New York 18-year-old decides he may not want to go to college after all. This is a young adult novel, but older adults can enjoy its exploration of adolescent feelings. The book is ''terrific, piercing and funny,'' our reviewer, David Lipsky, said.

HEADLINE: Let the Kid Be

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
Perhaps you know it by its other names: helicoptering, smothering mothering, alpha parenting, child-centered parenting. Or maybe there's a description you've coined on your own but kept to yourself: Overly enmeshed parenting? Get-them-into-Harvard-or-bust parenting? My-own-mother-never-breast-fed-me-so-I-am-never-going-to-let-my-kid-out-of-my-sight parenting?
 There are, similarly, any number of theories as to why 21st-century mothers and fathers feel compelled to micromanage their offspring: these are enlightened parents, sacrificing their own needs to give their children every emotional, intellectual and material advantage; or floundering parents, trying their best to navigate a changing world; or narcissistic parents, who see their children as both the center of the universe and an extension of themselves. 
 But whatever you call it, and however it began, its days may be numbered. It seems as though the newest wave of mothers is saying no to prenatal Beethoven appreciation classes, homework tutors in kindergarten, or moving to a town near their child's college campus so the darling can more easily have home-cooked meals. (O.K., O.K., many were already saying no, but now they're doing so without the feeling that a good parent would say yes.) Over coffee and out in cyberspace they are gleefully labeling themselves ''bad mommies,'' pouring out their doubts, their dissatisfaction and their dysfunction, celebrating their own shortcomings in contrast to their older sisters' cloying perfection.
 After all, that is the way it is with parenting -- which I bet was never used as a verb before the 20th century, when medicine reached the point where parents could assume their babies would survive. At its core, raising children is about instinct and biology, yes, but on top of that, we build an artificial scaffold, which supports what we have come to think of as parenting truths but are really only parenting trends. 
 Going way back, the Spartans probably thought they were oh, so modern when they left defenseless infants on wild mountain slopes. So did wealthy Norse mothers who had poor women foster their children, and European aristocrats who employed wet nurses. More recently, as Ann Hulbert chronicles in her book ''Raising America: Experts, Parents, and a Century of Advice About Children,'' rigid feeding schedules were all the rage in the United States in the 1920s. The next two decades brought an emphasis on discipline.
 In 1946, Dr. Spock came along and told parents to trust their instincts. Later, parents became buddies with their kids, and by the end of the last century, the debate was about the quality versus the quantity of time spent with your children. That was followed by the concept of mothering as an all-consuming identity. Mothers chose their gurus -- T. Berry Brazelton (touchy-feely parenting), William Sears (attachment parenting) and John Rosemond (Christian parenting) -- then diligently wore their babies in slings and nursed them into toddlerhood, all the while judging (and feeling judged by) those who did not do the same.
 After a decade of earnest immersion in parenting, though, the times are ripe for a change. The first sign was the wave of confessionals -- from anonymous Web sites like truumomconfessions.com (where mothers admit to transgressions like feigning stomach cramps to steal quiet time hiding in the bathroom) to bylined blogs like the wildly popular dooce.com (where Heather B. Armstrong chronicled her postpartum depression and continues to write about her struggles as the mother of a charming but somewhat high-strung 5-year-old) to memoirs like Ayelet Waldman's (in which she cops to such ''sins'' as using disposable diapers and loving her husband more than her children).
 But in the past few months, a second wave has taken hold -- writers are moving past merely venting and are trying to gather the like-minded into a new movement. Carl Honore is one. He calls it ''slow parenting'' -- no more rushing around physically and metaphorically, no more racing kids from soccer to Suzuki. Lenore Skenazy is another. She calls it ''free-range parenting,'' a return to the days when childhood was not ruled by the fear (overblown, she says, with statistics to prove it) that children would be maimed, kidnapped or killed if they did something as simple as riding their bikes alone to the park.
 By far the most chipper is Tom Hodgkinson, whose book ''The Idle Parent: Why Less Means More When Raising Kids'' was just published in England, and whose cover -- Mum and Dad lounging with martinis while their well-trained toddler sits on the floor mixing up the next batch -- illustrates his message that parents should just chill. Pay attention to your own needs, he writes, back off on your children and everyone will be happier and better adjusted.
 All this certainly dovetails nicely with new economic realities. When you can't afford those violin lessons or a baby sitter to accompany your 10-year-old to the park, you can turn guilt on its head and call it a parenting philosophy. But is it fundamental change? Or is the apparent decline of overparenting (and its corollaries: feelings of competition and inadequacy) actually the same obsession donning a new disguise? 
 The one constant over the past century has been parents' determination to find the right answers when it comes to raising their children. In this latest chapter, we have replaced the experts who told us what a good parent worries about with experts who tell us that a good parent doesn't worry so much. We may even see parents stop aiming to prove how perfect they are and start trying to prove how nonchalant they are. But worry is worry. The search to keep from messing up goes on.

 By all accounts the members of PHISHwere determined not to make their reunion feel like a business decision. Their first brief run of shows, at the Hampton Coliseum in Virginia in March, featured some of the band's most intricately detailed songs, suggesting that music was the absolute motivator. As a result fans of this quintessential jam band, which broke up in 2004, have joined the revitalization effort with full fervor: at livephish.com those Hampton Coliseum dates are the three most-downloaded shows. And Phish's highly merchandized summer tour, beginning Sunday at Fenway Park in Boston, sold out instantly, which means, among other things, that a robust gray-market economy has emerged online. In one recent search tickets for this week's stand at Jones Beach could be found for around $60 each. That's not bad, even if all three shows will soon be available at livephish.com as a package, in MP3 form, for $26.85. Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at 7:30 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., livenation.com; sold out. 
 Speaking of intricacy, the Argentine pianist-composer GUILLERMO KLEIN returns to the Village Vanguard this week with LOS GUACHOS, his excellent 11-piece band. This same group released one of last year's best jazz albums, ''Filtros'' (Sunnyside). But as in the case of Phish -- and here's where the comparison stops -- Mr. Klein's music is best experienced live. Tuesday through Sunday at 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

HEADLINE: Travel

BYLINE: By JOSHUA HAMMER. 
Joshua Hammer, a freelance foreign correspondent, is researching his next book, ''Empire of Sand: A Tale of Greed, Glory and Horror in German Colonial Africa.''

 BODY:
This summer, travel for the sake of pure travel is out. Among the current crowd of globe-trotting writers, just about everybody has an ulterior motive. Whether it's assuaging a guilty yanqui conscience by plunging into Hugo Chavez's Venezuela or satisfying a longstanding fascination with the mummified remains of long-dead saints, these footloose authors are less interested in breathing in the atmosphere of exotic haunts than in indulging their passion for religion or liquor -- or leftist politics.
 In RAG AND BONE: A Journey Among the World's Holy Dead (Holt, $25), Peter Manseau embarks on a global odyssey in search of the ''dismembered toes, splinters of shinbone, stolen bits of hair, burned remnants of an anonymous rib cage, and other odds and ends'' belonging to saints and other sacred figures. The result is an entertaining, sometimes affecting inquiry into man's yearning for spiritual transcendence through the worship of holy relics, real or otherwise -- from the Shroud of Turin (''considered by some to be Christianity's most holy artifact, mocked by others as little more than a medieval towel smeared with ink'') to more obscure bits of clothing and body parts. 
 The book could have been ghoulish, but Manseau's irreverent approach and enthusiasm keep the tone surprisingly light. He examines the curious dissemination of pieces of saints around the globe, meets a cast of fellow enthusiasts -- including a French paleopathologist who spends his spare time rummaging through the supposed bone fragments of Joan of Arc -- and explores the fringes of religious devotion. Most notable is the pious Portuguese woman who, in a fit of ecstasy, is said to have bitten off the little toe of St. Francis Xavier, whose damaged cadaver lures Manseau to the Roman Catholic enclave of Goa, India: ''To look closely at the foot now -- with at least three digits missing -- is to wonder if she got away with an even bigger bite.'' 
 Kate Hopkins, a popular food blogger and former stand-up comedian, has a far less taxing itinerary. In 99 DRAMS OF WHISKEY: The Accidental Hedonist's Quest for the Perfect Shot and the History of the Drink (St. Martin's, $24.95), she sets off with her friend Krysta on a ramble through the distilleries of Scotland, Ireland, Canada and the United States in search of the best whiskeys in the world. Hopkins's bits of history go down easy: America's Whiskey Rebellion of 1794; the spread of the Phylloxera vastatrix parasite through French vineyards that wiped out the wine industry and boosted Scotch's popularity; the rivalry between Ireland and Scotland for the best single malts. She also serves up pungent assessments of the spirits she samples, from Bushmills White Label (''the Julia Roberts of the whiskey world'') to Isle of Jura Single Malt Whisky 10Y (''the perfect introduction to peated malts''). But her shtick -- including a routine about an erratically functioning GPS she nicknames Molly -- can be annoying, and the journey becomes an uninspired plod through distillery gift shops, tasting rooms and other well-traveled haunts. ''Any idea of deep, lush Canadian farmland,'' Hopkins writes, on a journey to inspect the Canadian Club distillery in Ontario, ''had been beaten to a pulp and then buried in a tar pit by the scenic reality of places whose best redeeming features were that they had a Tim Hortons doughnut shop AND a Boston Pizza.''
 Another comedian hits the road in search of intoxication of a different sort in I'M OFF THEN: Losing and Finding Myself on the Camino de Santiago (Free Press, paper, $15; available in mid-June). Hape Kerkeling, a popular TV talk-show host and cabaret star in his native Germany, cuts loose from the comforts of Dusseldorf and sets off on a hike across the Pyrenees to the grave of St. James at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Searching for spiritual meaning, this self-described ''couch potato'' follows a 1,000-year-old pilgrimage route that lures 100,000 trekkers each year, experiencing almost insufferable heat and physical agony in the process. ''Tormented by recurrent throbbing and stabbing pains in my knee,'' he confesses early on, ''I am forced to reduce my pace, particularly because I am shuffling along in flip-flops instead of in proper footwear.''
 Kerkeling's account of his travels (translated here by Shelley Frisch) was a best seller in Germany, possibly because it's so easy to identify with him. He skips some of the hardest stretches to hitch rides with local farmers or hop aboard trains, and he avoids fetid pilgrims' hostels whenever possible in favor of the best hotel in town (often not much better). Despite such tactics, this gregarious traveler soon gets into the spirit of things, and his encounters with fellow pilgrims, including a Peruvian shaman with a creepy fondness for ''Mein Kampf,'' can be both funny and moving. Less successful is Kerkeling's tendency to note every minor incident along the way, as well as his shopworn insights. ''What makes us human?'' goes one typical epiphany. ''Our minor faults and major flaws. If we didn't have them, we'd all be little angels.''
 In NOMAD'S HOTEL: Travels in Time and Space (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, paper, $13.95), a collection of travel essays spanning four decades, the Dutch novelist Cees Nooteboom wanders from Mali to Venice to pre-Ayatollah Iran. Despite some occasionally awkward passages in this translation by Ann Kelland, Nooteboom's observant eye and ravenous appetite for third-world backwaters sometimes recall the work of his contemporary, the Polish journalist Ryszard Kapuscinski. In the best piece, ''Lady Wright and Sir Jawara: A Boat Trip up the Gambia,'' written in 1975, Nooteboom flies on a whim to Banjul -- capital of Gambia, a former British colony in West Africa -- and, after hanging around the torpid city for days, trying (for no good reason) to interview the president, he boards a beat-up river boat to nowhere. ''His head is broad, Mongolian,'' Nooteboom writes of one prosperous trader squeezed beside him on the deck, ''and decorated with a mustache fit for Pythagoras: a black triangle of which the sharply angled upper corner seems to point at his nose. His smile is as sweet as caramel and does not wane for a moment.'' 
 In an essay called ''Nooteboom's Hotel 1,'' he constructs a virtual inn out of the most memorable places where he has stayed and describes his definition of traveler's hell: ''the murmurings of the fellow in the next room, . . . the traces of someone else's lust or sounds of same, . . . the slow torture of the gutta cadenda from a leaky tap and the axiomatic certainty that the next drip is on its way.''
 ''I have four parents,'' explains 18-year-old Chesa Boudin to his bemused Guatemalan hostess at the beginning of GRINGO: A Coming-of-Age in Latin America (Scribner, $25). The son of the radicals Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, who were sentenced to long prison terms for their role in a deadly 1981 Brink's truck robbery, Boudin was raised by his jailed parents' comrades, William Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, and eventually became a Rhodes Scholar. 
 This earnest account of his decade-long travels through Latin America -- from a dirt-poor village near Guatemala's Lake Peten Itza to the corridors of power in Caracas -- is part travel memoir, part social and economic critique. Many of Boudin's encounters are extraordinary: he meets ordinary Argentines caught up in the country's financial collapse and befriends a beautiful young Brazilian on a boat up the Amazon, then follows her home to the two-bedroom Manaus apartment she shares with at least a dozen members of her family.
 Boudin's unusual background gives him special entree on a continent where the anti-Bush backlash is sweeping leftist governments to power. ''I had found one of the few places on the planet where having parents in prison in the United States for politically motivated crimes actually opened doors rather than closed them,'' he writes after landing a job working for an adviser to the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. But he falls into simplistic condemnations of globalism, the International Monetary Fund and structural adjustment programs, and loses credibility with his one-side cheerleading for Chavez. ''Fighting off sleep, Pablo, Liza and I donned our pro-Chavez red paraphernalia and raced out to join the inevitable celebrations,'' he writes after the Venezuelan leader's 2006 electoral victory. Boudin's starry-eyed enthusiasm makes one long for a more dispassionate approach to his subject.
 Rory Nugent's 1993 travelogue, ''Drums Along the Congo,'' was an uproarious account of his pursuit of a dinosaur rumored to be lurking around Lake Tele in the heart of Africa. In DOWN AT THE DOCKS (Pantheon, $24.95), his first book since, Nugent sets his sights much closer to home -- on the commercial fishermen of New Bedford, Mass. Their once-thriving industry has been done in by ''feds, regs and quotas,'' says a rye-swilling seaman called Sword, one member of a fraternity of Vietnam vets, drug abusers, alcoholics and other hard-bitten types Nugent encounters during his immersion in the community.
 Nugent has a knack for getting people to talk, and their sometimes harrowing, sometimes hilarious stories of late-night marijuana drops, work injuries and weeklong benders capture a world of entrepreneurial independence and fearsome risk. Most memorable is Mako, an erstwhile pot smuggler and scallop fisherman whose dysfunctionality on land is countered by his authority at sea: ''As captain, he runs the show, a benevolent dictator of a tiny, self-propelled island populated by five or six other pirates joined in common cause: to grab as much sea booty as they can set their hooks into.''

PERSON: Clive W.J. Granger 

HEADLINE: Clive Granger, 74, Nobel Economist Who Unleashed Statistics, Is Dead

BYLINE: By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Clive W. J. Granger, an economist and Nobel laureate whose work revolutionized the way stocks and other fluctuating series of data are analyzed and forecast, died on May 27. He was 74 and lived in La Jolla, Calif.
 His death was announced on Friday by the University of California, San Diego, where he taught for three decades. No cause was given.
 Throughout his career, Dr. Granger was known as one of the most prominent figures in the use of statistics to study the economy, a highly technical field known as econometrics. But it was an early revelation about time series data -- sets of data that are collected over time, like daily stock prices, interest rates and consumer spending habits -- that earned him his greatest honor. 
 In macroeconomics, some time series are referred to as nonstationary, in that they grow over time and have an element of randomness to them, while others are called stationary, meaning they do not grow over time and tend to fluctuate around a given value or average. 
 Before Dr. Granger's studies, it was common practice for economists to take methods intended for stationary time series and use them to analyze nonstationary ones. But Dr. Granger -- working closely with a colleague at the University of California, Davis, Robert F. Engle -- demonstrated that this approach could produce erroneous results. 
 He also devised ways to analyze relationships between data that follow similar trends over time but are not necessarily linked through cause and effect, like monthly fluctuations in consumer spending and changes in household wealth. 
 The implications of Dr. Granger's work quickly spread far beyond academia, allowing bankers to better analyze stock prices and economists to better understand the intricacies of the economy. His methods are also applied in fields like biology and engineering. 
 For their work, Dr. Granger and Dr. Engle were awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 2003. 
 ''His innovation has completely changed the way that economists estimate and build dynamic models of the macro economy,'' Torsten Persson, an economist at the University of Stockholm who served on the Nobel Prize Committee for Economic Sciences, said at a ceremony honoring Dr. Granger in 2003. ''Nowadays co-integration methods are literally used everywhere -- by academically minded researchers in universities, as well as more practically minded investigators, be it in central banks or the private sector.'' 
 In 2004, Dr. Granger, a native of Wales, was inducted into the Order of Knight Bachelor by Queen Elizabeth II. 
 Clive William John Granger was born in Swansea, Wales, in 1934. He developed a strong interest in mathematics as a child but ambled into a career in statistics haphazardly. As a grammar school student in 1946, his teacher instructed him and his classmates to stand up one day and announce the careers they wanted.
 ''I preferred to use mathematics in some practical fashion and thought that meteorology sounded promising,'' he wrote in his Nobel biography. ''In those days I stuttered somewhat and when my turn came to stand up, I tried to say 'meteorology' but found I could not get the word out, so I just said 'statistics,' thereby determining my future path.''
 He would go on to the University of Nottingham, where he earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1955. He earned his Ph.D. in statistics there in 1959, publishing his first statistical paper on an unlikely subject: sunspot activity. After obtaining his degree, he was briefly lured away from Nottingham by Princeton University, where he spent an academic year and, as Dr. Persson put it, ''he was safely hooked onto the use of statistics in economics rather than physics.''
 At the end of his stint at Princeton, Dr. Granger, known for his gentle humor, married Patricia Loveland and went on what he called ''an extended camping trip and honeymoon'' across the United States, using money he had received through a fellowship.
 ''After twelve thousand spectacular miles,'' he wrote, ''we still liked each other and I had acquired a beard.''
 In the years that followed, Dr. Granger took up visiting positions at various schools, but spent most of his time teaching at the University of Nottingham. He returned to the United States in the early 1970s, settling at U.C. San Diego. There, he began his work with Dr. Engle, working with him through the '70s and '80s and together building one of the world's most prominent econometrics programs. 
 In addition to his research, Dr. Granger published a dozen books and won numerous awards. In 2005, the University of Nottingham bestowed upon him yet another in a series of rare honors, renaming the school's economics and geography department the Sir Clive Granger Building.
 Dr. Granger is survived by his wife as well as two children: a son, Mark, and a daughter, Claire.
 He retired from his post at U.C. San Diego in June 2003 but kept an emeritus position. He worked for a time at the University of New Zealand, only to have his semi-retirement interrupted that October with a 3 a.m. phone call from the Nobel committee. 
 In an interview with The New York Times shortly after the announcement, Dr. Granger said he initially wondered whether the coveted call was a prank. It was only when he heard voices of Royal Academy members whom he knew that he realized it was no hoax.
 ''I kind of thought I had a chance,'' he said at the time, ''but I wasn't expecting it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 9, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on May 31 about Clive W. J. Granger, an economist and Nobel laureate in 2003, misidentified the University of California campus where he worked with Robert F. Engle, who shared the Nobel Prize with him. It was the San Diego campus, not the Davis one. The obituary also misstated the name of a university where Dr. Granger later worked. It is the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, not the University of New Zealand.

HEADLINE: Wanted: A New Home For My Country

 BODY:
The idea of relocating an entire island population is radical and may at some point become unavoidable (Nicholas Schmidle, May 10). The Maldives are a unique place of beauty and serenity, however, and giving them (and a couple of dozen other island states) up to global warming and rising sea levels must be a last resort and not a first best option. We have caused global warming, and we should take responsibility for it now and come up with a lot more ideas, efforts and resources to contain its negative effects. Many ideas have been floated by more or less qualified individuals and organizations. 
We can try to seed algae growth in the South Pacific with iron powder to extract carbon from the atmosphere. We might pump large amounts of seawater into the Saharan desert to create a huge salt lake, which would potentially feed underground aquifers and natural rainfall in Northeast Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Or we could cover vulnerable glaciers in Greenland with reflective tin foil during the summer months. These are just a few ideas that might help and would not cost billions. Is there an international discussion forum for scientists from different disciplinary and national backgrounds to exchange their views on the feasibility and side effects of existing and new ideas? Have we even started to seriously dedicate our minds to the matter? Or are we still stuck in the Bush administration attitude that global warming is either not happening or not as bad as it sounds or at least not going to strike in our lifetime?
 FRANK EMMERT Director, Center for International and Comparative Law Indiana University School of Law Indianapolis
 A global climate tax might be worth considering as a way of addressing problems like climate change's threat to the Maldives. If a tax were levied on industries and utilities in developed countries that create CO2, that money could be used to help pay the resettlement costs of those impacted by global climate change.
 The world has become more globalized than ever before. Maybe it is time to consider such an international climate tax. It could be administered by one of the world bodies responsible for international finance -- like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. We should plan now, in a methodological way, before there is a crisis and actual climate refugees.

HEADLINE: Contractors Vie For Plum Work, Hacking for U.S.

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW and JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: MELBOURNE, Fla. 

 BODY:
The government's urgent push into cyberwarfare has set off a rush among the biggest military companies for billions of dollars in new defense contracts.
 The exotic nature of the work, coupled with the deep recession, is enabling the companies to attract top young talent that once would have gone to Silicon Valley. And the race to develop weapons that defend against, or initiate, computer attacks has given rise to thousands of ''hacker soldiers'' within the Pentagon who can blend the new capabilities into the nation's war planning.
 Nearly all of the largest military companies -- including Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon -- have major cyber contracts with the military and intelligence agencies.
 The companies have been moving quickly to lock up the relatively small number of experts with the training and creativity to block the attacks and design countermeasures. They have been buying smaller firms, financing academic research and running advertisements for ''cyberninjas'' at a time when other industries are shedding workers. 
 The changes are manifesting themselves in highly classified laboratories, where computer geeks in their 20s like to joke that they are hackers with security clearances. 
 At a Raytheon facility here south of the Kennedy Space Center, a hub of innovation in an earlier era, rock music blares and empty cans of Mountain Dew pile up as engineers create tools to protect the Pentagon's computers and crack into the networks of countries that could become adversaries. Prizes like cappuccino machines and stacks of cash spur them on, and a gong heralds each major breakthrough.
 The young engineers represent the new face of a war that President Obama described Friday as ''one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.'' The president said he would appoint a senior White House official to oversee the nation's cybersecurity strategies. 
 Computer experts say the government is behind the curve in sealing off its networks from threats that are growing more persistent and sophisticated, with thousands of intrusions each day from organized criminals and legions of hackers for nations including Russia and China.
 ''Everybody's attacking everybody,'' said Scott Chase, a 30-year-old computer engineer who helps run the Raytheon unit here. 
 Mr. Chase, who wears his hair in a ponytail, and Terry Gillette, a 53-year-old former rocket engineer, ran SI Government Solutions before selling the company to Raytheon last year as the boom in the military's cyberoperations accelerated. 
 The operation -- tucked into several unmarked buildings behind an insurance office and a dentist's office -- is doing some of the most cutting-edge work, both in identifying weaknesses in Pentagon networks and in creating weapons for potential attacks.
 Daniel D. Allen, who oversees work on intelligence systems for Northrop Grumman, estimated that federal spending on computer security now totals $10 billion each year, including classified programs. That is just a fraction of the government's spending on weapons systems. But industry officials expect it to rise rapidly. 
 The military contractors are now in the enviable position of turning what they learned out of necessity -- protecting the sensitive Pentagon data that sits on their own computers -- into a lucrative business that could replace some of the revenue lost from cancellations of conventional weapons systems. 
 Executives at Lockheed Martin, which has long been the government's largest information-technology contractor, also see the demand for greater computer security spreading to energy and health care agencies and the rest of the nation's critical infrastructure. But for now, most companies remain focused on the national-security arena, where the hottest efforts involve anticipating how an enemy might attack and developing the resources to strike back.
 Though even the existence of research on cyberweapons was once highly classified, the Air Force plans this year to award the first publicly announced contract for developing tools to break into enemy computers. The companies are also teaming up to build a National Cyber Range, a model of the Internet for testing advanced techniques.
 Military experts said Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics, which have long been major players in the Pentagon's security efforts, are leading the push into offensive cyberwarfare, along with the Raytheon unit. This involves finding vulnerabilities in other countries' computer systems and developing software tools to exploit them, either to steal sensitive information or disable the networks. 
 Mr. Chase and Mr. Gillette said the Raytheon unit, which has about 100 employees, grew out of a company they started with friends at Florida Institute of Technology that concentrated on helping software makers find flaws in their own products. Over the last several years, their focus shifted to the military and intelligence agencies, which wanted to use their analytic tools to detect vulnerabilities and intrusions previously unnoticed. 
 Like other contractors, the Raytheon teams set up ''honey pots,'' the equivalent of sting operations, to lure hackers into digital cul-de-sacs that mimic Pentagon Web sites. They then capture the attackers' codes and create defenses for them. 
 And since most of the world's computers run on the Windows or the Linux systems, their work has also provided a growing window into how to attack foreign networks in any cyberwar.
 ''It takes a nonconformist to excel at what we do,'' said Mr. Gillette, a tanned surfing aficionado who looks like a 1950s hipster in his T-shirts with rolled-up sleeves. 
 The company, which would allow interviews with other employees only on the condition that their last names not be used because of security concerns, hired one of its top young workers, Dustin, after he won two major hacking contests and dropped out of college. ''I always approach it like a game, and it's been fun,'' said Dustin, now 22.
 Another engineer, known as Jolly, joined Raytheon in April after earning a master's degree in computer security at DePaul University in Chicago. ''You think defense contractors, and you think bureaucracy, and not necessarily a lot of interesting and challenging projects,'' he said. 
 The Pentagon's interest in cyberwarfare has reached ''religious intensity,'' said Daniel T. Kuehl, a military historian at the National Defense University. And the changes carry through to soldiers being trained to defend and attack computer and wireless networks out on the battlefield.
 That shift can be seen in the remaking of organizations like the Association of Old Crows, a professional group that includes contractors and military personnel. 
 The Old Crows have deep roots in what has long been known as electronic warfare -- the use of radar and radio technologies for jamming and deception.
 But the financing for electronic warfare had slowed recently, prompting the Old Crows to set up a broader information-operations branch last year and establish a new trade journal to focus on cyberwarfare.
 The career of Joel Harding, the director of the group's Information Operations Institute, exemplifies the increasing role that computing and the Internet are playing in the military.
 A 20-year veteran of military intelligence, Mr. Harding shifted in 1996 into one of the earliest commands that studied government-sponsored computer hacker programs. After leaving the military, he took a job as an analyst at SAIC, a large contractor developing computer applications for military and intelligence agencies.
 Mr. Harding estimates that there are now 3,000 to 5,000 information operations specialists in the military and 50,000 to 70,000 soldiers involved in general computer operations. Adding specialists in electronic warfare, deception and other areas could bring the total number of information operations personnel to as many as 88,700, he said.

HEADLINE: Barriers to Brooklyn Fall Slowly for Nets

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Will the Nets ever play basketball in Brooklyn?
 The question is impossible to answer nearly six years since Bruce C. Ratner hatched the idea when he led the successful bid to acquire the Nets for $300 million. 
 Since then, the Mets, the Yankees and the Devils have moved into new homes -- but the Nets still play at the Izod Center in East Rutherford, N.J., where they lose tens of millions of dollars annually as tenants of the state. And Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark is beckoning them to skip Brooklyn to join the Devils in his city's $375 million Prudential Center, which opened in 2007.
 ''We would attend their games in Newark,'' said Councilwoman Letitia James, who represents the Prospect Heights neighborhood where the Nets' arena is to be built as the centerpiece of the $4 billion Atlantic Yards development. ''I'll sponsor the buses to go there.''
 Troubled by litigation, Forest City Ratner, Ratner's real estate development company, has not fully cleared the full 22-acre site where the arena, the Barclays Center, would rise. 
 No work has been done since the end of last year on land that is a hodgepodge of empty lots and buildings and the Long Island Rail Road's Vanderbilt Yards. Forest City has neither begun to pay the Metropolitan Transportation Authority the $100 million they agreed to for development rights over the yards -- and is negotiating the price downward -- nor begun to move the tracks to a far end of the site. Forest City still faces legal and financial challenges, but it contends they have eased enough to unequivocally predict the arena's opening for the 2011-12 season.
 ''It's done, inevitable, it's imminent, it's going to happen this year,'' said Brett Yormark, the Nets' chief executive. After a number of failed predictions for when the Nets would move into the arena, he said: ''We're on schedule. There's more certainty than there's ever been.''
 His confidence rests on two factors. First, a state appellate court's May 15 dismissal of a lawsuit organized by an alliance of 21 community groups, Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn and filed by nine property owners and tenants. If the expected appeal fails, the state can use eminent domain to seize the remaining properties.
 Second, the recession that appeared to level the hope of financing the arena is abating, opening up clogged credit markets to the possibility of selling up to $600 million in bonds.
 Gregory B. Carey, a managing director of Goldman Sachs, which is the co-leader of the financing with Barclays Bank, said the improving economy and outlook for municipal bonds pointed to an increasingly likely chance of financing the arena, barring a legal surprise.
 ''We're in tough times, but it's looking good,'' said Carey, who engineered the second financing of the new Yankee Stadium this year, including $258.9 million in tax-exempt bonds. But the stadium was nearly done when it sought the additional bonds.
 Mike Stanton, publisher of The Bond Buyer, said that if the financing was priced and structured the way the Yankees' and the Mets' stadiums were this year, ''They should have no trouble getting it done.''
 But Forest City must break ground by Dec. 31 to meet the Internal Revenue Service's deadline to sell tax-exempt bonds. If the developer misses the deadline, financing costs will leap. ''Bruce and I have never talked about missing that deadline,'' Yormark said.
 The same deadline appears to loom for the 20-year, $400 million naming-rights deal between the Nets and Barclays. Barclays extended the sponsorship beyond last year because of construction delays, but a spokesman refused to say if it would do so again.
 Daniel Goldstein, a leader and spokesman of Develop Don't Destroy, said he did not believe Forest City would meet the deadline, not with his group's appeal of the eminent domain decision and intention to file more lawsuits to delay the project until its death. 
 ''They're not going to get financing this year or control of the land this year,'' Goldstein said in his condominium on Pacific Street, which would be about midcourt of the proposed arena. He, his wife and baby daughter are the only occupants of the nine-story building, the other 30 unit owners having long ago accepted buyout offers. 
 ''I don't even think they know what will make them give up,'' he said.
 Forest City is not surrendering and contends only a restraining order can stop the eminent domain process and construction. But Yormark's confidence is mixed with testiness that Forest City cannot rid itself of Goldstein or the legal aggressiveness displayed by Develop Don't Destroy.
 ''I have no admiration for anyone who puts his personal interests before the people's interests,'' Yormark said. 
 Goldstein said, ''The selfish party is his boss, Bruce Ratner, who wants public land for a song, private property confiscated by eminent domain and the taxpayers to pay hundreds of millions of dollars toward his enrichment.''
 (Forest City was the development partner for the Midtown headquarters of The New York Times Company.)
 Forest City Ratner would not disclose its legal fees since 2006 to fight the lawsuits filed or financed by Develop Don't Destroy, but the cost of the arena has soared to at least $950 million, from $637 million. Goldstein said Develop Don't Destroy had raised $1 million from 4,000 donors to sue Forest City and state agencies, including the Empire State Development Corporation.
 If Develop Don't Destroy's appeal fails, or isn't considered, it vows to file more lawsuits in the belief that further litigation will impede Forest City's financing and force it to face more public hearings and amendments to governmental approvals it has received.
 Forest City has won all 23 decisions in the legal battle, but the time taken to fight each motion and appeal has caused delay after delay. Ratner once hoped that the Nets would be in Brooklyn by 2006. The postponed move-in dates have prevented Ratner from capitalizing on having an Eastern Division power that lost the N.B.A. finals in 2002 and 2003. In each of the last two seasons, the Nets have won just 34 games.
 The Nets have not averaged more than 16,925 fans -- 3,000 short of the Izod Center's capacity -- this decade. How many current fans would go to Brooklyn, and how many new fans will have to be developed to fill the arena?
 Since acquiring the Nets, Forest City Enterprises, Ratner's parent company, has sustained pretax losses of $111.9 million, including $76 million in the year ended Jan. 31. The team's dozens of investors have sustained $353 million in pretax losses, about half of it from amortization. Forest City became responsible for 54 percent of the team's losses in the year ended Jan. 31, a larger share than it had ever absorbed. On the positive side, it has future sponsorship commitments for the arena of $500 million, 80 percent of it from Barclays.
 The team desperately needs the arena, which was designed by Frank Gehry. But to reduce its cost to $800 million or less, it could lose Gehry. The arena was to be sheathed in glass and topped with a running track and an ice rink. But Forest City has consulted with other architects, including Ellerbe Becket, in Kansas City, Mo., to slash the price and make it easier to finance.
 Yormark said that the arena would reflect Gehry's vision but that the savings would come mainly through cutting square footage. ''As of now, Frank is still in,'' he said. 
 Still, Ellerbe Becket, which is known for its design of the Conseco Fieldhouse for the Indiana Pacers, acknowledged last week that it had been assessing Gehry's design since late last year. 
 Gehry, who declined to comment through a spokesman, recently cast doubt on the Atlantic Yards, for which he is the master architect, coming to fruition. He retracted his statement. But if the shape and look of the arena changes enough to meet economic needs, it may not meet Gehry's standards.
 Meanwhile, Newark awaits the Nets -- at least for the two preseason games they will play in the Prudential Center.
 ''We'd love to have them here,'' said Robert G. Sommer, the president of Rock Entertainment Management, an arena subsidiary. ''They'd never leave.''

HEADLINE: Branching Out in Science

BYLINE: By SCOTT A. McGREGOR. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I LOVED chemistry, biology and electronics as a kid. In grade school I was a runner-up in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search. My project dealt with different crystalline forms of the chemical element selenium. However, I wasn't able to turn my interest in science into a job until much later. 
 As a teenager, I washed dishes in a restaurant and was a telephone solicitor for a real estate company. I was the one who called people at dinnertime, telling them they had won a prize and that if they would go look at a certain property, they could pick up the prize. Of course the goal was to have them buy. You learn about rejection in a job like that. 
 I attended Stanford. I wanted to study computer science, but the school didn't offer it as an undergraduate major at the time. I switched between majoring in psychology, economics and math and finally decided on psychology. I got a B.A. degree in psychology simultaneously with an M.S. degree in computer science and computer engineering. 
 Studying psychology allowed me to combine my interest in computer science with the way people think. I was focused on artificial intelligence, which at the time involved exploring how to have computers do some simple tasks or understand speech.
 My senior year, I worked for Xerox in the Palo Alto Research Center. It was fascinating -- the company was working on laser printers, graphics displays and several other technological developments that we take for granted today. I wrote software for graphical user interfaces.
 After graduating, I worked at Xerox for several years, and then at Microsoft for two years, leading the team that developed the first version of the Windows operating system, Windows 1.0. I worked for several other software companies, then joined Philips Semiconductors as head of the emerging-business unit in 1998. After working in software for 20 years, I wanted to do something different. 
 I enjoy trying new things and working in areas in which I'm less than comfortable. I've also learned that the most significant thing about a job for me, more so than what I do, is liking and respecting the people around me. It's also important that we share the same values.
 In 2001, I was promoted to president and C.E.O. of the Philips Semiconductors division, and my family and I moved to the Netherlands for three and a half years. We lived in a house with a thatched roof. Our time there was interesting, but bittersweet. The war in Iraq started and it helped define us as a family and as Americans. 
 I returned to the United States in 2005 to join Broadcom as C.E.O. The semiconductor industry is cyclical, and I started during a downward cycle. To manage well in this industry, you have to make sure you don't get carried away in an upturn and that you have the cash to weather a downturn and invest in the future.
 We've made over 40 acquisitions in 10 years, which has allowed us to bring in new ideas. I believe you should select companies based on the quality of their employees. You should integrate the team quickly and give each person an important role. We want employees to feel inspired and that they gained something from the merger. Almost everyone in the companies we have acquired has stayed with us.
 Our chips are in the wireless game controller for the Nintendo Wii, enable the Bluetooth technology in cellphones, and power set-top boxes sitting on televisions. We have a strong patent portfolio that was tested in litigation with Qualcomm, but in April we settled our differences. 
 Before I joined Broadcom, there were some issues related to stock options that were backdated years earlier. While there is some lingering litigation, the company has moved on and we're focused on the next big things in communications and converging technologies.

HEADLINE: My Personal Credit Crisis

 BODY:
While I can sympathize somewhat with Edmund L. Andrews and what he went through (May 17), his comment that ''I took a certain pride that I outlasted two of my three mortgage lenders'' actually left me angered. I am not a fan of these mortgage companies, but a big reason they failed was that borrowers like Andrews felt that it was O.K. to live beyond their means and not do everything they could to honor contracts they signed.
 I'm not really sure why he's gloating over a failure he had a role in and can't help wondering how many people there are like him who have an incredibly large hand in this mess and still feel like victims.
 JOSH COHEN San Francisco 
 The excruciating details of Edmund L. Andrews's personal finances, combined with his reputation as an economics journalist, make this a courageous essay. The story is especially powerful because he does not portray the mortgage broker or lender employees as villains.
 The entire country was lulled into a materialistic mind-set in recent years, and the tale is a sober reminder that our economic future is complicated, as families readjust on spending, industries readjust on production, unemployment rises and housing prices continue to fall. As our government sinks deeper into record debt, any waste or reckless public spending by political leaders would be unconscionable.
 We live in the D.C. area, and I must point out that Andrews's home and lifestyle were certainly not among the most excessive. Mistakes were made, and Andrews was brave and generous to outline his experiences for readers.
 SUSAN FROETSCHEL Takoma Park, Md.
 In Edmund L. Andrews's poignant description of his economic hardships while trying to budget his household expenses, he reveals not only his succumbing to the seductions of a subprime mortgage and credit-card lures, but also something else -- his attempt to support two families. Based on what I read in the article, Andrews appears to support his two children generously, while his present wife's ex-husband seems to exempt himself from any financial responsibility to support his children, not even paying for their plane tickets to visit him. Have all adult parties had a conversation about this? Suze Orman would recommend one.
 MITZI WITKIN New York
 I can only hope that I am not the only reader whose primary reaction to Edmund L. Andrews's confessional was disgust. There can be no doubt that there were victims of abusive mortgage practices, but Andrews and his wife were victims of only their own greed and their inability (or unwillingness) to live within their means.
 I suppose we were supposed to feel sympathy for his sleepless nights and anxiety attacks. If only he had thought of that before running up bills for beach houses and purchases at Gap Kids. That we the taxpayers may now end up footing the bill for their indiscretions is maddening. One can only hope that the advances on his book, and whatever he earned writing this article, will be confiscated and applied to his debt.
 PAUL WOEHRLE Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
 Edmund L. Andrews reports that his home increased in value, so he was apparently not trapped ''underwater'' as so many unfortunate people have been. Why did (does) he not sell the house, pay off his debts and rent an apartment that he can afford? Without an explanation for this, it appears that he remains in the grip of the denial of reality that caused the trouble in the first place.
 LISA MCILWAIN Oregon City, Ore.
 Edmund L. Andrews's odd confessional teaches us little, other than laying bare his propensity to shift blame to others, including his innocent erstwhile and current wives, and his lender, just as a junkie implicates the dealer. His persistence in spending what he did not have is not a tale for our times, but of moral obtuseness of a very personal sort, as he had the ability and training to avoid his errors. The great irony of this story is that at a time when honest millions are capsized by economic and historical forces beyond their control, Andrews is truly the author of his woes. 
 ANDREW J. GREEN Overland Park, Kan.
 Although I enjoyed Edmund L. Andrews's presentation of how easy it is to fall into ridiculous debt, the article left me with a simmering anger. This is why, in our country, the rich get richer and the poor stay right where they are. Andrews will probably get to keep his house, because we, the taxpayers, are going to refinance all these mortgages that no one should have been allowed to begin with. Or perhaps because the bank will never get around to foreclosing.
 The sum that Andrews has left after alimony payments that he ''can't live on'' is more than my household's monthly income. But I, who have dutifully paid more than the average mortgage payment in rent for decades now, because I know that I can't afford a house, I, who did nothing to contribute to this financial meltdown, I will get nothing. Rent payments don't get tax credits. Renters who rack up credit cards can't borrow against their houses to reduce their interest rates. And because we shell out so much in rent, get no tax breaks and can't offer our homes up as collateral for low-interest rates, we are unlikely to ever save enough to own our own houses and join the ranks of those who can play the system. If my husband loses his job or I don't find a new one and we don't pay rent for eight months, we will be evicted. I am afraid that our society's response to this financial crisis will simply reinforce the existing logic. Be responsible, and you will never win. Gamble big and lose, and someone else will pay the bill. We justify mortgage bailouts because if we don't, ''everyone will lose their homes.'' Then they would be renters, just like me. How horrible.
 JUSTINE BUCK QUIJADA Bronx, N.Y.
 I had frankly struggled over the past many months to appreciate the scale of the subprime mess and the many delinquencies that have occurred. The aggregated defaults -- with numbers in the billions of dollars -- lost all sense of perspective and understanding for me. But Edmund L. Andrews and his family's story really humanized the issue better than all the bank failures could.
 I suggest The New York Times give him a big bonus so he can square up with Chase, get on with life and refocus his energies on being the wonderful reporter that he obviously is.
 BRUCE A. PELLEGRINO Far Hills, N.J.
 Edmund L. Andrews neglected to include a character in his drama . . . me. I am a hardworking, financially responsible taxpayer who must now indirectly subsidize his financial indiscretions with my tax dollars. Incidentally, the State of New Jersey is considering cutting back on benefit payments to individuals with developmental disabilities (such as my son) due to the ongoing financial crisis. If you wish to toss and turn in your sleep, Mr. Andrews, you may.
 THOMAS R. BONIELLO Mountainside, N.J.
 Edmund L. Andrews is to be congratulated on the unusual degree of candor he displays. I suppose that if the article itself generates enough interest in the book from which it is said to be adapted, it is we readers who will write the final chapter in this tale of financial woe. By buying copies of the book, we can ourselves perhaps free the author and his wife just before the train arrives. It is an odd feeling. But sign me up!

EIFFEL'S TOWER
 And the World's Fair Where Buffalo Bill Beguiled Paris, the Artists Quarreled, and Thomas Edison Became a Count
 By Jill Jonnes
 Illustrated. 354 pp. Viking. $27.95
 PARIS FROM THE GROUND UP
 By James H. S. McGregor
 Illustrated. 327 pp. The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $29.95
 Ever since its appearance on the Parisian skyline in 1889, the Eiffel Tower has drawn criticism and praise aplenty. Among its earliest detractors, Guy de Maupassant saw the tower as an affront to his nation's proud cultural heritage and dined regularly in its restaurant because that was the one spot in Paris from which he didn't have to look upon ''this giant and disgraceful skeleton.'' (Otherwise, he complained, ''you see it from everywhere . . . an unavoidable and horrid nightmare.'') Maupassant's contemporary Paul Gauguin stood at the opposite end of the spectrum, hailing the tower as a ''triumph of iron'' and an exciting new art form. But across the board, as Roland Barthes has noted, the Eiffel Tower ''attracts meaning, the way a lightning rod attracts thunderbolts.'' Indeed, to offer an opinion of this monument is to comment, wittingly or otherwise, on the past, present and future of French civilization. 
 In ''Eiffel's Tower: And the World's Fair Where Buffalo Bill Beguiled Paris, the Artists Quarreled, and Thomas Edison Became a Count,'' Jill Jonnes examines -- with splendid attention to detail, if not always with writerly finesse -- the importance the tower assumed in its own historical moment. Built by the engineer Gustave Eiffel as the centerpiece of the 1889 Exposition Universelle, the vaulting iron structure was intended, Jonnes writes, as ''a potent symbol of French modern industrial might, a towering edifice that would exalt science and technology, assert France's superiority over its rivals (especially America) and entice millions to visit Paris.'' These were pressing goals, for by 1889, the French government had -- after a century of pendulum swings between the forces of revolution and reaction -- reinvented itself yet again, as the Third Republic. To other European leaders, monarchs almost to a man (or woman), this was an unwelcome development; faced with their opposition, France sorely needed to assert the health and robustness of its new regime. The United States posed a somewhat different threat: its industries were booming, its cities were expanding and its people had recently erected the world's tallest structure, the Washington Monument. About 1,000 feet high, Eiffel's tower would be almost twice the height of that daring obelisk -- and so put the Americans in their place.
 It would be misleading, however, to suggest that such broad-based international-affairs issues dominate ''Eiffel's Tower,'' which instead recounts a series of smaller, more personal stories that took the 1889 exposition as their backdrop. As her subtitle reveals, Jonnes, the author of ''Conquering Gotham'' and ''Empires of Light,'' takes a remarkable cast of characters and documents their respective experiences at the fair. Buffalo Bill, for instance, brought his crowd-pleasing Wild West revue to Paris for the occasion, while Thomas Edison traveled there to unveil his new and improved phonograph; both men were overnight sensations -- as was Bill's star performer, Annie Oakley, whom the polygamous king of Senegal attempted to buy for 100,000 francs. The artists who displayed their work at the exposition included James McNeill Whistler, whose portrait of Lady Archibald Campbell won a gold medal, and Gauguin, who didn't sell a single painting but who did manage to pocket an exotic sculpture fragment that he found at the fair's Khmer temple. Each of these characters -- in different ways and to varying degrees -- used the fair as a forum for an idea or a worldview that was to have lasting implications for French culture. (Though this statement may sound dubious in regard to Buffalo Bill, Jonnes credits him with inspiring the abiding ''French love affair'' with the Wild West. Which, moreover, had some surprising early adopters: ''After attending the Wild West show, Paul Gauguin bought a Stetson to wear.'')
 Yet of all the exposition's trailblazers, none is obviously more central to Jonnes's narrative than Gustave Eiffel, the visionary engineer-cum-millionaire whose success as a builder of bridges and aqueducts emboldened him to apply his innovative technology to the construction of the tower. In so doing, he offended his nation's traditionalists, several prominent writers, artists and architects among them. While Eiffel hurried to get the thing built in time for the exposition's opening, his adversaries condemned it as ''a black and gigantic factory chimney,'' ''a lighthouse, a nail, a chandelier'' and a ''funnel planted on its fat butt.'' (This last insult came courtesy of Charles Garnier, the architect responsible for the city's magnificent Paris Opera, whose ornate Beaux-Arts design could not have been more different from the radically pared-down, industrial look of Eiffel's creation.) As has too often been the case in debates about ''French'' taste, the attack on modern style was laced with anti-Semitism: on the basis of his last name, Eiffel, a French Catholic, was branded ''nothing more nor less than a German Jew,'' and his masterpiece ''une tour juive.'' 
 Unfazed by the critics, Eiffel defended his choices on aesthetic as well as technical grounds. ''I believe that the tower will have its own beauty,'' he declared. ''The first principle of architectural beauty is that the essential lines of a construction be determined by a perfect appropriateness to its use. What was the main obstacle I had to overcome in designing the tower? Its resistance to wind. And I submit that the curves of its four piers as produced by our calculations, rising from an enormous base and narrowing toward the top, will give a great impression of strength and beauty.'' Although Jonnes does not make this point, her protagonist's brief, elegant statement of form-follows-function anticipates some of the 20th century's most significant achievements in architecture and design. In this respect, Eiffel's tower effectively -- and literally -- embedded the modern in the French cultural landscape.
 In James H. S. McGregor's ''Paris From the Ground Up'' -- which offers an informative history of the city's art and architecture -- the Eiffel Tower necessarily plays a smaller role, occupying only four pages of a book that, by contrast, devotes a 30-page chapter to the Cathedral of Notre Dame. But those four pages are invaluable, as they explain with admirable economy a crucial fact that Jonnes, oddly, never mentions: Eiffel's engineering genius consisted in combining linear and curvilinear support systems -- rectilinear cross-braced pylons and arches. This insight is typical of McGregor, who has written three other books in the From the Ground Up series and who is at his best when elaborating on the technical aspects of Paris's buildings. 
 Unfortunately, McGregor sometimes carries this interest too far. His Notre Dame chapter, for example, quickly goes from illuminating to mind-numbing, for he seems never to have met a Gothic architectural term he didn't like. Transept and buttress; trumeau and nave; tympanum, apse and archivolt -- the gang's all here, as well it should be. Yet as the author remarks of the cathedral's exterior decorations: ''The array is dizzying both to the eye and to the mind,'' and not in a good way. By the same token, in cataloging at such length what it once took to create ''an architecture of the sky'' -- as Gothic structures have been called -- McGregor indirectly reveals what Eiffel, seven centuries later, was up against when he redefined this concept for the modern age.

HEADLINE: What About the Valley After the Rally?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHY have investors been so cheery of late? One reason may be the relative calm on Wall Street. 
 The numbers indeed show that the market has been fairly sedate lately. The most closely followed gauge of market fear is the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, and it's been sinking. 
 Last week, the VIX, as the index is commonly called, fell below 30 for the first time since September, about the time that the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off a wave of panic in the financial markets. 
 The VIX reached 50 earlier this year and hit 80 last fall.
 Some market bulls say this ebb in the volatility numbers confirms that the rally that began in early March is real, because it shows that much of the anxiety that scared investors away from stocks appears to be dissipating. 
 But don't assume that volatility is gone for good.
 History shows that rallies that emerge from the depths of bear markets are almost always followed by a ''retesting'' of those market lows. ''We always tend to get a very sharp rally off a bear market low,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for Standard & Poor's. ''And like it or not, we tend to get a decline thereafter, as the market digests what it just gained.''
 Sometimes, the retests can be mild. For example, after the recovery rally that took place at the end of the 1982 bear market, the S.& P. 500-stock index fell about 4 percent. 
 But retests can also be frightening. After stocks rallied in October 2002, the S.& P. 500 suffered another scare that pushed stock prices lower by 15 percent.
 Mr. Stovall studied retests going back to 1957, and found that the average such event lowered stock prices about 7 percent. But those that followed ''mega downturns'' -- like the one the market suffered over the last year or two -- took down the S.& P. by 14 percent, on average. 
 So let's assume that the rally that began in early March peaked on May 8, with the S.& P. 500 at 929. A correction of 14 percent would bring down the index to 799. Based on its current level, the market would have to fall an additional 13 percent or so to reach that level.
 ''If we're going to go through a retest that could be as severe as a correction -- a 10 percent to 20 percent decline -- I would tend to think that panic will return,'' Mr. Stovall said.
 Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston, agrees that volatility will stage a comeback. He said he expected another wave of selling to erase about half of the 36 percent gain that stocks have achieved since their March lows. That means that even though volatility tends to decline during the summer months, he said, ''the next few months will see higher volatility than the past two to three months of relatively steady gains.'' 
 To be sure, that volatility may not be as severe as it was when stocks were setting their bear market lows. 
 For instance, when the 2000-02 bear market ended on Oct. 9, 2002, the VIX climbed as high as 42 before falling back into the low 20s. During the subsequent retest, the VIX climbed again, but never made it all the way back above 40.
 Still, there are plenty of reasons to believe that volatility will re-emerge soon.
 For starters, Mr. Kleintop said, there's the relative uncertainty still surrounding the economy. Both bulls and bears may overreact to economic reports in the coming weeks, giving stocks a bumpy few months, he said.
 Adding to the potential for stronger-than-expected volatility is the tremendous appetite for risk-taking that many investors showed in the first eight weeks after global markets started recovering in early March. 
 During that period, for example, investors put more new money to work in risky emerging-market stock funds -- which invest in countries like China, India and Russia -- than they invested in domestic stock funds, European portfolios and Japanese equity funds combined. 
 So, if the global markets stumble, there's a good chance that investors' current courage will turn into another bout of fear, which will spill over into a drop in domestic stocks. 
 Is the bear market really over? Watch the VIX.

HEADLINE: Sheets Flap, Socks Dance And Towels Just Hang Out

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
In the Hunts Point neighborhood of the Bronx, a family's assortment of blue jeans bobbed like invisible people dancing on a puppet string. At 181st Street and Audubon Avenue in Manhattan, yellow panties shamelessly waved to Washington Heights. 
 And outside a bathroom window two stories above Bailey Avenue in Kingsbridge Heights, another Bronx neighborhood, was a more mundane tableau: a white washcloth, a red towel.
As the temperature goes up, so does the quantity and the variety of items fluttering in the air across New York, where clotheslines hung outside apartment buildings, a hallmark of tenement life a century ago, have stubbornly defied the elements, the ages, the landlord and the fluff 'n' fold.
 This year, it seems, immigration, environmentalism and the penny-pinching of recession have combined to make the lines a more familiar sight in both lower-income and gentrifying neighborhoods, as well as in suburbs, where sheets and towels blowing in a breeze are a sign that summer has arrived. 
 In buildings with satellite dishes, in apartments with high-tech and high-speed appliances, residents still open their windows, pin their laundry to a line and send it squeakily out into the sunshine, which takes about five hours to do what a coin-operated dryer does in 45 minutes. 
 Some do it to save money, others to save the planet -- there's a nonprofit group called Project Laundry List that promotes clotheslines as a way to reduce climate change. Many simply prefer the feel and smell of clothes slowly dried by sun and air, or the freedom from hauling smelly baskets downstairs or down the block.
 Environmental benefits are the reason Eric Thomas, 32, a freelance copy writer, strung up five lines in his apartment in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn, even though his doorman building has a laundry room in the basement. ''I'm no longer scrambling for quarters, but that's less important to me than the energy,'' he said. Bernadette Schill, 71, the owner of the white washcloth and red towel in Kingsbridge Heights, said that hanging the wash outside is just part of her routine. ''I don't even think about it,'' she said. ''Go put it on the line.''
 In her hilly working-class neighborhood, with no shortage of 8-minutes-per-quarter Laundromats, many others were opting to use the free air instead. There were 10 clotheslines strung from pulleys outside the windows of her four-story, nine-unit building at 3060 Bailey Avenue and the one next door.
 In 1909, clotheslines were as much a part of the defining look of the city as the front stoop. The sails of linens and laundry stretching across historical photographs impart a strange nautical aspect to the buildings, as if they rested not on the street but on the sea.
 A century later, there are still plenty: short ones at the corners of buildings high above Mount Hope in the Bronx and long ones that run from back windows to tall poles behind brownstones in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. Some lines are high enough that when bare, they can be confused with telephone and power wires, others low enough that the logos on T-shirts are readable.
 One recent afternoon, Angel Martinez, the superintendent of a red-brick walk-up at 744 Coster Street, in the South Bronx, walked into his narrow kitchen, carefully avoiding stepping on Mimi, his pet ferret, where he faced two options: a small automatic dryer, and two clotheslines -- one stretching outside to the living room window, one to the bathroom window. On this 66-degree day, his lines were empty except for a white bath mat hung the night before. He inherited the lines, just as he inherited the narrow kitchen: they were there when he moved in years ago. ''We started to use it,'' said Mr. Martinez, 51. 
 Why? ''Because it's there.''
 Among the many provisions and restrictions in the city's code covering housing maintenance, clotheslines are not mentioned. Yet many tenants worry that the practice will get them into trouble, and they are often vague, when pressed, as to the ownership of the clothes dangling outside their apartment windows. Some in rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments have gotten into disputes with their landlords over the removal of clotheslines, claiming it amounted to a reduction in building services. 
 One landlord in the Bronx, the Fordham Bedford Housing Corporation, which manages nearly 100 buildings, including 3060 Bailey Avenue, often removes clotheslines when renovating windows. But ''people hook them back up again,'' said John M. Reilly, the group's executive director. ''I'm sure sometimes they get a little help from the building's super.''
 In a typical setup, hooks are drilled into the building at the edge of the window frame, pulleys are attached to the hooks and the lines -- cotton, plastic, wire-- are fed through. Many hardware stores sell the equipment (plastic pulleys can be had for $2.99), but installation is another matter. 
 One woman in a brownstone in Carroll Gardens recalled the time she nervously climbed an old metal pole in the backyard to fix her jammed line, three stories up. 
 The New York clothesline has its own methods and manners, seasons and supplies, ethnic distinctions and class divisions. In working-class neighborhoods, they are often banners marking buildings as home to poor immigrants. In gentrifying areas, they mark the turf as home to energy-conscious or frugal hipsters.
 People use the lines at all hours of the day and night, in any weather short of a downpour. Strong winds or broken lines have been known to scatter people's wash around the block or into tree branches. Summer is the high season, but on a cold gray October morning in the Fordham section of the Bronx, a lone pair of pants dangled from a line at the back of 2650 Bainbridge Avenue.
 Over the decades, clotheslines have occasionally helped kill New Yorkers and, just as frequently, have helped rescue them. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, lines were often taken down and used by the despondent as a means of committing suicide. On July 30, 1910, a 7-year-old boy named Isidore Bloom, who was playing near the roof of his five-floor apartment building in Chinatown, lost his balance and fell. Four of the building's five clotheslines snapped on his way down, but the fifth did not, and Isidore held on. 
 Ms. Schill's clothesline, which runs diagonally from her bathroom window to her living room window, has not done such noble service. But it has kept her family in fresh clothes. 
 Years ago, she had another clothesline outside the bathroom, one that stretched to the building next door. Ms. Schill shared the line with the woman in the opposite apartment, an unlikely connection on the thinnest of strings. The other woman died, and eventually the line was removed. 
 Ms. Schill misses that clothesline sometimes. And her neighbor, too.

HEADLINE: New York: Metropolis Born of a Merger

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
In 1898, modern New York City was born when the City of Brooklyn merged with the counties that encompassed Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. The unification helped propel the metropolis originally known as ''Greater New York'' on its rise to becoming a pre-eminent global center for trade, industry, finance, media and culture. 
 Some who have studied New York, like the urban activist Jane Jacobs, have argued that the merger helped the ascent of the city as a whole, and Manhattan in particular, at the expense of the other boroughs. 
 Many Staten Island residents felt so aggrieved by what they believed was the shortchanging of their borough that they voted in 1993 to secede from New York City, a bold move that was thwarted by Albany. 
 Through the years, the various scandals and troubles the city has endured -- particularly the fiscal crisis of the 1970s -- made it a national symbol of government gone awry. But Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, contends that the merger was a boon to all the boroughs by creating a highly centralized government capable of attracting high-caliber managers who have helped the city adapt. 
 ''The story of the last 30 years is that New York government has gotten better and more efficient,'' Mr. Moss said, ''while government in the suburbs has gotten more expensive and worse.''

HEADLINE: New Home, New Job and New Moves

BYLINE: By ROSLYN SULCAS

 BODY:
ON a cold, clear morning in January, Alexei Ratmansky stood on the corner of Avenue of the Americas and 11th Street. The current darling of the ballet world had just officially assumed his five-year position as artist in residence with American Ballet Theater. And although he wouldn't be moving here until the spring, he was obliged to tackle a horrible reality that no amount of personal success could make go away: choosing a school for his 11-year-old son.
 Which is why he was standing with his wife, Tatiana, and their son, Vasily, outside P.S. 41 in Greenwich Village looking slightly apprehensive. A tour of the school, given by an extravagantly friendly staffer, ensued. Mr. Ratmansky looked dazed as they were whirled through the building.
 ''What does it cost?'' he asked at one point, prompting a quick tutorial on the differences between public and private schooling from American Ballet Theater's education director. In Moscow, where Mr. Ratmansky, 40, was the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 2004 to 2008, Vasily attended a public school -- the norm there, Ms. Ratmansky said. 
 While the school tours were an instant lesson in the economic and social politics of New York City, they were hardly the first adjustment Mr. Ratmansky would be forced to make in the ensuing days and months. The announcement of his appointment at Ballet Theater in September had caused almost unprecedented excitement in the ballet world. 
 Quite aside from Mr. Ratmansky's reputation -- his additions to the Bolshoi repertory of reworked Soviet-era classics like ''The Bright Stream'' and ''The Flames of Paris'' were widely acclaimed; the two works he created for the New York City Ballet, ''Russian Seasons'' and ''Concerto DSCH,'' were smash hits. Adding spice to the news, Mr. Ratmansky's negotiations with City Ballet for its resident choreographer position had fallen through months earlier, putting Ballet Theater -- a company with a far more conservative reputation and approach -- in the unfamiliar position of being the buzz-worthy innovator.
 Mr. Ratmansky's first encounter with Ballet Theater dancers came in January, when he observed rehearsals in preparation for casting ''On the Dnieper.'' That ballet will have its premiere Monday night at the Metropolitan Opera House, but back then it was hardly Mr. Ratmansky's top priority. First he needed to make a full-length ballet for the Kirov Ballet, a few smaller pieces elsewhere and tie up loose ends in Moscow.
 And there was a party to attend, an introduction to the reliance of companies like Ballet Theater on the wealthy donors who end up being primary supporters of the arts. Those donors and assorted cultural figures sipped Champagne at the Upper East Side town house of Ali and Monica Wambold, as Mr. Ratmansky, dressed in black pants and shirt, a slim gold ring in one ear, stood quietly with his wife and son to one side.
 There is an odd disconnect between Mr. Ratmansky's quiet, private persona and the It Boy status he has attained in the ballet world. He obviously is not drawn to the spotlight, yet he successfully ran the huge Bolshoi company, a famously difficult place to work.
 ''I had to make myself be more outspoken and be heard,'' he said. ''You have no choice. But I had to force myself to be that kind of person.''
 At the party, however, Mr. Ratmansky had no obligations apart from chatting with well-wishers and enduring a short yet lavishly complimentary toast by Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director. As Mr. McKenzie spoke, Mr. Ratmansky gave a self-deprecating ''we'll see'' grimace. Vasily read a comic on the sofa.
 A few months later, in mid-April, Mr. Ratmansky arrived for good, moving into a furnished apartment not far from Ballet Theater's downtown studios while his wife waited for Vasily to finish school in Moscow. He said his most important possession was the Prokofiev score of ''On the Dnieper,'' a little-known work commissioned by Serge Lifar, the director of the Paris Opera Ballet. The ballet met with little success at its 1932 premiere, and the music was recorded for the first time only in 1994.
 ''That this score is so little known intrigued me for a long time,'' Mr. Ratmansky said. ''Prokofiev and Lifar created a simple story: she loves him; he loves another lady, who is loved by yet another man. I thought it's a nice balance of everything: a story, a major composer. What else? The Dnieper: it's a river in the Ukraine, and I'm from the Ukraine. Maybe that.''
 Mr. Ratmansky grew up in Kiev, where his father -- a former junior gymnastic champion -- was an aeronautics engineer and his mother a psychiatrist. The family happened to be in Moscow at the time of the Bolshoi ballet school entry auditions one year, and on a whim Mr. Ratmansky, then 10, went. ''I was sure I wouldn't be accepted,'' he said. ''There were literally hundreds of children for each available place. And if I hadn't been taken, it wouldn't have been a drama.''
 Of course he was accepted. He was a good dancer, he said, but ''not the best at anything.'' (That would have been his classmate Vladimir Malakhov, later a principal at Ballet Theater.)
 Early on at the school he began to organize little performances, plays as well as dances, in his dormitory room. He also loved ballet history, trawling for old books and scores with his friend Yuri Burlaka (who succeeded Mr. Ratmansky at the Bolshoi last year). ''Somehow I knew I needed all that for the future,'' he said.
 When he graduated from the Bolshoi, he returned to Kiev and joined the Kiev Ballet. There he met Tatiana Kilivniuk, who joined him soon after he became part of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1992. He began to choreograph ''small things,'' mostly for Ms. Ratmansky, and three years later the Kiev company asked him to create a full-evening work. 
 ''I got 'new hope of Russian ballet' title,'' he said. ''But I didn't feel pressure of that at the beginning.''
 These days there is no shortage of pressure on Mr. Ratmansky. A crowd of expectant dancers waited in the studio on the first day of ''Dnieper'' rehearsals. Mr. Ratmansky, dressed in loose black pants and dark T-shirt, made no formal introduction to the ballet, its history or its narrative, but as he choreographed, he peppered his demonstrations with details. ''You are late with your eyes,'' he told Veronika Part. ''It should look like you are saying so much that you have too much to say.''
 The way Mr. Ratmansky filtered these emotional nuances into his steps right at the outset provided a clue to the complex appeal of his work. His dance vocabulary is classical but unfettered by academic strictures; its fluid changes between the ballet lexicon and other kinds of movement are endlessly surprising and innately expressive. 
 His vivid demonstrations to the dancers show how highly coordinated the movement needs to be to achieve the naturalness he seeks. ''The detail of his work is in his body,'' said Marcelo Gomes, one of the dancers. ''It's a really refreshing experience to have movement that expresses something.''
 At Ballet Theater Mr. Ratmansky seemed to know exactly what he wanted, often standing still and counting out the score's complex rhythms to himself before showing the steps. ''At the beginning I prepare more,'' he said after the rehearsal. ''I don't trust my imagination in the studio.'' 
 Mikhail Baryshnikov, for whom Mr. Ratmansky recently created a solo, said: ''He always has an aggressive agenda as to what a piece is about. It's always about something, even when there is no story. He's a Russian man with a very Western grip on movement.''
 Mr. Ratmansky is tall and good looking in a modest way: short dark hair, regular features. His demeanor is unvaryingly calm; not once during several months of rehearsal did he betray impatience or temper. He is not, however, impervious to the expectations of him, amplified by the clamorous success of the City Ballet pieces and his near-hire there.
 City Ballet had seemed like a perfect fit for a young, mold-breaking Russian choreographer. (After all, it was founded by another, George Balanchine.) But in the end Mr. Ratmansky's many commitments were a deterrent.
 ''It's not a secret that he wanted to go to City Ballet,'' Mr. Baryshnikov said. ''But I think he'll be happy at A.B.T. It's a very smart catch for them.''
 The City Ballet offer, Mr. Ratmansky said, spurred his decision to leave the Bolshoi, where he had felt increasingly frustrated in his creative work and by the demands of dealing with the enormous company. ''I grew up with the Bolshoi as Olympus, with gods dancing,'' he said. ''It was a great experience of my life. But Russian ballet is still centered around the past.''
 Ballet Theater's repertory is also centered around the past, with a heavy reliance on full-length classics. But bringing in Mr. Ratmansky clearly telegraphs more creative ambitions. ''I want someone here who is helping me to organize various opportunities that are in embryonic stages,'' Mr. McKenzie said, ''to have workshops, choreographic programs, areas where I think A.B.T. is frankly behind.''
 But in late spring Mr. Ratmansky was being left alone to create his ballet. Despite his unflappable demeanor, the process wasn't entirely smooth. After a few weeks of rehearsal he spoke admiringly of the dancers, but with some hesitancy about the piece. ''This is an important work for me,'' he said. ''I thought Prokofiev might help, but I must say, Shostakovich or Stravinsky feel easier for me. There is something weighty about this music.''
 After Ballet Theater's opening night performance, at which Nina Ananiashvili danced a short piece d'occasion by Mr. Ratmansky, a glittering gala celebrated the opening of the season. The Ratmanskys, perhaps unaware of the potential fund-raising implications of their presence, didn't attend. ''We wanted to get back to Vasily, and Alexei had to work the next day,'' Ms. Ratmansky explained later.
 Mr. Ratmansky was indeed hard at work the next day. He still had six minutes of his ballet to create, not inconsiderable given that it had taken an hour of work to make about 40 seconds of a complicated crowd scene days earlier.
 Choreographing a solo on Gennadi Saveliev and Jose Manuel Carreno in one of the studios at the Met, he seemed tense. ''I don't have the millions of admin things, the phone calls that I had as a director,'' he said, ''but actually I don't feel less stressed. It's not easier. It's the same.''
 Ms. Ratmansky and Vasily, meanwhile, were spending their days exploring New York. Soon he will start summer camp. They like the city, Ms. Ratmansky said, although her husband hasn't had time to do much. ''He is happy here,'' she said, ''although of course he is worried if his piece will be good. He is human.''

HEADLINE: In Heartland Death, Traces of Heroin's Spread

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Antonio Betancourt contributed reporting from Mexico City.

DATELINE: GROVE CITY, Ohio 

 BODY:
For five hours, Dana Smith huddled stunned and bewildered in her suburban living room while the body of her son Arthur Eisel IV, 31, lay slumped in an upstairs bathroom, next to a hypodermic needle.
 Family and friends streamed in. Detectives scurried about. For Mrs. Smith, the cold realization set in that her oldest son Artie -- quiet, shy, car enthusiast, football and softball fanatic -- was dead of a heroin overdose.
The death was the end of a particular horror for Mrs. Smith, whose two other children, Mr. Eisel's younger brothers, also fell into heroin addiction ''like dominoes,'' she said, and still struggle with it.
 To the federal government, which prosecuted the heroin dealers for Mr. Eisel's death, it was a stark illustration of how Mexican drug cartels have pushed heroin sales beyond major cities into America's suburban and rural byways, some of which had seen little heroin before. 
 In Ohio, for instance, heroin-related deaths spread into 18 new counties from 2004 to 2007, the latest year for which statistics are available. Their numbers rose to 546 in that period, from 376 for 2000 to 2003. 
 Federal officials now consider the cartels the greatest organized crime threat to the United States. Officials say the groups are taking over heroin distribution from Colombians and Dominicans and making new inroads across the country, pushing a powerful form of heroin grown and processed in Mexico known as ''black tar'' for its dark color and sticky texture.
 Their operations often piggyback on a growing and struggling Mexican immigrant population. In a case that provides a window into how this works, two illegal immigrant dealers pleaded guilty to manslaughter last year in Mr. Eisel's death, in a rare federal manslaughter prosecution from a drug overdose. 
 Investigators determined that the two immigrants, Jose Manuel Cazeras-Contreras, 30, and Victor Delgadillo Parra, 23, began distributing heroin when they were unable to find jobs. Mr. Parra, in an interview from prison, where he was sentenced to spend 16 1/2 years, said he was afraid of being arrested at first, but took the job to support his wife and son, as well as relatives in Mexico.
 ''I was living a hard life here in the United States,'' Mr. Parra said. ''And I didn't have any other job I was going to go to.'' 
 Another man in the drug ring, who was not directly connected to the death and therefore not charged with manslaughter, was recruited off the streets of Mexico and smuggled into the country expressly to peddle drugs in Ohio, the government said. 
 Fat on profits made largely in the United States, drug traffickers in Mexico are engaged there in a bloody war among themselves and with the government, which began a crackdown on them three years ago. Since then the violence, including assaults on the police and the army, has left more than 10,000 people dead.
 But on this side of the border, the traffickers continue to expand their reach. 
 Drug Enforcement Administration officials say that Ohio is of particular concern because of the crisscrossing network of freeways here that make it well suited as a transshipment point. Anthony C. Marotta, who heads the agency's Columbus office, said heroin tied to the Columbus-area dealers had been cropping up in nearby states like Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia and as far away as the Baltimore area. 
 The case of Arthur Eisel and the men arrested for selling him heroin shows how the traffickers pushed their product and how in Mr. Eisel, already addicted to expensive pain killers because of a back injury, they found a ready customer for heroin, which was cheaper. 
 Investigators say that Arthur Eisel was not alone in switching from a prescription painkiller to heroin. It gives a similar, euphoric high at a fraction of the cost, $10 to $20 for a ''balloon'' -- one dose, usually a gram or less -- as opposed to upwards of $60 for a typical prescription pill dose on the street.
 The traffickers found a ripe market in Grove City, a suburb of Columbus, as they have elsewhere in the nation. Drug seizures ebb and flow over the years, but the amount of heroin confiscated nationwide has been arcing up since the mid-90s, going from 370 kilograms in 1998 nationwide to about 600 kilograms -- roughly $150 million worth of heroin -- last year, though officials believe it is a small fraction of what is available on the street.
 The share of heroin-related prosecutions among federal drug cases in this region has also been climbing, reaching 15 percent of cases last year compared with 4 percent a decade ago.
 The numbers here are small in comparison with other populous states like New York, California or Texas, which have always been centers of drug use. But the growth here has prompted much soul-searching. 
 Mr. Marotta said he had been alarmed recently to see dealing in the parking lot of a supermarket in Dublin, a quiet, upscale suburb of Columbus, where he was shopping.
 Paul Coleman, the director of Maryhaven, the largest rehabilitation center in the region, said the percentage of patients reporting opiates, principally heroin, as their preferred drug -- whether it is smoked, inhaled or injected -- grew to 68 percent last year from 38 percent in 2002.
 Mr. Coleman said he believed that the trend reflected an increased supply of heroin.
 Mike G., who is undergoing treatment at Maryhaven and asked that his last name be withheld for fear enemies on the street would find him there, said, ''In some places it is like going to pick up beer.''
 A Fatal Link
 The group linked to the Mexican cartel that sold Arthur Eisel his fatal dose was just one of at least 10 trafficking organizations, known by the authorities as cells, operating in central Ohio, said Tim Reagan, a D.E.A. agent who investigated the case as part of the Southwest Border Task Force, a group of Ohio law enforcement officials focused on drugs coming from Mexico.
 Each cell consists of a handful of people who distribute the drug after it is smuggled across the Southwest border, 1,500 miles away. Many cell members, like Mr. Parra and Mr. Contreras, have roots in Nayarit, a state on the Pacific Coast of Mexico.
 Mexican authorities say that growers in Nayarit are using a highly productive form of the poppy from Colombia and processing the heroin in laboratories scattered around Tepic, Nayarit's capital, despite efforts to kill the plants through fumigation.
 The cells take orders over disposable mobile phones, making it hard for the police to trace them or their calls. They use a system of ''dispatchers'' and ''runners'' to take orders and deliver the drug. Members of the cells typically stay in an area for only four or five months before replacements arrive. The drugs are sold at rendezvous points, usually in shopping center parking lots, in an effort to blend in with the bustle. 
 The men convicted in the Eisel case told the authorities similar stories. Mr. Contreras, the dispatcher in the case, told federal authorities that he had crossed the border illegally and lived in Oregon for several years before moving to Columbus in 2007 on the promise of a job as an auto mechanic. But that job never materialized. In a letter to The New York Times, he said he had worked a variety of other jobs but had hit an unemployment streak that left him without a car or a house for his wife and two young children. 
 Desperate for work, he said he found an acquaintance in Columbus who promised him easy money for distributing heroin. 
 ''Since I spoke English and Spanish, they proposed that I answer the phone only,'' Mr. Contreras wrote. ''I didn't touch the drug or see it. I was only answering the phone. I was with them for three months, and that was when they caught me.''
 He said he never imagined that anyone could die from the heroin, ''since I have used the drug and nothing ever happened to me.''
 Mr. Parra said he illegally crossed the border in 2005 and settled in California, working in the kitchen of a seafood restaurant for several months. When that work and other jobs dried up, friends suggested he come to Ohio for work. But when he arrived, Mr. Parra said, he learned that the work would be helping to distribute heroin.
 At turns repentant and defiant, Mr. Parra said he felt sorry for the family of Mr. Eisel but did not fully accept responsibility for his death and wondered aloud if the government was making an example of him.
 ''It was never my intention for someone to die,'' Mr. Parra said, ''but neither did I put a syringe or something in somebody so that they could inject the drug,'' adding, ''I am serving as an example'' to discourage other dealers.
 Jose Garcia Morales, a third man who was arrested in the case but was not prosecuted for the death of Mr. Eisel, was recruited off the streets of Nayarit's capital, according to a memorandum his lawyer prepared for the court in urging a lenient sentence.
 The document describes how the ring arranged for the payment of a ''coyote,'' or human smuggler, to bring Mr. Morales across the border. Then, he piled into the back of a Ryder truck, was driven to Columbus and, over a two-week training period, was taught to deliver heroin by other drug traffickers already established there.
 ''Mr. Morales was promised that he would make a lot of money,'' the document said. ''In reality, when he was paid, if it all, he generally received between $400 and $500 a week, a place to sleep, and occasionally some food. As expected, Mr. Morales sent much of the money he earned back to his family in Mexico.''
 Connecting the distribution rings to the cartel leadership in Mexico has proved difficult. Those arrested here typically say they fear for the safety of their families in Mexico if word gets back that they have been too cooperative.
 ''If they are caught, they are terrified what will happen to their families, and for good reason,'' said David M. DeVillers, a federal prosecutor here who has handled several drug cases. ''They want to do the prison time.''
 The authorities say that local arrests rarely make a difference. New dealers pop up within weeks.
 ''It's like sweeping sunshine off the roof,'' Mr. Marotta of the D.E.A. said. 
 Shared Addictions
 Standing before a federal judge last summer as he faced the prospect of 20 years in prison on manslaughter charges in Mr. Eisel's death, Mr. Contreras begged for forgiveness.
 ''I truly did not intend to do any damage to their family,'' said Mr. Contreras, 30, before the judge handed down a 15-year sentence. ''I have two children, and I would not like something like this to happen to my sons.''
 Dana Smith listened, horrified. At home, her two younger sons were still struggling with addiction.
 Arthur had been, in her eyes, a typical suburban child, shy around girls, a devotee of the radio host Howard Stern, a member of a local softball league, popular with the children of friends.
 He eventually found work as a bank clerk and rented an apartment with one of his brothers, Robby. Robby Eisel, who is undergoing treatment at a residential center in Columbus, said the progression from prescription medicine to heroin was easy ''because the heroin is everywhere around here.''
 When Arthur Eisel injured his back in a car accident in 2005, he started taking prescription medication, Percocet and OxyContin, for chronic pain, under a doctor's supervision.
 Robby Eisel said he had been taking similar medications after he broke his arm on the job as a maintenance worker at a golf course. Soon, all three brothers were acquiring OxyContin illegally and sharing it. When supplies dried up and their dealer suggested heroin, they tried it and quickly developed an addiction.
 Mrs. Smith said she struggled to comprehend what took hold of her sons. She works as a clerk at a courthouse and had seen the regular parade of drug addicts and offenders come through. But one day in 2007, she heard the names of two of her boys, Arthur and Robby, announced in arraignment court. They had broken into a store.
 ''It was devastating,'' she said.
 More horrors came. She would find needles in pillow cases, in coats, under living room chairs. She watched her sons writhe in agony from head and bone pain and diarrhea as they experienced withdrawal trying to beat the addiction at home.
 Mrs. Smith said she sometimes feels pangs of guilt and wonders if she could have done more to help Arthur break the addiction. She concedes that she gave him food, a place to stay and sometimes even money when his stupor made clear what he was up to.
 ''I was an enabler,'' she said quietly. ''I was his mother.''
 At one point, she called a private rehabilitation facility in Florida, hoping to get all of her sons in treatment. But she was told the facility did not accept siblings.
 ''Which one has it the worst?'' she recalled a counselor there asking.
 The question still gnaws at her.
 ''How do you choose which one of your children to save?'' Mrs. Smith asks now. She decided at the time that she could not choose and sent none of them to Florida.
 Regret and Resolve
 Arthur Eisel went through a revolving door of treatment centers in the Columbus area in the months before his death. He would get free of the drug, seemingly set on a positive path only to relapse and fall into it again. But, his family said, he did not appear to be using heavily in the weeks before his death. 
 The night before he died, he and his brother Ryan paid their mother a visit, watching television there until late in the evening.
 At work the next morning, Mrs. Smith got the kind of call parents dread. She remembers hearing Ryan say, ''His lips are blue.'' Mrs. Smith spent the next months in a state of shock. She said she does not remember much. 
 As it turned out, investigators had already been trailing the ring that sold Arthur his fatal dose. That work, in addition to confidential informants whose testimony would have allowed investigators to trace Mr. Eisel's dose to Mr. Parra and Mr. Contreras, emboldened prosecutors to charge them with manslaughter and other crimes.
 Prosecutors asked Mrs. Smith to go to the sentencing hearings and make a statement. She stood feet from the men accused of killing her son and listened to their words of regret. 
 ''Part of my heart goes out to their families,'' she said in a recent interview. ''But something has got to be done to stop this.''

HEADLINE: Folk Songs, It Turns Out, Were in Her Blood

BYLINE: By BILL FRISKICS-WARREN

DATELINE: NASHVILLE 

 BODY:
 DIANA JONES has been writing songs since she was 11, and she's been studying people's faces, as a portrait artist, for nearly as long. But it wasn't until Ms. Jones, who was adopted as an infant, met her birth mother's family and heard the folk songs they'd been singing for generations that she discovered her true artistic calling.
 It was an unlikely transformation for a woman who was raised on Long Island and trained early on as a classical vocalist. Yet after finding her birth family in East Tennessee in the late 1980s, Ms. Jones discovered that she had an uncanny affinity for Appalachian music. Gradually she began claiming it as her own. 
 ''Better Times Will Come'' (Proper Records), her unvarnished new album, marks both the culmination of this process and the arrival of a fresh and distinctive voice. The music on the record is built around the familiar fiddles, mandolins and harmonies of rural Appalachia, and yet there's no regionalism to speak of in Ms. Jones's supple, loamy alto. She sings of the hard times, murderous urges and chilling loneliness that haunt the old Anglo-Celtic ballads but, with one exception, sets her plain-spoken narratives resolutely in the present. She approaches the mountain-ballad tradition not as a curiosity or antique but as a renewable vernacular that's just as capable of speaking to the human condition now as it was 80 years ago. 
 In her record's title track, for instance, she explores global recession and hostility, while in ''Soldier Girl'' she fears for the safety of a young enlisted woman. The lyrics don't mention a specific war, but the urgency in Ms. Jones's voice leaves little doubt that her protagonist is bound for Afghanistan or Iraq. Many of her songs reveal strong empathy, something she attributes to being adopted. 
 ''I was always looking at faces, always searching for people who looked like me,'' Ms. Jones said of her childhood while sipping hot tea on the porch of her home, a converted shotgun shack in the Shelby Hills neighborhood, a blue-collar section of the East Nashville area. ''It's that longing for connection, I think, that's also there when I write songs.''
 This longing is most poignant in ''All God's Children,'' a song about orphans. ''Shifted from family to other families/some have been hurtful/and some have been kind,'' she sings with an equal mix of sadness and resiliency, surrounded by plaintive strains of mandolin, fiddle and banjo.
 Ms. Jones, 43, is still mostly unknown outside folk circles in the United States, although her 2006 record, ''My Remembrance of You,'' received glowing reviews in British magazines like Uncut and Q. Her new CD is the kind of record that might have signaled a popular breakthrough, the emergence of a Joan Baez or a Judy Collins, had it appeared at the height of the folk or singer-songwriter movements of the 1960s and '70s.
 Ms. Baez, who inhabits Appalachian folk songs as well as anybody, said writers of Ms. Jones's caliber come along only every so often. ''There's some kind of channeling from some other lifetime going on,'' Ms. Baez said by phone from her home in Woodside, Calif. ''I don't know the answer to these things, but all I can think of is that it must come from some mysterious part of her soul.''
 There's little mystery but plenty of moral ambiguity in the song ''If I Had a Gun,'' an updated bit of Southern Gothic in which Ms. Jones imagines herself as a battered woman who's had enough. ''If I had a gun, you'd be dead/one to the heart, one to the head,'' she intones in chilling, remorseless monosyllables. 
 ''Diana's music has a kind of honesty to it that almost makes you want to look away,'' said the novelist Ann Patchett, who attended Sarah Lawrence College with Ms. Jones in the '80s. Her former classmate reminds her a little of Iris Dement, a tradition-steeped singer whose austere records transcend time, place and musical tastes. ''Diana's music feels essentially American without getting into that whole Americana thing,'' Ms. Patchett added. ''It's the voice of our dirt.''
 Ms. Jones said that throughout her childhood and adolescence she felt an almost mystical attraction to rural Southern music but never understood why. ''My brother had Johnny Cash's live 'At Folsom Prison' album, and I stole it from his room,'' she recalled. ''Whenever I heard that or someone like Emmylou Harris, I'd be like, 'Wow, that's beautiful.' I just didn't know where to find more of it.''
 Apart from the soundtracks to musicals like ''Oklahoma!'' and ''The Sound of Music,'' there wasn't much culture in the home of her adoptive parents when she was young. ''I grew up in a house with little music, no art, no books, and my dad kept moving us farther and farther into the country,'' she said. 
 Her father was a chemist, she said, who ''wanted to do this farm thing, and when you're 13 or 14 years old, to be that cut off, where you couldn't even ride your bike anywhere, was debilitating -- alienating, really.''
 In the late '80s, after she'd graduated from college, Ms. Jones began the search for her birth mother at the New York Public Library on 42nd Street, discovering that the woman had been 20, single and working for Eastern Airlines when she gave up Ms. Jones for adoption. She described her mother, who by then had long since married and moved to England, as an adventurer who wanted to escape the provincialism and intolerance of the South and ''experience the world in a bigger way.'' 
 Birth mother and daughter eventually reunited and have remained in contact, but the biological relative who played the pivotal role in Ms. Jones's musical reawakening was her maternal grandfather, Robert Lee Maranville. A guitar player and singer, he performed as a teenager at barn dances in and around Knoxville, Tenn., with Chet Atkins. Mr. Maranville was with his granddaughter in a gift shop in the Smoky Mountains in 1997 when she bought a copy of the CD ''Voices From the American South.'' The album, the first volume in the musicologist Alan Lomax's Southern Journey series for the Library of Congress, included Depression-era versions of songs like ''Pretty Polly'' and ''Poor Wayfaring Stranger.'' 
 ''I looked on the back of the CD, and I looked at my grandfather and said, 'Do you know any of these songs?' '' Ms. Jones recalled. ''So he went down the list and went, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.' Then we played it in the car, and he sat there tapping on his leg with his fingers, singing along to these songs that he'd grown up with. I thought, 'O.K., this is what I was looking for.' '' 
 Ms. Jones said that not long after, she decided to throw out every song she'd ever written and start over. ''My Remembrance of You,'' a record dedicated to the memory of her grandfather, who died in February 2001, was the first fruit of this musical rebirth. As lovely as it is sincere, the album betrays no whiff of dilettantism, no hint of irony.
 Ms. Patchett had lost touch with Ms. Jones after college and found her friend's transformation to be dramatic and complete. ''When I knew Diana in school, she looked like David Bowie,'' she said. ''She was this very androgynous kid who had short hair and wore white T-shirts. She was a rocker. Then I ran into her four years ago at the gym in Nashville. She had grown into this really gorgeous woman and also grown into her voice and her playing and her whole identity.''
 ''My Remembrance of You'' secured Ms. Jones a nomination as emerging artist of the year in the 2007 Folk Alliance Awards and the chance to tour with Richard Thompson. More validation came when Ms. Baez included ''Henry Russell's Last Words,'' a coal-mining ballad that Ms. Jones wrote, on her 2008 album, ''Day After Tomorrow.'' A version of the song also appears on Ms. Jones's new CD.
 Based on actual events, ''Henry Russell's Last Words'' was inspired by a love letter that its namesake wrote to his wife, Mary, while he and 110 other men were trapped in a mine in Everettville, W.Va., in 1927. The mine eventually exploded, killing everyone inside. Mr. Russell wrote his letter in coal, on a fragment of paper torn from a bag of cement.
 ''It's one of those songs where you can see it; the imagery is that powerful and haunting,'' Ms. Baez said. ''You feel the lack of air and the desperation, but also the beauty of the messages to the outside, the connection that this man feels and that he assumes comes back.''
 Just as authoritative as Ms. Jones's pen, however, is her singing voice, a clarion alto whose rich timbres and elongated phrasing sometimes suggest those of a cello or viola. Ms. Jones has spent time listening to a wide range of commanding singers, including Kitty Wells, Ella Fitzgerald and Edith Piaf. ''The thing about them all is that they don't sound like anybody else,'' she said. ''When you hear them sing a song, whether they wrote it or not, you believe every word, every nuance, every breath. You're with them.
 ''I try to be very present to my material, to mean each word I sing,'' she continued. ''That to me is the bottom line. It's like telling a story. You want people to understand what you're singing, but you also want to believe it yourself, to really get into it. And that's really the joy of it. It feels like flying.''

HEADLINE: One Summer, 14 Weekends

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
MAYBE 2009 has had its challenges, but once again we've made it to summer, the season to hit the road on the weekend and wander, teasing the senses with the view over the next hill, the squish of sand on an unfamiliar beach, and the chef's spiciest barbecue in a faraway locale. Between now and Labor Day, this summer is serving up 14 weekends. To go with them, here are 14 weekend destinations, offering simple and exotic pleasures. Scale a mountain, dance to folk music, nibble some fudge, groove to classic rock, float down a river, fly a kite, pedal around an island and, please, for your sanity, get hot sauce on your chin.
 JUNE 6-7
 Phoenicia, N.Y. 
 Craving mountain air and a waterborne adventure now that the days are heating up? Find them a bit more than a couple of hours from New York City at Phoenicia, on Esopus Creek in the heart of the Catskills. Hiking trails in the Catskill Park are close to town: in its guide to the best day hikes in the Catskills and Hudson Valley, the Appalachian Mountain Club recommends a four-hour, 5.6-mile, strenuous-level jaunt up Mount Tremper, which is less than two miles southeast of Phoenicia off Route 40 on the eastern side of the creek. The hike, one of the most popular in the Catskills, passes a quarry and two lean-tos to a fire tower at the summit. 
 For a taste of white water, bring a raft or kayak, put in on the Upper Course of the Esopus and ride the rapids down into town, where you can stop off for dinner and a spin through the Main Street shops. Or for a tamer experience, start in Phoenicia and take a lazy float in an inner tube down the four-mile Lower Course of the creek; tubes are $16 at F-S Tube Rental on Church Street (845-688-7633). This weekend you can also be a spectator as the Kayak and Canoe Club of New York (www.kccny.com) holds its Whitewater Slalom and Downriver Sprint Race on Railroad Rapids. 
 Find accommodation at the Phoenicia Black Bear Campground and R.V. Park (www.phoeniciacampground.com); the Winwood Inn in Windham (www.windhammountain.com/lodging/winwood/; weekend rates $129 to $329); or in the Hudson River towns not far away. 
 JUNE 13-14 
 Virginia
 Beat the midsummer tidal wave of tourists on Skyline Drive and the Blue Ridge Parkway, and at the same time catch one of the country's most spectacular shows of wildflowers -- vividly pink rhododendrons the size of small trees and their lower-growing cousins, azaleas, spilling over the hillsides. Stop at the overlooks to gaze out over the Shenandoah Valley and find the paths into the thickets of blossoms. 
 The 105-mile Skyline Drive (www.nps.gov/shen) runs north and south along the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Shenandoah National Park; the maximum speed limit is 35 miles an hour, so no one gets anywhere in a hurry. It connects to the parkway, which runs 217 more miles in Virginia and into North Carolina, offering more views and plenty of handicraft shops. 
 Take a side trip to Charlottesville, Va., and the newly opened Thomas Jefferson Visitor Center and Smith Education Center at Jefferson's home, Monticello. The center (www.monticello.org) has four exhibitions about Jefferson and a film about his ideas and accomplishments. Admission to the center is $20; $8 for children 6 to 11. It is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. through October. 
 JUNE 20-21 
 Pleasure Island, N.C.
 The Cape Fear River rambles past the historic and picturesque city of Wilmington, N.C., widening and creating slivery barrier islands with the river on one side and the Atlantic Ocean on the other. Pleasure Island, about 12 miles south of Wilmington, has the towns of Carolina Beach and Kure Beach as well as pleasurable beaches for catching a tan. 
 But you can tackle the area by hiking in Carolina Beach State Park (910-458-8206), home to the carnivorous Venus' flytraps. Or you can rent a surfboard or body board at SandBarz Surf and Skate Shop (www.sandbarznc.com) on the Boardwalk in Carolina Beach. 
 To the south in Kure Beach is the North Carolina Aquarium at Fort Fisher (www.ncaquariums.com) and the 712-foot-long Kure Beach Pier (910-458-5524), where you can try to snag mackerel and flounder ($5 fishing fee). The Sandi Beach Inn (www.sandibeachinn.com), a block away, has rooms for $95 to $225 a night.
 For a break from beach life, drive into Wilmington for a horse-drawn trolley tour of the city's historic area (www.capefear.nc.us) and a performance of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' at the Shakespeare on the Green Festival (Third Street and Carolina Beach Road; 910-762-6393). 
 JUNE 26-28 
 HIGHLAND PARK, ILL.
 Hop a special northbound Metra train from Chicago (www.metrarail.com) and find a spot on a big lawn with thousands of music-loving families on yet another big weekend at the renowned and beloved Ravinia Festival (www.ravinia.org), which offers music from classical to classic rock over its run from June to September. This weekend you can spread out a blanket and take in starry evening concerts by the Indigo Girls (Friday), Diana Krall (Saturday) and Joe Cocker (Sunday). Pavilion tickets are for sales, but the best buy is a lawn ticket ($22 or $27). 
 Stay overnight in the Loop and stroll along Lake Michigan during the day. The James (www.jameshotels.com), one of the city's designer boutique hotels, offers a room for four (with 300-thread-count sheets) starting at $227 a night, with a Peace, Love and Room Service special for $314, which includes $50 toward room service.
 JULY 3-5
 MACKINAC ISLAND, MICH.
 People on Mackinac (pronounce it MACK-i-naw) Island, in the Straits of Mackinac off the northern tip of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, like to say they host an old-fashioned Fourth of July celebration. Because the island, 3.8 square miles and 80 percent state park, is accessible only by ferry, and motorized vehicles are prohibited, Mackinac still feels like a Victorian-era resort village.
 At Windermere Point Beach at noon on the Fourth, old-fashioned skill is on display at the annual stone-skipping contest; the best skippers can score 40 skips or more with a single stone (www.stoneskipping.com). At 2 and 7 p.m., an 1880s-style celebration at Fort Mackinac, with its parading soldiers in period costume, will include military music and a 38-gun salute. After dusk, fireworks boom over both Mackinac Island and St. Ignace, the nearby Upper Peninsula town. The Star Line ferry (www.mackinacferry.com) has a two-hour fireworks cruise offering views from the straits, which connect Lakes Michigan and Huron. 
 The island has about 40 inns and bed-and-breakfasts, but a three-night holiday package at the showplace 343-room Grand Hotel (www.grandhotel.com) includes lodging for up to five people, with breakfast and dinner, for $1,890. Mackinac Island is famous for its fudge, available at shops like Ryba's, Murdick's and Joann's, but in St. Ignace, try a modern version of a pastie, the meat-and-vegetable pie brought by miners from England, who heated them by putting them on a shovel and holding them over their headlamp candles. 
 JULY 11-12
 PAYETTE RIVER, IDAHO
 Fly into Boise, rent a car and tackle the Payette River Scenic Byway, which has so many scenic views that it is hard to keep your eyes on the road. Fortunately, there are also many places to stop and explore.
 The 111.7-mile officially designated byway (www.idahobyways.gov/byways/payette-river.aspx) begins northwest of Boise, where Route 44 meets Route 55, and rolls northward on Route 55 through the Boise and Payette National Forests. Along the way are two popular, strollable resort towns, Cascade and McCall, but the rumbling, tumbling white water is the star attraction. 
 South of Cascade, near Smiths Ferry, is the 4D Longhorn Guest Ranch (www.4dranches.com), which offers horseback riding and overnight accommodations. Campers can stay at Ponderosa State Park (208-634-2164), on Payette Lake near McCall. 
 The byway ends in New Meadows, almost exactly at the 45th parallel, and the air is sweet and clear. 
 You can turn around and head south the way you came or loop around, taking the also-scenic U.S. 95 south, which meanders toward the Oregon state line and along the Snake River to I-84, which can take you back to Boise.
 JULY 18-19 
 DAUPHIN ISLAND, ALA.
 Expect to mingle with nearly 100,000 spectators at what promoters say is the largest and oldest saltwater fishing tournament in the United States: the Alabama Deep-Sea Fishing Rodeo (www.adsfr.com) on this 14-mile-long barrier island. About 3,000 anglers participate in the tournament, which offers an estimated $400,000 in cash and prizes in a competition as feverish as a stock-car race. 
 The waters are loaded to the gills with fish, from amberjack to vermilion snapper, which are brought back to Dauphin Island and measured. Admission is free, and the atmosphere is akin to a county fair's, with exhibits, music and food. Fresh seafood is on sale at Skinner's on the island. 
 Also on the island is a bird sanctuary and sea lab on Bienville Boulevard, and visitors can take self-guided tours of Fort Gaines (www.dauphinislandcoc.com). Beachfront Rentals and Sales (877-551-1460) rents condos, and the Mobile Bay Visitors Bureau's Web site (www.mobile.org) has a list of accommodations. 
 Route 193, the direct road to the island, can become clogged; a roundabout but picturesque route is Route 59 to Gulf Shores, then Route 180 along the Gulf of Mexico coast to Fort Morgan and a ferry to Dauphin Island (www.mobilebayferry.com).
 JULY 25-26 
 LOWELL, MASS.
 Don't be fooled by the logo of the Lowell Folk Festival, which includes an acoustic guitar and a guitar pick. The free festival (www.lowellfolkfestival.org), which will be held for the 23rd time in this small city northwest of Boston, is estimated to draw about 200,000 visitors because it offers much, much more than just strummers. Over three days, not only will polka, bluegrass and zydeco emanate from the six outdoor stages , but there will also be traditional Quebecois music (with fiddles, guitars and wooden flutes), Western swing and honky-tonk, a Klezmer brass band and Tuvan throat singing. 
 There's a Dance Pavilion, but don't be bashful about dancing wherever you want. Or eating whatever you want: people come just for the variety of ethnic and native foods on sale, Armenian to Jamaican to Laotian. Meander through a traditional crafts area, a family activities area and an art courtyard. While you're in town, visit the Lowell National Historic Park (www.nps.gov/lowe) in the old cotton mills that sprang up along the Merrimack River in the town's industrial heyday. A list of accommodations is available on the Greater Merrimack Valley Convention and Visitors Bureau Web site (www.merrimackvalley.org).
 AUG. 1-2 
 CINCINNATI
 Much more awaits in Cincinnati than big-league baseball and the city's famous chili, but try them for starters. Sample the chili at both Skyline and Gold Star, rival chains with fragrant secret recipes. ''Five-way'' is chili atop spaghetti with a mountain of shredded Cheddar cheese, onions and red beans. The Cincinnati Reds, a tradition since 1869, play a series this weekend against the Colorado Rockies at the seven-year-old Great American Ball Park. Tickets (www.reds.com) range from $5 for an outfield seat to $230 for a Diamond Seat behind home plate, and a family section is alcohol-free. 
 The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center (www.freedomcenter.org), about a two-block walk west of the ballpark, tells its moving story in a strategic spot: the Ohio River was a border of free and slave states, with Cincinnati, on its northern bank, a beacon for escaping slaves (11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday; $9 for adults). And although ''WKRP in Cincinnati,'' the sitcom about a top-40 station at the bottom of the ratings, might be a more familiar cultural reference, the free American Classical Music Hall of Fame (www.americanclassicalmusic.org) is also in town, at 1225 Elm Street (tours by appointment; 513-621-3263).
 AUG. 8-9
 COOPERSTOWN, N.Y.
 The festival season at the popular and innovative Glimmerglass Opera runs from July 18 to Aug. 25 at Alice Busch Opera Theater, but this is an especially good weekend for opera immersion here along the shores of shimmering Otsego Lake, which James Fenimore Cooper called Glimmerglass in his novels. All four operas on the 2009 schedule will be performed: on Saturday, Verdi's ''Traviata'' at 1:30 p.m. and Rossini's ''Cenerentola'' at 8 p.m., and on Sunday, Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' at 11:30 a.m. and Menotti's ''Consul'' at 3 p.m. Tickets are $48 to $130. 
 Free backstage tours are given every Saturday in August at 10 a.m.. Also, between shows on Saturday, a member of the production staff narrates the stage crew's frenzied scenery changes to ticket holders who hang around after the first show. 
 Indulge your cultural eclecticism with a break from opera at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in town (www.baseballhalloffame.org), and see a new exhibit of dozens of artifacts donated by Hank Aaron, the slugger who finished his career with 755 home runs (9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily; $16.50). The Cooperstown area has an abundance of lodging at bed-and-breakfasts, guesthouses, hotels and inns.
 AUG. 15-16
 NANTUCKET, MASS.
 Nantucket -- isolated, beautiful and unique -- has also developed a reputation as a place that's affordable only for the kinds of families once featured on ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.'' But especially in this recession year, that can be a misconception. The island's Visitors Services Bureau (508-228-0925; www.nantucket-ma.gov) regularly updates its list of rooms available at the bed-and-breakfasts and hotels. According to Kate Hamilton Pardee, the director of the bureau, demand has been lower in 2009 than in recent years, and rooms are still available in a wide price range. 
 Once on the island, almost everything is accessible by foot, bicycle or taxi, so you can leave your car on Cape Cod and pay only passenger rates on the ferry ($33 for adults on Steamship Authority boats from Hyannis, Mass.; www.steamshipauthority.com). Entertainment needn't be costly; many beaches are privately owned, but by tradition, most are open to the public without charge. Rent a bike at Young's Bike Shop, at 6 Broad Street, about 100 yards from the ferry terminal, for about $25 for 24 hours, and take one of the tours recommended on its Web site, www.youngsbicycleshop.com; one 4.2-mile spin takes you past points of interest including the Brant Point Lighthouse. 
 AUG. 22-23 
 LONG BEACH, WASH.
 Go try your luck at one of the best kite-flying venues in the world, the Long Beach Peninsula, known to its loyalists as the World's Longest Beach and the home of the World Kite Museum and the Washington State International Kite Festival. The festival, held annually in the third week of August, draws kite fliers from all over the world, along with tens of thousands of spectators who marvel at the intricate choreography of so many colorful kites. But there is also plenty of room to buy a kite and take to the skies yourself. 
 The World Kite Museum has changing displays of colorful and historic kites (303 Sid Snyder Drive in downtown Long Beach, blocks from the boardwalk; 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; $5). The Long Beach Peninsula Visitors Bureau Web site (www.funbeach.com) lists lodging from camping and motels to rental apartments and bed-and-breakfasts. 
 AUG. 29-30
 KATY TRAIL, MO.
 Head to St. Charles, a Missouri River city just northwest of St. Louis, and pedal off westward on the Katy Trail, which meanders along the river before it bends to the southwest and ends in Clinton, 225 miles to the west (www.bikekatytrail.com). Rental bikes are available for $6 an hour or $30 a day at Momentum Cycles (www.momentumcycles.com), at 104 South Main Street near a trailhead. On Saturday, the trail offers a bonus: views of canoeists and kayakers zooming downstream in the Race for the Rivers. 
 Take your own bike cruise 26 miles past the river towns of Greens Bottom, Weldon Spring and Defiance and the Daniel Boone Judgement Tree Memorial in Matson. Turn around in Augusta, after a good meal at the Augusta Brewing Co., which makes a variety of ale and beer, including root beer. Back in St. Charles, stop by the Lewis and Clark Boat House and Nature Center on Riverside Drive for displays on Lewis and Clark's expedition ($3). The Ameristar Casino Hotel and Spa (www.ameristarcasinos.com) offers river-view rooms for $269. 
 SEPT. 5-7 
 BUFFALO
 Buffalo chicken wings are everywhere now, peppery and ritually served with celery and blue-cheese dressing, but are celebrated nowhere else as they are in Buffalo, where, legend has it, they were invented in 1964 by Teressa Bellissimo, co-owner of the Anchor Bar on Main Street. The eighth National Buffalo Wing Festival (www.buffalowing.com) is on Saturday and Sunday in Coca-Cola Park. A record 78,000 people flocked to the festival last year to watch wing-eating and bobbing-for-wing contests, a celebrity wing cook-off and pageants for Miss Buffalo Wing and Baby Wing. 
 About 30 restaurants, including the Anchor Bar and national chains, will serve their own varieties of wings. Find a moist towelette and walk your wings off at the Erie Basin Marina on Lake Erie downtown or at the Buffalo Zoological Gardens (www.buffalozoo.org). The Hotel Indigo (www.hotelindigo.com), in the suburb of Amherst, is offering a special wing festival rate of $159.

HEADLINE: Be Nice to Job Seekers. (They're Shoppers, Too.)

BYLINE: By JON PICOULT. 
Jon Picoult is founder and principal of Watermark Consulting in Simsbury, Conn., which focuses on improving customer and employee experiences.

 BODY:
IN an environment of rapidly rising unemployment, scores of managers and executives have had doctor-as-patient, ''aha'' moments, as they find themselves among the millions of American workers looking for new jobs.
 Now on the other side of the hiring table, these people are seeing for themselves how job candidates are often treated during the recruiting process. And it's not a pretty picture. 
 Companies' interaction with job candidates is often devoid of basic professional courtesies that were routinely accorded to these managers and executives in their previous roles: prompt responses to phone calls and e-mail, personalized attention and frequent ''keep in the loop'' communications. Indeed, as these former executives soon discover, the rules of engagement in the recruiting arena are quite different from those they were accustomed to in the corner office. 
 In this new world, candidates' correspondence to companies is rarely acknowledged. Calls are seldom returned. Status updates are not routinely provided. Rejection decisions are not consistently communicated. As I've heard many a job seeker describe it, this is the ''black hole'' into which resumes, inquiries, follow-up calls and any other types of communication are lobbed. 
 These discourtesies are not reserved only for the masses of ''poor fit'' candidates. They even manifest themselves in interaction with job finalists -- people you'd think a company would want to woo and impress. 
 In their defense, human resource departments receive lots of inquiries from job seekers. It's hard to pay personal attention to each and every one -- though with most job applications now submitted or recorded electronically, companies can and should be more communicative using automated means.
 But in the whirlwind of daily activity, a business can lose sight that there are real people behind all those resumes. And how the company treats those people, well before any of them become employees, says a lot about it, its brand and its values.
 In the current labor market, where there is a glut of supply, perhaps some companies think they have the upper hand and can afford to skimp on the niceties. They are mistaken, though, because every economic cycle eventually turns, and there is always competition for the best talent, regardless of economic conditions.
 It's for this reason that human-resources professionals and company leaders need to treat job candidates like customers. After all, these candidates are buying a ''product'': a new company, a new role, a promise of career fulfillment and advancement.
 A Stanford Business School case study found that some companies get this concept and capitalize on it. Southwest Airlines, for one, recognizes that employment candidates are not only career customers -- but that they could also be, or become, customers of the airline. 
 Southwest's core principles of respect permeate its recruiting, where there is a focus on making sure that no applicant feels inferior or rejected. Many Southwest job applicants have a better experience being rejected by Southwest than they have being hired by other companies. As a result, Southwest gets the best people, and it shows in its superior financial results.
 Another example comes from the food industry, where I recently heard a story about a manager from Nabisco who was attending a human-resources industry conference. When he declared that his company responded to every resume it received -- solicited and unsolicited -- he was met with incredulous stares from his peers.
 ''Why respond to every resume when that's clearly not necessary?'' someone asked.
 The Nabisco manager smiled and replied, '' Because -- everyone eats cookies.''
 Companies reveal their true colors during the recruiting and selection process. If an organization pays only lip service to principles like respect, kindness and service excellence -- that will become apparent through the process and evident to job candidates. 
 The experience that a company delivers to prospective employees will undoubtedly influence their perceptions of the company, both as an employer and as a business they might consider patronizing.
 Companies have much to gain -- in talent, in positive word of mouth and in basic corporate responsibility -- by bringing greater civility to their recruiting. Few, though, are stepping up to the plate.
 So for all you job seekers out there, the next time you hear nothing after contacting a potential employer, don't take personal offense -- that's how most companies operate. And when you walk out of an interview knowing that you nailed it, but then never hear from the company again -- don't theorize about whether you had toilet paper stuck to your shoe or a stain on your shirt. It is, unfortunately, par for the course.
 Let's hope that some basic human courtesy and kindness find their way back into recruiting. And, of course, when those of you who are out of work do land that next job, don't forget what it was like on the other side -- and be sure to treat your prospective employees accordingly.

HEADLINE: Play Time

BYLINE: By PILAR VILADAS

 BODY:
Those who were expecting gloom and doom at the Milan furniture fair last month got something they hadn't bargained for: fun. Designers, especially those showing outside the fair, channeled their inner imp, producing pieces that reminded us that design can be both functional and whimsical at the same time. This represents a refreshing change from the recent proliferation of design art, which, with its myopic focus on making high-priced objets for hedge-fund managers, almost succeeded at stifling real inspiration before it crashed and burned along with the economy. 
 This year, the target audience ran less toward hedge-fund managers than it did to, say, would-be roadies. Even if watching ''Almost Famous'' is the closest you've gotten to sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, you can still say you're with the band with the Flightcase -- a storage unit based on the equipment trunks that musicians carry -- from Successful Living, a partnership between the furniture Company Moroso and the clothing giant Diesel. And you can spice up the dullest dinner party with the Dutch designer Marcel Wanders's elegantly louche Can Can light for Flos, with its naughty set of ruffles peeking out from beneath a sleek, minimalist shade. Ooh la la! Post-Modernism -- the historicist and ornament-obsessed movement that was one of 20th century design's most fun-centric -- reared its subversive head again in a new version of Alessandro Mendini's famous Proust armchair for Cappellini. In this one, a geometric-patterned fabric replaced the pointillist design of the 1978 original. 
 But two of the most charming examples of this year's mischievous spirit were also the most modest. Outside the fair, Pagani Perversi's Saily light, made for the ambitious new design company Skitsch, had a shade that looked like a boat made out of folded newspaper, but the material was decidedly high-tech: a fire-resistant paper from DuPont. And no discussion of playfulness would be complete without mentioning the Italian company Campeggi, which has long been delighting Milan fairgoers with its ingenious, winsome designs for inflatable beds and sleep sofas that put American versions to shame. The company, alas, has had no United States distribution, but it is working on that. So when it does, those of you who need a stylish guest bed that fits unobtrusively into your tiny New York apartment or your college dorm room can snap up Campeggi's Tent sofa by the young Canadian designer Philippe Malouin (who is featured in ''Form Follows Fun'' on Page 61). In a clever play on the idea of camping out, its tentlike superstructure offers overnight guests an extra measure of privacy in their hosts' living rooms. Sweet. PILAR VILADAS

HEADLINE: Odes to Sex, Samba Soul and a French Novel

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Iggy Pop
 Iggy Pop as a chanteur, crooning and contemplating life with autumnal bitterness and resignation? That's his unexpected guise on ''Preliminaires'' (Astralwerks); he even sings ''Les Feuilles Mortes'' (''Autumn Leaves'') in mediocre French. The album was sparked by Michel Houellebecq's novel ''The Possibility of an Island,'' a time-hopping narrative about a savagely comic entertainer, his beloved dog and their clones from the distant, emotionless future. The songs touch on its plot -- particularly the dog, in ''A Machine for Loving'' and the New Orleans jazz romp ''King of the Dogs'' -- and also ruminate, like the book, about sex and mortality, more quietly than usual for Mr. Pop. But after the novelty wears off, the keeper is his typically blunt ''Nice to Be Dead'' -- ''It's nice to be underground/Free of the ugly sounds of life'' -- which happens to be the album's one electric-guitar rocker.
 Jason Lytle 
 ''Hold my hand while everything blows away, and we will run to a brand new sun,'' Jason Lytle sings in his high, scratchy voice. That sense of willed optimism rising out of catastrophe could be about the end of a band, a romance, a friendship, an economic boom or all of them at once, and it runs through the songs on ''Yours Truly, the Commuter'' (Anti-), Mr. Lytle's first solo album after 15 years of leading Grandaddy. Mr. Lytle moved to Bozeman, Mont., and recorded the album by himself, playing all the instruments. It's a fragile recollection of California rock from more auspicious times, with stately melodies and vocal chorales over jerry-built foundations: elegies for vanished certainties. 
 Zee Avi
 Finger snaps, a walking bass line, brushes on the drums, gentle guitar chords, a lilting vocal with a flutter in it -- those are the easy-swinging ingredients of Zee Avi's ''Poppy,'' which happens to be about the ravages of heroin addiction. Ms. Avi, a Malaysian songwriter who sings in fluent English and was discovered on YouTube, is full of cheerful tunes on her debut album, ''Zee Avi'' (Brushfire/Universal). It's folky, sparsely produced and largely unplugged; now and then she plays ukulele. Yet while the album includes its share of blandly pleasant songs -- the kind that could position Ms. Avi as a less arty Feist -- there are also glints of melancholy clarity that promise more.
 Savath & Savalas
 One way to define psychedelia is as pop engulfed in seemingly extraneous but richly evocative noises. Creaks, pings, birdcalls, clarinets, rustles, whooshes, echoes and all sorts of other sonic flotsam surround simple melodies and quietly picked acoustic guitars on ''La Llama'' (Stones Throw). It's the fourth album by Savath & Savalas, one of the projects of Guillermo Scott Herren, the Catalan-rooted producer who's better known for making dance music as Prefuse 73. Savath & Savalas is his Latin-alternative project, with the breathy, bemused lead vocals of Eva Puyuelo Muns at the center. She sings in Spanish about pathways, journeys, dreams and curative kisses as the music drifts between lullaby and incantation, awash in distractions and apparitions. 
 Marcio Local
 Samba soul isn't a new hybrid in Brazil. It has been around since the late 1960s, when Jorge Ben and others merged ideas from up north with the sounds of Rio de Janeiro. Marcio Local was born in 1976, and his album, ''Marcio Local Says 'Don Day Don Dree Don Don': Adventures in Samba Soul'' (Luaka Bop), is mostly a happy throwback. The instruments are hand-played: horn sections, twinkling electric piano and wah-wah guitars alongside Brazilian percussion and cavaquinho, the small samba guitar. Mr. Local sings in a roomy, long-breathed baritone that always sounds relaxed, sloshing over the beat or gliding into a nonchalant falsetto. The album was produced by Mario Caldato Jr., who has worked with the Beastie Boys. And every now and then Mr. Local raps, as he does in ''Represento'' -- which, like many of the songs, is a manifesto of respect for homegrown Brazilian culture, for samba and for the joys of art that makes people want to dance. 
 White Rabbits
 Drumbeats, not guitars or keyboards, come first for White Rabbits, a Brooklyn band that has just released its second album, ''It's Frightening'' (tbd). That choice puts a spring, even a swagger, in the step of songs that could otherwise slip into indie-rock alienation and mopery with thoughts like, ''I admit this association's bleak/the company I keep.'' White Rabbits have an unmistakable Radiohead streak; Stephen Patterson's lead vocals leap from adenoidal to falsetto, and the highly changeable studio arrangements (produced on this album by Britt Daniel from Spoon) apply finesse to trashy lo-fi sounds. But White Rabbits favor physical instruments over electronic abstractions, and the drums kick the music toward an American sound that fortifies its brains with muscle.
 Electrik Red
 Electrik Red, the four-member girl group concocted by the R&B hitmakers Christopher (Tricky) Stewart and Terius (The-Dream) Nash, is pure male fantasy and strictly for the one-track mind on its debut album, ''How To Be a Lady: Volume 1'' (Def Jam). Making the Pussycat Dolls look like multitasking Renaissance women, Electrik Red is entirely about sex: technique, not romance. Four-letter words provide shock-value hooks; for radio, there are lots of ''oohs.'' The-Dream and Tricky lavished musical ingenuity on Electrik Red, devising countless twists on old-school electro; if only they showed as much imagination about women's hearts and minds.

HEADLINE: Carbon Offsets: A Small Price to Pay for Efficiency

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank, a Cornell University economist, is a visiting faculty member at the Stern School of Business at New York University. He is the author of ''The Economic Naturalist's Field Guide: Common Sense Principles for Troubled Times,'' which will be published on Monday.

 BODY:
ARE carbon offsets a good thing?
 They are intended to reduce the environmental impact of consumption. Traveling by plane, for example, causes carbon dioxide to be emitted into the atmosphere, so travelers can pay a specialist to offset those emissions some other way -- perhaps by planting vegetation or installing renewable-energy technologies. It all sounds reasonable.
 Yet carbon offsets have drawn sharp criticism, even ridicule. A British Web site called Cheat Neutral (www.cheatneutral.com) parodies the concept -- by offering a service under which someone who wants to cheat on his partner can pay someone else who will refrain from committing an act of infidelity. The site's founders say they wanted to use humor to demonstrate why the market for carbon offsets is a moral travesty. 
 But the criticism is misguided. If our goal is to reduce carbon emissions as efficiently as possible, offsets make perfect economic sense. 
 Consider the decision of whether to buy a hybrid car. Because of the expensive batteries and other complex equipment in such cars, they can cost much more than similar vehicles powered by standard combustion engines. Many people drive so little that they wouldn't save enough on gasoline to recoup the higher cost. Yet many such people buy hybrids anyway, because they think they are helping the environment. Well and good, but they could help even more by buying a standard car and using the savings to buy carbon offsets. 
 The same goes for someone who wonders whether it's O.K. to eat foods grown far from home. A New Yorker may worry, for example, that the diesel fuel burned to ship California-grown tomatoes to him in winter will accelerate global warming. But suppose he would be happy to pay $10 more than the cost of shipping those tomatoes rather than eat locally grown root vegetables nine months a year. That would buy more than enough carbon offsets to neutralize the greenhouse gases emitted by shipping the tomatoes. So it would be much better, for him and the planet, if he bought offsets and ate winter tomatoes.
 Of course, carbon offsets alone won't eliminate global warming. People also need stronger incentives to take into account the environmental consequences of their actions. 
 President Obama has proposed attacking the problem with a carbon cap-and-trade system. The government would first set a limit on annual carbon emissions, then auction emissions permits to the highest bidders. Companies could still use processes or sell products that emit carbon, but only by first buying a permit for each unit of carbon released. If the government wanted to limit carbon emissions to five billion tons a year, for example, it would auction that many tons of annual carbon permits. 
 This approach was first used in the United States to address acid rain, when the Clean Air Act established a market for permits to emit sulfur dioxide. Compared with more traditional regulatory measures, the auction method substantially reduced the cost of achieving the law's air-quality target. 
 As people learn more about such an approach, they seem less likely to oppose it. Although several environmental groups once bitterly opposed pollution permit auctions, they now endorse them enthusiastically. 
 A carbon cap-and-trade system is functionally similar to a carbon tax. Both approaches would raise the cost of activities that generate carbon dioxide emissions, giving people a powerful incentive to reduce their carbon footprints. Carbon offsets are no substitute for the stronger incentives inherent in carbon taxes or cap-and-trade, but they can reinforce their effects. Both carbon taxes and permit auctions would also generate revenue that could be used to buy additional carbon offsets.
 Dozens of companies, nonprofit and for-profit, sell carbon offsets, and some critics question how their work can be verified. But with various certification programs now in place -- including the Gold Standard and Green-e Climate, to name two -- there is no reason that fraud should be harder to curb in carbon-offset markets than in other domains. 
 AT last count, Cheat Neutral, the British infidelity neutralization Web site, said it had offset 65,768 cheats, and had recruited a roster of ''9,002 faithful people ready to neutralize your misdemeanors.'' The Web site draws out the parallel this way: ''When you cheat on your partner you add to the heartbreak, pain, and jealousy in the atmosphere.'' Cheat Neutral claims that its plan ''neutralizes the pain and unhappy emotion and leaves you with a clear conscience.'' 
 Actually, no. Only you will know whether your conscience is clear, but it is certain that higher rates of marital fidelity in London do nothing to eliminate the anguish caused by straying spouses in Manchester. In contrast, one person's reduction in carbon dioxide emissions anywhere on the planet fully offsets anyone else's contribution to the total.
 Carbon offsets, though much maligned, are an excellent idea. If you want to help reduce carbon emissions, consider buying some.

HEADLINE: Autism Doesn't Have an Age Limit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I was greatly moved by ''Growing Old With Autism,'' by Karl Taro Greenfeld (Op-Ed, May 24), and I, too, wonder how people with autistic spectrum disorders and their families will evolve as their numbers grow.
 I have the great privilege of working with these families, providing psychopharmacologic consultations for their children's behavioral and emotional difficulties. 
 I have followed many autistic children and teenagers who have had daily structure at private schools and work experiences, a friend or two, and periodic extracurricular social activities, including ''dances.''
 Mr. Greenfeld is right: once the structure and socialization of school ends, it is completely up to the family to figure out what to do next. The families that make it (those that do not implode from stress and lack of support) have so little to guide and support them. 
 These families deserve medals for their efforts. But what they could really use is financing directed at programmatic needs for their adult children.

 I am the mother of a 35-year-old adult woman with autism and painfully aware of the sobriquet ''refrigerator mothers,'' who, Karl Taro Greenfeld explains, were ''mistakenly blamed for their children's withdrawn, antisocial condition.''
 There have been important advances in clinical behavioral intervention studies that have evolved over the last 30 years into an impressive body of highly refined treatment modalities (or best practices) for autism. What has not kept pace is the creation of educational curriculums and dynamic methods to train young service providers. 
 There is not only a dearth of college-level teachers to use these best practices, but also no discernible career path along which these young professionals may advance. How can we expect undertrained health care workers, even if they are the most dedicated and caring of individuals, to work with autistic adults when all we offer them are the bluntest of tools and only the prospect of an early burnout?
 It is essential that families, legislators and professionals unite to organize and finance academically rigorous venues where this important body of information can be collected and disseminated, and where a validating program for professional growth can be established.

 To the Editor:
 I have a 21-year-old son with autism. I just spoke at the Autism One Conference in Chicago, about ''Biomedical Interventions for Older Children.'' My son's doctor, Michael Elice, presented as well and reminded parents that it is ''never too late'' to try to ameliorate the symptoms of autism. 
 By following the ''Defeat Autism Now'' protocols -- and this doctor's advice -- we have been able to help our son control his concentration, behavior and stomach problems. He is not cured. But we will keep trying. 
 As the children of the current autism epidemic grow older, it is crucial to understand that age should not be a deterrent to interventions.
 Barbara Fischkin Chicago, May 25, 2009
 To the Editor:
 As I read the article by Karl Taro Greenfeld, I became alarmed that he had set up an opposition between adorable tykes (the subject of current research) and frightening adults (whom no one knows what to do with). But he identifies a real problem. 
 My son lives in a state-financed unit dedicated to providing treatment for young men with autism. In the last year, the parents of these men have asked the state for a small amount of money so that the institution can open a smaller unit in the community to which our sons could ''graduate.'' 
 Why would we do this when the state's economy is in free fall? Because each bed vacated by one of our sons will become available for another young man -- perhaps now in a psychiatric hospital, inappropriately, or perhaps in a prison, frighteningly -- who cannot get the services he needs.

 To the Editor:
 Karl Taro Greenfeld's article applies to all disabilities. My child has cerebral palsy, and there are not enough programs out there. 
 People always look at the children but never the adults. We could save so many more people with all sorts of problems, but when families can no longer care for them, where do they go? What kind of life do they have? 
 I do not want to think of the day when I can no longer care for my child. We must learn to see the whole picture for all these people.
 Kristina Fallon Lexington, S.C., May 24, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I am the parent of a 23-year-old nonverbal young man with autism and live in Illinois, a state that ranks at the bottom in the provision of services for developmentally disabled adults. 
 In Illinois, educational entitlements end at age 22. After that, there is nothing except a handful of nonmandated programs with long waiting lists that live hand to mouth, dependent on the ups and downs of the state budget each year. What is needed is a breakdown of the artificial distinction between services for children and services for adults. Autism is the same in children and in adults. 
 Fund-raising for research into childhood autism may make for a more effective appeal, when accompanied by images of affected children, but the subtext of that appeal is that adults with autism don't matter and are beyond help.
 Our son still lives with us. Like all parents of adults with autism, we dread the day when we will have to find an alternative living arrangement.

SUMMER WORLD
 A Season of Bounty
 By Bernd Heinrich
 Illustrated. 253 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99
 It may not be every urbanite's idea of a dream date, but mine, after reading ''Summer World,'' is to spend a summer day with a 69-year-old insect physiologist and all the tools of his trade. My ideal man lives in Maine and Vermont, where he's surrounded, at various times, by screen-cloth aviaries and screen cages; insect nets; electronic thermometers; tape measures; binoculars; barrels of frog eggs; scraps of wasp-nest paper; plant sprigs and mosses being subjected to various light, temperature and moisture treatments; ant nests he's experimentally relocated; moths tethered to shrubs; and the skins of small rodents dotted with botfly maggots. Our date would start before dawn and would include, but not be limited to, climbing into treetops, slogging through wetlands and sitting quietly for hours with pencil and notebook, the better to observe and record. 
 An emeritus professor of biology at the University of Vermont, Bernd Heinrich -- the object of my admiration -- has been doing all this, and writing about it with brio, for decades. (He's the author of 13 previous books.) Perhaps his most attractive quality, for this reader at least, is his ability to find something intellectually stimulating whenever he steps out the door. ''Every summer I spend some time trying to learn something new about animals,'' he writes with disarming simplicity. But ''some time'' is hundreds of rigorous hours, and ''something new'' means new to science. 
 While Heinrich considers insects ''magical'' for doing so much with a pinpoint-size brain, the entomologist himself is a Dumbledore of the forest -- magical himself for his ability to conjure a riot of life from what others less attuned might consider your standard Northern woodlot. Those rolled up aspen leaves on the ground? Look inside and behold a moth caterpillar hiding in a tube made of its own fecal pellets. Those bite marks on fresh leaves? They indicate the biter was unpalatable to birds. That barely audible patter in the woods at night? It's the rain of caterpillar poop on leaves. Heinrich's business is exploring and explaining the astonishing adaptations of his woodland neighbors (among them wood frogs, mud daubers, Cecropia moths, longhorn beetles, hummingbirds and various annoying flies) and their struggle to procreate while they've got the chance.
 Summer, Heinrich writes, ''releases'' life. For most creatures, it's ''the season of reproduction, feeding, growing and trying to avoid being eaten.'' For the scientist, it's time to get super-busy, muddy, viciously stung and lucky -- as in ''I also found a female black ichneumon wasp in the act of injecting an egg into a young tiger swallowtail butterfly larva on a chokecherry.'' Heinrich captures the wasp, sketches the act and then spends an hour watching sap drip from a birch. ''I hope to see surprises, even as I want to learn the routine,'' he says. Is sap dull? Hardly. During this period three hummingbirds, two satyr butterflies, roughly a dozen bald-faced hornets and a swarm of small flies lap the sap. Later, by flashlight, he notes a flying squirrel taking its turn. He does too. The sap ''tasted sweet,'' with a sugar concentration of 17 to 18 percent, as measured with his brewer's refractometer. You've got to admire the precision.
 And the unending questions. Concerning wood frogs, why do the males aggregate and call for females at once? The proximate answer is to attract mates, but if females can't differentiate between males in a chorus, why should an individual bother? (See Chapter 3 for the answer.) Animals come to life in gripping detail (the organ pipe mud-dauber wasp injects her spider prey with a chemical that keeps it in a zombie-like state of suspended animation so her larvae can get a fresh meal upon emerging), and so does Heinrich as he bounds between his experiments. The man is irrepressible. 
 He can also be, at times, a bit dry. ''Summer World'' contains between 8 and 11 dispiriting sentences (as measured by a reviewer's bonehead meter). Here's an example: ''The solstices, the asteorological relationships during the Earth's annual journey around the sun, proximally cause the seasons and the overall weather patterns to which life adjusts.'' If you can overlook such lapses, the marvels that Heinrich reveals and his own enthusiasm -- a quality he admires in the animals around him -- are certain to carry you along.
 ''Summer World'' will please fans of noncharismatic, non-mega fauna, but the book isn't all splendor in the grass. There are snakes, too -- the snakes of local extirpation and the first world's unsustainable lifestyle. In our ''climate bubbles,'' Heinrich writes, we live in a virtual summer world, ''eating bananas from Central America and drinking coffee from Africa.'' He continues: ''It is madness to suppose we would make a significant difference by using more energy-efficient lightbulbs and using agrofuels rather than oil, or that city dwellers can or would take up a rural farming or a hunter-gatherer lifestyle: given our numbers there is no land.'' (Pace vertical farmers.)
 But there is a way out: ''radical reductions of population.'' The answer will rankle some readers, but not those who grok Heinrich's central message -- the necessity of maintaining sound natural ecosystems. Without them, we cannot live. Heinrich offers a brief prescription -- ''We need two things: clear vision and also a spiritual imperative so that we will focus on the ultimate ecology, not the proximate economy'' -- and then he quickly moves on . . . to the evolutionary pressures of head and body lice.
 At this point, my dream date with Bernd Heinrich concludes.

 BODY:
THESE days, anxious New York City developers are marketing as fast as they can, churning out flash-animated Web sites, glossy brochures, and smooth (if hollow-eyed) agents hawking sales incentives alongside Hansgrohe faucets.
 Yet many buyers with a yen for modern buildings are turning to seasoned talent with proven box-office draw. 
 For them, nearly new is the new new. 
 ''Everybody I've sold to this year has been looking at brand-new and decided they prefer to do nearly new,'' said Karin Posvar-Picket, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group who has sold seven condominiums this year in the Metropolitan, a five-year-old building at East 90th Street and Third Avenue. ''For a little less money, they know exactly what they're getting, and they can move right in.'' 
 Buyers say that there are distinct advantages to buildings that are two or more years old. One is that the building is likely to be sold out, so there's a better chance of securing financing. Many banks will not issue mortgages in buildings that are less than 70 percent sold.
 Another is that they don't have to worry if the sponsor is going to finish the job or start renting out unsold apartments. The buildings are also likely to have an observable community of neighbors; apartments with valuable custom upgrades like surround-sound wiring or $25,000 automated window shades; sellers who have more flexibility to negotiate than most developers; and a relative dearth of new-building kinks, including the torment of ongoing construction. 
 Mathieu Schepard recently agreed to pay around $800 per square foot for an 856-square foot loft at 15 Broad Street -- a k a Downtown by Philippe Starck, among the first ''designer'' buildings to go on sale in the Financial District five years ago. Mr. Schepard found the investor-owned apartment with the help of Elie Pariente, the managing partner of Urban Sanctuary, a boutique real estate brokerage.
 ''Being in a newer apartment was important, but being the first one in wasn't,'' said Mr. Schepard, who feared, among other things, losing his down payment if he bought new construction and the developer went under. ''We figured we would buy in as new a building as possible, but one that was already fully sold.''
 Mr. Schepard, 38, and his wife, Monica, 27, didn't care about the Philippe Starck pedigree. What mattered was that the apartment can be divided into two bedrooms to accommodate them and their 5-year-old daughter, Samantha. Also of importance were the 382-unit building's family-friendly amenities -- including a bowling alley, a basketball court and a swimming pool -- all underwritten by modest common charges of $600 per month. Then there was the stroller-heavy population and the location next to their daughter's school. A further seducement was the unusually low sales price: The property was listed at $799,000, but the sellers accepted their offer of $692,000.
 ''There are at least 40 apartments for sale in the building, and they are not willing to budge on $1,000 per square foot,'' Mr. Schepard said. ''Our seller agreed to $808 because they had bought it as an investment unit.'' (According to property records, the sellers bought the property two years ago for $595,000, or $702 per square foot.)
 He did have one misgiving: The high inventory. ''It did put up a red flag,'' said Mr. Schepard, who asked around for advice. ''They said there's always going to be a certain percentage of apartments on the market regardless of the economy -- like 5 percent -- so this is an additional 5 percent.''
 In addition to insecurity over down payments, many buyers today believe that squeezed developers will inevitably cut corners on construction, finishes and amenities. Some, aware that common charges frequently escalate after a sponsor moves on, look for more certainty about monthly costs. Others seek to avoid the 1.825 percent transfer tax that buyers must pay on a brand-new condo. (In resales, the seller pays the tax.) And some are dismayed by tales of construction delays and chronically unheeded punch lists.
 But not all nearly new buildings are equal, even if they sold at similarly breakneck speeds and lavish sums during the boom.
 ''Three years ago, you could sell a mediocre apartment almost as quickly as a fabulous apartment, if the price reflected it somewhat,'' said Michele Kleier, the president of Gumley Haft Kleier. ''Now, people are looking at the reality, as opposed to what they wanted to see, and what the developers wanted them to see. They are acting with their heads and wallets instead of their heart and emotions.''
 The heads-and-wallets school of purchase is developing its own guidelines: Too many renters are a turnoff. Fringe locations -- glossed over in the boom years by developers who claimed that bad neighborhoods no longer existed -- are a major turnoff. A building should not be top-heavy with amenities (for instance, a 50-unit building supporting a doorman and a pool). Classic-leaning design is preferable to ultramodern, while starchitect imprimatur is pretty much irrelevant. 
 Developments erected earlier in the boom, before 2007, tend to invite the most serious consideration. 
 ''My buyers have found that construction quality went down as the boom years progressed,'' said Tom Demsker, who runs Demsker Realty, a specialist in downtown dwellings. ''It seems like things were put together a little more hastily. We have seen issues like the leveling of the floor, the grouting of the tiles, the way the cabinets were hung, that lead you to believe things were probably done faster than they should have been.'' 
 Earlier vintages tend to have larger bedrooms and sensibly restrained common areas; sellers are potentially more negotiable; and lawsuits against developers are usually over and done with. And early-boom buildings tend to have fewer investor-owned apartments. 
 ''We definitely see more stability in the earlier buildings,'' said Milla Tonkonogy, who is looking for a one-bedroom apartment downtown for under $900,000, and favors the 2005-06 crop in part because of the less transient population. ''You get a lot of owners living there, whereas a lot of later buildings seem to have more investors.''
 Ms. Tonkonogy and her fiance, Benjamin Hartner, intended to buy new construction until they applied for loan prequalification. 
 ''Our lender was much more antsy about new construction than we are,'' said Ms. Tonkonogy, who works in corporate finance. ''That spooked us because they know a lot more about this than we do. We're much more willing to trust a lender who really has their money on the line long-term, versus the sponsor who just wants to get out.''
 She and Mr. Hartner, both in their 30s, have looked at apartments in several downtown conversions, including 56 Pine, 80 Chambers Street and 71 Nassau Street.
 ''For the most part, they're in fantastic condition,'' she said. Helped by a tax abatement, ''their common charges have been stable. And they typically have the same amenities as the newer ones -- 24-hour doorman, fitness center, sometimes a common area like a lounge or roof deck-- except the common spaces are smaller and less hotel-quality. We're looking more for value than those types of amenities, so the older buildings definitely make sense.''
 The couple are also mindful that sellers who bought earlier in the boom have a lower cost basis, and therefore are more likely to negotiate than later purchasers. But Ms. Tonkonogy noted that this has yet to translate into lower asking prices.
 ''In every case the apartments are still asking $1,000 per square foot or more, which is the same as new construction in a similar area,'' Ms. Tonkonogy said. She believes prices should be at 2003 levels now (around $550 to $600 per square foot for the kind of property they are interested in) and will eventually settle at 2001 levels, or about $400 to $500 per square foot.
 Keith Burkhardt, the president of the Burkhardt Group, a boutique brokerage, says location is returning to the equation. ''The market is kind of reverting to what it was like when I started in 1991,'' Mr. Burkhardt said. ''In fringe areas like the Financial District, Hell's Kitchen, Harlem, Washington Heights, Inwood, parts of Brooklyn and Long Island City, I wouldn't advise buying unless the price was at least 25 percent below an established neighborhood. Those neighborhoods are going to wind up settling well below $700 per square foot.'' 
 Buyers, no longer stampeded into purchases by runaway prices, can afford to be picky.
 Worried about financing problems and potential corner-cutting, and appalled by ''outrageously priced'' new development, Nelie Shah recently started shopping for a preowned two-bedroom two-bath condo. She is impressed by the mint-condition properties she has seen.
 ''Sometimes the taste is not completely mine, but they have nine-foot or higher ceilings, generally nice bathrooms, Sub-Zero refrigerators, and sometimes playrooms,'' said Ms. Shah, who is in her 30s and the president of Nothing Falls Short Marketing, a market research company. ''I can't think of anything that new has that slightly older doesn't.''
 But many of yesterday's hot buildings, like many of today's struggling ones, were built a little too far off the beaten path for her liking.
 For example, the Metropolitan, at East 90th Street and Third Avenue, had ''an elegant lobby and seemed very new,'' she said. ''The ceilings are high and it had big windows. But I'm not sure I want to be as high as 90th Street.''
 Her broker, Ms. Posvar-Picket, also took her to the Arcadia, at East 79th and First Avenue, but that felt too far east. The Hudson, on West 60th Street near Amsterdam Avenue, was too far west, while the Campiello, on West 17th between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, was a better fit for Ms. Shah, who likes to socialize downtown. But with so many properties to choose among, she is still looking.
 Even as developers and buyers downplayed the importance of location during the late boom, they engaged in an amenities arms race. But today, building bling is more likely to provoke a shudder than a thrill.
 ''Everything is changing, from being over the top to what do I really need? Do I really need a sommelier in my building? Do I really need a cooler downstairs for my Fresh Direct that might require repair?'' said Iman Bacodari, a vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman. Moreover, buyers are weighing whether there are enough units to support the amenities at a reasonable cost.
 Buyers in pursuit of properties under $3 million are especially amenity averse. ''They're not looking for a gym and a pool and all that hoopla,'' said Colleen Dwinell-Power, an associate broker at DJK Residential. ''They're really searching for value, lower common charges and more square footage.'' 
 Indeed, Mr. Pariente said, the almost new buildings with the most sex appeal flaunt an alluring set of financials. He said the interest in the numbers coincided with tightening lending standards last fall. 
 ''People ask for minutes and financials on the spot,'' he said. ''That never used to happen before. Buyers have become much more educated about the whole health of a building.''

HEADLINE: Oh, No! What Happened to Archway?

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
SITTING in his office late one evening in April last year, Keith Roberts, the director of finance for the Archway & Mother's Cookie Company, stared in shocked silence at the numbers on his desk.
 He knew things had been bad -- daily reports he had been monitoring for six months showed that cookie sales at the company had been dismal. But the financial data he was looking at showed much more robust sales. 
 ''Where on earth had all of these sales come from?'' Mr. Roberts recalls thinking to himself. 
 Tired, but intrigued, he began digging through orders and shipping and inventory records until, well after midnight, he reached the conclusion that Archway, based in Battle Creek, Mich., was booking nonexistent sales. 
 He reasoned that sham transactions allowed Archway, which was owned by a private-equity firm, Catterton Partners, to maintain access to badly needed money from its lender, Wachovia. Mr. Roberts's investigation eventually caused Wachovia to pull its financing lines, helping to push Archway into bankruptcy last fall. Two other food companies picked off much of its assets earlier this year for $42 million and are churning out the brands' cookies again.
 As accounting scandals go, Archway is no Enron. Not in the size of the possible accounting fraud itself -- sales were probably overstated by a few million dollars -- or in its sophistication or ingenuity. Yet what court documents filed in Delaware describe as a fairly simplistic fraud went on for months, seemingly missed by the company's lenders as well as its savvy, private-equity stewards.
 And Archway's collapse is a reminder of the apparent lengths to which some of the nation's biggest banks went to do deals with private-equity firms during the recent buyout boom. 
 Wachovia, for instance, provided tens of millions of dollars in loans and lines of credit backed by assets to Archway despite the fact the company had not had a formal independent audit of its financial statements in three years. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, which acquired Wachovia last year, declined comment.
 Archway's failure also raises questions about how some private-equity shops operate. When they acquire broken companies, the firms pledge to use their financial, strategic and operational expertise to fix them. The firms receive management fees from their portfolio companies while also charging investors -- large institutions and pension funds -- fees for managing their money. 
 Although Catterton placed three of its partners on Archway's board, naming one as vice chairman, it hired a management company, Insight Holdings, to handle day-to-day operations at Archway. Several former executives and employees who worked at Archway's headquarters say Insight conducted most of its oversight of the company via telephone and videoconferences.
 The Catterton partners, these former employees say, were never seen at Archway. Catterton and Insight nonetheless collected about $6 million in management fees and compensation during their nearly four-year tenure running Archway, court documents assert.
 In an e-mailed statement, a spokeswoman for Catterton said the firm did make on-site visits to Archway and stopped receiving fees in October 2007. In total, she said, Catterton received only $2.75 million in fees, half of which was distributed to its investors.
 A multitude of lawsuits have been filed in connection with Archway's collapse, including suits brought by former employees as well as independent distributors. In one suit filed earlier this year in Delaware bankruptcy court, a committee of unsecured creditors contends that the alleged accounting fraud continued for as long as it did because of the ''control, participation and acquiescence'' of Catterton. 
 Catterton, Insight, Archway's board and a number of former executives are defendants in the suit. Catterton, the court documents say, prolonged the alleged fraud so it could try to refinance Archway's debt or sell the company. 
 A court-appointed trustee is investigating the accusations, and Catterton said it was cooperating.
 Catterton's spokeswoman denies all of the accusations in the complaint, calling them ''baseless,'' and adds that the complaint does not ''include even a single specific act by Catterton or an individual Catterton member to support those allegations.'' 
 Insight also denies the accusations. ''The principals of Insight did nothing wrong,'' a spokesman for the company said in an e-mailed statement. ''Insight's principals are working with the U.S. Trustee to bring this matter to a close.'' 
 Catterton's spokeswoman also pointed to the company's strong track record. ''Archway notwithstanding, Catterton has helped to capitalize and grow nearly 75 successful consumer companies in its 20-year history.''
 BY late 2007, Scott Gallagher, an independent distributor, was drowning in cookies, as Archway force-fed him more than he could possibly sell. It had begun with some mild incentives -- payments of $1 a case for ordering additional product -- before Archway stopped offering incentives entirely and just allotted more cookies to distributors nationwide.
 For Mr. Gallagher, who had been a distributor in the Denver, area since 2000, it all seemed to involve a lot of hocus-pocus.
 ''Normally I would have $4,000 of product physically sitting in my truck, but they were charging me for $14,000 worth of cookies. Cookies that didn't exist,'' Mr. Gallagher said. ''They went from doing this at the end of the quarter to doing it every six weeks.''
 Longstanding cookie makers with an extremely loyal fan base, Archway and its sister company, Mother's, had their share of troubles in recent years as the once-family-controlled business that owned both brands was passed along from buyer to buyer -- first to an Italian company, Parmalat, in 2000, and then, after an accounting scandal at Parmalat, to Catterton Partners in 2005.
 Catterton, a private-equity firm with a track record of buying and fixing up consumer products companies, didn't disclose what it paid for Archway and Mother's, but it was clearly fired up over the deal. ''Archway and Mother's are household names with strong regional brand awareness that offer great potential for continued expansion,'' J. Michael Chu, a Catterton managing partner, said in a press release announcing the deal. 
 Catterton renamed the business the Archway & Mother's Cookie Company and put a senior adviser and three of its partners on Archway's board. It also installed Keith Lively, a managing partner at Insight, as Archway's chief executive.
 For workers and distributors concerned about their futures, the Catterton acquisition was greeted with relief. 
 ''During the time I was at Mother's, we were bought and sold by a number of companies. Somebody would buy us, suck out all the profits and sell us to someone else,'' said Mark S. Zinzer, who began working at a Mother's distribution center in Portland, Ore., in 1995.
 Catterton and Insight said they hoped to increase Archway's profits, build sales and make the company a nimbler competitor. ''When the business was purchased in 2005, Archway was losing a substantial amount of money and required significant turnaround work,'' Catterton's spokeswoman said. 
 But Mr. Zinzer and others said they soon began to have doubts about Catterton's stewardship. ''Those guys were stepping over quarters to pick up pennies,'' he said. ''They cut here and cut there and some of the things they needed to do. But, in my opinion, they threw away a lot of profits by a lot of bad decisions.''
 After Catterton took over, Archway began ratcheting back spending on in-store promotions, which distributors contended made their cookies less competitive in stores. Catterton also abruptly shut a bakery and distribution plant in Oakland, Calif., which had made Mother's Cookies for several decades. Operations were shifted elsewhere. 
 The Catterton spokeswoman said that while there were layoffs in some Archway facilities, there were additions at others. Moreover, she said, Catterton was aware that the management of Archway continued in-store promotions ''where it made business sense to do so.'' In other cases, management stopped or reduced promotions because they were ''ineffective and/or unprofitable.''
 Besides putting 230 of the Oakland plant's employees out of work, the closure had another negative effect. It lengthened the time between when the cookies were baked and when they hit store shelves around the country. 
 Some also believe that Archway altered its recipes or ingredients. Mr. Gallagher, the distributor, said that as time went on, he ended up having to eat a lot of cookies that he couldn't sell. ''I noticed, over time, they were getting worse and worse.''
 Mr. Zinzer is more blunt: ''Our cookies turned to crap. They were nowhere near as good as they used to be.'' 
 A former employee inside the headquarters, who declined to be identified because of continuing litigation, said that as the company's troubles worsened, the company began using less expensive ingredients in its cookies. 
 Still others noticed odd quality-control problems emerging. Some distributors said they saw a significant increase in the numbers of cookies they received where the package hadn't been sealed correctly, leaving vendors unable to sell them. ''One of my last loads, I got a pallet of Taffy cookies and they were all open. Unsealed,'' said Dennis Pfeifer, who had a Mother's route in Northern California and Oregon. 
 Archway declined to comment about whether recipes were changed or less expensive ingredients used. It also declined to comment on any quality-control problems that may have emerged.
 When Mr. Pfeifer called Archway, however, to get a credit for the opened cookies, rather than simply filling out a form as he had done in the past, he said he was told he had to cut the individual seals on all of the wrappers on the pallet.
 ''Clearly that was meant to deter me from asking for credit. I said, 'Forget it,' '' Mr. Pfeifer said. ''I took it all to the dump.''
 ALMOST as soon as he arrived at Archway in October 2007 as its director of finance, Mr. Roberts was putting out fires. Having spent the last decade working for various troubled manufacturers that private-equity firms had lassoed, he was used to the day-to-day struggle needed to keep weak companies afloat.
 ''I had plenty of experience with private-equity firms that highly leverage the companies they buy. The financial person is expected to keep a million balls up in the air,'' he said. ''There are days when you wonder if you can keep the doors open another week and then something happens and, suddenly, you're making a profit.''
 When Mr. Roberts joined Archway, he said, his boss, Mark Multer, Archway's vice president for finance, asked him to spend the majority of his time pulling together financial documents that would allow Ernst & Young to audit the company. 
 While Archway's auditors had reviewed its financial statements, the company had not had a formal year-end audit since 2004, so Mr. Roberts said he worked 12-hour days trying to close the past years' ledgers. And that's how he came across Archway's suspect numbers in April of last year -- numbers that he said Mr. Multer and an assistant had prepared. Mr. Multer is a defendant in the Delaware lawsuit; his lawyer declined to comment.
 Mr. Roberts said he confronted Mr. Multer in his office in mid-May. ''I thought I would go in there and tell him that what was happening wasn't kosher and that we would have to restate the financials,'' Mr. Roberts recalled. ''I wanted him to raise his hand and say: 'Oh boy, we have some big accounting errors. I don't know how it happened, but let's fix it.' '' 
 Instead, Mr. Roberts said Mr. Multer dismissed his concerns, saying that was how sales were going to have to be accounted for in order for Archway to get through a crucial time. 
 Archway was in a tight fix, caught in a cash crunch as weakening sales and higher costs were causing losses to accelerate. 
 Scrambling for solutions, Archway considered selling off assets while also trying to restructure its debt through a finance company owned by Cerberus Capital Management, the hedge fund.
 Cerberus had its own auditors examining Archway's books. Cerberus and its financing company declined to comment for this article.
 Mr. Roberts said Ernst & Young was threatening to issue a ''going concern'' opinion, a signal that the auditors were worried about Archway's ability to remain solvent. That not only imperiled the restructuring by the Cerberus affiliate, Mr. Roberts said, it also may have caused Wachovia to pull Archway's existing lines. Ernst & Young declined to comment.
 Mr. Roberts said he continued voicing his concerns about Archway's accounting to Mr. Multer, especially after he discovered a series of ''virtual'' sales from large distributors for products that never shipped -- or, in some cases, for cookies that weren't even being offered for sale. The virtual sales are cited in the Delaware lawsuit. The creditors also submitted as evidence an e-mail message sent by Mr. Roberts to an Insight executive that discussed virtual sales.
 In an interview, Jason D. Pechawer, an accountant who had been hired by Mr. Roberts in early 2008 to help with the Ernst & Young audit, supported Mr. Roberts's findings about virtual sales, as did a third Battle Creek employee who declined to be identified because of continuing litigation. 
 During his review, Mr. Roberts said, he also uncovered a large, $1.2 million order from a new warehousing customer, Elite Logistics, which occurred on the last day of Archway's fiscal year in 2007. Elite was supposed to distribute the cookies to the independent producers that would have normally been supplied directly by Archway. But distributors didn't order quickly enough and the cookies at Elite began to go bad, court documents said. 
 Archway then began providing fresh cookies to Elite. But, according to Mr. Roberts, Archway never properly accounted for the $200,000 to $400,000 in stale cookies that Elite returned. 
 More glaring, he said, were discrepancies in daily sales data Archway provided to Wachovia to justify how much it could borrow. Archway routinely changed the numbers -- on more than 120 occasions -- between 2007 and 2008, according to the lawsuit.
 Mr. Pechawer also had concerns about the numbers Archway gave to Wachovia.
 ''I was looking at the daily sales reporting numbers, which clearly said one thing, and then the daily borrowing number, which was sent to Wachovia, and the number had changed,'' Mr. Pechawer said. ''You just can't do that. That happened multiple times.'' 
 At one point last summer, Mr. Roberts said, George Knobloch, then president of Archway, held a meeting with supervisors and managers in which he said the company had been pushing product onto its distributors to ''make it look like we were doing O.K.,'' and that the ''virtual'' sales were designed to help secure bank loans. Mr. Roberts's recollection of the meeting was confirmed by another Archway employee who also attended the meeting but requested anonymity because of legal concerns.
 Mr. Knobloch, who is also a defendant in the Delaware case and is now a top executive with Furniture Brands International, didn't return calls to his office.
 By mid-July, Mr. Roberts, who had considered leaving the company several times, had had enough. On the advice of his lawyer, he met with Mr. Multer and a human-resources executive and demanded an 18-month severance package in exchange for signing a nondisclosure statement about his experience. Archway, he said, told him he could resign without severance. Mr. Roberts resigned last August.
 In late August, about three weeks after Mr. Roberts's resignation, as Archway neared the completion of its Ernst & Young audit, Mr. Pechawer said he told one of the auditing managers about his concerns about Archway's accounting.
 Catterton's spokeswoman said it became aware of the allegations of improper accounting in the ''second half'' of July and ''was not involved in any wrongdoing.'' 
 ''These allegations were taken seriously and we took prompt action when we learned of them,'' including hiring forensic accountants, replacing Insight, asking the Insight executives to resign from the board and notifying the company's auditors and lenders, she said.
 Mr. Roberts and Mr. Pechawer said it was they -- not Catterton -- who had alerted the auditing firms and Wachovia to the possibility of accounting fraud.
 LAST October, the P.A. system in Archway headquarters squawked and a voice asked employees to gather in the cafeteria for a brief meeting. In a five-minute presentation, Mr. Knobloch said the company was discontinuing operations. 
 ''It was terrible. You had people crying. They were very upset,'' said Mr. Pechawer, who attended the meeting. ''There were people who had worked there for 25 or 30 years and now everything was gone.''
 In the months since, Wachovia has recovered much, if not all, of the money it lent Archway. But Catterton and its investors appear to have lost their stake.
 Catterton also has other headaches. It is among scores of firms that have been subpoenaed by Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, as part of his investigation of possible corruption involving public pension funds in New York City and New Mexico. Catterton is ''neither the target nor the subject of the investigation,'' the firm's spokeswoman said. Catterton has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
 While it continues to face lawsuits related to Archway, Catterton emphasizes that it had very little oversight of the company and that Insight was responsible for supervising daily operations. 
 Catterton's spokeswoman said it was members of Insight's team who were ''installed in positions of substantial operating responsibility'' at Archway. Catterton has also argued in court filings that Archway's operations were impossible to sustain in a deteriorating economic environment.
 But some former employees and distributors, noting that Archway and Mother's had survived tough economic times before, don't accept that explanation. They say the company was simply mismanaged into extinction.
 ''What soured me on this experience is that these private equity firms that come in and buy companies don't look at a company to grow it. Whether it sinks or swims doesn't really matter to them,'' Mr. Pfeifer said. ''They don't think about the people whose livelihoods depend on that company. I hope I never have to go through that again.''

HEADLINE: Industry Fears U.S. May Quit New Car Habit

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting from Detroit, Michael J. de la Merced from New York and Gerry Shih from Palo Alto, Calif.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
For all the drastic cuts and financial overhauls that are meant to secure a future for General Motors and Chrysler, their prospects in coming years will be determined more by the answer to a simple question: Can American drivers live without that new-car smell?
 In recent years Americans appeared to be hooked on it and took advantage of home equity loans, easy credit and cheap short-term lease deals to send new-car sales to levels of more than 17 million a year. 
 Now the market has collapsed by 46 percent to below 10 million, as people are making do with the cars they have, leaving the industry to debate -- and worry -- about what the new normal will be once the recession ends. 
 Some say the downturn is temporary and that sales will spring back in a few years. Others believe Americans will rethink whether they need so many cars, particularly new ones. 
 The answer will be important to the Obama administration as it prepares to put G.M. into bankruptcy on Monday. After the company emerges from bankruptcy, the federal government will own about 70 percent of it, in return for $50 billion in taxpayer aid. G.M. has already received about $20 billion in federal help.
 The Treasury Department's advisers, who initially expected auto sales to pick up late next year, now foresee no jump in demand this year or in 2010. And even five years out, they expect annual sales to be about 15 million, still well below the peaks of this decade.
 Making predictions is tricky in this economy. The market has grown more bleak, and worst-case scenarios drafted only months ago are becoming reality.
 If sales do not recover, the Treasury will have to provide more financial support for G.M. and for Chrysler, which has received about $10 billion in federal aid, before they can stand on their own and the government can divest its shares.
 People like Kate M. Emminger do not offer the carmakers much hope. Ms. Emminger sold her 2006 Toyota Corolla last April because she decided she could not afford her $250 monthly payment, even though she earns about $60,000 a year as a university events planner. 
 ''It just became too expensive to have a car,'' Ms. Emminger said. Now, she volunteers at City CarShare, a nonprofit organization in San Francisco, in order to earn free use of its vehicles, which normally rent to members for $5 an hour plus 40 cents a mile. Otherwise, she takes public transit.
 But plenty of people in Detroit argue that once the recession is over, buyers will rush back to dealer showrooms. 
 If sales do pick up, carmakers eventually could be more profitable than they have ever been because of all the costs they have shed, said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
 ''After you rebound from this artificial low in demand, wow,'' Mr. Cole said of the potential for auto sales and profits. 
 He estimates that pent-up demand for new cars is actually about 4 million vehicles higher than the current selling rate, which in April would translate to 9.3 million a year, according to Autodata Incorporated. 
 Others, however, point to shifts suggesting that Americans' desire -- and need -- for new cars may be cooling.
 Baby boomers, the biggest group in the car market, are beginning to enter retirement, a stage of life when people typically buy fewer cars. Home values are down sharply, making consumers feel less wealthy, and also cutting off a handy source of money from home-equity loans for new cars.
 ''We sold to people who purchased cars by refinancing their houses,'' said Wilbur Ross, the billionaire financier who has invested in steel mills and auto parts companies. 
 The housing and financial crisis has taken its toll on reliable customers like Frank Powell, a school administrator in the East Palo Alto school district in California. He moved out of the house he had lived in since 1983 and started renting a few months ago because of his debt burden, which includes auto loans.
 ''I used to buy cars all the time and took out loans to pay them off,'' he said. ''As soon as I paid part of one off I'd get another. I'd buy one for my kids, my wife, myself. I can't do that anymore'' 
 He now has a Cadillac Escalade sport-utility vehicle, but he is thinking about downsizing and driving something much smaller -- and for longer. 
 ''Something had to change,'' he added. ''You just can't keep going with that many cars.''
 Lifestyles have changed, too. As many people move back to cities from suburbs, they are swapping three-car garages for a single parking space. Public transit use is up.
 ''Too many people are looking at alternatives,'' said Scott Griffith, chief executive of Zipcar, the national car-sharing company that has more than 300,000 members, up from about 200,000 a year ago. Mr. Griffith estimates that for every three members, a new car probably goes unsold.
 ''They're much smarter about spending money and looking for ways that don't even involve cars any more,'' he added.
 Of course, car-sharing services like Zipcar are not available everywhere. They are concentrated in urban areas and college towns, where owning a car can be burdensome and expensive.
 Donald Grimes, an economist at the University of Michigan, is forecasting the lowest sales for the driving-age population this year since 1970.
 From 1970 to 2001, there were 0.76 vehicles sold per driver in the United States. Now that figure has dropped to 0.4 vehicles per driver, and he does not see much of a rebound in coming years.
 The swift decline has spooked the industry. ''I don't think there has ever been a period in our history like this,'' Josephine Cooper, Toyota's group vice president for government and industry affairs, said of her company, which lost $7.1 billion in the first three months of the year. ''It is very, very sobering.''
 Now Toyota and other carmakers must wait to see if Americans will return to their old car-buying habits -- people like Jay S. Allen, owner of a San Francisco consulting firm, and his wife, Jennifer Nicoloff, a product manager at Gap. Over the years, they have owned eight cars between them.
 But now they are carless, with no plans to buy. When he needs transportation, Mr. Allen either rides his scooter or borrows a car for a few hours from a local car-sharing service.
 ''The biggest thing right now is fear,'' Mr. Allen said. ''We don't know which way the economy is going to go. We don't want to buy anything that has long-term implications.''

GRAPHIC: CHART: THE SALES SLOWDOWN: For the first four months of 2009, the rate of vehicle sales fell below 10 million a year on a seasonally adjusted basis, a longer stretch than even during the recession of 1981-82. Meanwhile, cars and trucks are being used much longer than they once were. (Sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis

HEADLINE: Devotion And Money Tie Iranians To Iraqi City

BYLINE: By SAM DAGHER; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran.

DATELINE: KARBALA, Iraq 

 BODY:
Over just two days, about 80 Iranian pilgrims were killed in April in suicide bombings in Iraq. But even though the pilgrims are clearly a favored target for Sunni extremists in Iraq, and though the threat continues, it seems nothing will keep the Iranians from coming here.
 On a recent afternoon, a group of pilgrims from the Iranian city of Isfahan -- many in tears and in a trancelike state -- inched toward the shimmering golden-domed shrine ahead chanting ''Hussein beloved'' in Persian. Inside, Iranians jostled other pilgrims to grip the ornate gold and silver cagelike structure bearing the tomb of Prophet Muhammad's grandson Imam Hussein, shrouded in green fabric embroidered with precious stones. 
 It is religious devotion that compels them to come. But Iran's government is part of the equation, too, encouraging a greater Iranian presence in Iraq by supporting companies that control a lucrative segment of the pilgrimage business and renovating and maintaining Shiite shrines in Iraq.
 While the United States and surrounding Arab nations worry about direct Iranian influence and support for armed groups, the pilgrimages present a small but important example of Iran's rising soft power in Iraq. And it is something that makes Iraqis increasingly resentful.
 Recently, the Interior Ministry banned Persian signs inside Karbala despite the fact most Iranian pilgrims speak no Arabic. 
 In April, Karbala's residents demonstrated against the awarding of a contract to an Iranian company, Al Kawthar, to renovate the historic city center, including the area around the shrines of Imam Hussein and his brother Abu Fadhil al-Abbas, part of a $100-million project. Officials say they have been inundated with petitions against the Iranian proposal.
 ''We are Arabs, we will not accept to be colonized by anyone,'' said Ali al-Hayawi, a hotel owner in Karbala catering to pilgrims, who is opposed to Iran's involvement in the project. ''We do not take orders from the Iranians.''
 The dynamic in Karbala suggests that Iran may have a hard time exerting any deep sway among Iraqis, even among fellow Shiites, with suspicion playing out on several fronts. But at the national level, the relationship is more of a tug of war. The Iraqi government may want to keep Iran at arm's length, but it also needs Iran economically and as a strategic ally. 
 Iran and Iraq have always had a contentious relationship, and it became more complicated with the American presence in Iraq. 
 The two predominantly Shiite countries share an 800-mile border and historical, cultural and trade ties, but attitudes on both sides remain colored both by ancient enmities and an eight-year war in the 1980s that left hundreds of thousands dead or maimed. Saddam Hussein did allow Iranian pilgrims back into Iraq in the mid-1990s, but it was a fraction of the current number and they were under the constant watch of his secret police.
 Iraq signed an agreement with Iran in 2005 to allow up to 5,000 Iranian pilgrims in each day. Most come by land and stay for a week. There are also three daily flights now ferrying Iranian pilgrims to Iraq. Tehran wants to send many more and to improve the infrastructure in the shrine cities to allow it. 
 Karbala, for instance, receives millions of visitors each year but has a maximum hotel capacity of 23,000, local officials say.
 Nationalists and Sunni extremists aside, many Iraqis welcome Iranian pilgrims, whose business is vital for the economies of this shrine city, nearby Najaf and the area around the Shiite shrine in the Kadhimiya district of Baghdad. And the government deploys its security forces liberally to protect them.
 At the same time many Iraqis bristle at Iran's perceived negative influence and meddling in internal politics, especially through the governing Iraqi Shiite parties that have been nurtured by Iran for years. 
 ''Three-quarters of the power is in their hands,'' said Haidar Abdul-Hassan, a shopkeeper in Karbala, referring to Iranians and their Iraqi allies. 
 Iraqi officials, eager not to be seen as beholden to Iran, become cagey and agitated when asked about Iranian influence in Karbala, insisting that it is minimal. 
 A closer look, though, reveals a different picture. 
 Behind the Imam Hussein shrine, through a dimly lighted hotel lobby and up a flight of stairs are the offices of Shamsa, a private Iranian company that has a virtual monopoly on Iranian pilgrimages to Iraq. 
 Shamsa gets to choose which Iraqi companies to deal with for the transportation, protection and accommodation of pilgrims. Almost all its partners are companies affiliated with Iraqi political parties close to Iran, according to those in the business. An example is the Ihsan private security company, which is close to the influential Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. 
 Tucked inside a warren of alleys in Karbala's bazaar are the nondescript offices of Setad Bazsazi Atabat Aliyat. It is a company owned by the Iranian government, involved in shrine renovation worldwide and busy at work here. 
 An entry on a whiteboard reads: ''Deliver five air-cooling units to Imam Hussein's shrine.''
 Glossy graphic designs of the contentious Karbala shrine renovation project hang on the walls. The project entails demolishing old homes, enlarging the plaza between the shrines and constructing two underground levels and shopping malls. Al Kawthar, the Iranian company awarded the design contract, is a Setad affiliate.
 Both operate in all shrine cities. Projects in Karbala alone include a hospital, several large hotels and apartment complexes and an Iranian-run religious seminary.
 In May 2008, Setad's chairman told Iranian news media that Iran donated nearly $1 billion to equip and renovate Iraq's shrines. Shrine officials in Karbala at the time said the number was ''highly exaggerated.''
 The United States military commander for the nine mainly Shiite provinces south of Baghdad, including Karbala, said recently that while Iran reduced but did not completely cut off its ''lethal support'' and arming of militias in Iraq, it had sought to increase its soft power through charities and economic and political organizations. 
 ''Some of it is good,'' said the commander, Maj. Gen. Michael Oates. ''My concern is the degree to which they may seek to influence Iraqi politics.''

HEADLINE: Who Is to Blame for the Next Attack?

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
AFTER watching the farce surrounding Dick Cheney's coming-out party this month, you have to wonder: Which will reach Washington first, change or the terrorists? If change doesn't arrive soon, terrorists may well rush in where the capital's fools now tread. 
 The Beltway antics that greeted the great Cheney-Obama torture debate were an unsettling return to the post-9/11 dynamic that landed America in Iraq. Once again Cheney and his cohort were using lies and fear to try to gain political advantage -- this time to rewrite history and escape accountability for the failed Bush presidency rather than to drum up a new war. Once again Democrats in Congress were cowed. And once again too much of the so-called liberal news media parroted the right's scare tactics, putting America's real security interests at risk by failing to challenge any Washington politician carrying a big stick. 
 Cheney's ''no middle ground'' speech on torture at the American Enterprise Institute arrived with the kind of orchestrated media campaign that he, his boss and Karl Rove patented in the good old days. It was bookended by a pair of Republican attack ads on the Web that crosscut President Obama's planned closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention center with apocalyptic imagery -- graphic video of the burning twin towers in one ad, a roar of nuclear holocaust (borrowed from the L.B.J. ''daisy'' ad of 1964) in the other. 
 The speech itself, with 20 mentions of 9/11, struck the same cynical note as the ads, as if the G.O.P. was almost rooting for a terrorist attack on Obama's watch. ''No one wishes the current administration more success in defending the country than we do,'' Cheney said as a disingenuous disclaimer before going on to charge that Obama's ''half measures'' were leaving Americans ''half exposed.'' The new president, he said, is unraveling ''the very policies that kept our people safe since 9/11.'' In other words, when the next attack comes, it will be all Obama's fault. A new ad shouting ''We told you so!'' awaits only the updated video.
 The Republicans at least have an excuse for pushing this poison. They are desperate. The trio of Pillsbury doughboys now leading the party -- Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich, Cheney -- have variously cemented the G.O.P.'s brand as a whites-only men's club by revoking Colin Powell's membership and smearing the first Latina Supreme Court nominee as a ''reverse racist.'' Republicans in Congress have no plausible economic, health care or energy policies to counter Obama's. The only card left to play is 9/11.
 Yet even before Cheney spoke, Congressional Democrats were quaking in fear, purporting with straight faces that the transfer of detainees to ''supermax'' American prisons constituted a serious security threat. Many of the same senators who signed on to the Iraq war resolution in the fall of 2002 joined the 90-to-6 majority that put a hold on Obama's Gitmo closure plans.
 The deja vu in the news media was more chilling. Rather than vet the substance of Cheney's fulmination, talking heads instead hyped the split-screen ''dueling speeches'' gimmick of the back-to-back Obama-Cheney scheduling. Time magazine's political Web site Photoshopped Cheney and Obama's faces atop prize fighters' bodies.
 Most of the punditocracy scored the fight on a curve, setting up a false equivalence between the men's ideas. Cheney's pugnacious certitude edged out Obama's law-professor nuance. ''On policy grounds, you've got a real legitimate fight here,'' David Gregory insisted on ''Meet the Press'' as he regurgitated the former vice president's argument (''You can't compromise on these matters'') and questioned whether the president could ''really bring'' his brand of pragmatism ''to the issue of the war on terror.'' 
 One New York Daily News columnist summed up Cheney's supposed TKO this way: ''The key to Cheney's powerful performance: facts, facts, facts.'' But the facts, as usual, were wrong.
 At the McClatchy newspapers' Washington bureau, the reporters Jonathan S. Landay and Warren P. Strobel detailed 10 whoppers. With selective quotations, Cheney falsified the views of the director of national intelligence, Adm. Dennis Blair, on the supposed intelligence value of waterboarding. Equally bogus was Cheney's boast that his administration had ''moved decisively against the terrorists in their hideouts and their sanctuaries, and committed to using every asset to take down their networks.'' In truth, the Bush administration had lost Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, not least because it started diverting huge assets to Iraq before accomplishing the mission of vanquishing Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. That decision makes us less safe to this very minute.
 You can find a link to the complete Landay-Strobel accounting of Cheney's errors in the online version of this column. The failure of much of the press to match their effort has a troubling historical antecedent. These are the same two journalists who, reporting for what was then Knight Ridder, uncovered much of the deceitin the Bush-Cheney case for the Iraq war in the crucial weeks before Congress gave the invasion the green light. 
 On Sept. 6, 2002, Landay and Strobel reported that there was no known new intelligence indicating that ''the Iraqis have made significant advances in their nuclear, biological or chemical weapons programs.'' It was two days later that The Times ran its nownotorious front-page account of Saddam Hussein's ''quest for thousands of high-strength aluminum tubes.'' In the months that followed, as the Bush White House kept beating the drum for Saddam's imminent mushroom clouds to little challenge from most news organizations, Landay and Strobel reported on the ''lack of hard evidence'' of Iraqi weapons and the infightingamong intelligence agencies. Their scoops were largely ignored by the big papers and networks as America hurtled toward fiasco.
 Another reporter who was ahead of the pack in unmasking Bush-Cheney propaganda is the author Ron Suskind. In his 2006 book on the American intelligence matrix, ''The One Percent Doctrine,'' Suskind wrote about a fully operational and potentially catastrophic post-9/11 Qaeda assault on America that actually was aborted in the Bush years: a hydrogen cyanide attack planned for the New York City subways. It was halted 45 days before zero hour -- but not because we stopped it. Al-Zawahri had called it off. 
 When Bush and Cheney learned of the cancellation later on from conventional intelligence, they were baffled as to why. The answer: Al-Zawahri had decided that a rush-hour New York subway attack was not enough of an encore to top 9/11. Al Qaeda's ''special event'' strategy, Suskind wrote, requires the creation of ''an upward arc of rising and terrible expectation'' that is ''multiplied by time passing.'' The event that fits that bill after 9/11 must involve some kind of nuclear weapon.
 ''What are the lessons of this period?'' Suskind asked when we spoke last week. ''If you draw the wrong lessons, you end up embracing the wrong answers.'' They are certainly not the lessons cited by Cheney. Waterboarding hasn't and isn't going to save us from anything. The ticking time-bomb debate rekindled by Cheney's speech may be entertaining on ''24'' or cable-news food fights, but is a detour from the actual perils before the country. ''What we're dealing with is a patient foe who thinks in decades while we tend to think more in news cycles,'' Suskind said. ''We have to try to wrestle this fear-based debate into something resembling a reality-based discussion.''
 The reality is that while the Bush administration was bogged down in Iraq and being played by Pervez Musharraf, the likelihood of Qaeda gaining access to nuclear weapons in a Taliban-saturated Pakistan was increasing by the day. We know that in the month before 9/11, bin Laden and al-Zawahri met with the Pakistani nuclear scientist Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood. That was the real link between 9/11 and nuclear terror that the Bush administration let metastasize while it squandered American resources on a fictional link between 9/11 and a ''nuclear'' Saddam.
 And where are we now? On the eve of Obama's inauguration, David Sanger reported in The Times that military and nuclear experts agree that if ''a real-life crisis'' breaks out in Pakistan ''it is unlikely that anyone would be able to assure an American president, with confidence, that he knew where all of Pakistan's weapons were -- or that none were in the hands of Islamic extremists.'' 
 Pakistan is the time bomb. But with a push from Cheney, abetted by too many Democrats and too many compliant journalists, we have been distracted into drawing the wrong lessons, embracing the wrong answers. We are even wasting time worrying that detainees might escape from tomb-sized concrete cells in Colorado. 
 What we need to be doing instead, as Suskind put it, is to ''build the thing we don't have -- human intelligence. We need people who are cooperating with us, who step up and help, and who won't turn away when they see things happening. Hearts and minds -- which we've botched -- must be corrected and corrected quickly. That's what wins the battle, not going medieval.'' It's not for nothing, after all, that Powell, Gen. David Petraeus and Robert Gates, the secretary of defense -- among other military minds -- agree with Obama, not Cheney, about torture and Gitmo.
 The harrowing truth remains unchanged from what it was before Cheney emerged from his bunker to set Washington atwitter. The Bush administration did not make us safer either before or after 9/11. Obama is not making us less safe. If there's another terrorist attack, it will be because the mess the Bush administration ignored in Pakistan and Afghanistan spun beyond anyone's control well before Americans could throw the bums out.

Real Money Men
 Q. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is a New York City billionaire. We know. But who was the first local to be worth a billion?
 A. We don't know. Laurence A. Tisch? Donald Trump? Rupert Murdoch? Or one of the city's many financiers and real estate barons who are virtually anonymous and want to keep it that way? Not even the helpful folks at Forbes magazine, which likes to list billionaires, could tell us who in New York first got to 10 figures. (There is historical debate over whether John D. Rockefeller Sr. was ever worth a billion, leaving aside the question of whether Rockefeller, of Cleveland and Westchester County, was a New Yorker.) 
 F.Y.I.'s best guess is Daniel K. Ludwig, the shipowner, who died in his Manhattan apartment in 1992; he was being called a billionaire in the 1970s, when a billion was really a billion and before Mr. Bloomberg had even started his own company. But we can't be sure. 
 We've been reckoning billionaires in what finance calls nominal dollars, the dollars of their own time. Prof. Robert E. Wright, a financial historian at New York University, suggested changing the definition to real, or inflation-adjusted, dollars. In that case, one can make an argument for John Jacob Astor (1763-1848), the fur trader and Manhattan real estate magnate. 
 ''Undoubtedly a New Yorker, Astor was worth about $20 million nominal upon his death,'' Professor Wright said in an e-mail message. Depending on the method of calculation used, that was the equivalent of $421 million to $119 billion today. The results vary widely depending on the goods and services one compares from different eras, but if one chooses the method that produces the highest figure, some 18th-century New Yorker might have hit one billion even earlier, Professor Wright said. 
 Tribute in Transit
 Q.I am always taken aback when I hear the message: ''This is an E train bound for the World Trade Center,'' because I know it is a phantom destination. What was the thinking behind giving the final downtown stop that name? 
 A. Symbolism and consistency. 
 There was some discussion after 9/11 about what to call the terminus for the E once it reopened, said Deirdre Parker, a spokeswoman for New York City Transit. ''We did not want to strip 'the World Trade Center' from our public information,'' she said in an e-mail message.
 Ms. Parker also noted that the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation calls the future complex the World Trade Center Towers; New Jersey PATH and the Tribute W.T.C. Visitor Center both use the name; and there is a new 7 World Trade Center. The full name of the memorial is the National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center.
 Round and Round
 Q.I see buses go back and forth all day -- the same ones, by their roof numbers. How many miles does a typical city bus put on in a year?
 A. About 27,000, according to New York City Transit. That's more than enough to go around the world.
 Ozone (Park, Not Layer)
 Q. How did Ozone Park, Queens, get its name? One suggestion I heard is that it was the ''O'' zone as distinct from the ''P'' zone.
 A. Ozone was no zone. The name sprang from the fancy of two 19th-century developers, Benjamin W. Hitchcock and Charles C. Denton, who bought farmland and created building lots after a railroad opened in 1880 from Long Island City to Howard Beach. They decided to call their development Ozone Park to promote the idea of cool, clean breezes blowing in from the Atlantic Ocean. Fresh air is one of the meanings of ozone.

HEADLINE: Sotomayor Would Be Sixth Catholic Justice, but the Pigeonholing Ends There

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
If Judge Sonia Sotomayor is confirmed for a seat on the Supreme Court, she will be the sixth of the nine justices who are Roman Catholic -- a stunning robed portrait in a country where Catholics were once targets of discrimination and suspicion. 
 Four of the Catholics on the court are reported to be committed attenders of Mass, and they make up the court's solid conservative bloc -- Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. The fifth Catholic, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, often votes with them. 
 There are indications that Judge Sotomayor is more like the majority of American Catholics: those who were raised in the faith and shaped by its values, but who do not attend Mass regularly and are not particularly active in religious life. Like many Americans, Judge Sotomayor may be what religion scholars call a ''cultural Catholic'' -- a category that could say something about her political and social attitudes. 
 Interviews with more than a dozen of Judge Sotomayor's friends from high school, college, law school and professional life said they had never heard her talk about her faith, and had no recollection of her ever going to Mass or belonging to a parish. Her family did not return phone calls for comment. 
 A White House spokesman, speaking on background, put it this way: ''She currently does not belong to a particular parish or church, but she attends church with family and friends for important occasions.'' 
 Many of Judge Sotomayor's friends and colleagues also said they believed that her expressed commitment to social justice and community service is a reflection of her Catholic upbringing. 
 ''In law school, it was very clear she was committed to serving the community and using the law as an instrument of service to the greater good,'' said Rachel Moran, a professor at the University of California Berkeley School of Law who is on leave to help establish a law school at the University of California, Irvine. ''That's a mark of religion, even if she didn't say so.'' 
 Studies have consistently shown that the 57 percent of Catholics who rarely or never attend Mass are far more liberal on political and cultural issues than Catholics who attend weekly or at least once a month. 
 In fact, 52 percent of Catholics who do not attend church regularly say abortion is morally acceptable, compared with 24 percent of churchgoing Catholics, according to a Gallup study released in March based on polling over the previous three years. Gallup found that 61 percent of non-churchgoing Catholics found same-sex relationships morally acceptable, compared with 44 percent of churchgoers. 
 But legal scholars say that while Judge Sotomayor's Catholic identity will undoubtedly shape her perceptions, they will not determine how she would rule on the bench. After all, they point out, Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Frank Murphy, both Catholics, had records as liberals, while Justice Scalia has been a reliable conservative. Their positions have differed, even on issues covered in Catholic teaching, like abortion. 
 ''I don't think there is any one Catholic stance on the law,'' said M. Cathleen Kaveny, a professor of law and theology at the University of Notre Dame. ''Catholicism is a big tent, so different people are drawn to different aspects of it. A Dorothy Day Catholic is going to be different than an Opus Dei Catholic,'' she said. (Dorothy Day founded the Catholic Worker movement that promotes justice for the poor; Opus Dei is a church prelature that promotes personal orthodoxy.) 
 ''You'll have judges who are pro-life personally who are going to rule that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land,'' Ms. Kaveny said. ''People recognize that the task of the judge is different than the task of a lawmaker.''
 After her father died, Judge Sotomayor was brought up in the Bronx by her mother. She attended Cardinal Spellman High School, an academically rigorous Catholic school, in an era when boys and girls were segregated. 
 But it was also in the era after the Second Vatican Council, when the church was opening to modern culture. Mass at Spellman High was accompanied by a guitar, and girls were asking why they could not be altar servers, said Jane Morris, who knew Judge Sotomayor while both were student council leaders. 
 ''We were allowed and encouraged to ask a lot of questions,'' said Ms. Morris, who is now the girls athletic director at Spellman High. ''We were asking, what's wrong with the other religions, and why do you say everybody else is going to Hell?'' 
 At Princeton, where Judge Sotomayor belonged to a Puerto Rican student group, a group of Latino students attended Mass every week, but she was not among them, a former classmate recalled.
 Judge Sotomayor married her boyfriend from high school, Kevin E. Noonan, in a small chapel at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City in the summer of 1976, after both graduated from college, according to a friend of Judge Sotomayor. But within seven years they were divorced, and it is not known whether she obtained a marriage annulment from the church. She has not remarried and has no children. 
 As a Hispanic Catholic, Judge Sotomayor is part of the church's most vibrant and growing wing. Hispanic Catholics, studies show, are more liberal than white Catholics on some social and economic issues, like immigration and health care reform, but more conservative on homosexuality and abortion. 
 Justice Scalia, whose son is a Catholic priest, and Justice Alito are of Italian Catholic ancestry. Justice Thomas is an African-American convert who once went to seminary, left the church for 28 years and rejoined in the mid-1990s. 
 Lucas A. Powe Jr., a professor of law and government at the University of Texas, Austin, said Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito are ''Catholic and movement conservatives.'' 
 ''That combination is just golden for being anti-abortion and anti-affirmative action,'' said Mr. Powe, author of ''The Supreme Court and the American Elite, 1789-2008'' (March 2009, Harvard University Press).
 Justice Kennedy, who wrote two decisions favoring equal rights for gay people, is a ''country club Republican,'' which Mr. Powe described as ''an economic conservative without some of the social conservatism.'' 
 The court's liberal wing is made up of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, who are Jewish, and John Paul Stevens, a Protestant.
 The Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, a Jesuit priest and the former president of Fordham University, who came to know Judge Sotomayor when they both served on the New York City Campaign Finance Board in the 1980s, said: ''I just don't think Sonia would fit in with Roberts, exactly, and certainly not Scalia. I think they're very different Catholics.''

HEADLINE: Other Voices: Playing by the Rules

 BODY:
Re ''The Writers Make News. Unfortunately.'' (May 24):
 I was surprised to learn that Thomas L. Friedman commands a $75,000 speaking fee, his international best sellers notwithstanding. I imagine some elite private universities could afford to pay that sum, but it seems improbable that most nonprofit groups could justify that expenditure, let alone a ''governmental agency'' in the most cash-strapped state in America. At least Mr. Friedman made no excuses.
If Maureen Dowd actually got a 42 word ''quote'' in writing from a friend and then used it almost verbatim, why didn't she attribute the comment to the e-mail correspondent who gave it to her? The fact that Ms. Dowd did not realize from whom she was taking the quote does not mean she was unaware that the unattributed words were not her own, which is the essence of plagiarism. You should have named it as such. 
 Edmund Andrews demonstrated poor personal judgment in his finances and poor professional judgment in continuing to cover stories related to an area where he had an actual or potential conflict of interest. You sidestepped the larger issue here: Mr. Andrews now lacks credibility about economic issues because he was so forthright about many of his multiple financial missteps in order, it seems, to get a big payday from his forthcoming book. If The Times keeps Mr. Andrews on staff, he needs a new beat. 
 You use the word ''pounce'' to describe the vigilance of outside observers, a rather charged term that suggests that monitoring is somehow inappropriate. Oversight is essential and should come from your editors. But you should welcome -- rather than discourage -- outside scrutiny. 
 MARY PAT TREUTHART Spokane, Wash., May 26, 2009
 Crediting two bloggers doesn't justify copying and pasting the words of a third. The words were clearly not Maureen Dowd's, and even the punctuation was the same as Josh Marshall's. Mr. Marshall isn't pressing the issue and considers the matter closed, but that doesn't justify letting Ms. Dowd off the hook with just a correction. The passive-voice note that she ''failed to attribute a paragraph'' seems to play down what actually occurred. 
 You note that ''Dowd told me the passage in question was part of an e-mail conversation with her friend.'' Since Ms. Dowd lifted someone else's words without attribution, it seems odd that The Times is simply taking her word for how this incident occurred. I feel that this is plagiarism. Most definitions I've seen don't require that there be specific intent behind the copying. 
 I believe Ms. Dowd owes Mr. Marshall, The Times and her readers an apology for lifting the passage. And either she or The Times should explain just how this happened. DAVE BRUCE
 Hoboken, N.J., May 24, 2009
 You write, ''The Times has not been abiding by all its rules on speaking fees for years.'' For years? Perhaps The Times should refer to its ''rules,'' then, as suggestions, recommendations or advisories. Is a nod as good as a wink? 
 When is a rule not a rule? In a fifth-grade English class, some clarification may be in order, but at The Times? 
 Why should readers spend time ingesting Times articles if the management can't tell the difference between a rule and not-a-rule? Can readers believe editors know the difference between a fact and not-quite-a-fact? A columnist's paragraph and one that belonged to another, unattributed source? 
 I thought this was the reason I read The Times and not blogs. 
 THOMAS C. PAUTLER Providence, R.I., May 24, 2009
 The News From Boston
 Re ''When Your Sister Is the Story'' (May 10):
 I think the real problem with The Times's coverage of The Boston Globe is not, as you phrase it, that ''your sister is the story.'' I'm certain that the acquisition of The Globe from the Taylor family was prominently displayed in The Times in 1993. 
 No, the real reason for burying the continuing Times-Globe negotiations could best be encapsulated in a headline like: ''When Abusing Your Sister Is the Story.'' As in real life, it's the shameful things that get buried. 
 To continue with the family metaphor, weddings, celebrations and college acceptances always get good play; it's the arrests and the domestic violence that families whisper about. IVONNE ROVIRA
 Louisville, Ky., May 10, 2009
 It is indeed sad when a still renowned newspaper like The Times falls short of its responsibility for its ''sister.'' A free press is essential for a democracy, particularly ours, which sits on the top of all democracies, waving its finger at those trying to be one. 
 The steps of the ladder down are quicker than the ones up. In these past years our press has abdicated its responsibility to its citizens and readers. 
 Leadership comes from the top and sets the pace. I lived and worked in Boston and found The Boston Globe to be a very important part of life in that beautiful city. I hope that The New York Times Company will be able to save The Globe. 
 CHRISTA DOWLING New York, May 11, 2009
 Was It a Story?
 Re ''The Tip That Didn't Pan Out'' (May 17): Two thoughts, from a fellow journalist who worked 25 years for daily newspapers:
 Are we really supposed to believe that the all-caps ''SIGH!'' in the e-mail message from Stephanie Strom, the Times reporter writing about troubles within the Acorn group and a possible ''Obama connection,'' was anything other than an indication of her political leanings? You're stretching your credibility thin on that one. 
 And can you seriously tell us that The Times wouldn't have run the story if it had involved Republican shenanigans? It's sad to see what depths The Times will sink to not only in pursuit of its agenda but also in its public editor's attempts to explain that away as simply good journalism.

HEADLINE: Connecticut: Going It Alone

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
As a product of the New England tradition of strong local government, Connecticut gives its 169 towns the kind of broad power and autonomy on land use, taxes and infrastructure that most states reserve for large cities. 
 Those powers have only increased since 1960, when Connecticut disbanded its eight county governments, giving most administrative duties to its towns. So while state officials invoke the concept of regionalism to talk about reducing taxes, they tread lightly. There are scattered examples of towns sharing services, and Gov. M. Jodi Rell has allocated money to encourage communities to band together to purchase equipment like snowplows and fire trucks. Mrs. Rell also is pushing through a plan to consolidate the probate court system. 
 But calls for wholesale mergers of communities or regional economic plans have never gone far. State Assemblyman Brendan Sharkey, a Democrat from Hamden, has spent years seeking approval of a plan to give towns a portion of the state sales tax in exchange for combining public services like road maintenance and sewer and water systems and joining together on economic projects.
 But to no avail. ''People in Connecticut are vested in the idea of their town going it alone,'' Carl Goldfield, an alderman in New Haven, said. ''The independent town is part of what Connecticut is all about.''

HEADLINE: It's Not About Bill

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER. 
Peter Baker, a White House correspondent for The Times and a contributing writer for the magazine, last wrote about the frustrations of a retiring Republican congressman.

 BODY:
Bill Clinton loves toshop. On a March day in an elegant crafts store in Lima, the Peruvian capital, he hunted for presents for his wife and the women on his staff back home. He had given a speech at a university earlier and just came from a ceremony kicking off a program to help impoverished Peruvians. Now he was eyeing a necklace with a green stone amulet.
 Standing all by himself, the former president of the United States moved his eyes methodically across shelves of wooden carvings, jewelry and sculptures as he searched for something distinctive to bring his wife. ''She used to look forward to me coming home from wherever I've been,'' he mused with a laugh. ''Now I'm afraid I'll be second fiddle to whatever world leader she's just met.''
 Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state, had in fact just returned home from a trip to Mexico, then rushed to the White House to help announce a new war strategy. ''I saw her on CNN standing behind the president talking about Afghanistan,'' her husband said. ''Then she went to Dallas for something. I don't know why.'' 
 He spotted a turquoise bracelet. ''Hillary likes turquoise,'' he noted as he fingered the piece. 
 He decided to buy it. In between his globe-trotting philanthropy, speech making and legacy burnishing, Clinton is a regular at crafts stores around the world and can tell you the best ones in Hong Kong or Arusha. ''They're a great thing,'' he said. ''If all of your staff are women and all of your family are women, you just buy what you like and bring them home and then figure out who to give them to.''
 The store owner showed him a selection of shoulder bags for women. Clinton selected one he thought would be great for his friend, Frank Giustra, the Canadian mining mogul, to give to Giustra's girlfriend. Clinton said he likes picking out gifts for his friends' wives and girlfriends.
 After a half-hour, he slipped back into his motorcade and headed to the Restaurant Huaca Pucllana, adjacent to pre-Incan ruins dating back 1,500 years. Clinton settled into a seat at a long table that included his traveling party: Giustra, a half-dozen aides, some local advance people and me. 
 He seemed a little tired, having flown overnight to Peru from New York before plunging into a full day of activities. More than eight years after leaving office and nearly five years after an open-heart operation, Clinton at 62 looks older than the boy president who dominated American politics in the 1990s, but he remains more robust than most men his age and full of intellectual energy. His left hand trembled a little bit during dinner, as it tends to do late in the day. It worried him enough at one point that he had himself tested for Parkinson's disease, but the results came back negative; his doctor says he has just signed too many autographs over the years. When I mentioned that he had to get hearing aids during his White House tenure because of the effects of too many campaign rallies, he cheerfully pulled out the latest equipment from his ear and showed off how sleek and virtually invisible it was.
 By the end of a three-day jaunt through Peru and Colombia to check up on programs sponsored by the William J. Clinton Foundation, I realized how familiar the trip felt -- not because it resembled the travels he made as president but because it resembled the ones Hillary Clinton made as first lady. As a White House correspondent at the time, I accompanied her to Africa, Europe and Latin America. She typically would make a courtesy stop at a palace for a brief meeting with the head of state, but the trips were built around round-table discussions or visits to far-off villages to explore how people confronted the challenges of their world. That's what Bill Clinton was doing now. The next day he would wake up in Lima, fly to Barranquilla on Colombia's northern coast and then to Medellin before settling into a hotel in Cartagena. When I later made the observation to him, he said with a laugh, ''We've reversed roles.'' 
 One day during the trip, he was standing on an airport tarmac in Colombia, struggling with the mobile telephone pressed to his ear. ''The only bad thing about Hillary's being secretary of state,'' he groused good-naturedly, ''is I can't always get hold of her. They changed all her phone numbers, and her phone doesn't work inside the State Department building.''
 Clinton has now spent more time as a former president than he did as president, a point he said he made to Hillary when they arrived home after President Barack Obama's inauguration. ''I looked at her and I said, 'You realize we've now been out of the White House longer than we were in it.' ''
 The advent of a new Democratic administration, with his wife in the top cabinet slot, has opened a new chapter in the eventful life of the nation's 42nd president. No longer in exile, yet not exactly in the inner circle, Clinton is trying to define his role and find his place in the Age of Obama. He agreed to some limits on his activities to satisfy the good-government advocates around Obama, but he is still traveling the globe, pushing his favorite philanthropic programs, collecting six-figure checks for speeches, dining with foreign leaders and in his own way speaking for America again. A couple of weeks ago, he agreed to serve as the United Nations special envoy to Haiti.
 At the same time, he is trying to respect a certain line with the new administration. He sends memos occasionally to the national-security adviser, Jim Jones. He talks with Vice President Joe Biden perhaps once a week and less frequently with former aides like Rahm Emanuel, Larry Summers and Carol Browner, who all now hold high positions in Obama's White House. But he leaves Obama alone. When I visited Clinton at his office in Harlem last month, he said he had talked with Obama only once since the inauguration and could not remember what about. ''I try to stay out of their way,'' he told me. ''I've got plenty to do. I've got a full life here. If I come up with an idea I think that's helpful to them, I give it to them.''
 He has easier access to the secretary of state, at least when he can get the phones to work. ''If she asks, I tell her what I think,'' Clinton said. ''And if there's something that's going on that I feel that I have a particular knowledge of, I say that.'' Does she ask? ''Yeah, quite frequently she does,'' he said. ''She says: 'Did you ever work with this guy? Do you know him?' ''
 Hillary Clinton, who declined to comment for this article, recently told Mark Landler of The Times that her husband is careful to give her space but can be a useful source of information. ''He just knows a lot and he knows everybody,'' she said. ''He has a broad-gauge understanding of issues and personalities, so he's always value-added.''
 No one has combined the roles of former president and cabinet spouse before, and the lines are blurry. After Hillary Clinton's nomination for secretary of state was announced, the telephones at her husband's office rang as various ambassadors tried to go through him to get a meeting. The foreign leaders he meets with now ask after his wife and know they can use him to get messages to her. But Obama has not tapped Clinton to do anything significant for the new administration yet. Unless Obama messes up, says a former top Clinton aide, ''President Clinton is irrelevant.'' Obama does not need him. ''This is not a circumstance in which Bill Clinton is going to have much of a role,'' the aide says.
 So Clinton is doing his own thing. The restrictions Obama imposed on Clinton's activities -- like disclosing his foundation's donors and no longer convening conferences overseas -- have done little to tether him to New York. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Clinton roamed the halls, mixing with the dignitaries as if it were an Oxford reunion. After hosting a reception at a local museum on opening night, he wandered over to the Sheraton to a private party held by Vladimir Putin, the Russian prime minister, who welcomed him as ''our good friend'' and toasted him with vodka shots. The two then retired to a private room, planted themselves at a table and talked deep into the night.
 When I asked Clinton later what they discussed, he lapsed into stories about Putin and his own love for Boris Yeltsin but divulged little of what was said. Even so, it seems reasonable to infer that Putin was hoping to send messages to the new administration through the husband of the secretary of state. On missile defense, Clinton said Putin told him, ''Oh, we're going to work it out now.'' And Putin stressed that his handpicked successor as president, Dmitri Medvedev, was not just a puppet. 
 For both the trip to Davos and the trip to South America that I joined, Clinton said he checked first with Jim Jones at the National Security Council. ''I say: 'Look, I've been invited to go to this place. These people will be there. Do you want me not to go?' '' he told me early last month. ''If they want me to make any points on their behalf, I'll do it. I really do believe there can only be one president at a time.'' A White House official later told me that Clinton also checked with Jones before agreeing to take the United Nations post.
 So far, the former president has avoided causing trouble for the new one. Before Hillary Clinton was picked for secretary of state, some Obama advisers were wary of bringing a freelancing Bill Clinton inside the tent. But to their surprise, Clinton has done nothing to complicate Obama's life so far. As of early May, Clinton had never been mentioned during the daily White House senior staff meetings as an issue to be dealt with, according to two officials who attend. By contrast, one of them said, Jimmy Carter had come up twice already.
 ''He left the country in a stronger position, and I think he's pretty much at peace with what he accomplished,'' Mack McLarty, a Clinton friend since kindergarten and his first White House chief of staff, told me. ''That doesn't mean that from time to time, President Clinton wouldn't like to be engaged and be in the action. That's an understandable human feeling. But it's not burning him up or eating him up.''
 Not long after our meeting in Harlem, Clinton was invited to join Obama for a ceremony enacting legislation to expand the AmeriCorps service program, one of the former president's favorite legacies. By the time Clinton left office, more people had served in AmeriCorps than have served in the Peace Corps in its entire history. The ceremony was held at a school in a poorer, predominantly African-American section of Washington. Clinton was acknowledged in the remarks but was not invited onto the main stage or given a speaking role. Instead, Obama used the occasion to heap praise on Senator Edward Kennedy, a key patron during last year's campaign. 
 Afterward, Clinton joined Obama in a motorcade ride to a nearby park to plant trees with members of a program financed by AmeriCorps. Clinton wore boots and gloves. Obama, in dress shoes, watched as his predecessor showed him how it was done, chopping at the dirt and making sure the hole was big enough for the roots to grow. 
 ''Mr. President, I don't think you can do any better than that,'' Obama told him. The two walked up a path together as Clinton prepared to leave. 
 ''Stay in touch,'' said Obama, who went to plant his own tree. Rather than leave, Clinton grabbed a second tree and began planting that one too.
 Clinton was in Hong Kong for a foundation event in December when Obama nominated Hillary Clinton for secretary of state. As Bill Clinton watched the announcement on a television in a restaurant, he could not help voicing his own running commentary. He shouldn't have said that. He could have said this.She should smile now. Mack McLarty, who was with him, nudged him. ''Mr. President,'' he recalls saying, ''there are other people here.''
 Clinton arrived at the inception of the new administration still burned by the campaign that produced it. His flashes of temper and ill-considered remarks on the trail showed a side of him that surprised many accustomed to a smooth political operator. He was riled that a young upstart who had never accomplished much could overtake his wife, according to campaign veterans. He chafed at efforts by her staff to control him and bristled when he felt they were not listening to him. At one point he devoted days to campaigning in South Carolina against the wishes of her strategists, only to watch her lose the primary. ''He never felt a part of the campaign and, in fact, he was not part of the campaign,'' an adviser to Hillary Clinton, who did not want to be named discussing internal dynamics, told me. In part, the strategist said, that was because the candidate herself felt she had to win on her own. ''She was keeping him distant.''
 Now his anger appears gone, and he has entered the reconciliation stage of the familiar Clinton cycle of fall and redemption. ''I think his blood pressure is down again,'' McLarty said. And after an uncertain beginning, he added, Clinton has passed through ''a fragile period'' during the transition and reconciled himself to the new administration. ''I think he's better,'' agreed Skip Rutherford, another longtime friend and dean of the Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas. ''I think he's happier.''
 Two sides of Clinton's persona have long warred with each other, sunny optimism versus angry grievance. Clinton succeeded in politics largely because he projected the former; his worst moments usually came when he gave in to the latter. Both sides are genuine reflections of who he is. Twelve years after his last campaign for office, he found it harder to control his resentments when he returned to the trail on his wife's behalf. In his view, the news media and the political world held her to a different standard, while practically anointing Obama. And when he says her, he also means, in the back of his mind, himself.
 By most accounts, including his own, Clinton was never the same after a quadruple-bypass heart operation in 2004, followed by rare complications affecting his lungs that required another operation six months later. ''Last year, I was exhausted half the time,'' he told me when we sat down last month at his house in Chappaqua outside New York City. ''I literally went to 300 towns in March, April and May alone. I did way over 300 events in those three months, but I was in 300 separate American communities. So you know, you might be a little testy, too, if you didn't get more sleep than I did.''
 When Clinton was in college at Georgetown, a professor mentioned that great men often require less rest than ordinary people, some sleeping no more than five hours a night. Clinton adopted that pattern. But the heart and lung operations drained his fabled stamina. ''It changed me,'' he said. ''One of the things I noticed is that on normal days ever since I had that heart surgery, I'm a lot more laid back and a lot more relaxed and a lot more healthy. But I also noticed since I had the surgery -- and this is what you picked up in the campaign -- that if I'm really, really tired, it's more difficult for me than it was when I was back in politics before I had the heart problem. I have no explanation for why that is. I'm just observing it. It's neither an excuse for any mistake I made or anything else. I'm just explaining. It's something I've noticed. My life has changed.''
 People close to Clinton said he has largely got over his resentment at Obama but not toward Ted Kennedy and his niece, Caroline Kennedy. As Clinton sees it, they say, he did so much for the Kennedys over the years that he felt they became almost family. Nor has he forgiven Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who endorsed Obama even though Clinton appointed him to two cabinet posts. And the man once called the ''first black president'' remains deeply wounded by allegations that he made racially insensitive remarks during the campaign, like dismissing Obama's South Carolina win by comparing it with Jesse Jackson's victories there in the 1980s.
 ''None of them ever really took seriously the race rap,'' he told me. ''They knew it was politics. I had one minister in Texas in the general election come up and put his arm around me.'' This was an Obama supporter. ''And he came up, threw his arm around me and said, 'You've got to forgive us for that race deal.' He said, 'That was out of line.' But he said, 'You know, we wanted to win real bad.' And I said, 'I got no problem with that.' I said it's fine; it's O.K. And we laughed about it and we went on.'' The other side is moving on, too. Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, who once recalled an angry Clinton berating him on the phone for criticizing the former president's campaign rhetoric, is letting bygones be bygones, at least publicly. ''No fence-mending is needed,'' Clyburn said through a spokeswoman.
 Yet if Clinton has a powerful memory for slights, he also has a remarkable capacity for reconciliation. He is likelier to find peace with people who hate him the most than with friends who betray him. He focuses his considerable charms on seducing the person in the room he finds most resistant. Among those he has been friendly with lately is Christopher Ruddy, a conservative journalist who was a chief proponent of cover-up theories involving the Clintons during the 1990s. In his book, ''The Strange Death of Vincent Foster,'' Ruddy rejected official findings that Foster, a deputy White House counsel, killed himself in a Virginia park and suggested the possibility of ''a cover-up conducted by people who have, with the help of the press, placed themselves above the law.'' Ruddy also advanced the notion that Ron Brown, the Clinton commerce secretary who died in an airplane crash in Croatia in 1996, was actually shot in the head.
 Ruddy today is the founder and chief executive of Newsmax, a conservative news-magazine. He told me he came around on Clinton after Ed Koch, the former New York mayor, introduced them. That led to lunches and more contacts, and now Ruddy says he was wrong about Clinton. ''I do consider Bill Clinton a friend, and I think he would consider me a friend,'' Ruddy said. ''And to think of all the wars we went through in the '90s, it seems almost surreal.''
 With the passage of time, Ruddy said he came to believe that Clinton was much less liberal than his enemies thought. After all, Clinton overhauled welfare, tamed the deficit and promoted free trade. While still a proud ''Reagan conservative,'' Ruddy said he now thinks the attacks on Clinton in the 1990s went too far. ''Did we like and enjoy all the salacious reporting and all the stuff going on in the '90s?'' he asked. ''I guess we thought, This is just politics. But looking back at my role, I was probably over the top. And if I knew then what I know today, I wouldn't have pursued some of that stuff as aggressively as I did. I did an honest reporter's job. But I have a different take on it now.''
 Ruddy also attributes his change of heart to Clinton's foundation, which has impressed him and other onetime foes. Richard Mellon Scaife, the billionaire publisher who financed Ruddy's investigations and other anti-Clinton activities, is now a contributor to the foundation. So is Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation chairman whose Fox News was a regular thorn in Clinton's side. Clinton over the years has also made peace with other former adversaries, like Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich. The elder George Bush told me he now considers Clinton ''a real friend.'' When I asked what changed his view, he wrote in an e-mail message: ''I didn't know him personally back then. I knew him, but not up close and personal. Now I do.''
 Clinton's relationship with the younger Bush evolved over the years. ''President Bush the latter didn't like me very much, because I defeated his father, and it was obvious to me when he came to the White House when I was president and he was governor of Texas,'' Clinton recalled. ''Jeb was a better actor.'' The bad blood increased when Clinton left the White House and stories emerged about W's being removed from computer keyboards and so forth, much of which proved to be exaggerated or untrue. The Bush crew bitterly complained that the Clinton team did little to help them; Clinton was bitter at the whisper campaign trashing him. ''I had a talk with him about it one day, a real frank talk, because they were being rough,'' Clinton told me. ''I told him that I understood how he felt, and it didn't bother me. I liked the fact that he loved his father and that I felt a great affection for his father, too. But I said: 'I'll tell you what, I'll make you a deal. If you ever need me to do something for you and I can do it consistent with my conscience, I'll do it.' ''
 Bush took him up on the offer by asking Clinton to work with his father on relief efforts after the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. ''We just developed a relationship,'' Clinton said. ''He would call every now and then. We would talk. I just made it a project. I wanted to figure him out and get to know him.'' Although they disagree on many issues, Clinton said: ''I like him personally. I think he did what he thought was right.'' By the time Bush left office, the two presidents were close enough that Clinton taped a funny testimonial alongside the elder Bush for a video shown on the plane as the 43rd president flew back to Texas after Obama's inauguration. And Clinton and George W. Bush agreed to appear onstage together in Toronto on May 29 for a 90-minute discussion of current events.
 ''You know, I'm a Baptist,'' Clinton explained. ''We don't give up on anybody. We believe in deathbed conversions.'' 
 How about Ken Starr? ''Well,'' he said, then paused. ''That's another kettle of fish.''
 History will always remember that Bill Clinton was the first elected president ever impeached, particularly because the charges were rooted in a tawdry Oval Office fling with a White House intern and fostered a divisive partisan showdown ending in his acquittal. But Clinton has not been willing to trust history to write his story. 
 When Clinton left office, he was lost at first. McLarty recalled being ''a little concerned'' for a while. But then the former president established a foundation with ambition to match his own. Financed by Saudi princes, Indian tycoons, Hollywood moguls and governments like Australia and Norway, Clinton has assembled an operation with 1,400 paid employees and volunteers working in 40 countries to fight disease, poverty and climate change. The foundation has made a place for itself as a generator of new ways of tackling old problems. Rather than just pour money into an issue, it searches for market-based solutions that bring together business, government and the nonprofit sector.
 The claimed successes at times sound grandiose. The Clinton Global Initiative asserts that it has ''affected more than 200 million lives in 150 countries'' through $46 billion in commitments by its members. Whatever the details, the foundation's work clearly has yielded tangible results, most notably in the fight against H.I.V./AIDS. By negotiating a volume contract with the pharmaceutical industry, the foundation cut the cost of anti-retroviral medicine by nearly half for the developing world; governments around the globe have bought drugs off the Clinton contract for about two million people living with the disease. 
 Clinton's peripatetic journeys in South America showcased other initiatives. In Lima, he attended a ceremony kicking off a project to provide 50,000 cataract operations for the poor over four years. In Cartagena, wearing a hand-woven bracelet that he was given during a previous visit in 2002 and has never taken off, Clinton visited young women growing and selling spices thanks to help from the foundation.
 His foundation works on the home front too. Shortly after returning from South America, I went to see him at the Empire State Building as the owners announced a ''green'' retrofit to cut energy consumption and save $4.4 million a year on utility bills. The project represented a Clinton-foundation approach to reduce the carbon footprint of large buildings across the world: building owners obtain financing from banks to renovate their properties by dedicating the savings from lower utility bills to repay the loans. Energy-services companies guarantee reductions in energy consumption to achieve those savings or provide the difference if they fall short. ''We'll never conquer climate change,'' Clinton told the crowd on the 80th floor, ''until we prove it's good business to do so.''
 Some friends think he is using his postpresidency to make up for what he could not achieve during his presidency. ''He's got a lot of unfinished business that he wants to do,'' Skip Rutherford, of the Clinton School of Public Service, said. ''I think he's completing a lot of things he wished he could have done as president.'' Bono, the rock star and activist, said he believes Clinton regrets in particular that he did not do more in office to fight AIDS overseas. ''He did a lot on domestic AIDS, but I think he does beat himself up on not dealing with global AIDS quickly enough,'' Bono told me. Since leaving office, he said, Clinton ''not only got up to speed but got into the fast lane in fighting this epidemic.'' 
 Clinton agrees, to a point. ''Some of the things, yes, it's unfinished business,'' he told me. ''That's mostly the climate-change thing and, to some extent, AIDS. But AIDS was more like here's something where I can still make a difference.'' On climate change, he argued that he did what he could as president; he pushed for the Kyoto treaty curbing greenhouse gases but never sent it to the Senate because it would not be ratified. ''Nobody was really focusing on climate change,'' he said. ''So a lot of times you have to wait for the time to get right.'' When it came to AIDS, he added, ''I felt that neither I nor anyone else in the world did enough. We tripled overseas AIDS funding when I was president, and we were contributing about 25 percent of the funding in the world, but it was a pitiful amount.''
 Ultimately, at the suggestion of his longtime aide and right-hand man, Doug Band, he formed the Clinton Global Initiative in 2005 to gather heads of state, Nobel laureates, billionaires and celebrities for a conference to make specific commitments to fix the world's problems, not just talk about them and forget them the next day. As Band put it, ''Only one person alive could really get all these people together in one room -- 60 or 70 heads of state, Bono, Gates and Buffett -- and say, 'You can't leave the room until you make a commitment and put your name on the line.' ''
 A few weeks after Obama's inauguration, Clinton joined Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to talk about climate change at the Center for American Progress, the liberal research organization founded by his former White House chief of staff John Podesta. Moderating was Timothy Wirth, the former Colorado senator who served as an under secretary of state in Clinton's administration. Wirth noted the recent momentum on climate change, then turned to his former president. 
 ''Why did this take so long?'' Wirth asked Clinton pointedly. Clinton looked a little peeved. ''We didn't have the votes before,'' he explained.
 Later in the program, Podesta returned to the subject. ''I want to come back to the question you posed to President Clinton, which is what's different than the last 35 years,'' said Podesta, who most recently served as Obama's transition chief. ''And I'd say after this beginning, it's that we have new leadership to move the issue forward.''
 If the implicit comparison bothered Clinton, he did not say so. But the moment raised questions: What does Obama's ascension mean for Clinton's legacy? Is it the validation of the Clinton presidency or the repudiation of it? Is Obama building on the base Clinton established or tearing it down? Will Obama be the president many Democrats wished Clinton had been? Or will he be doomed to relearn the lessons Clinton did about ambitious agendas giving way to more incremental change?
 In the past 140 years, only two other Democratic presidents, Harry Truman and Jimmy Carter, lived long enough to see another Democrat in the White House -- and Carter's relations with Clinton were difficult, to say the least. Clinton chooses to look at Obama as the next stage in a political movement he led. But it's not at all clear that Obama sees it that way. During the campaign, Obama dismissed Clinton as a historical placeholder. ''Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that, you know, Richard Nixon did not, and in a way that Bill Clinton did not,'' Obama said then.
 Of course, Obama was running against Clinton's wife. Since winning, Obama has found more to like about the Clinton administration, particularly its personnel. His chief of staff, national economics adviser, climate czar, White House counsel, Treasury secretary, attorney general, United Nations ambassador and homeland-security secretary -- not to mention his secretary of state -- all served with Clinton. As of April, 42 percent of Obama's appointees to Senate-confirmed positions were Clinton veterans.
 Some of those returnees to power seem to view the Obama administration as a do-over, a chance to get right what went wrong in the 1990s. When they talk about what it is like to work for Obama, Clinton does not fare well in the comparison. That may be a function of the natural tendency to talk up the current boss, but in their praise of Obama comes the obvious contrast. They marvel at Obama's discipline and roll their eyes as they remember Clinton's agonizing before making decisions. They admire Obama's cool as they recall Clinton's ''purple rages'' at his staff behind closed doors. ''Obama respects the process,'' said an aide to both men. ''Clinton always had to do the math himself.''
 Rahm Emanuel, who was a senior adviser to Clinton and now is chief of staff for Obama, recently described the current White House as a far more cohesive operation than his last one. ''We don't, rather, have the kind of New Democrats versus traditionalist split that existed in that White House,'' he said on CNBC. ''We don't have in this White House the president-versus-vice-president staff divisions that have been in other White Houses.'' Emanuel credited ''the tone and tenor that the president of the United States has set in expectations.'' The next day on ABC, he suggested Obama would rank among the best American leaders, comparing him with ''successful presidents and transformative presidents'' like Franklin D. Roosevelt, Kennedy and Reagan. Emanuel made no mention of Clinton.
 When I later asked him about that, Emanuel quickly heaped praise on Clinton. ''When you do a balanced budget, welfare reform, a crime bill, successfully prosecute the war in the Balkans, pass the chemical-weapons treaty, NATO expansion, there is no way Bill Clinton was not a successful president,'' he said. ''He governed in a Republican era. I said 'transformative president.' '' Transformative presidents like Roosevelt, Kennedy and Reagan followed presidents who were perceived to have failed and who governed in a time of crisis, he said. The factors ''that make up what would be a transformative president weren't there for Clinton.''
 While Emanuel points to history, some Democrats blame Clinton for being too tactical and hope that Obama will achieve what his predecessor failed to do in remaking health care and reining in climate change. ''So why didn't more happen?'' Wirth asked, repeating his own question when I tracked him down after the forum on climate change. ''That's the first question that has to be looked at. It was not very high on their political list, and I think they were somewhat afraid of the issue politically.'' Clinton was right that he did not have the votes, Wirth said. ''But they didn't try to get the votes,'' he said. ''When we were doing Kyoto, they weren't really helpful in driving the issue at all, the White House. We were sort of hung out there on our own at the State Department. So we lost all those years.''
 But if liberals see Obama as the bold Clinton, some moderates and conservatives worry that Obama is reversing his predecessor's direction. Clinton sought to remake a broken party in a more centrist mold. Beyond balancing the budget for the first time in three decades and overhauling the welfare system, he passed the North American Free Trade Agreement and launched military strikes against Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic. Now the ''era of big government'' he declared over appears back, as Obama tries to jump-start the economy by pushing deficit spending to the highest levels since World War II and inserting government more deeply into the private sector than it has been in generations. Where Clinton failed to pass a $16 billion economic-stimulus package in 1993, Obama pushed a $787 billion stimulus package in 2009 through a more deferential Congress.
 So if Obama transforms Washington, does that validate Clinton or marginalize him? ''I think it eclipses him,'' said a senior Clinton White House official. Podesta puts it differently, arguing that Obama may be able to accomplish more because Clinton paved the way for his administration. ''It's built on extending the strategy that Clinton brought to bear on government,'' Podesta told me. ''But it also has more opportunity for transformational change. If he's able to succeed at that, and I believe he can, people 40 or 50 or 60 years from now will look back and say the roots of that were planted during the Clinton administration. But Clinton lived at the back end of a conservative cycle, and Obama is living at the front end of what could be a profoundly progressive cycle.''
 The issue came up several times in my conversations with Clinton, and it was clear he was sorting through the shifting historical roles. ''I see this moment as the triumph of a battle we've been waging for 40 years, and basically they were symbolized by, in effect, Reagan and Thatcher on one side and me and Blair on another,'' he said. Now he detects a new era in which the Democratic base has grown and more things are possible, just as many of Theodore Roosevelt's progressive designs were not realized until his cousin became president. ''I see a lot of the ideas that I pushed -- that I got enormous push-back for -- now flowering,'' he said.
 One thing that thrived during Clinton's presidency, the economy, has wilted of late. The economic boom of the 1990s created nearly 23 million new jobs during his eight years, but today, the economy is shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs a month. While this has stoked nostalgia for the prosperity of the Clinton era, it has also focused new scrutiny on his record. What role did Clinton's policies play in creating the conditions that led to the Great Recession?
 When the subject came up during our conversation in Chappaqua, Clinton calmly dissected the case against him and acknowledged that in at least some particulars his critics have a point. In almost clinical form, as if back at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, he broke down the case against him into three allegations: first, that he used the Community Reinvestment Act to force small banks into making loans to low-income depositors who were too risky. Second, that he signed the deregulatory Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, repealing part of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in the investment business. And third, that he failed to regulate the complex financial instruments known as derivatives.
 The first complaint Clinton rejects as ''just a totally off-the-wall crazy argument'' made by the ''right wing,'' noting that community banks have not had major problems. The second he gives some credence to, although he blames Bush for, in his view, neutering the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''Letting banks take investment positions I don't think had much to do with this meltdown,'' he said. ''And the more diversified institutions in general were better able to handle what happened. And again, if I had known that the S.E.C. would have taken a rain check, would I have done it? Probably not. But I wouldn't have done anything. In other words, I would have tried to reverse everything if I had known we were going to have eight years where we would not have an S.E.C. for most of the time.''
 Clinton argued that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act set up a framework for overseeing the industry. ''So I don't think that's such a good criticism,'' he said. ''I think, actually, if you want to make a criticism on that, it would be an indirect one -- you could say that the signing of that legislation sped up what was happening anyway and maybe led some of these institutions to be bigger than they otherwise would have been and the very bigness of some of these groups caused some of this problem because the bigger something is and the newer it is, the harder it is to manage. And I do think there were some serious management problems which might not have occurred.''
 Then there are the derivatives. There, Clinton pleads guilty. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, opposed regulation of derivatives as they came to the fore in the 1990s, and Clinton agreed. ''They argued that nobody's going to buy these derivatives, we'll do it without transparency, they'll get the information they need,'' he recalled. ''And it turned out to be just wrong; it just wasn't true.'' He said others share blame, including credit-rating agencies that underestimated the risk. But he accepts responsibility as well. ''I very much wish now that I had demanded that we put derivatives under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that transparency rules had been observed and that we had done that. That I think is a legitimate criticism of what we didn't do.'' He added: ''If you ask me to write the indictment, I'd say: 'I wish Bill Clinton had said more about derivatives. The Republicans probably would have stopped him from doing it, but at least he should have sounded the alarm bell.' ''
 For all that, Clinton insisted he never would have let the housing bubble grow into the problem it became (never mind the high-technology bubble that burst on his watch) and would have stepped in if he were president to prevent the free fall. ''When anybody asks me that,'' he told me, ''I ask them, I look at them and ask them: 'Do you think this would have happened if we had been there? Look me in the face and say yes.' I haven't found any takers yet.''
 On the cedar-shingled Dutch colonial in Chappaqua hangs a sign that says, ''The Clintons, est. 1999.'' It is a white house, if not the White House, the oldest part dating to 1895. The first floor, airy and bright, displays the artifacts of a lifetime in politics. As Clinton gave me the tour, each item came with a story. Pictures of Boris Yeltsin, Nelson Mandela, Helmut Kohl, Yitzhak Rabin and Pele the soccer star. An illustration of the White House with drawings of all the presidents (''there's Fillmore,'' Clinton noted). A 4,000-year-old Chinese funeral urn and a 700-year-old Vietnamese spear. A massive, century-old German cabinet he bought, more than 30 years ago, for $150 (Hillary Clinton calls it ''the monster''). A sculpture made out of pieces of Ron Brown's plane embedded in rock from the Croatian mountain into which his plane crashed.
 Unlike most presidents, Clinton never had his own house to retreat to while in office, and he eagerly described how he flattened an outside slope, put in a new floor and opened up the glassed-in porch. ''I love this place,'' he told me. ''I've worked hard on it.''
 As he showed me around, it was striking just how much this was his house. The memorabilia was his. All the work done to the property was what ''I'' did rather than ''we.'' While Hillary Clinton returns from her travels to their house in Washington, he flies back to the little airport at White Plains just 15 minutes from Chappaqua. He watches ''Mad Men,'' ''24'' and ''Damages.'' The man who ushered in the Internet age still does not use a computer, much less a BlackBerry, but keeps up with blogs and sites like The Huffington Post through clips printed out by aides.
 The couple's hyperbusy, often-separate lives intersect when schedules permit. ''I try to go down there one night a week,'' Clinton said. ''She comes home Friday nights, stays Saturday night, goes back Sunday.'' When she makes it to Chappaqua, they do little socializing. ''Normally when she comes here,'' he said, ''she just wants to rest.'' And while they talk regularly by telephone, they sometimes lose track of the other. Hillary Clinton told my colleague Mark Landler that she did not know Bill Clinton was doing the Empire State Building event until it was in the news.
 They spend much of their lives on airplanes, hers provided by the Air Force, his usually by one of his wealthy friends. For the South America trip, Clinton traveled with Frank Giustra aboard his luxurious MD-87, complete with bedroom and shower, gold-plated bathroom fixtures, leather upholstered reclining seats, flat-panel TVs and original paintings on the cabin walls. The blankets are emblazoned ''Giustra Air.'' Traveling with him on this trip was Doug Band, 36, his aide of 14 years who spends more time with Clinton than any other person. Mort Engelberg, a Hollywood producer who made films like ''Smokey and the Bandit'' and has done volunteer advance work for Clinton for years, was there too.
 Clinton's life with the high-flying crowd and his postpresidential friendships with the rich, powerful and famous have drawn disapproval from some quarters, including former advisers who see it as unseemly. Some of his rich bachelor friends have not led celibate lives, and the associations have generated concern about his own activities, as detailed in a Vanity Fair article last year. His contacts also made Clinton a very rich man very quickly after leaving office. Saddled with $14 million in legal bills after his wars with Ken Starr, Clinton quickly amassed a fortune through speaking fees, book contracts and business deals. Periodically questions emerge about his financial dealings with the likes of Giustra or Ron Burkle, the supermarket tycoon. 
 Clinton has severed his financial ties with Burkle. But he continues to travel with Giustra, despite attention over a visit he and Giustra made a few years ago to Kazakhstan's authoritarian president, Nursultan Nazarbayev. An article on the front page of The Times focused on whether Clinton's presence helped Giustra get a lucrative uranium-mining deal, something that both adamantly deny. Just as problematic was Clinton's endorsement of Nazarbayev's bid to lead an international organization that monitors elections, despite Kazakhstan's history of manipulated votes. Giustra, who committed $100 million to a sustainable-development initiative with Clinton, deeply resents the insinuations about their friendship. ''Being called all these things by all these people who never met me -- let's just say this: I will never go into politics,'' he told me in a van as we rode to inspect a project in Colombia. ''That's a contact sport. He accepts the world he lives in.''
 Clinton slips effortlessly among his various worlds. After a talk at a United Nations forum about Asian tsunami relief, I found him backstage accompanied by the film director Martin Scorsese, with whom he had just had lunch. A few weeks earlier, Clinton participated in a panel discussion at his presidential library in Little Rock. The rarefied Clinton gave way to the down-home Clinton, describing how he felt when his friends left Washington (''I was lower than a snake's belly'') and how he attended an annual ''coon supper'' as governor (''Until you have eaten barbecued 'coon, you have not lived''). He laughed until he was red in the face as Dale Bumpers, the former senator from Arkansas, recounted traveling together in a small plane that crash-landed. ''He was telling some long yarn, and when we crashed, he just kept talking,'' Bumpers related with a little Ozark embroidery. ''The plane was upside down, and I said: 'Bill, open the door! This damn thing's going to catch on fire!' ''
 For a man slowed by health issues, Clinton still stays up late at night chewing cigars and playing Oh, Hell, a card game Steven Spielberg taught him in 2000, recruiting Giustra, Band and anyone else he can get to play. He obsessively works the Times crossword puzzle, enlisting others to figure out clues. After getting stuck one night on ''big catch of 2003'' (''Hussein''), he handed me the completed puzzle the next morning. 
 He remains a wonk of the first order, lamenting that the foundation located next to his library has ''a better water-capture and recycled-materials ratio than I do.'' During Obama's transition, Podesta said the only time Clinton called him was to make specific suggestions on ''greening'' buildings. ''Mr. President, I'm not really sweating the details on this,'' Podesta told him. And yet Clinton is self-critical enough that after a presentation to the Inter-American Development Bank conference in Medellin, he asked four times if he did all right.
 ''It's a restless engagement in the world,'' said Eric Nonacs, who was the foreign-policy adviser to Clinton's foundation and now does work for the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative. ''He's the same guy who has a huge circle of friends and keeps in touch with all of them. He's the same guy who wants to finish the crossword puzzle and will do it with everyone around him if he needs to.''
 If there is part of him that secretly covets Obama's job, he is burying it inside. ''I like my life now,'' he said. ''I loved being president and it's a good thing we had a constitutional limit or I'd have made the people take me out in a pine box, probably. But we had a constitutional limit and I knew that in the beginning. And so when I left, I had to go out and create another life. And I did it, and I love doing it.''
 He no longer seems to need the crowds quite the way he used to. He still lights up at the attention of people on the street and happily shakes every hand that comes his way, but he does not seek them out as much. It was striking one night in Lima to watch him steer through a restaurant. In the old days, he would have worked every table and lingered to hear every story. On this night, he shook the hand of a waiter but did not break stride as he made his way to the table. Being noticed has become part of the job, rather than a craving to satisfy.
 Still, as he boarded the plane in Medellin one night, he posed on the tarmac with the local security officers who had been guarding him, as he dutifully does at every stop. He seemed tired and not particularly interested, but he did not complain. Climbing the stairs to leave, though, he noticed some other officers. ''Were you in the picture?'' he asked. Then to an aide, he said, ''These guys weren't in the picture.'' He came back down the stairs and posed again.

HEADLINE: Toxic Mud, Heading To Texas, Stirs Town

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: EUNICE, N.M. 

 BODY:
There are not many towns in America that would welcome the 2.5 million cubic yards of toxic sludge being dredged from the bottom of the Hudson River in New York, but to hear Mayor Matt White tell it, Eunice is one of them.
 Storing waste nobody else wants means more jobs, Mr. White said, and the oil workers here are used to living with hazards. After all, there are several oil wells in the town itself. One of them is a block from City Hall.
 ''We have deadly gases in the oil fields,'' he said. ''It's more deadly than any of the stuff they are going to put in the ground out here.''
 From the edge of town, one can see huge berms at the landfill where General Electric plans to bury the dried sludge that is tainted with 1.3 million pounds of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls. They flowed into the upper Hudson from two G. E. factories for three decades before they were banned, in 1977. In high doses, the chemicals have been shown to cause cancer in animals and are considered a probable carcinogen in people. 
 The landfill lies five miles away in Texas, right across the state line, and belongs to Harold C. Simmons, a Dallas billionaire who was a large campaign contributor to former President George W. Bush and Gov. Rick Perry. (He also helped finance the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against Senator John Kerry in the 2004 presidential race and the advertisements linking President Obama to William Ayers in 2008.) 
 Not only has Mr. Simmons's company, Waste Control Specialists, landed a lucrative contract to take the Hudson River sludge to Texas, but this spring it won a permit from the state to store low-level radioactive waste as well. 
 Some environmentalists warn that the landfill is too near the giant Ogallala aquifer to store such hazardous materials, an assertion the company says is a lie. The federal Environmental Protection Agency's office in Dallas and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality have sided with the company in the debate over the aquifer. But some confusion remains, and three state environmental officials have resigned in protest over granting the company permits for the radioactive waste. 
 A little closer to Eunice, just inside New Mexico, an international consortium is building a uranium enrichment plant, with the blessing of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
 Not everyone in Eunice is overjoyed by these developments. 
 Rose Gardner, 50, a florist, has been fighting the landfill and the uranium enrichment plant for years, but she says it has been hard to get others to rally to the cause. Local business leaders and politicians on both sides of the state line fully support the projects, and some residents are afraid to speak out against the authorities, Ms. Gardner said. 
 ''I'm all for economic development, but why do we have to sacrifice our health and the environment?'' she said. 
 Nellie Franco, a school librarian, said she and her husband, George, were considering moving after having spent their entire lives here. She can see the landfill from her front yard, past a corral with horses in it. ''I don't want my grandchildren to grow up here,'' she said as she watered her front lawn. ''They say, 'It's safe, it's safe.' What if they have a spill?''
 Some residents complained that there had been no public hearings on the plan to haul the toxic sludge to the site. Eddie Joe Harper cursed when he was told the sludge would travel on railroad tracks running next to his property. ''I hadn't heard that,'' he said. ''They keep it all hush-hush.'' 
 But like many residents here, Mr. Harper, who works for a company that does environmental cleanups in oil fields, worries more about leaks from the uranium plant than from the landfill. ''It don't take but one leak and, boom, it would be over with,'' he said.
 Still, many people in Eunice say the landfill and the enrichment plant were bringing new jobs into a local economy that used to be buffeted by the rise and fall of oil prices. Some even said they considered it a patriotic duty to accept the Hudson River waste, to help clean up America. 
 ''We are not uncomfortable with it at all,'' said Lynn White, a barber who publishes the local newspaper, Eunice News. ''There is just not a whole lot to fear about the deal.''
 Even without the landfill and the uranium plant, Eunice is hardly a garden spot. 
 For miles around the town, pump jacks bob their mechanical heads like great birds pecking the earth. Power lines run like stitches over the high plains scrubland to power the pumps. The air is sour from the gases emitted by the wells and by three natural gas plants in town.
 ''We already have chemicals in the air here,'' said Rocio Araujo, 18, who works at a coffeehouse and said she did not mind the PCB plan because the waste disposal business had infused new money into the oil economy. Beatrice Fabela, a barista at the coffee shop, grimaced when asked about the sludge. ''I just hope it doesn't end up another Erin Brockovich story,'' she said. ''I didn't know about that being there. It's kind of scary to think about.''
 Tom W. Jones III, a vice president of Waste Control Specialists, said the Hudson River sludge would be wrapped in heavy plastic, like a burrito, loaded onto open railcars and shipped to the landfill in trains at least 80 cars long. By the third year of the five-year plan, which has been approved by the E.P.A., two to three trains a week will arrive.
 At the landfill, Mr. Jones said, excavators on platforms will rip open the bags and transfer the sludge to 110-ton mining trucks, starting in late June. The transfer will take place in a hangarlike building to shield the contaminated soil from the wind. The trucks will haul the sludge into a pit dug 75 feet into red clay and lined with two layers of heavy polyethylene. Then it will be covered over with at least three feet of clay. 
 Neil Carman, the director of the Lone Star Sierra Club, said the plan is fraught with dangers. A rail accident could spill contaminated soil along the route, and G. E. has so far refused to say what route the trains will take. Mr. Carman also said the winds whipping across the high plains of West Texas could spread the poisoned soil before it is buried. 
 ''We could be a major public health concern and an environmental disaster if this should be spilled out,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Gates Issues Warning to North Korea

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: SINGAPORE 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates warned North Korea on Saturday that the United States would not accept it as a nuclear weapons state, as Asian security officials struggled to find a new way to deal with the isolated Communist nation. 
 ''We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in Asia -- or on us,'' Mr. Gates told a major defense conference here that has been dominated by North Korea's test this week of a nuclear device and the firing of at least six short-range missiles, all in defiance of international sanctions.
 Mr. Gates said that he did not consider North Korea's nuclear program ''a direct military threat'' to the United States, but added that its progress ''is a harbinger of a dark future.'' One of the chief concerns among United States officials is that North Korea will sell its nuclear technology.
 Although Mr. Gates said that the administration was planning to discuss with its Asian allies how to move forward with the six-party talks aimed at persuading the North to give up its nuclear weapons program, he acknowledged during a question and answer session that ''it would be hard to point to them at this point as an example of success.'' 
 In Washington on Saturday, a senior American official confirmed South Korean news reports of indications that the North was preparing to ship an inter-continental ballistic missile toward a missile testing site on the Sea of Japan, a sign that Pyongyang might be planning another long-range missile test. It would likely take several weeks for the missile to reach the site and be put in place, and there is still no evidence that the North Koreans have the technology to create a nuclear device small enough to fit atop a missile.
 The North Koreans have conducted two such tests before, including one over Japanese territory, and American officials are particularly concerned about Japanese reaction to another test. Such missiles are theoretically capable of reaching Alaska and Hawaii.
 A C.I.A. assessment has concluded that North Korea has built one or two nuclear weapons and harvested the fuel for six or more weapons. 
 Throughout the day at the annual conference in Singapore, called the Shangri-La Dialogue, Mr. Gates met with defense officials from China, South Korea, Japan and other Asian nations to try to begin pulling together an international consensus on how to proceed. James B. Steinberg, the deputy Secretary of State, attended a number of the meetings, as did Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence. 
 There was talk of toughening economic sanctions on North Korea and a widespread view that long-running six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear program had failed. Beyond that, nothing specific emerged.
 ''There's no prescription yet on what to do,'' said a senior American defense official who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The official said that one ''prudent option'' was ''what should we be thinking about in the event that we need to start enhancing our posture, our defenses?'' But the official said that it was premature to talk of building up American forces in the region -- an echo of comments from Mr. Gates on Friday that the United States had no plans to reinforce some 28,000 American troops based in South Korea.
 Late in the day, Mr. Gates had a three-way meeting focused on North Korea with the defense ministers of South Korea and Japan, a precursor to more detailed discussions to occur next week in Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing about North Korea's nuclear test. Mr. Steinberg is to lead the American team at those meetings; the group will include Stuart Levey, the Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, an indication that tough economic measures against North Korea will be a significant part of the discussions.
 Military officials traveling with Mr. Gates said the tough talk was aimed in large part at increasing worldwide pressure on North Korea as well as reassuring allies in the region, particularly Japan and South Korea, that the United States was committed to their defense should North Korea make good on its talk of war this week. On Wednesday, North Korea threatened military strikes against the South.
 Mr. Gates met early on Saturday with the highest-ranking official sent to the conference by China, Lt. Gen. Ma Xiaotian, the deputy chief of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army. American Defense officials said after the meeting that China, the country that has the most influence over North Korea, clearly viewed the nuclear test seriously, a reflection of General Ma's public remarks at the conference. 
 ''We are resolutely opposed to nuclear proliferation,'' General Ma said, adding that ''we hope that all parties concerned will remain cool-headed and take measured measures to address the problem.''
 The United States has been pressing the Chinese government for a tough response, but it remains unclear if China is willing to engage in a heightened showdown with North Korea. In the past, China has feared the collapse of North Korea's government could lead to refugees pouring across its border.
 In Moscow, the Kremlin issued a statement saying President Dmitri A. Medvedev and Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan had agreed on the need for a serious response to the nuclear test, Reuters reported. 
 In Mr. Gates' formal remarks at the conference, his first as an emissary of President Obama, he made clear that the new administration had limited patience with North Korea's bellicose words and behavior.
 ''President Obama has offered an open hand to tyrannies that unclench their fists,'' Mr. Gates said. ''He is hopeful, but he is not naive. Likewise, the United States and our allies are open to dialogue, but we will not bend to pressure or provocation.''
 Military officials acknowledged that the United States had only limited information about what was really happening inside North Korea and suspected that its leader, Kim Jong-il, was in the midst of political maneuvers to make his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, his successor. The officials described the country's leadership as unpredictable and bizarre.
 Although North Korea was the ''hot topic'' at the conference, as Mr. Gates put it, the defense secretary also used the forum to appeal to Asian allies for help, both financial and military, with the war in Afghanistan.
 ''I know some in Asia have concluded that Afghanistan does not represent a strategic threat for their countries, owing in part to Afghanistan's geographic location,'' Mr. Gates said. ''But the threat from failed or failing states is international in scope.'' 
 The defense secretary said that extremists in Asia who have engaged in terrorism in Bali and guerrilla warfare in the Philippines ''are inspired by, and at times have received support directly from, groups operating along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border -- the ungoverned space from which this threat ultimately emanates.'' 
 Failure in Afghanistan, Mr. Gates said, ''would have international reverberations -- and, undoubtedly, many of them would be felt in this part of the world.''
 In representing Mr. Obama, Mr. Gates sought to draw a distinction between the new president and his predecessor. Mr. Gates noted that Mr. Obama had spent part of his childhood in Indonesia and that it was the first time ''that we have had a president with such a personal connection to the region.''
 Mr. Gates concluded that the United States, ''in our efforts to protect our own freedom, and that of others'' had ''from time to time made mistakes, including at times being arrogant in dealing with others.'' Mr. Gates did not name names, but then said, ''We always correct our course.''

HEADLINE: Realism May Not Play Well In Cairo's Streets

BYLINE: By JAMES TRAUB

 BODY:
This Thursday, when President Obama delivers a much-anticipated speech in Cairo, he will be addressing so many audiences, and seeking to advance so many agendas, that even his oratorical gifts are likely to be taxed. He will surely express his respect for Islam and the Islamic world, as he has before; articulate his broad policy goals in the Middle East; and offer proposals to increase the prospects, now quite dim, for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. But the president has chosen to deliver this speech in Cairo, and so he must also address the Egyptian people, who live -- like the citizens of virtually all Arab countries -- in an authoritarian state, and who have grown increasingly restive as President Hosni Mubarak has snuffed out flickering hopes for change.
 What will President Obama say to them? 
 This is a question with an anguished history. Egypt was the central target of President Bush's Freedom Agenda, his campaign to spread democracy worldwide. In July 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice traveled to Cairo, where she startled, and thrilled, many in her audience by bluntly declaring that ''for 60 years, my country, the United States, pursued stability at the expense of democracy in this region here in the Middle East, and we achieved neither.'' And, she continued, ''the day must come when the rule of law replaces emergency decrees.'' 
 Mr. Mubarak initially responded by allowing an unprecedented degree of political freedom. But when an opposition Islamist party did well at the polls, Egypt's security apparatus cracked down. The Bush administration, concerned about pushing a key ally too far, responded meekly. And that, arguably, marked the inglorious end of the Freedom Agenda.
 President Obama's words in Cairo are presumably being framed in the context of that episode. Should Mr. Bush have pushed harder for democratic reform in Egypt and with other allies? Should his administration have spoken more softly, less publicly? Should he, like his father, have devoted less attention to the way regimes treat their citizens, and more to winning cooperation on America's national security objectives? 
 On this set of issues, as on so many others, President Obama has declined to come down on one side of an either-or choice. During the campaign, he spoke eloquently about democracy at home and abroad, and in an interview before taking office asserted that the promotion of democracy ''needs to be at a central part of our foreign policy.'' But he recoiled before the kind of missionary rhetoric that President Bush so often deployed; instead, he praised ''realist'' statesmen like Brent Scowcroft, and cautionary cold-war thinkers like Reinhold Niebuhr.
 As president, Mr. Obama has managed to use the language both of the realists, who typically address the behavior of regimes, and of idealists, who, at least since Woodrow Wilson's time, have sought to speak directly to the aspirations of ordinary citizens. 
 Mr. Obama has tried to re-knit frayed ties by opening new lines of communication with Cuba and Iran, by soft-pedaling human-rights concerns in China, by remaining respectful toward Russia despite the occasional provocation. Just last week, he sought to harvest the fruits of his realpolitik by assembling a united front of states, very much including China and Russia, in the face of North Korea's nuclear test. 
 But at the same time, President Obama has stirred listeners abroad with the clarion language of hope. In an April speech in Prague, he invoked the Prague Spring of 1968, when ''the simple and principled pursuit of liberty and opportunity shamed those who relied on the power of tanks and arms to put down the will of a people.''
 This duality has as much to do with geopolitical reality as with Mr. Obama's own temperament. In a recent speech, David Miliband, Britain's scholarly foreign minister, observed that, in the face of ''threats from climate change, terrorism, pandemics and financial crisis,'' global security can be guaranteed only by ''the broadest possible coalition of states and political movements,'' including undemocratic ones. At the same time, he added, ''we need the consent of citizens.'' Both objectives were realist ones, in the sense that they further common national interests. But they were inevitably, Mr. Miliband acknowledged, in tension with one another. 
 That tension is much more acute for President Obama than it might be for another statesman. America has played a central role in the establishment and guidance of global bodies, from the League of Nations to the Bretton Woods institutions. But Mr. Obama's direct predecessor preferred ad hoc ''coalitions of the willing'' to standing institutions, and in any case did not agree with many of his allies on the substance of the threats. The nuclear nonproliferation regime is thus in tatters; climate change policy is in disarray. Mr. Obama, who believes that global institutions enhance rather than constrain American power, has a vast and urgent work of rebuilding before him. And he cannot, as Mr. Miliband observed, limit that effort to democratic allies. Without China, there can be no solution to climate change; without Russia, nonproliferation is a dead letter.
 It may be the imperative of building a global order for the 21st century that accounts for the strikingly realist cast to the Obama administration's conduct of foreign affairs. Both the president and his chief aides have steered clear of the language of democracy. In China in March, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said bluntly that America's concern about human rights ''can't interfere'' with progress on the global economy, climate change and other issues. Egypt, too, occupies an important place in Mr. Obama's strategic calculus, which aims to lay the groundwork for peace in the Middle East by shoring up ''moderate'' states while coaxing Iran and Syria into the fold.
 The White House has accommodated President Mubarak by eliminating American funding for civil society organizations that the state refuses to recognize, and by stating publicly that neither military nor civilian funding will be conditioned on reform. This has provoked alarm from liberals, from scholarly experts and from activists in the region. 
 Mr. Obama has a gift for eluding antinomies: he is ''both-and'' rather than ''either-or.'' But consensus-seeking has its limits. You can demonstrate deep respect for both the state and its people in a democracy like the Czech Republic -- but not in a place like Egypt, where the people feel crushed by the state. There you must make a choice. And if the state is a valued ally, it will be a very difficult choice. The dilemma is particularly acute for Mr. Obama, who is seen throughout the world as the incarnation of American democracy, and who well understands America's power to inspire both hope and resentment. Does he want to be seen as the architect of a policy that gives a dictator free rein in exchange for strategic cooperation? Would that even be a ''realist'' choice? 
 At a symposium several weeks ago sponsored by the Project on Middle East Democracy, Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said he thought the Obama administration was struggling with the issue of democracy promotion, and had not yet found an answer with which it was comfortable. ''My guess,'' he said, ''is that Obama wants to be forced to fight this out himself.''

HEADLINE: Gates Seeks Broader Options On North Korea if Talks Fail

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: SINGAPORE 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates raised the idea of a tougher approach toward North Korea's recent nuclear test in meetings here with Asian allies on Saturday, including the prospect of building up United States military forces in the region should six-nation diplomatic talks with North Korea fail, American defense officials said. 
 Mr. Gates raised ''the notion that we should think about this as we are pursuing the six-party talks,'' said a senior defense official who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. ''We ought to think about what more we need to do should they not prove successful.''
But another defense official cautioned that talk of any military buildup was premature and that it was merely a ''prudent option'' in terms of ''what should we be thinking about in the event that we need to start enhancing our posture, our defenses?'' On Friday Mr. Gates said that the United States had no plans to reinforce some 28,000 American troops based in South Korea.
 Mr. Gates, who warned North Korea in a speech here early Saturday that the United States would not tolerate it becoming a nuclear-armed nation, met throughout the day at the conference, called the Shangri-La Dialogue, with defense officials from China, South Korea, Japan and other Asian nations to begin pulling together a consensus on how to proceed. James B. Steinberg, the deputy secretary of State, attended a number of meetings, as did Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence. 
 There was widespread acknowledgement that sanctions against North Korea had to be strengthened because of its nuclear test on Monday and subsequent firings of short-range missiles. There was also general agreement that the long-running six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear program had so far failed.
 But by Sunday morning, Asian defense officials had not endorsed a specific course of action. ''There's no prescription yet on what to do,'' said one of the senior American defense officials.
 Late in the day on Saturday, Mr. Gates had a meeting focused on North Korea with the defense ministers of South Korea and Japan, a precursor to more detailed discussions to occur next week about North Korea's nuclear test. Mr. Steinberg is to lead the American team at those meetings; the group will include Stuart Levey, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, an indication that economic measures will be a significant part of the discussions.
 Mr. Gates met on Saturday with the highest-ranking Chinese official at the conference, Lt. Gen. Ma Xiaotian, the deputy chief of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army. American defense officials said after the meeting that China, which has been reluctant to take tough action against North Korea, clearly viewed the nuclear test seriously.

 Hey, last night at a fundraiser in Beverly Hills, people paid $30,000 to attend a dinner and a discussion with President Barack Obama. The subject of the discussion? The struggling economy.

 History was made today when President Obama nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor as the first female Hispanic justice to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court. Obama said this should help keep the court from leaning too far to the white.

HEADLINE: Obama's Face (That's Him?) Rules the Web

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Mimi Torchia Boothby's job as a technician puts her outside a wind tunnel every weekday at the Boeing plant south of Seattle, but in her free time two years ago she took up watercolors. Among her favorite subjects are cats, idyllic scenes of Italy -- and, of course, Barack Obama, whose contemplative, sun-splashed portrait she completed a few weeks after his election as president.
 She was so happy with it she started offering fine prints of it on the Web, her first proud professional act as an artist, and has since sold more than two dozen at $40 apiece. ''Talk about viral,'' Ms. Boothby, 57, said. ''Most of the people who bought them were people I didn't even know.''
 Perhaps not since John F. Kennedy, whose dusty portraits can still be seen in kitchens and barbershops and alongside the antique beer cans at bars like Manuel's Tavern in Atlanta, has a presidency so fanned the flames of painterly ardor among hobbyist and professional artists. 
 Mr. Obama's campaign was well known for inspiring art, including Shepard Fairey's ubiquitous ''Hope'' poster, a version of which is now in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. Months after the election, with the glow of the administration's first 100 days dimming, it might have been expected that enthusiasm for Obama art would be dimming, too. 
 Yet the still-ample offerings of original paintings of the president and the first family on eBay and at places like the annual Affordable Art Fair in New York -- along with a crop of presidential-art-obsessed Internet sites including obamaartreport.com, artofobama.com and, inevitably, badpaintingsofbarackobama.com -- are indications that it might just be a growth industry.
 The phenomenon has been a boon to the near-anonymous painting factories crowded together in the suburbs of Shenzhen, China, famous for cranking out copies of masterpieces, along with landscapes and semitasteful nudes. Another one, seemingly based in Germany, offers stately Obamas amid air-brushy likenesses of Tupac Shakur, Bruce Lee and Al Pacino (in his ''Scarface'' role), advertised as ''real hand-embellished'' paintings on canvas.
 Market interest has also helped small-time artists like Dan Lacey, of tiny Elko, Minn., a self-described disillusioned conservative who made a name for himself last year in the blogosphere with his inexplicably strange portraits of Senator John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin depicted with pancakes stacked on top of their heads. 
 Lately, he has turned to Mr. Obama, cranking out both eBay-ready conventional portraits -- ''I hate to say this, but I can do ones like that in about an hour,'' he said -- and even stranger works that have tended toward portrayals of the 44th president naked on a unicorn, often performing gallant deeds like wrestling a bear on Wall Street or taking the controls of the US Airways flight that landed in the Hudson River.
 ''There's a consistent demand for Obama, both for things that are funny and also for the serious, sort of Aaron Shikler kinds of treatments,'' said Mr. Lacey, referring to the artist who painted well-known portraits of the Kennedy family.
 Among Mr. Lacey's eBay customers are Carla Pasley, an administrator for a consumer products company in Kansas City, Mo., who said she is generally apolitical but bought an Obama portrait simply because she found it ''really pretty,'' and Gary Rogers Wares, a manager at a stationery and gift manufacturer in Culver City, Calif., who has a gold-hued Obama in his office behind his desk and just won another one at auction for $28.
 ''I wanted a painting because it's something unique, and as far as I'm concerned it's unique, just like our president is,'' Mr. Wares said. ''This is historic and you want something that feels like an heirloom.''
 The White House, asked if the president and first lady commonly received gifts of paintings of themselves, responded with characteristic reticence: ''On background, I can pass along that among other things, the Obamas are given works of art that include images of the President and symbols from the campaign,'' a spokesman wrote.
 If Mr. Obama has not yet fixed the country's economy or solved its security problems, he at least seems to have postponed the withering of original art's ''aura,'' or power, in a world of easy reproduction, as famously foreseen by the philosopher Walter Benjamin.
 Indeed, a 90-day search by eBay under the category of Obama paintings, most of them original creations, not posters or prints, found 787 works offered for sale from mid-February to mid-May, generating almost $20,000 at an average price of $118 a painting, said Karen Bard, a spokeswoman. Production generally seems to be running well ahead of demand. 
 High-dollar works by well-known artists seem not to fare as well -- an Obama painting by Peter Max listed with a buy-it-now price of $17,000 has had no takers so far. But paintings in a wild variety of styles -- Cubist, Pop, post-Impressionist, folk arty, street arty and what might be described as neo-Tolkienesque -- have sold in the two-figure and even three-figure range.
 Gabriel McGovern, a Web designer in Portland, Ore., who started artofobama.com during the presidential campaign last summer, said he had not intended to continue it past the election but had been receiving such a steady stream of submissions -- commercial works, personal works, works photographed on the streets, 300 or so images of paintings and other kinds of art that he has not yet had time to post -- that he decided to keep the site going.
 ''My favorites are the first-time painters,'' he said. ''It might not even really look like Obama -- in fact, not much at all -- but they not only paint it, they go out and find a forum on the Web where they can post it so everyone can see it.''
 Ms. Boothby said she is now managing to make a little money on the side with her brushes and easel and credits Mr. Obama. ''I think that portrait I did of the president was kind of a touchstone for my confidence, painting-wise,'' she wrote in an e-mail message. ''I'm not sure I would have been able to start doing commissions if I hadn't gotten as warm a reception as I did for that one painting.''
 Mr. Lacey, who admits to parting with paintings for as little as $1 on the Web, said he sold his president-wrestling-a-bear fantasia for $600 and recently received a commission for a unicorn-themed Obama. He intends to ride the surging presidential art wave as long as it will keep him afloat.
 During the previous administration, he said, he had also tried his hand at some portraits of George W. Bush but added, in a tone that mingled regret with professional candor, ''You really couldn't sell them.''
