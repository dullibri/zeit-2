HEADLINE: U.N. Rights Panel Declines to Censure China

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 8

 BODY:
Despite heavy lobbying by the United States, China narrowly escaped criticism of its human rights record today in a vote by the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
The commission voted 21 to 20 to reject a resolution expressing concern about human rights in China. Russia voted against the proposal. 
 The resolution would have obliged the commission to investigate human rights in China. That would have been considered an insult to China as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
The proposed resolution cited reports of torture and other violations, but it also praised the Government for improving the lives of its people through economic and legal reforms.
China's representative, Jin Yongjian, said the sponsors had "turned a blind eye to the achievements of China in the field of human rights."
Even though the measure was defeated, human rights groups regarded the vote as a victory because it was the first time the commission had formally considered the China rights issue at all.
"For the first time the commission is looking at the human rights records of the Security Council members," said John H. F. Shattuck, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights.
Last week the panel criticized Russia for using force to stop the southern republic of Chechnya from seceding. On Tuesday it considered and overwhelmingly rejected a Cuban resolution expressing concern about racial discrimination in the United States, Mr. Shattuck said.
The commission, in the final week of its annual six-week session, also took these actions today:
*Condemned the Sudan, 33 to 7, for summary executions, killings, detentions, slavery, abuses against women and children, forced displacement and systematic torture, and called for talks on the establishment of a permanent system of rights monitors.
*Condemned Iran, 28 to 8, for a high number of executions and cases of torture, for discrimination against women and non-Islamic religions and for excessive force in suppressing dissent.
*Rejected, 21 to 17, a resolution criticizing Nigeria for banning some newspapers and for torture, executions and restrictions on leaving the country.
*Denounced Iraq, 31 to 1, for "massive and extremely grave violations" including "broad-based discrimination and widespread terror," and expressed "special alarm" over Iraq's refusal to make use of United Nations provisions to meet the basic needs of the Iraqi people.
The commission also adopted without a vote resolutions expressing concern over human rights in Haiti, Zaire and Myanmar.
Other resolutions urged Haiti to set up an independent police force, called on Zaire to end torture, arbitrary arrest, summary executions and forced displacement of certain communities, and deplored Myanmar's military offensive against political opponents.

HEADLINE: Experiment With Success -- A special report.;
Guiding Hand to College for Ghetto Youth

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Reuben Mills, a brash, 22-year-old youth worker fresh out of college, sat behind his battered desk at Benjamin Franklin High School and nervously considered the typewritten list of 25 students.
They were just names to him then, in the fall of 1989, randomly picked from the incoming class of ninth graders. All were from the same ghetto where he had been reared by a single mother. Beyond that, he knew nothing about them except that their lives were in his inexperienced hands for the rest of their high school years. 
 Mr. Mills was about to embark on a four-year odyssey with these teen-agers as part of a small, innovative social experiment. He would serve as their father, big brother or friend, whatever was needed to keep them in high school, out of trouble and on the road to college.
This $1 million experiment, financed by the Ford Foundation in four American cities, has now produced some of the most remarkable results for poor youths since the test runs for Head Start and Job Corps, the most widely copied programs of the Great Society era.
Of the 100 teen-agers in the experiment, many more improved their basic skills, graduated from high school and went on to college than a randomly selected control group of their peers. And fewer had babies.
The experiment, known as the Quantum Opportunities Program, broke sharply with a generation of strategies that aimed programs at the particular problems of poor youths -- teen-age pregnancy, delinquency, failure at school and unemployment. Generally, such programs last no more than a year, the length of government's budget cycle, reaching young people only after they are in deep trouble, and often producing disappointing results.
The Quantum program, in contrast, which will resume in the fall, enrolled them at age 13, 14 or 15, usually before they dropped out of school, had babies or turned to crime and drugs. And it was able to stay with them for four years.
In a social policy landscape littered with the disappointing remains of other experiments, the Quantum program stands out for its common sense: What poor children from crumbled families and neighborhoods need most is an adult who cares about them and sticks with them for years.
But the program not only put people like Mr. Mills in place, it also gave them the tools they needed to guide teen-agers.
The young people on Mr. Mills's list, most of them fatherless and on welfare, were paid small stipends -- matched in a college fund for them -- for the hours they spent studying math and vocabulary on computers in the program office, being tutored, doing volunteer work, going to plays, ballets and museums, visiting college campuses and listening to guest speakers.
Over the years, Mr. Mills, compact and dapper in starched shirt, tasseled loafers and wire-rimmed glasses, became the center of their universe. Each day, they gathered around him in his small cement-block office, confiding in him about their love interests and family problems. He, in turn, gave them advice and affection, rubbing their heads, admiring their new hairdos, kidding them.
He hung out with them after school, on weekends and in summer. He gave them his home phone number. "I did get sick of them a little bit," he admitted, "but if I didn't see them for a day or two, I'd get nervous."
And he let them get away with nothing. Each day for four years, he checked up on them in their English classes to be sure they were in school. On pretty spring days he looked in on them in both the first and last periods. If they came late or skipped out early, he docked their stipend payments for the hours missed.
When students missed school, Mr. Mills combed their neighborhood haunts and ventured into their homes. "If he didn't see me for two days," Ray Holmes said, "Mr. Mills would go all over the neighborhood looking for me."
And after the last school bell rang, Mr. Mills was the Pied Piper, leading a trail of the students on the four-block walk to the offices of the Opportunities Industrialization Center, a 30-year-old community-based organization that ran the program. There, he and Phyllis Lawrence, the center's director of youth programs who hired him, looked over the students' shoulders, correcting grammar and helping them with math problems.
Because Mr. Mills was always with them, the students listened to him.
When Kenyatta Clark became pregnant at 15 and quit school in shame, Mr. Mills went to the dilapidated row house where she lived and talked her into coming back.
When Sherice Woolfalk was failing geometry and wanted to drop out in her senior year, Mr. Mills convinced her that she had come too far to give up.
When Ray Holmes dropped out after his older brother was murdered, Mr. Mills coaxed him back into the program, though not to school. Ray is now close to obtaining his license to be a barber.
"My brother used to wake me in the morning, smacking me in the face," Ray said. "We'd walk to school together. I started sleeping the whole day after he was killed. But Mr. Mills was always on my back, encouraging me."
Nineteen of Mr. Mills's 25 students graduated from high school and 18 went on to college or training schools, compared with only 12 graduates and 7 college-bound students in a control group of youths from the same school who did not participate.
Social policy researchers say the Quantum program has provided the first strong evidence that long-term approaches work.
But despite its promising results, the Quantum experiment has arrived at an inauspicious moment for new anti-poverty initiatives. At every level of government, financing for such efforts is being slashed.
Still, Robert Taggart, a research professor at Howard University and a principal architect of the Quantum program, said advocates for youth should push for an immediate and large-scale expansion of the model.
"It is the only thing that any of us have seen that works for this age group with statistical validity," said Mr. Taggart, who himself shaped a generation of employment programs while running a $4 billion Federal initiative in the Carter Administration to learn what works for poor youth.
While encouraged by the Quantum results, other researchers caution against exaggerated hopes. Will a small, intensively monitored experiment, staffed by extremely committed people, work if expanded on a large scale?
"Will the findings last?" asked Gordon Berlin, a social policy expert who was with the Ford Foundation when it financed the Quantum experiment. "We've gotten a lot of kids in college. Will they stay and will they get jobs when they get out?"
To help answer these and other questions, the Ford Foundation will continue following the Quantum participants who finished the program in 1993. After an evaluation, it is planning another round of Quantum experiments this fall.
Even with the caveats, the results of the Quantum program, commonly called Quop, have inspired a restrained excitement in the normally staid world of social policy research. The lead researcher on the project, Andrew B. Hahn, a Brandeis University professor, wrote in his evaluation, "The potential for Quop-like programs is enormous!"
 
The Odds
Knowing the Need, Tailoring the Help
 In the fall of 1989, the organizers of the Quantum experiment in Philadelphia were wondering what they had got themselves into. The 25 students on their list were not motivated, hand-picked volunteers, but poor teen-agers whose names had been selected by computer. Half had already been held back a year in school.
The success of the experiment depended on persuading them to join. But would they be enticed by $1 an hour to play checkers with old people in nursing homes, to log on to learning computers, to go to concerts of the Philadelphia Orchestra?
Mr. Mills took on the project in addition to his main job as a dropout prevention worker at Benjamin Franklin High School because he believed he could do some good. He, too, had attended Franklin, which serves the predominantly black and poor neighborhood of North Central Philadelphia in the shadow of City Hall. He, too, had grown up without a father. His family immigrated from Antigua and his mother struggled to support her children on the small income of a mail clerk.
But he had made it, graduating from Cheyney University in Cheyney, Pa., and he believed he could help others do it, too. "I was serving a community I was a product of," he said. "I felt like I had to see this program succeed."
The odds seemed long. So many young people drop out of Franklin that the number of students in a class shrinks to 250 in the 10th grade from about 500 in the 9th grade, school officials say. The students are drawn from narrow, pocked streets near the school that are lined with decaying row houses, many of them abandoned and boarded up.
"During the springtime, you throw bread crumbs on the ground and the birds snatch the crumbs and fly back to the trees," said Joe Hodges, one of the Quantum youths. "That's what this neighborhood is like. Everybody's trying to take from each other."
As it turned out, the 25 youths from this hard-luck neighborhood leaped at the chance to join the program. And Mr. Mills convinced them that he was not trying to use them, but to help them. His pay rose the more hours the Quantum students put in, but that amounted to only $5,000 to $6,000 over his annual salary, which started at $18,000.
"It was good to know someone was there looking out for you, not just for the money but because you were special to him," Joe said.
Indeed, Mr. Mills tried to understand Joe and tailored his approach to fit Joe's needs. When he joined the program, Joe said, he was making D's and F's. His parents held solid religious values, but Joe chafed at the rules.
"Joe yearns for freedom," Mr. Mills said. "He comes from a neighborhood where most kids can do what they want. But his mother believed in disciplining her children. She reared Joe right.
"He was always a challenge to me. I was very hard on him. He was the kind who disrespected everyone, who spoke back. No matter how much you told Joe to go left, Joe would definitely go right. If you told Joe the workshop today is at 2, he'd straggle in at 3."
What Joe had trouble accepting from his parents, he took from his idol Mr. Mills. "He'd help me with my homework," Joe said. "And he told me to check with him every day. He wanted to make sure I was in school. I had perfect attendance."
On report card days, Mr. Mills played the father who knows that his son can do better. "I remember one time I had a D," Joe said, "and he was like, 'You got to bring that up, man.' Then it was a C, and he said, 'You got to bring that up.' He was always pushing me to be my best."
By the time Joe graduated, he had solid grades and won the high school's $100 prize for most improved student. He is now attending Philadelphia Community College and still talks to Mr. Mills every day.
 
The Successes
Good Time Is Had By All? Not Quite
 Mr. Mills never gave up on anyone, even students who went completely off track. A 10th grader, Charles Corbitt, was sent away to prison for 7 to 17 years for fatally shooting a young man who Charles said had been threatening his baby daughter. He said it was Mr. Mills's encouragement that gave him the hope he needed to continue his education. He earned a general equivalency degree in prison.
"Even though the program has been over for some time, I still get a piece of mail from Mr. Mills at least three times a month to keep me on my toes," he wrote recently in a letter from prison.
Most students did graduate, though, often despite daunting obstacles. Dawn Clark, a shy, round-faced girl, said she had to mother her five younger brothers and sisters after her own mother became hooked on crack and smoked up half the family's welfare check each month.
In the 10th grade, Dawn left her mother's house and moved in with her grandmother around the corner. Every morning she still ran home to make sure her youngest brothers and sisters were out of bed and dressed.
She did clerical work at an accounting firm to make extra money to buy clothes and easy-to-prepare food for them: baked beans, hamburgers, Rice-a-Roni, 10-pound bags of hot dogs. On weekends, she cleaned the bathrooms.
Dawn said: "Sometimes in life, you say: 'This is hard. I can't do it.' " The first time she saw her mother using cocaine, she said, "I just went upstairs in my bed, lay down and cried all night."
Though Dawn rarely confided in Mr. Mills about her personal problems ("I'm one of those people that keep everything inside," she said), she said that he and a close friend or two in the program helped give her the strength to make it to school. The program office also gave her a place to do homework in peace.
"Mr. Mills was determined to see us succeed," said Dawn, who is now a sophomore at West Chester University in West Chester, Pa. "But he wasn't just a serious person. He made everything fun. He would joke with us. He's not an old, old person."
 
The Future
Word Gets Out, And Many Want In
 The other 75 students the Quantum program served were in Oklahoma City, San Antonio and Saginaw, Mich. In Philadelphia, the most successful of the sites, students each put in an average of 2,300 hours during the four years, on top of 3,600 hours in school itself.
The average four-year cost of the program was $10,600 for each student, two-thirds the annual cost of Job Corps, a residential training program that serves mainly high school dropouts.
The students were paid a stipend of $1.33 for each hour they spent on extra academic study, volunteer work or cultural and educational events, plus a $100 bonus for each 100 hours completed. Their earnings were matched in accounts that they could draw from only if they went to college or trade school. The Philadelphia students each accumulated about $4,000 in those accounts.
As word spread through Benjamin Franklin High School about the program, many students tried to get in.
"My little sister, she wanted something like that for her," said Kenyatta Clark, whose father was slain when she was a toddler and whose mother was so inspired by her daughter's graduation that she herself returned to Franklin at the age of 42 and will graduate this year.
"A lot of kids wanted to know how to get in," Kenyatta said. "I didn't know what to tell them because I was picked out of a hat. There's a lot of kids out here that want the chance to go to college, but their parents don't have that kind of money."

HEADLINE: Clinton Issues Order to Build Union Muscle

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
President Clinton sided with organized labor today and issued an order barring the Federal Government from doing business with companies that hire permanent replacement workers during strikes.
Last month Vice President Al Gore made clear that Mr. Clinton intended to take the step even if it would ignite a bitter political fight. Republican leaders in Congress had warned the President not to go forward with the plan, and today they immediately began seeking passage of legislation to block the action. 
 "Congress makes the laws, not the Administration," said Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican who heads the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. "The executive branch should not attempt to use the Federal procurement process to make major changes to our labor laws."
Employers are allowed to hire permanent replacements for striking workers. Last year, the Senate blocked White House-backed legislation that would have prohibited the practice.
Mr. Clinton's executive order represents an attempt to circumvent that obstacle, but while the White House invited Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., to witness today's signing, it sought to play down the act of defiance by barring reporters and cameras from the ceremony.
It nevertheless quickly became evident that the President's move had opened a new battle about the rights of companies during strikes. While Mr. Kirkland applauded the move as a "step towards justice in the workplace," the United States Chamber of Commerce denounced it as "a gross abuse of power" and vowed to challenge the order in both Congress and the courts.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, had joined with Senator Kassebaum in urging Mr. Clinton not to "attempt an end run" around Congress. This evening, he joined her again in endorsing an amendment she introduced on the Senate floor that would prevent the Administration from enforcing what he called "this misguided Presidential directive."
At the same time, House Republicans led by Representative Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, also vowed to overturn the President's order.
Clinton Administration officials acknowledged that their rivals might well succeed. But even if Mr. Clinton's move is undercut, the officials said, the order would serve its intended task of setting down a marker on a potent political issue.
The White House has argued that replacement workers undermine the collective bargaining process and reduce productivity, affecting the economy. It has also contended that the hiring of replacement workers inevitably leads to the production of lower-quality goods, and it defended Mr. Clinton's move as an appropriate way to safeguard Federal procurements.
The effect of Mr. Clinton's order may nevertheless be limited. It would not apply to companies that hire replacement workers with the intention of letting them go after a strike is over, a practice the White House has defended. It also would not apply to contracts of less than $100,000, which means that it would affect about 10 percent of Federal contracts, although these account for 90 percent of the money the Government spends on contracts.
The order was also not retroactive, which means that it would not affect existing Federal contracts with Bridgestone-Firestone, which hired 2,300 replacement workers during a strike earlier this year and has said the hirings would be permanent.
But Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, singled out Bridgestone-Firestone as an example of what the Administration hopes to avoid. "We don't want to involve the equivalent of minor leaguers and rookies making the tires for the next Desert Storm," Mr. McCurry said.
Administration officials said the order required the Labor Secretary to notify Federal agencies any time a company used replacement workers during a strike. The agencies would be directed to terminate contracts with such companies and to bar future contracts to them, although the agency heads could fight those orders in Federal proceedings.

HEADLINE: Teamsters Seize Local on Costs At Javits Center

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Asserting that the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan is riddled with corruption, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters seized control yesterday of the union local that dispenses many jobs at the center, saying it was a patronage mill for mobsters and convicted felons.
The international union's president, Ron Carey, acted on the recommendations of a government oversight body that found extensive corruption at the center, which has long been the focus of charges that mob influence made conventions there prohibitively expensive. 
 Exhibitors have complained since the center's opening in 1986 about shakedowns and excessive labor costs in dealing with the teamsters, carpenters and other unions at the glass-enclosed center, which is New York City's premier site for trade shows and fairs. In part because of the center's high labor bills, many trade-show organizers say they have moved their exhibitions to other cities -- a trend that tourism officials say has drained millions of dollars from New York's economy.
Announcing that he would have outside trustees oversee Teamsters Local 807, Mr. Carey, a self-described reformer who is the general president of the international union, said: "Corruption at the Javits Center and Local 807 is robbing this city. It robs good jobs from hard-working people and robs hundreds of thousands of dollars by driving convention business away."
The local represents tractor-trailer drivers, forklift operators, warehousemen and other helpers at the center, and the report said these jobs -- which sometimes paid double what was paid for similar jobs elsewhere -- went to well-connected union members, sometimes ex-convicts with ties to organized crime.
Officials have said that because of the inflated wages in the local and other unions, like the carpenters union, the simplest tasks at the center are far too costly.
Joseph D. McCann, general counsel and acting chief executive officer of the Javits Center, praised yesterday's takeover. "To the extent that a union can be taken away from corrupt individuals who have misused that union for their own purposes and returned to its own members, this is going to give a legitimacy not only to the union but to the Javits Center itself," he said.
Mr. McCann said the center provides $300 million to $400 million a year in direct tax revenues to the city and the state and contributes in other ways to economic development.
The allegations of corruption led Deputy Mayor John Dyson to urge the state on Tuesday to consider relinquishing control of the center to the city if it could not eliminate the mob influence there.
At a news conference at the Capitol in Albany, Gov. George E. Pataki said, "It's a situation that is from my standpoint intolerable and we're not going to allow it to continue." Asked if he might consider turning over the state-operated center to New York City, he said, "We're going to have some specific recommendations in the near future," but he would not elaborate.
The Independent Review Board, a court-appointed panel charged with rooting out corruption in the teamsters union, said earlier this week in a 64-page report on Local 807 that jobs went to relatives and friends of local officers and to individuals with ties to organized crime. "Furthermore, approximately one-third of the Local 807 members on the trade show seniority list have criminal records," the report said.
The local's president, Joseph Mangan, 89, was unavailable for comment yesterday. A woman who answered the telephone at the union's office but declined to identify herself said, "He's gone for the day." Acknowledging that she was aware of the report of corruption in the local and the imposition of a trusteeship, she said, "Right now we have no comment on that."
According to the report, Mr. Mangan was paid $101,461 in 1993 to run the local, which has 2,600 to 3,000 members and apparently has not had a contested election since 1972. But the report said that only a few -- fewer than 80 union members -- were on the local's hiring lists for work at the Javits Center and that many were given such preference because they were friends and relatives of mobsters. Of those on the hiring list, at least 11 have ties to organized crime and 15 have criminal records, the report said.
"The Javits Center has become a United Nations for the Mob," Mr. Carey said at a news conference outside the center on the West Side of mid-Manhattan. "The Gambinos, Genoveses, Bonannos, Colombos and Luccheses -- these are the people whose friends and associates are getting many of the good jobs at the Javits Center."
Yesterday's action comes three months after a former Federal judge, Kenneth Conboy, filed administrative charges to remove Anthony D. Fiorini, the carpenters union's top representative at the center, on the ground that he had aided the Genovese crime family in its activities there for more than three years. As in the case of Local 807, Mr. Conboy, a court-appointed monitor, suggested that Mr. Fiorini had helped Mafia members and their associates find jobs at the center while discriminating against carpenters union members.
Mr. Conboy welcomed the seizure of the teamsters local yesterday, saying, "I think it's an impressive and welcome effort on the part of the teamsters to eliminate the very, very broad and pernicious racketeering that has been a consistent problem at the Javits Center."
In the three years since he took office, Mr. Carey has imposed 41 trusteeships on locals, 19 of them in the New York metropolitan area. Trusteeships are imposed because of corruption, including the influence of organized crime, the misuse of dues money or health and pension funds and the abuse of members' contract and democratic rights.
In these locals, trustees work with members to strengthen the finances and operations of the local and to institute democratic procedures.
The Independent Review Board, which issued the report on Local 807, was created under a 1989 consent decree between the United States Government and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in a settlement of a lawsuit against former top officials of the union.

The Jew World Order

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
In a fiery speech delivered in Chicago on Feb. 26, Louis Farrakhan attacked "international bankers" for promoting this century's wars so that their "central banks" could collect interest off loans to the combatants. The bankers he singled out for ignominy were Jewish -- the Rothschilds in Europe, and, in America, their alleged agent Paul Warburg.
Does any of this sound familiar? It will to students of the anti-Semitic ravings of Depression-era demagogues. But, far more disturbing, some of Mr. Farrakhan's points might also hit home with the members of the Christian Coalition, who have scooped up more than a half-million copies of their leader Pat Robertson's tome "The New World Order" since its publication in 1991. 
 Like Mr. Farrakhan, Mr. Robertson overdramatizes Paul Warburg's role as the "true draftsman" and "catalyst" of the sinister U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve, in 1913. Such is Mr. Robertson's fascination with the Rothschilds that he calls The Economist, an independent magazine that once had a Rothschild as its chairman, "the Rothschild publication."
And then there's the overlap of logic.
Farrakhan: "In order to fight a war, governments had to borrow money. They borrowed money from these central banks. The central banks waxed rich because they loaned money and charged interest. . . ."
Robertson: "The money barons of Europe, who had established privately owned central banks like the Bank of England, found in war the excuse to make large loans. . . ."
When I wrote about "The New World Order" in this space a week ago, the response from Mr. Robertson, the most powerful kingmaker in the Republican Party right now, was swift. In a statement to The Times, he congratulated himself for his support of Israel, then expressed shock and regret that anyone could possibly think that his "description of international bankers" referred to Jews. He described his book as "carefully researched," with "seven single-spaced pages of bibliography from original historical sources." But while he repudiated his supposedly inadvertent use of anti-Semitic code words, he did not repudiate the book's content whatsoever.
"The New World Order" and Mr. Farrakhan's tirade have the same pedigree. Among its "original historical sources," Mr. Robertson's bibliography does not include either Paul Warburg's papers or books, but it does list Nesta Webster's "Secret Societies," a notorious anti-Semitic tract from the 1920's. Our two most prominent extremists of the 1990's are both dipping into the same well of pseudo-history that once served Father Coughlin and Henry Ford.
On the phone this week, Ron Chernow, the author of the definitive biography "The Warburgs," noted that the obsession with Warburg and the Rothschilds "runs through all anti-Semitic literature." To single out the depressed, morbidly shy Warburg as "the kingpin of a conspiracy," he added, is "absurd."
Then again, any New York Times writer might be part of the conspiracy too, since Adolph Ochs, a Jew who was The Times's formative publisher, makes a cameo appearance in "The New World Order" as well.
Is Pat Robertson anti-Semitic? He says not. But that doesn't alter the fact that his book disseminates old anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, however encoded. Were he leading a fringe movement, he could simply be dismissed as a footnote to what the historian Richard Hofstadter once labeled "the paranoid style" in American politics. But the Christian Coalition now has a major say in the Republican nominating process. At its "Road to Victory" convention last fall, Phil Gramm, Lamar Alexander and Elizabeth Dole, standing in for her husband, all kissed Mr. Robertson's ring.
Ralph Reed, Mr. Robertson's front man, assured The Times last weekend that Mr. Robertson's statement disavowing any anti-Semitic code words in "The New World Order" would be printed in a coming issue of "Christian American," the coalition's newspaper. In the February 1995 issue, meanwhile, you can read a column by Patrick Buchanan invoking "The New World Order" in which Robert Rubin, now Secretary of the Treasury, is accused of supporting the Mexican bailout to enrich his old investment-banking firm, Goldman, Sachs.

HEADLINE: The City's Ailing Hospitals

 BODY:
New York City's public hospitals are embattled as never before. Costs are rising, state and city aid is falling, and politics has made it difficult to cut waste. The quality of care in many hospitals is suffering. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is right to call for a fundamental reappraisal of the whole system.
The Mayor is already trying to sell off three hospitals and is wondering whether the city should junk them all. Given the city's enormous budget deficits, his drastic approach is worth exploring -- but only as part of a rational plan to improve health services for the poor or at least insure that they do not deteriorate further. 
 The Mayor's plan is driven by economics, but the threat of insolvency is hardly the only problem besetting the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the 11 municipal hospitals. As a series of articles in The New York Times pointed out in horrific detail this week, public hospitals seem to provide inferior care, particularly in childbirths.
The Times articles also reported that city hospitals may be getting second-rate supervision and staffing from the private hospitals and medical schools that have signed contracts to provide services for patients. That problem should be a warning sign to City Hall. In rushing to privatize, the city must not simply turn hospitals over to private institutions that have done a poor job under contract; it must insure that the institutions guarantee to provide an adequate level of care.
As a down payment in its privatization plan, City Hall has announced that three better-run hospitals in middle-class sections of Queens and southern Brooklyn will go on the block, perhaps to be sold by the end of the year. The strategy seems to be to get rid of those units that will find ready buyers. That could leave the city running the most deficit-ridden hospitals in the poorest neighborhoods, where it would continue to provide needed care with little hope of recovering the costs.
In selling its hospitals, the city should also get the right price and insure that the needs of all members of the community, including the poor and uninsured, continue to be met. A selling spree makes sense only if it fits in with an overall plan to rely more heavily on neighborhood centers and move patients into less expensive managed care, eventually reducing the number of hospital beds citywide. Such steps would control health costs in New York City for rich and poor patients alike.
City Hall may have already decided that closing down the whole system may be the only way to cut the Gordian knot of corruption, mismanagement, patronage and waste that has grown up over the years. But the commission appointed by the Mayor to study the issue should not overlook the fact that the public hospitals' problems are rooted equally in their tradition of caring for a portion of the population that nobody else wants as patients.
The city's private hospitals have long accepted Medicaid patients, but municipal hospitals and their emergency rooms remain an important resource for Medicaid patients and the uninsured who do not feel they can turn to private hospitals for one reason or another. It is the municipal hospital system that bears the brunt of care for the homeless, and for AIDS patients, especially children with AIDS -- not to mention people with drug problems, tuberculosis and mental illness.
This is a propitious time for sweeping reform. But before the existing system is junked entirely, City Hall should give the Health and Hospitals Corporation and its president, Dr. Bruce Siegel, enough time to see if its own reforms can also work to reduce costs. The corporation, for example, is moving to close 1,000 excess beds this year, reduce its staff substantially and speed up moving Medicaid patients into managed care.
The Giuliani administration should take the time to study the effects of what it wants to do. It would also help if Gov. George Pataki and the State Legislature eased the cuts in Medicaid payments proposed for the next fiscal year. The people who depend on the system are not the only ones who must insist that cuts, closings and selling of city hospitals be conducted carefully.

HEADLINE: The Arms Bazaar Expands Eastward

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration wants new markets for American-made arms, and is looking for them in all the wrong places. Instead of trying to limit arms trafficking around the globe, it is now ready to make sales to former Soviet bloc countries. That is the message of the Administration's disappointing new policy on arms sales.
The policy would permit the sale of sophisticated weapons like F-16 fighter jets and Abrams tanks in 10 markets formerly monopolized by Moscow: the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Baltic Republics, Albania, and even Bulgaria and Romania. With their economies in bad shape and no threat from neighboring Russia imminent, the last thing these struggling nations need is expensive new weapons. 
 Central Europe's armed forces are Soviet-recruited, Soviet-trained and Soviet-equipped. As the region's economies shriveled and defense budgets shrank, officers were rewarded with promotions instead of higher pay, leaving a command structure top-heavy with Soviet-era brass operating largely beyond civilian control. These forces need to be reduced, retrained and infused with new recruits before they are rearmed.
The American interests ostensibly served by arming the central Europeans include increased access and influence, having others pick up a share of defense costs and "interoperability," the Pentagon term for making foreign forces compatible with NATO forces. While the countries might benefit from communications gear that allows them to talk to NATO without Russian eavesdropping, they can do without new fighter planes. Central European troops can also train to use American arms in peacekeeping operations, as other countries do, without having to buy them.
The central Europeans cannot afford to maintain the weapons they have. Far from providing a potentially lucrative market for American manufacturers, the only way central European countries could acquire American arms is if the Pentagon transferred them free of charge, sold them at deep discount or had them paid for with American aid. Arms deals can also be negotiated on concessionary terms, backed by loan guarantees. To its credit, the Administration is not seeking additional loan guarantees, but it could be doing a lot more to discourage subsidized sales at taxpayer expense.
The United States should be limiting, not promoting, the sale of arms, particularly in countries that do not need and cannot afford them.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Where's the Fingerspitzengefuhl?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In our last episode, we discussed Bill Clinton's passive Weltanschauung, a "world view" that confines what was once America's diplomatic freedom of action to the slow convoy of multilateral consensus.
Today we seize another long German word: Clinton foreign policy lacks Fingerspitzengefuhl, that combination of sure-footedness on slippery slopes and sensitivity to nuance familiar to mountain goats, safecrackers and statesmen. 
 How do we deal with a Russian leader growing more woozily autocratic even as his nation becomes dominated by a mafia-military complex? The murder of the TV newsman Vladislav Listyev is leading to a suspension of civil liberties in the name of "right and order" -- which some suspect was the purpose of the murderers.
Must the U.S. President embrace Boris Yeltsin, as Mr. Bush clung to Mikhail Gorbachev, long after his popular mandate has vanished? Granted, Yeltsin was "democratically elected"; does this mean Mr. Clinton walls himself off from Russia's democratic opposition?
These questions gain urgency as Clinton must decide whether to visit Moscow, as promised, to celebrate the golden anniversary of victory over Hitler -- while Yeltsin's forces continue to obliterate Chechnya.
Last week the most popular political figure in Russia visited the U.S. to get acquainted with the foreign policy leadership here. He is Grigory Yavlinsky, 42, a market economist whose bloc has 8 percent of the seats in Parliament. He is building a national party to challenge Yeltsin in 1996, if elections are held.
You might think this is a man that the President of the United States would want to meet. But Clinton is leery of doing anything to upset Yeltsin. Defense Secretary William Perry, of all people, was assigned to meet Yavlinsky; Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott could spare only 15 minutes before handing him off to a functionary in the Executive Office Building.
A President with Fingerspitzengefuhl might have handled the opportunity this way: A National Security Council staff member would have brought him over to the White House basement to drop in on Tony Lake or his deputy. Then the President would stick his head in the door and say hello. They would talk as long as they liked in the hallway.
No photo op; neither a secret visit nor a scheduled appointment. No offense could possibly be taken by Boris Yeltsin. But the President, face to face with an outspoken Russian opponent of the war on Chechnya, could have asked: Would it help or hurt the cause of democratic reform if I went to Moscow on V-E Day?
Had he done so, Clinton would have heard firsthand from Yavlinsky what he may or may not have been advised through the fuzzying filter of advisers:
Do not go to Moscow if it means you will stand there merely as Yeltsin's friend, uttering platitudes together about Allied cooperation in World War II.
Go to Moscow if Yeltsin understands you will directly address the Russian people on television about (1) America's disapproval of the Chechnya destruction and (2) U.S. support of democratic reform and an honest count in coming Russian elections. It is not "taking sides" to speak out about what America stands for.
But Clinton is insulated from such unvarnished input; it might upset Boris.
Really? The Western leader closest to Yeltsin is Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. This morning Kohl is scheduled to receive Yavlinsky in Bonn, with photographers present. The unprecedented opening to the Russian opposition -- on Kohl's initiative -- should be avidly covered in Eastern Europe and Russia.
Simultaneously, Germany's Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, will be meeting Yeltsin in the Kremlin with other foreign ministers, and will return to Bonn to meet Yavlinsky tomorrow.
Contrast the Kohl and Clinton approaches to the Yeltsin problem: The German shows friendly flexibility as the American is frozen in fear of offending. Bill Clinton shows all thumbs while Helmut Kohl exhibits Fingerspitzengefuhl.

HEADLINE: Flat-Broke Washington Hears Giuliani's Advice

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
In his hometown, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is wrestling with a budget gap that is still growing despite deep cuts.
But in flat-broke Washington, lawmakers have turned to Mr. Giuliani for budgetary advice, which he doled out yesterday at a meeting of the House subcommittee on the District of Columbia. 
 The subcommittee, of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee, is drafting legislation to create a financial control board over the District, whose officials have failedto trim spending and jobs in response to a Congressional mandate.
The District is facing a deficit of $722 million, just a fraction of New York's projected budget shortfall of $2.7 billion for the 1996 fiscal year. But subcommittee members heaped extravagant praise on the Mayor's way with a budget ax. For the current fiscal year, Mr. Giuliani has cut $2 billion in spending.
Representative Susan Molinari, a Republican of Staten Island, made the introductions. "Rudy is the best thing to happen to New York City since La Guardia cleaned up Tammany Hall," she said. "The truth is, Mr. Chairman, if you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere."
Mr. Giuliani said he had come to Capitol Hill in part to discuss "the steps my administration has taken to re-order New York City's economy, government spending, promote private sector growth and improve the quality of life."
Committee members took turns asking his counsel on how to duplicate the New York model.
Mr. Giuliani discussed successful union negotiations: "Municipal labor leaders have to be convinced that someone isn't playing a game with them."
He warned that if Washington brings in a financial control board, as New York did in the 1970's, its tenure should "have a very strict beginning and end."
And Mr. Giuliani said it was important to privatize and consolidate where possible, noting that before recent layoffs "the New York Police Department press office was larger than the President's or the State Department's and twice the size of the Mayor's."
After those layoffs, the top police spokesman, John Miller, quit in tears and accused the Mayor of improperly trying to control public information and of being jealous of Police Commissioner William J. Bratton's good press.
"I think it's great what you're doing up there," Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d, a Virginia Republican and chairman of the subcommittee, told the Mayor. "I could talk to you all day. I feel that's really inspiring, your testimony that there is hope."
The Mayor's remarks were followed by testimony from other officials who have faced a fiscal crisis, including former Gov. Hugh L. Carey, former New York State Comptroller Edward V. Regan and Gov. George V. Voinovich of Ohio.
At the hearing, only Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's nonvoting delegate in Congress, suggested that New York's budget problems had not been resolved.
"You are given credit for tackling the financial problems you faced when you came in office," she said, referring to the $2.3 billion gap left behind by Mayor David N. Dinkins. "But what interests me is that New York went though this extraordinary crisis where you laid off 'x' number of people in nothing flat," and yet the budget gap continued to expand.
Mr. Giuliani replied: "Sometimes I compare it to someone who has gone through the painful process of losing an enormous amount of weight and then gains it all back." He said his advice was in the spirit of someone who was himself still struggling to overcome huge obstacles.
"We think we're moving in the right direction, and we're certainly happy to tell you what doesn't work," he said laughing.

HEADLINE: 13 Stadium Renovation Plans Later, Yankees Are Still Dissatisfied

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Several weeks after city officials presented their latest plan to renovate Yankee Stadium, a top team official has suggested that it may be impossible to rebuild the historic stadium in a way that would satisfy the team's principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d.
The city's current plan, a $600 million proposal, would provide new highway ramps and garages to make it easier for drivers to reach and park at the stadium and would include entertainment attractions, retail shops and restaurants. 
 But in a recent interview, David Sussman, the Yankees' executive vice president and general counsel, questioned whether it would be enough. "Can any structure or renovation ever satisfy the demands of the mid-90's," he asked, "consistent with other state-of-the-art facilities around the country?"
Mr. Sussman's comments may be a sign from Mr. Steinbrenner that if he stays in New York City, it would most likely be in a modern new ballpark on the West Side of Manhattan. Otherwise, he could cross the Hudson River for a site in New Jersey. Mr. Steinbrenner has not commented publicly on the latest plan.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's policy, for now, is to keep the Yankees in the South Bronx. For nearly two years, the city and the team have tried to forge a plan to renovate Yankee Stadium and its environs to satisfy the team's desires for greater revenue, additional parking and better access from the highways.
Last month, an architect unveiled the city's 13th refinement of its design, calling for new ramps from the Major Deegan Expressway, a third bridge across the Harlem River and new garages that would combine with existing garages to flank the stadium with parking on three sides.
The new garages would force playing fields and a track to move from Macombs Dam Park north to sites along River Avenue and west to a waterfront parking area.
Vollmer Associates, a consultant hired by Mr. Steinbrenner, is evaluating the traffic-management aspects of the plan and is expected to report soon. Asked whether the city would further redesign its plan to satisfy the Yankees, Mr. Sussman said: "You're assuming there will be a further plan. The city may say they've done all they can."
Forrest Taylor, a mayoral spokesman, said redesigns would be commissioned from the architect, Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, "as long as the Mayor finds it fruitful and they're moving in a positive direction."
South Bronx community leaders assailed the existing plan for turning the stadium into a garage-enclosed enclave, and shifting the playing fields from Macombs Dam Park.
Although the plan looked tailor-made to Mr. Steinbrenner's desires to ease access into Yankee Stadium and move fans quickly from parking garages, Mr. Sussman said the team had not dictated the process.
"The Yankees didn't hire H.O.K., and I don't think the Yankees will ever be in a position to tell the Mayor what we want in Yankee Stadium," he said. "The approach has been for the city to put forth proposals and for the Yankees to respond. To be sure, H.O.K. interviewed us, but we're passive, sitting back."
But John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said: "The Yankees have been involved all along."
Mr. Dyson said that despite community objections to the current city proposal, the driving force now is to satisfy the Yankees enough to stay.
"We anticipated the community reaction," Mr. Dyson said. "We took their reaction into account to create the previous plan, which George didn't like."
He added: "We need an agreement from a business we're trying to retain, much like Disney on 42d Street. We need that agreement."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Make Big Gains On Rebound of Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Bonds staged their biggest rally in more than a month yesterday, as a stronger dollar raised hopes that Treasury securities would be more attractive to foreign investors.
"Bonds are bouncing back because of the better currency," said Barbara Kenworthy, who manages more than $2 billion of bonds at Prudential Investment Advisers in Newark. A stronger dollar suggests that "perhaps foreigners would want to take a flier in the U.S. bond market." 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 28/32 , to 10031/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.54 percent, from 7.62 percent on Tuesday. It was the biggest gain by the long bond since Feb. 3.
The price of the two-year note also rose, with its yield falling to 6.87 percent from 6.98 percent.
"The bounce in the bond market today is kind of a return to rationality on the part of U.S. investors," said Scott Grannis, chief economist at Western Asset Management, a firm in Pasadena, Calif., with $12 billion in bonds.
In the corporate bond market, Cone Mills Inc. and Browning-Ferris Industries took advantage of the drop in bond yields to sell $400 million in bonds. Maryland sold $175 million of municipal bonds.
Bonds rose as the dollar rebounded from post-World-War-II lows against the Japanese yen and the German mark.
Treasuries "will always follow the dollar, unless there's something else more pressing," said Marcello Frustaci, a trader at Daiwa Securities America.
In testimony before the House Budget Committee yesterday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said the plunge of the dollar "adds potential inflation pressures to our economy." A weaker dollar can heighten inflation by making imported goods more costly.
Still, the economy "may be slowing," Mr. Greenspan said, citing reports that housing and retail sales had slowed.
Municipal and mortgage bonds tracked Treasuries higher.
The mounting concern that tax-free municipal bonds will prove scarce this year has investors sometimes paying surprisingly high prices.
"It's still the fundamental supply situation," said William Fusting, vice president of trading at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. Issuance is down 60 percent this year. The Maryland sale of general obligation bonds headed $750 million of sales of municipal bonds today.
The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer's index of 40 actively traded municipals fell to 6.45 percent, from 6.47 percent on Tuesday.
The yield spreads between corporate and Treasury securities, which widen as investors demand compensation for the increased risk of holding corporate securities, widened as much as nine basis points.
For corporate treasurers, it is "a difficult time to pick an opportunity to come to market," said Russ Rowley, who helps manage $20 billion in bonds at the Principal Financial Group in Des Moines. "You could jump in and make your move now. If you wait, things could move against you."
For investors in mortgage bonds, the drop in rates during the last four months has increased the likelihood that more consumers will repay the loans quickly by refinancing or moving to new homes.
Those prepayments reward investors who bought bonds at a discount and punish those who paid a premium, because homeowners prepay the loans at face value. Discount mortgage securities have rebounded, as investors have concluded that prepayments are poised to increase.
Ned Gerstman, who oversees $4 billion at the Chubb Corporation, said that "it's the change in sentiment that has improved the valuation of" some of the mortgage securities priced at a discount. "People stopped penalizing them by pricing the bonds at absurdly low prepayment assumptions," he said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Higher on Dollar's Recovery, With Dow Up 16.60

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stock prices ended sharply higher yesterday as the market tracked the dollar's brisk recovery from its recent slump to record lows.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.60 points, to 3,979.23, rebounding from Tuesday's loss of nearly 35 points. 
 In the broader market, advancing issues narrowly led decliners, 1,125 to 1,052, on New York Stock Exchange active trading of 349.8 million shares. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.02 points, to 483.14, while the Nasdaq composite index ended up 4.48 points, to 795.81.
Analysts said the stock market was encouraged by the comments of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, before the House Budget Committee.
The Fed chief came out forcefully against the weakness of the dollar, calling it unwelcome, troublesome and very likely overdone.
"It seems like he was saying things investors wanted to hear," said Bill Allyn, director of listed equity trading at Jefferies & Company.
But the dollar received its biggest lift from comments by foreign monetary officials that were viewed as supportive of the currency. The dollar had been cascading to record lows daily since late last week on concern about the lack of forceful action by the United States to stem its fall.
In late New York trading, the dollar rebounded, rising 1.37 Japanese yen, to 91.42 yen, after tumbling on Tuesday through the psychologically important 90-yen level. The dollar also rose to 1.3950 German marks, from 1.3675 on Tuesday.
Comments from Germany's Bundesbank that cuts in German interest rates were possible started the dollar's rebound, which was extended by Mr. Greenspan's remarks, analysts said. Speculation of an increase in German lending rates had been cited as a key factor in the dollar's recent freefall.
"A big rally off the low point to me indicates the dollar's trying to stabilize," Jonathan Dodd, an analyst at Dean Witter, said.
Analysts said the stock market was tracking the dollar and not showing concern that a defense of the currency might mean the Fed would raise interest rates. The central bank has tightened credit seven times in the last year to slow the economy's growth and dampen inflation.
Among individual stocks, shares of the Lin Broadcasting Corporation fell 7 1/4, to 121. A third appraisal in the AT&T Corporation's planned acquisition of the 48 percent of Lin shares it does not already own valued the company at $127.50 a share. Two previous appraisers had determined the company was worth $105 and $155 a share, respectively. AT&T shares rose 1/8, to 51 1/8.
Gold stocks gave back some recent gains that had been generated by concern about the declining dollar. Shares of the Newmont Gold Company fell 1 1/2, to 37 1/4; those of ASA Ltd. dropped 2 3/8, to 45 1/2, and the Barrick Gold Corporation slipped 7/8 a share, to 22 3/8.
Toys "R" Us Inc. lost 1 3/4 a share, to 25, after the toy retailer warned of slower earnings growth this year. Similarly, Checkpoint Systems Inc., a maker of electronic surveillance systems, tumbled 5 1/2, to 17 1/2, after the company said it expected to break even or post a loss from operations for its first quarter.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.35 point, to 261.60. The average share on the Big Board was up 5 cents. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.21 point, to 449.95.

Ford Revises View of U.S. Auto Sales

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: LIVONIA, Mich., March 8

 BODY:
The chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Alexander J. Trotman, said today that vehicle sales in the United States this year might fall short of the company's projection of 15.8 million units.
Car and truck sales will "still be in the high 15's," Mr. Trotman said. Auto makers are beginning to retreat from the bullish forecasts they made last year, while increasing the discounts on some models to spur sales. 
 "Our incoming orders have been a little softer in the last few months," Mr. Trotman said. "It could be the industry is not going to be as strong as we thought six months ago."
Mr. Trotman was in Livonia, west of Detroit, to help distribute record profit-sharing checks -- averaging about $4,000 -- to the workers at Ford's transmission plant here.
Another increase in interest rates would do "significant" harm to domestic car and truck sales by damaging consumers' confidence, Mr. Trotman said.
The remarks by Mr. Trotman came about a month after the Chrysler Corporation reduced its forecast for sales in 1995, after an increase in the Federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve on Feb. 1. The Fed has raised interest rates seven times in the last 12 months.
Chrysler is still the most bullish of Detroit's Big Three auto makers. The chief economist of Chrysler, Van Bussmann, said vehicle sales, including those of medium- and heavy-duty trucks, would total 16 million units this year; his original forecast was 16.2 million.
The industry's leader, the General Motors Corporation, is sticking with its forecast of 15.6 million, compared with 15.4 million in 1994. But G. Richard Wagoner, head of North American vehicle operations for G.M., held out the possibility that sales might not exceed the levels in 1994.
The most notable example of the rising discounts on new models this year has been the skirmish between Ford and Chrysler in the mini-van market. Chrysler recently doubled its rebates on mini-vans, to $2,000, to reduce inventories before a new version of the vehicle comes out this spring. Ford offered rebates of up to $1,750 on its new Windstar mini-vans.
Mr. Trotman said it was too early to determine the effects of the weaker dollar on Ford's global operations.
"We have business in over 30 countries, so it's a very complicated question," he said. "But the weakness in the dollar vis-a-vis the Japanese yen should help us to export vehicles from the United States to Japan," and make Ford more competitive in Europe.
"We will obviously do a review of all of our prices in the export markets when the dollar settles down a little," he added.
Asked if the weak dollar would force Japanese auto makers to raise prices in the United States again, Mr. Trotman said, "The movements of the currencies haven't been a guide to the movement of the prices over the last few years, and we have no reason to believe they will be in the future, either."
From 1992 to 1994, the average sticker price of a Japanese car rose 16.6 percent, while the average sticker of a domestic car rose 8.7 percent, said George Magliano, an auto analyst with the WEFA Group in New York.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Fall: Crisis With No Bite

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
What's so terrible about a falling dollar?
It has been declining in value for nearly a decade against the two strongest currencies, the German mark and the Japanese yen -- doing so gradually most of the time, but with occasional plunges like the current one. And the damage to the economy has been negligible. 
 "The dollar fell by one-third between 1985 and 1987 and the result was a very prosperous period for the American economy, with only a modest increase in inflation," said Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist.
Imports -- Japanese cars, Italian clothing, Far Eastern electronics devices -- get lots of publicity, and they can become more expensive as the dollar weakens. But nearly 90 percent of what Americans purchase is made at home, and a dollar buys just as many of those goods and services as it did a month ago, before the plunge. Even the imports, which should cost more in dollars as the currency falters, have not been going up in price. That's mainly because many imports come from countries whose currencies are even weaker than the dollar. But it is also because many Japanese and German exporters are wary of raising prices in the hotly competitive American market.
Still, the fall in the dollar is unnerving. Many foreigners hold dollars acquired over the years and there is always the remote chance that they will try to dump them en masse, exchanging them for marks or yen and setting off a full-blown currency crisis. "In the frame of 1995, that possibility won't make much difference to the economy," said Peter L. Bernstein, a New York economic consultant. "But in the longer run, the feeling that the dollar can be raided like the Mexican peso is not very comforting, or ultimately good for the economy."
The immediate risk to the nation today is that the standard remedy for a weak dollar -- higher interest rates -- could do real damage to the economy. Although the nation is enjoying a combination of healthy economic growth and low inflation, signs of a slowdown are beginning to emerge. Raising interest rates may exacerbate an incipient slowdown by discouraging purchases on credit.
"If the Federal Reserve panics and raises rates to rescue the dollar, that would raise the odds of a recession," said John R. Williams, chief economist at the Bankers Trust Company. "That would be very inappropriate."
So why has the dollar fallen so sharply? Analysts cite a host of factors. Some blame the Mexican crisis. Others fault Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, for seeming to suggest last month that the Fed might lower rates soon to stimulate a weakening economy. Others argue that many Japanese holders of Treasury securities are selling them and converting their dollars to yen, for use back home.
But behind all this are foreign- exchange traders, constantly in search of the greatest short-term return on their holdings. They command enough capital to make any currency fluctuate sharply, and in the last two weeks many have settled on a better bet than the dollar.
Their latest bet is that the German central bank, the Bundesbank, will raise interest rates to stave off inflation in the prospering German economy while the Federal Reserve remains reluctant to increase rates simply to prop up the dollar. That, in turn, will make German securities increasingly more attractive than American securities.
"It looks like we are setting up an environment where German rates could move higher and American rates could hold steady or actually decline," said William Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean Witter. "That favors holding marks."
But the American economy is buffered from this process. More than most other nations, the United States has been immune to the decline of its own currency.
That's because when it comes to haircuts or cars or soaps or fees for real estate brokers or computer software or lawyers, eight out of nine purchases are for American-made goods and services. Other purchases are for products imported from countries like Mexico, Canada and China, where the dollar has gained ground against the local currencies or held its own.
The nation's persistent trade deficits have put a lot of dollars in foreign hands, of course, and that can worsen the dollar crisis. Since the nation does not export enough goods or services to pay for its imports, foreigners have to accept dollars in exchange for what they sell to Americans. These dollars are then invested in American securities, particularly Treasury notes and bonds. The great fear has been that as the dollar weakens investors around the world will sell their holdings and exchange the dollars they receive for marks and yen, thus further weakening the dollar.
But the deficit from America's overseas transactions represents less than 3 percent of the nation's $6 trillion plus in annual economic activity. And foreigners hold only 7 percent of the total value of Government debt. An additional 10 percent is held by foreign central banks, which are reluctant to sell dollars because their chief goal is to keep their own currencies from becoming too strong against the dollar and thus prevent exports from becoming too expensive for Americans.
"I am not sure the dollar is ridiculously low," said Paul Krugman, a Stanford University economist, "but I do think the yen and the mark are getting ridiculously high."
True, the experience of a spectacularly falling dollar could prompt nervous investors to dump stocks and bonds. There were signs of this in the sharp fall in the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday. But the Dow recovered some yesterday and so far both markets are behaving as if the plunge in the dollar is a temporary phenomenon.
The dollar, in fact, even rose a bit against the mark and the yen after Mr. Greenspan's Congressional testimony yesterday, in which he spoke bullishly about defending the dollar. The next test could come tomorrow, when the Labor Department announces the jobs data for February. A strong employment report could strengthen the dollar, by suggesting that the economy is not so weak after all. That would hold out to foreign-exchange traders the hope of another increase in interest rates to once again try to slow a potentially inflationary economy.
But a lot of currency trading is disconnected from real economic conditions and instead reflects a bet on what other traders will do. "The more the dollar fell, the more reasons were found to keep selling dollars and keep the fall going," said Edward Hyman, president of the ISI Group, a money management and trading firm.
That can turn quickly around as foreign-exchange traders, manipulating billions of dollars, decide that the dollar has fallen enough. Betting on a rebound tempts them.
"There has been panic selling of dollars but at some point there will be panic buying," Mr. Williams of Bankers Trust said. "Foreign-exchange traders don't try to analyze economies or call the shots. They just ride the momentum."

HEADLINE: Productivity Rose 2.2% in '94

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
American businesses made more progress last year in improving their productivity than in 1993, with raises and other labor cost increases remaining modest, the Labor Department said today.
The productivity of nonfarm businesses grew a healthy 2.2 percent last year after a modest 1.5 percent gain in 1993, the department said. 
 But in the fourth quarter of 1994, productivity rose only at a 1.7 percent annual rate, down from the 1.8 percent gain the department had previously estimated.
Productivity gauges the efficiency of businesses by measuring the amount of goods and services produced per hour of all people.
In the fourth quarter, output rose at a pace of 5.3 percent, while the number of hours worked rose 3.5 percent. For the full year, output similarly rose 5.2 percent, but hours grew by only 2.9 percent. As a result, the productivity gain for all of 1994 was greater than for the fourth quarter.
Inflation-adjusted hourly compensation rose by a modest five-tenths of 1 percent last year, compared with two-tenths of a percent in 1993. For the fourth quarter it grew at a rate of 1.7 percent. But the labor costs needed to produce a unit of goods or services rose only nine-tenths of 1 percent in 1994, the smallest gain in three decades and only about half the 1.7 percent rise in 1993 unit labor costs, the department said.
Manufacturing industries led overall productivity gains last year with a seven-year high 4.9 percent increase after a 3.2 percent rise in 1993. For the fourth quarter of 1994, manufacturing productivity grew at a 3.1 percent rate.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Managing the airwaves for productivity and profits.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE policy honchos who fought long and hard to auction the airwaves rather than give them away are preening these days, and for good reason. Bids for licenses to transmit voice, data and video over the air are now more than $5 billion -- money most welcome in an era when ketchup again seems destined to be reclassified as a vegetable.
But the vast sums being bet on this modest chunk of real estate in the sky suggest a darker side to this story as well. For one thing, it is evidence of the awesome value of the spectrum that could have been sold or rented in the past to everyone from broadcasters to cellular phone companies to ham radio operators. 
 More important, it implies that the rigid system in which spectrum licensed to, say, taxi dispatchers in 1950 cannot be redeployed to beeper services or airline telephones in 1995 is incredibly wasteful. "It is the equivalent of zoning land for rice paddies in the suburbs of Tokyo," explains Peter Pitsch, a consultant in Washington.
There probably isn't any way to reclaim precious spectrum rights already in private hands. But Washington can -- and this Congress may -- allow the Federal Communications Commission to grant maximum feasible flexibility to how the licensees use the rights.
The legal framework for spectrum allocation dates from a time when Americans clustered around the radio to listen to Jack Benny. And it shows. The F.C.C. is charged with identifying the uses for the spectrum that best serve the public, and then handing out licenses to those most likely to do the job right. By the 1950's, however, the process had become a funhouse for lawyers and lobbyists, as companies and whole industries jockeyed for free use of what was becoming a very scarce resource.
The outdated process deteriorated to farce by the 1980's, when the F.C.C. was passing out parts of the spectrum for cellular phone systems. Licenses to serve cities that were not arbitrarily assigned to regional Bell companies have been sold and resold for tens of billions of dollars. In despair of finding the most suitable applicants through hearings as usual, the F.C.C. tried lotteries for allocating cellular licenses in less densely populated regions. But hundreds of thousands of people deluged the agency with their lottery "tickets" -- the forms that gave them a chance to become rich overnight.
Congress got wiser in the 1990's, finally succumbing to the argument that the Treasury was a more worthy recipient of the pot of gold at the end of the spectrum. But auctions cannot unleash the productivity of older spectrum licenses issued on the implicit assumption that communications technology was cast in stone.
How much is really at stake here? A 1992 research paper by Evan Kwerel and John Williams, then members of the F.C.C.'s staff, suggests the magnitude of the waste. They asked what would happen if a single, lightly used UHF television channel in Los Angeles were reassigned to a third cellular phone system for Southern California.
They estimated the value of the permanent loss of the television signal, as measured in ad revenue and program diversity lost, to be about $140 million. But the benefits from adding a third cellular system in the crowded market would have a cumulative value of $1.2 billion. Hence the net benefit of shifting a single television license in a single market to a higher valued use exceeded $1 billion.
The example is obsolete because new spectrum is now being assigned to provide competition for Los Angeles's two cellular networks. And as Mr. Kwerel is the first to point out, reshuffling all licenses would not yield proportional benefits since the spectrum would become a less scarce commodity in a more efficient market.
But by even the most conservative estimates, the value of services delivered by spectrum users would increase by billions of dollars. Indeed, Nicholas Negroponte, the head of M.I.T.'s Media Lab, has speculated that rational allocation would lead to a colossal reshuffling of uses in which most voice communications would move to wireless service and spectrum hogs like video would retreat to fiber optic cable.
Is any of this likely to happen? Adam Thierer, a communications analyst with the Heritage Foundation, argues this Congress could be convinced to make the maximization of economic value "the overriding goal of spectrum management." J. Gregory Sidak, his counterpart at the American Enterprise Institute, agrees, provided the deal is keyed to "buying off the broadcasters" by giving them access to additional spectrum for high definition television.
In the end what makes analysts optimistic is that this is a "positive sum" game -- one in which vested interests could win along with the public. And that sure beats trying to balance the budget.

A home builder drops its nuts-and-bolts image for a 'trust us' campaign.

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
THE Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest house builder, is trying to build something other than dwellings with an unusual soft-sell campaign.
Rather than simply selling houses, Kaufman & Broad, which is based here, is seeking to enhance its brand image and change consumers' perceptions about the tract homes it builds. The campaign, which features $3.5 million worth of television commercials, is a novel concept for tract-house builders, who usually eschew expensive schedules of television spots, relying instead on the real estate sections of Sunday newspapers to promote openings of new developments. 
 "A house is the ultimate consumer product," said Clifford J. Einstein, chairman of Dailey & Associates, the Los Angeles agency that was awarded Kaufman & Broad's account, with billings estimated at $24 million, after a review in October.
"It's not different than the washer or the dryer or the television," Mr. Einstein added in making the case for the television campaign. "It's a bigger box."
So the commercials avoid giving potential home buyers a hard sell for a specific tract in favor of trying to quell the doubts many of them are likely to feel about their biggest potential investment. The spots also attempt to address the fears that some consumers have about home builders since the recession in California, which forced many companies to close.
"When there is fear that exists in the industry," Mr. Einstein said, "then the leader has to step up and say 'Don't worry about this' or the industry is poisoned."
Bruce Karatz, chairman of Kaufman & Broad, agreed.
"The ads are designed to affect people's decision to buy a house and accelerate it," he said. "After six years of recession, you get hesitant."
Kaufman & Broad generates 60 percent of its sales from 100 developments in California. The company actually increased its market share in the state during the recession, which is only now ending, but profit margins have fallen sharply from a peak in 1989.
"There are fewer people out there," Mr. Karatz said. "We can influence traffic. We think it's smart to invest in advertising to do that."
Indeed, since the commercials began running last week in five Western states -- Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah -- there have been about 400 telephone calls a day from would-be home buyers.
The commercials feature the actor Tom Skerritt, who portrays the sheriff in the CBS series "Picket Fences." He walks through a partly built home, talking sincerely about the need to buttress the dream of home ownership with a builder that can be trusted.
The approach is far different from that taken by Kaufman & Broad's former agency of nine years, JGMC in Santa Monica, Calif., which lost the account to Dailey. Research conducted by Dailey determined that the boastful theme of the company's previous campaign -- "the West's largest home builder" -- raised skepticism among consumers; what was a point of pride to Kaufman & Broad conveyed to prospective home buyers cookie-cutter architecture and something less than high quality.
Mr. Skerritt, whose credits also include the film "A River Runs Through It" and a campaign for Guess jeans, was selected from a list of potential spokesmen that included the actor Alan Alda and the sports analyst John Madden.
However, Mr. Skerritt, who declined to be interviewed, apparently needed a little convincing. The son of a building supply salesman, he went on his own to inspect Kaufman & Broad model homes, Mr. Einstein said. Mr. Skerritt must have liked what he saw, because he signed a long-term contract with the builder for the campaign.
Some executives in the home building industry doubt that brand-building ads can influence buying decisions. Other attributes, including price, location and seller financing, are much more important to prospective buyers than the identity of the builder, said Douglas A. Stempowski, marketing vice president for the Centex Real Estate Corporation in Dallas, the nation's No. 1 home builder.
"I believe there is value in establishing brand equity," he added, "but at what cost? We do it quiet, better -- by building a home right every time."

 Mexico adopted a tough new economic plan that suggests a grim near-term future: recession, job loss and personal hardship as unavoidable in recovering from the financial crisis that has severely reduced the peso's value. Among other things, gasoline prices will jump 35 percent, and the value-added tax is to rise to 15 percent. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: Yeltsin to Allow a European Rights Mission in Chechnya

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 9

 BODY:
In another gesture to Western opinion, President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed today to allow a human-rights mission from the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe to maintain a presence in the secessionist Chechnya republic.
Meeting the Foreign Ministers of Germany, France and Spain, who came here on a mission from the European Union, Mr. Yeltsin repeated his assurances that Russia is committed to a political settlement of the three-month Chechnya war. 
 On Friday Mr. Yeltsin is to meet with the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, to agree formally on an economic program entitling Russia to a $6.4 billion loan. While Mr. Camdessus must present the loan to the Fund's board for approval, the money should begin to flow to Russia in April.
The loan is another sign of Western willingness to deal with Russia as a great power despite Chechnya. But the Fund, which has seen Russian promises of economic rectitude collapse in the past, has insisted on providing the money monthly, not quarterly, dependent on Russian economic performance.
Three days ago, the European Union froze a wide-ranging trade agreement with Russia because of Moscow's military tactics in Chechnya, which included aerial bombing and extensive artillery attacks on a largely defenseless city, Grozny, the capital.
The visit of the three Foreign Ministers -- Klaus Kinkel of Germany, Alain Juppe of France and Javier Solana of Spain, together with the European Union Commissioner, Hans van den Broek -- was intended to seek assurances from Mr. Yeltsin that human rights would be respected in Chechnya and that a political dialogue would start with the Chechens fighting for independence.
Mr. Yeltsin and his Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, urged the European Foreign Ministers today to carry out the trade deal reached last year. Mr. Kozyrev said with some irritation that ratification of the accord was being "unjustifiably dragged out" because of criticisms about Russian behavior in Chechnya.
But the Europeans have been struggling to find a way to express their concern over human rights violations there without undermining either Mr. Yeltsin or the stability of Russia's borders.
Russian forces continue to use bombs and shells against Chechen villages where secessionist fighters are thought to be sheltering. There have been allegations of human rights abuses -- including mistreatment of prisoners -- from organizations like Amnesty International.
After meeting Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Kinkel said the Russians "said in principle they accept the idea of the O.S.C.E. in Chechnya, but we did not go into details" or settle timing.
The establishment of a human rights mission in Chechnya by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has also been a demand by Washington, Western diplomats said, suggesting that it was a prerequisite before President Clinton agrees to come to Moscow for a summit meeting, which could be in May or June.
But there are other serious issues between Washington and Moscow, including Russia's plans to sell nuclear reactors to Iran, and it is not yet decided whether Mr. Clinton will come here for the anniversary of the defeat of Nazism on May 9.
In Israel, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said he would meet Mr. Kozyrev within two weeks on a "substantial agenda." The United States Ambassador to Russia, Thomas R. Pickering, was told by Washington to break off a trip to the Russian Far East and return to Moscow for consultations "on ongoing matters of significant interest to the two Governments," essentially to help set up the Christopher-Kozyrev meeting, a spokesman for the ambassador said.
Mr. Christopher originally wanted to meet Mr. Kozyrev before returning to Washington from the Mideast, American officials said, but that was not possible. So the men are expected to meet the week of March 20, presumably in Geneva.
The European delegation is the highest-level foreign mission to Moscow since Vice President Al Gore saw Mr. Yeltsin on Dec. 16, five days after the Chechnya operation began.
Before arriving in Moscow, the German Foreign Minister, Mr. Kinkel, said the delegation would not "mince its words over Chechnya." The French Foreign Minister, Mr. Juppe, stressed that isolating Russia was not an option, but that "Russia must respect commitments," including respect for human rights.
The O.S.C.E. groups 53 nations, including the United States, Canada and every European country. Moscow would like it to play a stronger role in European security, subordinating NATO, an idea that Washington rejects.
The organization has sent two previous missions to Chechnya, both of them brief. It has condemned the "disproportionate use of force" by Russia in Chechnya, but does not recognize Chechen claims to independence from Moscow.
The organization's previous missions have been careful and done little offending Moscow. The first mission found violations of human rights on both sides; the second offended many Russian human rights advocates when it agreed to get on a military plane to Chechnya without Mr. Yeltsin's human-rights commissioner, Sergei A. Kovalyov. Mr. Kovalyov has been a fierce critic of the war, and the Russian military refused to let him into the air base, even though he was supposed to travel with the mission.
Mr. Kovalyov is now out of the country and could not be reached for comment.

Russia Presses Attack
 SLEPTSOVSK, Russia, March 9 (AP) -- Russian forces pounded villages in southwestern Chechnya today with artillery shells and rockets, casting doubt on the future of an informal truce reached on Wednesday.
Chechen village leaders and Russian military officials met for a second day but agreed only to reconvene "in the near future" to discuss a cease-fire, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting the Chechen district leader in Samashky, Salam Umalatov.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
A Chinese Suit Against Lehman

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
The latest twist in Wall Street's payments spats with China? You guessed it -- derivatives!
A Chinese Government trading company, the Minmetals International Nonferrous Metals Trading Company, countersued Lehman Brothers Inc. yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, contending that the investment bank induced an employee into making "more than $35 billion in unauthorized derivatives trades unrelated to its business." 
 The suit, which seeks $128 million of damages, contends that Lehman's sophisticated investment bankers seduced the employee, Hu Xiangdong, into making "incredibly complicated derivatives transactions that were impossible for him to understand."
A Lehman Brothers spokesman, Steven H. Faigen, responded: "Their complaint and allegations are simply a smokescreen for not paying their obligations. Portraying the situation as similar to some other derivative-related issues is cynical opportunism and has no relation to the facts."
Derivatives are a generic name for a slew of financial instruments -- including options and futures -- that are priced off, and derive from, the underlying performance of stocks and bonds.
Like many other investment banks, Lehman enthusiastically pursued business with companies in China in recent years as that country's economy grew strongly. But that enthusiasm has soured, leading some firms to make staff cutbacks in Hong Kong and other regional offices.
As relations with the Chinese cooled, Lehman in November sued Minmetals International and its parent company, the China National Metals and Mineral Import and Export Company, in the same court, saying it had $53.5 million in unpaid debts and margin calls. Such calls require investors to put up more cash or collateral to help offset losses on their trading.
Minmetals had until next Monday to answer the Lehman suit, and with the countersuit, the matter is expected to go to trial.
"These were young, pushy investment bankers who weren't being supervised that well," said Aaron Rubinstein, a partner at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, the law firm representing Minmetals. He maintained that Mr. Hu was not authorized to make many of the trades and that Lehman did not disclose to him the full risks of the trading.
Mr. Faigen of Lehman denied this and maintained that Mr. Hu was a sophisticated trader who had made some trades that resulted in losses.
Lehman has been more aggressive lately in seeking to resolve its payment difficulties with Chinese Government companies and has gone to court while many other firms with similar problems are still negotiating with the Chinese. In November it also sued the China International United Petroleum Chemicals Company, seeking $44 million in bills that it said had not been paid.
There have recently been a number of disputes between Wall Street firms and Chinese companies. In a separate matter, the China International Trade and Investment Corporation, a Government-owned investment company, settled payments disputes this month with Merrill Lynch & Company and with Lehman, paying an estimated $14 million to the two firms but leaving outstanding financial disagreements with several other big metals trading companies.
Wall Street is not alone, however, in its payment difficulties with Chinese Government companies. Several foreign banks and financial institutions are seeking several hundred million dollars in unpaid debts from China's state companies.

HEADLINE: Senator Deals Blow to Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
Joining the growing political debate over affirmative action, the Senator who is the new head of a centrist Democratic group with close ties to President Clinton said today that preferential policies based on race and sex were "patently unfair" and had helped lead to a breakdown in society.
"You can't defend policies that are based on group preferences as opposed to individual opportunities, which is what America has always been about," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the new chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council. 
 "When we have such policies, we have the effect of breaking some of those ties in civil society that have held us together, because they're patently unfair," he added. "And those who are the victims of them and lose out when choices are made based on group preferences as opposed to individual ability naturally become disaffected from the process."
Mr. Lieberman made his remarks in response to questions from reporters after a speech at the National Press Club, and he emphasized that he was speaking as an individual, "but I think reflecting the point of view of the D.L.C."
Mr. Clinton, who helped start the leadership council when he was Governor of Arkansas, recently ordered aides to review the merits of all Federal affirmative action efforts in the face of Republican pressure to scale back preferential programs based on race and sex. The White House hopes to emphasize programs that benefit working Americans, regardless of race or sex, in an effort to hold onto disgruntled white Democrats that Mr. Clinton lured back to the party in 1992, then apparently lost in the midterm elections last fall.
But in a sign of the sensitivity of the issue, the President met briefly at the White House this afternoon with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and other representatives of women's and minority groups who urged him not to abandon efforts to redress past discrimination.
Mr. Jackson has suggested he might challenge Mr. Clinton's re-election if he is dissatisfied with the President's position on the question, and he issued a news release today announcing that he would "convene a meeting" with Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff. But after meeting with Mr. Panetta and other top aides for about an hour, and then with Mr. Clinton himself, he told reporters: "We need not suggest any threat. The concern here is we've come to bring clarity, we've come to bring concerns."
He added, "My appeal to Mr. Clinton is to move more quickly, because the review will show the need to renew, not to retreat."
Mr. Jackson said he had urged Mr. Clinton to hold a White House conference on jobs, affirmative action and other issues.
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said later, "We think that might dovetail nicely with our plans for a series of economic conferences" around the country in the coming months. He also said Mr. Jackson and the President had agreed to keep in touch.
The Republicans have vowed to make affirmative action a major campaign issue, and in California, Gov. Pete Wilson and others support a ballot proposition in 1996 that would bar the state from awarding jobs or contracts based on race or sex.
Mr. Lieberman said of that proposal, "I can't see how I would be opposed to it, because it basically is a statement of American values." But he said he was just beginning to review the issue and that the leadership council had not yet taken a position. Democrats in California are discussing an alternative to the Republican proposals.
Mr. Lieberman, who has known Mr. Clinton since the President's days at Yale Law School, said that "this business of deciding by group, in a sense, is the flip side of the argument that has flared up here in the last year about genetics, if you will, and the argument that some make that some groups are genetically less able than others.
"That's an un-American argument," he added. "And it's an un-American argument because it's based on averages, not on individuals. And that's the same when we come to group preferences and quotas. America's about individuals, not about averages or groups."
In a news conference last week, Mr. Clinton said he wanted to explore whether the Government could help disadvantaged people in some cases without preferences based on race or gender, through efforts like expanding preschool programs and college loans, extending tax breaks to working families and providing aid to cities.
"Where we can move ahead based on need, we ought to move forward and we shouldn't move backward," Mr. Clinton said then, sketching out a theme that his advisers say he intends to stress in the coming weeks. "There are still a lot of people who aren't living up to their capacity in this country, and it's hurting the rest of us."
On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton's chief pollster, Stanley Greenberg, warned that "the Democratic coalition cannot be based on social justice claims of some segment of their coalition against other segments of the coalition" if it is to prevail and retain its majority status.

HEADLINE: Dollar Dips As the Peso Falls Again

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration faced not one currency crisis but two today as the dollar slipped again, pulled down by a free fall in the value of the Mexican peso. That decline in the peso is threatening the American effort to keep its neighbor from financial collapse.
"I believe that in time, investor confidence in Mexico will be restored," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in a speech this morning in which he tried to talk up the value of the dollar. "While markets will move around, the program is sound and it should work." 
 But in private, American officials were far less optimistic today, fearing that the United States might get dragged deeper into Mexico's financial quagmire.
American officials and private economists agree that there is now little question that Mexico's troubles have played a significant role in the precipitous decline of the dollar. That linkage has, in turn, brought demands on Capitol Hill that the Clinton Administration find a way to cut itself free of its $20 billion bailout plan for Mexico announced last month. Any such move was rejected by Mr. Rubin today.
Instead, American officials are hoping that investors who have been pulling out of the country at a tremendous pace will be tempted to return with Mexico's adoption of a tough new austerity plan.
"It is a horribly difficult situation, and there are a lot of reasons to wonder whether this is going to work," a senior Government official said today of the Mexican plan. "At this point we are in so deep that there is no turning back."
Mr. Rubin made a strong effort to talk the dollar up, repeating that "a strong dollar is in America's self-interest" and threatening to intervene in the currency markets -- something the United States has not done this week -- "when it makes sense."
But the markets shrugged off the statement from Mr. Rubin, who once oversaw currency trading at Goldman, Sachs & Company, and the dollar fell in New York today to 91.02 yen from 91.42 on Wednesday. It eked out a gain against the German mark, ending the day at 1.4055 marks, up from 1.3960.
The bigger worry for American officials was not the small slide in the dollar today, but the larger problem that the main objective of the Mexican bailout -- to strengthen the peso and persuade foreign investors to return to Mexico -- does not appear to be succeeding. At best, many economists said today, the plan announced by Mexican officials would cause a recession in Mexico that should give the country a good-sized trade surplus, which would probably come largely at the expense of United States exporters. Already, American exports to Mexico -- once hailed by President Clinton as a sign of the success of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- have come to a near halt. And, unless Mexican domestic inflation sends the prices of its exports up more rapidly than its currency is depreciating, it may be only a matter of time before imports from Mexico take off. For now, at least, exports from Mexico, when measured in dollars, are half as expensive as they were in December.
"The Mexican economy has hit a brick wall," said Lawrence Chimerine, the chief economist of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, which tends to favor a more confrontational United States trade approach. "Business is off 40 or 50 percent; the banks are in increasing risk of major failure, and the peso is dragging down the dollar. The only people coming out whole are the investors in Mexican bonds, who are cashing in and running."
The objective of the Clinton Administration's plan, part of a $50 billion international package of loans hastily assembled last month, was to stabilize Mexico enough that investors would be willing to keep their money there.
If that does not happen, it is only a matter of time before Mexico runs through the loans provided by the United States and the International Monetary Fund. At that point, the Administration will be faced with letting Mexico default -- a possibility Mr. Rubin called "extremely unlikely" -- or committing new money, which could prove politically ruinous.
Already Republicans like Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, are charging that the plan is a failure and that American aid to Mexico should be halted. Congress refused to act on the Mexican bailout earlier this year, forcing Mr. Clinton to move on his own, which left the Administration the focus of all the criticism. Mr. Rubin is scheduled to testify about the plan before Mr. D'Amato's committee on Friday morning, in what is expected to be a heated confrontation.
While Mr. D'Amato's call for disengagement from Mexico has drawn support on Capitol Hill, many leading economists argue that pulling out would only make things worse for American exporters and probably for the dollar. "It would be a total abdication of U.S. leadership," said C. Fred Bergsten, who heads the Institute for International Economics, which tends to push for free trade. "The message would be that the U.S. had gone isolationist, and that alone would trash the dollar. And Mexico would default, giving us the worst of all worlds."
But for Mr. Clinton, Mexico's crisis threatens to undermine a main theme of his Presidency: that the economic future of America is bound up in its partnerships with leading trading partners. Throughout last year, when Mr. Clinton deepened ties with emerging markets in Asia and convened the first Latin American summit meeting, he made a persuasive case that American job growth was directly linked to increasing exports to "emerging markets."
That is a far more difficult case to make today, and Mr. Rubin is clearly concerned that if Mexico's troubles spread to other markets, the United States is headed for an even larger trade deficit next year.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Up as Dollar Is Steadier

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury issues rose yesterday for a second day as the dollar steadied. Some traders also said that Mexico's deepening financial crisis encouraged demand for the perceived safety of United States debt.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32 , to 10113/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.51 percent, from 7.54 percent on Wednesday. 
 Treasury bills and notes that mature in two years or less, which are typically viewed as the world's safest and most easily traded securities, gained even more than bonds. The yield on the two-year note fell 5 basis points, to 6.82 percent, and bill yields dropped as much as 6 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Concern that United States banks may face losses on Latin American assets prompted some investors to swap bank stocks for short-term Treasury securities, traders said.
"It's the old 'flight to quality' thing, and it's helping the market," said William Feezer, co-head of trading at Sanwa Securities (USA). "Mexico is just slipping under the bridge. We've got to cut them loose at some point."
Bond traders said bank stocks could keep slipping as economic conditions in Mexico and other Latin American nations worsened, bolstering short- and medium-term Treasury securities.
"It would not shock me if somewhere, either in Europe or in the U.S., financial institutions were taking sizable hits," said Rebekah Helzel, a trader at BA Securities. "Where there is smoke, there is fire."
Treasury issues gained even though the dollar fell to 91.02 Japanese yen, from 91.42 yen on Wednesday. A weaker dollar makes United States securities less attractive to foreign investors and can accelerate inflation by making imported goods more expensive.
Bond prices fell for four days before rebounding on Wednesday as the dollar plunged against leading currencies. The resilience of Treasury securities yesterday in the face of a weak dollar suggested to some investors that a declining dollar would not necessarily drive down bonds, pushing yields higher.
"The dollar is being unfairly abused," said George Mateyo, chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management in Cleveland, which has $3 billion in bonds.
In a hopeful sign for bond investors, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan S. Blinder, said yesterday that "there are indications, though not yet definitive indications," that the economy's growth rate was slowing from the 4 percent of last year. Mr. Blinder also said he did not see any signs that inflation would accelerate.
In the municipal market, Michigan's strong credit and an attractive maturity date of Sept. 29 helped to raise demand for $500 million in 5 percent notes issued by that state, said Mike Carbuto, who manages about $1 billion of securities for the Oppenheimer Management Corporation. "It's a balance between supply and demand."
A lack of new notes helped the offering, traders said. Municipal note sales have totaled $5.86 billion this year, down 53 percent from the period a year earlier, according to the Securities Data Company.
The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer's index of 40 actively traded municipals fell to 6.44 percent, from 6.45 percent on Wednesday.
In the corporate market, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation of North America and Spiegel Inc. took advantage of declining Government bond yields to sell $1.682 billion of corporate bonds and asset-backed securities.
Mortgage-backed securities also rose yesterday. Some investors are more optimistic about mortgage securities because they expect lower interest rates and the spring housing season to prompt more homeowners to pay off loans early by moving to new homes or refinancing.

HEADLINE: A House G.O.P. Leader Sets $200 Billion in Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
Firing the first shot in what is bound to be a long battle over tax policy, Representative Bill Archer, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed today a plan for cutting taxes by almost $200 billion over the next five years.
The proposals essentially follow the lines of the Contract With America, the campaign platform of Republican candidates for the House of Representatives last fall. The main aspects are tax reduction for almost all families of $500 for each child, a lower capital gains tax, tax cuts for working couples and retirees, and a variety of tax breaks for businesses. 
 The measure will be taken up by the Ways and Means Committee next week. Republicans in the House are so unified nowadays that the bill is almost certain to be approved virtually intact there.
But its prospects for eventual enactment are problematic because of strong opposition from President Clinton and from influential senators more interested in reducing the Federal budget deficit than in cutting taxes.
"The American people are highly overtaxed," Mr. Archer said in a speech today to the Family Research Council, a group that lobbies for conservative causes.
He took issue with politicians who say the Government cannot afford tax cuts because of the large budget deficit.
"The argument," said Mr. Archer, a 13-term Republican Congressman from Houston, "goes like this: Congress blew it. Congress spent it. Congress did it. So you, the taxpayer, must suffer.
"To that," Mr. Archer continued, "I say no way, no how, no chance. Not on my watch."
Democrats were quick to criticize the proposal.
At a news conference, Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, asserted, "It's the wrong time and the wrong tax cut."
"The most productive thing we can do for the American public now is to reduce the deficit," Mr. Gibbons said.
At the White House, Leon E. Panetta, the chief of staff, told reporters, "The President rejects the idea of targeting the most vulnerable in our society -- our children, needy families, the homeless -- in order to pay for these tax cuts, especially for tax cuts that are benefiting the wealthiest."
Such influential Republican Senators as Bob Packwood of Oregon, chairman of the Finance Committee, and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, have said they are opposed to tax cuts as long as the budget deficit remains.
Mr. Archer insisted that "not one single penny of tax relief will be provided unless it is offset by spending cuts." But even if that is the case, the tax reductions would doubtless make deficit reduction harder.
The cost of his proposals in lost revenue from now through the year 2000 would be $189 billion, the Congressional tax staff estimates. Moreover, the full effect of many of the proposals would not be felt for several years.
The tax staff estimated last month that the tax provisions of the Contract With America would cost about $500 billion in lost revenue from 2001 to 2005, and staff specialists said today that the cost of Mr. Archer's measure in those years would be of the same magnitude.
His committee and others in the House have already approved billions of dollars in spending cuts for child welfare, food stamps, school lunches and other programs that mostly benefit the poor. Further cuts are expected to be approved soon in Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans in the House intend these spending cuts to help cover the cost of tax cuts in the first five years.
Republicans have given no indication how they hope to reduce spending enough to cover the long-term price tag of the tax measure and still reach their goal of a balanced Federal budget.
Mr. Archer's presentation this morning was carefully staged to emphasize the change in party control in the House.
Democrats used to make tax announcements in the cavernous, formal Ways and Means hearing room with lobbyists standing three deep along the walls. Mr. Archer made his presentation before a bank of television cameras in a cramped basement room, where he was introduced by a young couple from Virginia holding their year-old daughter.
"We will bring tax relief aimed at helping the American family get ahead and stay ahead," Mr. Archer said.
Mr. Archer's measure makes some small changes in the tax provisions of the Contract With America.
The main aspects of reductions in capital gains taxes -- a lower rate and the adjustment of gains for inflation -- would be retained. The top tax rate on capital gains, the profits from the sale of securities and other investments, would fall to 19.8 percent from the current 28 percent. But for assets that are already in a taxpayer's portfolio, the inflation adjustment would be measured beginning this year regardless of when the asset was bought. And investors would not be allowed to claim a capital loss just because their profits were less than what was needed to keep pace with inflation.
The Archer bill would also repeal the alternative minimum tax as it applies to businesses, an item in the tax code meant to make sure that profitable concerns with large write-offs still pay some taxes.
In addition, the tax credit for children that was outlined in the Republican contract would have been partly refundable, meaning that families with incomes so low that they did not owe enough taxes to take full advantage of the credit would have been given a cash rebate. Mr. Archer, on the other hand, decided that it should not be refundable. The credit would be fully available to families with annual incomes below $200,000 and partly available to those with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000.
These are some of the other aspects of the Archer bill:
*A tax cut of up to $145 for working couples, to reduce the unfavorable tax consequences that often arise when two single workers marry.
*A new and more generous retirement savings account that would allow penalty-free withdrawals for buying a home and some other purposes.
*A repeal of the higher taxes that were enacted in 1993 on the Social Security benefits of middle- and upper-income retirees, and an increase to $30,000 from $11,500 in the amount people from 65 through 69 can earn without reduction in Social Security payments.
*Tax breaks for adoption expenses, the cost of caring for the elderly, long-term-care insurance and life insurance distributions to the terminally ill.
*More generous depreciation rules for businesses with capital investments.
*Lower estate and gift taxes.
The Archer proposal is considerably more generous than separate tax-cut measures offered by President Clinton and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.

HEADLINE: Ian Ballantine, 79, a Publisher Who Led Move Into Paperbacks

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR 

 BODY:
Ian Ballantine, a pioneer in publishing and founder of three important paperback houses, died yesterday at his home in Bearsville, N.Y. He was 79.
The cause was cardiac arrest, his office said. 
 In a distinguished career that spanned more than five decades, Mr. Ballantine, who was devoted to the notion that people would read a wide variety of books if they were affordable and accessible, founded Penguin U.S.A., Bantam Books and Ballantine Books.
Born in 1916 in New York City, Mr. Ballantine showed an early fascination with publishing, when, as an undergraduate at Columbia University, he wrote a paper in which he described paperbound books as the great hope of publishing.
In 1939, as Pocket Books prepared to introduce one of the first American paperback lines, Mr. Ballantine, fresh out of the London School of Economics, arrived with a stack of paperbacks published by Penguin Books in Britain. He and his wife, Betty, opened Penguin U.S.A. and began importing such classics as "The Invisible Man" by H. G. Wells and "My Man Jeeves," by P. G. Wodehouse.
In 1945, the Ballantines left Penguin to begin a reprint house, which they named Bantam Books. Just months later, having bought the paperback rights for 20 hard-cover books, they released their first list, including "Life on the Mississippi" by Mark Twain, "The Grapes of Wrath" by John Steinbeck, "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald and several westerns and mysteries.
No longer were Americans, many of them former servicemen and women in the habit of reading paperback books distributed during World War II, limited to the costly hard-covers found in urban bookshops. They could now buy paperbacks in train stations and other retail outlets throughout the country as well. Hardcover editions had sold for $2 or more; the paperbacks cost 25 cents.
In 1952, the Ballantines founded Ballantine Books, turning their focus to paperback originals, or books first published in paperback form instead of hard-cover. While broad-based in their selections, they found their industry niche by publishing the science fiction, fantasy, western and mystery genres.
"That's where they made one of their most distinctive contributions," said Irwyn Applebaum, president and publisher of Bantam Books. "They really helped make the genres of science fiction, fantasy, western and mystery true mass market best sellers by nurturing a whole generation of novelists."
The Ballantines published a successful and original line of military histories and first-person accounts of World War II. They also developed lines of science fiction and fantasy, including the works of Ray Bradbury, who wrote "The Martian Chronicles," and Arthur C. Clarke, who wrote "2001: A Space Odyssey," and J. R. R. Tolkein, author of "The Hobbit" and "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. And they acquired, edited and published books by Carlos Castenada and Tom Robbins.
In 1974, the Ballantines sold the business to Random House and rejoined Bantam Books, where they worked with such authors as Chuck Yeager and Shirley MacLaine.
To his employees, Mr. Ballantine was something of an enigma, sometimes stern, sometimes playful. "Talking with Ian was a cross between a friendly browbeating and a sprinkling of pixie dust," Mr. Applebaum said.
Until his death, Mr. Ballantine maintained an editorial office at Bantam Books at 1540 Broadway in midtown Manhattan and still spent his days wheeling around a cart filled with illustrations and manuscripts.
In recent years, the Ballantines also worked under the name Rufus Publications, named for Mrs. Ballantine's dog, where they edited and put together illustrated art and fantasy books, like "Faeries," by Brian Froud, as well as the 1992 best seller "Dinotopia," by James Gurney.
The Ballantines were the recipients of the Literary Market Place's Lifetime Achievement Award last month.
He is survived by his wife; a son, Richard, who lives in England; a brother David, of Bearsville, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Popularity Suffers Sharp Drop in a Poll

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
After a year of high approval ratings for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, his austere budget proposals have apparently caused his popularity to sag sharply in the last few months, according to a poll released yesterday.
The poll, which was taken by Quinnipiac College, in Hamden, Conn., indicated that 46 percent of the people surveyed approved of Mr. Giuliani's performance, compared with 56 percent in a poll conducted by the college in December. In the same period, the Mayor's disapproval rating increased to 40 percent from 27 percent in the December survey. 
 "Mayor Giuliani's honeymoon is definitely over, as New Yorkers begin to weigh the personal implications of the budget crisis," said William J. McLaughlin, director of the college's polling operation. "His approval ratings, which were a consistent 2-to-1, now match the narrow margin by which he was elected."
Despite the drop in his overall popularity, Mr. Giuliani received high marks on his handling of crime, with 60 percent of the people surveyed approving of his performance, and 28 percent disapproving.
As in earlier polls, there were dramatic differences in Mr. Giuliani's approval ratings among white, black and Hispanic New Yorkers. Black respondents gave him a 19 percent approval rating, with 69 percent disapproving. Thirty-four percent of Hispanic New Yorkers approved of the Mayor's performance, with 50 percent disapproving. Among white residents, the Mayor received a 63 percent approval rating, with 23 percent disapproving.
When it came to Mr. Giuliani's handling of the city's budget deficit, 52 percent of those surveyed said they disapproved of his performance, with 33 percent approving and 15 percent saying they were uncertain.
The poll was conducted through surveys of 755 New York City residents between Feb. 28 and Tuesday. The poll has a margin of sampling error of 3.6 percent.
Speaking to reporters at City Hall, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that his fiscal policies had hurt his popularity, but said that he viewed the impact as being short-term.
"It reflects the fact that we've had to make a lot of very tough decisions on the budget," Mr. Giuliani said. "I think as people understand the effect of it and see the positive impact it will have on the economy of the city, it will turn out to be a very positive thing."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
As Drive Ends, Thousands Have Fund to Thank

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
In Harlem, an orphaned boy grieving for his parents found solace in art therapy. In the South Bronx, a single mother returned to school when she found free day care for her toddler. And in Brooklyn, through counseling, a sorrowful old man finally accepted his wife's death.
They were among thousands whose lives were made better this year by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, whose 83d annual campaign ended last week. A total of 12,868 donors from Bay Ridge to Bangkok helped raise $4,526,919.95, the third-highest total ever. Although the campaign ended March 1, the final tally was not completed until yesterday. 
 The fund took in record amounts in December, but fell behind last year's pace by mid-January. In the end, it fell short of the 1994 appeal, which raised $4.59 million, but passed the 1993 effort, which took in $4.47 million. The lingering effects of a recession in the metropolitan area may be partly to blame; many donors wrote that they had to give less this year because of their own hardships.
Last week, it looked as if the fund total might be the lowest since 1989. But articles about the predicament stirred readers' compassion. In its final 24 hours, the fund received $144,521.
"We send this very modest donation in the hope that it will help (even if just a little bit) in the final push toward matching last year's contributions to the fund," wrote Michael Farber and Liz Luhoja of Manhattan, who sent $25. "In a time where so little attention is being given to social services, the fund is more important than ever."
Many people, like Barbara R. Robey of Manhattan, sent second donations after reading that the fund was behind.
"It's my way of saying that while the governments of this country and state and city are appearing mean-spirited and short-sighted, not all of the citizenry go along with that," wrote Ms. Robey, who sent $100.
Since it was established in 1912 by The Times's publisher, Adolph S. Ochs, the fund has proved the generosity of New Yorkers. The first appeal, in 1912, received 117 gifts totaling $3,630.88. The $1 million mark was passed in the 1970-71 campaign, and the fund's annual total broke $2 million in 1984, and $4 million in 1989.
In the coming year, Neediest Cases money will help the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service continue Project Moving On, which teaches job skills to mentally ill adults. It will enable the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies to finance antiviolence projects in neighborhoods rife with crime. And it will offer a lifeline to thousands of people for whom survival is a daily struggle.
The fund will help immigrants like Vitaly Nisanov, a mentally retarded man who has flourished in a day program sponsored by UJA-Federation of New York. It will help children like Nicholas Wright, who received a new set of teeth thanks to the Children's Aid Society. It will help homeless New Yorkers like Charles Foreste, who slept at the 79th Street Boat Basin before the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services found him subsidized housing.
For all the people who benefit from the fund, there are others who make it a success. Throughout the winter, a steady stream of contributions came from families, businesses and school children, many with their own compelling stories. They included Johnny Suzuki of Chiba, Japan, who sent $20 "to the good American people having a hard time," and Audrey Amdursky of Manhattan, who donated $9,050 in memory of a son who she said died of complications from H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
Contributions to the Neediest Cases Fund will continue to be accepted throughout the year and credited to next year's campaign, which will begin on Thanksgiving Day.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Losing Money and Nobels

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Save a dollar even if you wind up losing two, or three. Somehow it does not seem the greatest way in the world to run a business, or a government.
But it happens when business management gets panicky, cannot come up with a strategy of cost control, investment and growth and instead just hacks, hacks, hacks. 
 And it happens to governments, when cutting budget and taxes become so politically and emotionally overriding to public and officials that the knife lops off or cripples parts of American life that pay back far more than they cost.
Everybody with a slice of brain knows that if the city and state slash back too hard on money to the cultural life of New York they will wither one of its major industries, the taxes it pays and the billions it brings from tourism.
But it does not sink in that an important source of revenue and economic progress is the City University of New York. This quite stunning collection of senior colleges, community colleges, professional schools and graduate center now faces one of the most severe budget-cutting threats in its history.
Penny wise. In plain bottom line: College graduates earn more, spend more and pay more taxes once they get that degree.
CUNY estimates that graduates of the 1970 to 1993 classes annually returned $4 billion more to New York than if they had stopped at high school. That does not even count us, the heavier earning, spending and taxed older graduates; I think I paid $4 billion in taxes myself. Anyway, we CUNY people have paid back for decades of college budgets, and still are paying.
The state contributes most of the budget of the senior colleges, and the city the two-year community colleges. Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani demand deep cuts.
For the 11 senior colleges alone, Governor Pataki is proposing a cut of $158.1 million. CUNY says that is a 25.7 percent reduction, compared with an overall cut in the state budget of 3.4 percent. The Governor says it can be made up if the colleges raise their tuition by $1,000, to $3,450.
That is less than Harvard. But students and faculty are nervy enough to complain. Maybe that's because for most of the history of the colleges, beginning in 1847, tuition was what it had to be to carry out the founding philosophy that bright, poor boys -- no girls existed then -- had the right to try for higher education. Tuition was zero.
In 1976, CUNY was forced to begin charging tuition. That was impossible for most students to pay. So they had to apply for "student aid." How I would have hated that -- higher education as a charitable dollop instead of the American right to go as far as my brain took me.
Youngsters from lower-middle-class families were judged too rich for the aid they needed to stay in college. But they did not have money to go to "pay schools."
If the new cuts stand, CUNY will have to slash faculty and classes so deep that it will hardly be a university anymore, or pass the burden on to the students.
Students whose family incomes, meager though they be, disqualify them for student aid may drop out when they find that the new tuition requires a full-time job, and that it is just too much for body and brain.
I could not have done it. I would not have wanted my sons to have to.
The state demands elimination of "remedial" classes. That would account for only a small part of the cuts. Remedial classes do not belong in colleges. But they should be phased out by academic decision, not a government fiat that will be taken hard by families, mostly minority, who still see them as a key to a door.
If graduating classes dwindle and CUNY slides irretrievably into the oblivion of mediocrity, this city will lose not only taxes but economic and social propellant.
CUNY tops Standard & Poor's survey of baccalaureate alumni who are top corporate leaders. Will anybody ever be our modern Baruch, our 12th Nobel, our 2d Colin Powell, our new Salk? All those thousands of graduates who became doctors, engineers, teachers, business leaders and scientists because New York gave them the chance -- what is the bottom line on having them and what will it be if we lose them?

HEADLINE: Chrysler Cuts Sales Forecast

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 9

 BODY:
Citing two consecutive months of disappointing sales, the Chrysler Corporation has cut its forecast for 1995 sales in the United States by 200,000 units, to 15.8 million cars and trucks from 16 million vehicles.
The estimate was revised last week but made public at the Geneva auto show today by the chairman of Chrysler, Robert J. Eaton. It is the second reduction this year in the outlook of the auto maker for 1995. 
 In February an economist for Chrysler, Van Bussmann, lowered his forecast for 1995 by 200,000 units, to 16 million vehicles, after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates.
Mr. Bussmann was not available to comment on the latest revision by Chrysler. But Mr. Eaton said concerns about interest rates appeared to be taking their toll.

HEADLINE: PAN AMERICAN GAMES;
The Games Go On but Feel a Global Financial Pinch

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina, March 9

 BODY:
The Pan American Games, a preamble to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, opened today in this oceanside resort, but the anticipation of gold medals is tempered by hemispheric political and economic concerns, including the level of future participation by the United States.
The 19-day Pan Am Games are held every four years, in the year preceding the Summer Olympics. The United States is spending $4.1 million to send a contingent of 750 athletes and 450 coaches and officials to Argentina. But with the United States Olympic Committee facing the possibility of budget cutbacks after the Atlanta Games, the number of athletes competing in future Pan Am Games could be reduced. 
 "I don't think there is any question that future U.S. participation in the Pan Am Games is up for careful review within our anticipated budget constraints," John Krimsky, the interim executive director of the United States Olympic Committee, said today.
The U.S.O.C. is bound by the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 to participate in the Pan Am Games. They serve as a vital competition in the year before the Summer Olympics. Politically, the Pan Am Games have also been a valuable tool for the United States in securing support from Latin America to obtain host sites for the Winter and Summer Olympics.
Traditionally, the United States has fielded its full complement of roster spots for participation in international events. But, given the worst-case scenario that the U.S.O.C.'s budget could shrink from $400 million to $300 million in the next quadrennium, some financial belt-tightening is inevitable, if only to reduce the number of officials who attend.
Others among the 42 nations competing in the 1995 Pan Am Games are suffering far more urgent economic problems. Mexico has experienced a staggering devaluation of the peso, which appears to have had a significant impact on state-supported sports programs, U.S.O.C. officials said.
Mexico is sending 324 athletes to Argentina, 15 fewer than it sent to the 1991 Pan Am Games in Cuba, and has had to negotiate with private companies to pay for its contingent, according to Mario Vasquez Rana, a Mexican International Olympic Committee member who is also president of the Pan American Sports Organization. Vasquez Rana said the peso devaluation would have "no effect at all" on Mexico's participation in the Pan Am Games, but American officials said they had been told otherwise in discussions with Mexican officials.
After Puerto Rico withdrew from the women's basketball competition last week, the U.S.O.C. offered to fly the Mexican women's team to Argentina on its charter from Miami in a futile attempt to keep the event from being canceled. Mexico declined, partly for economic reasons, Krimsky said.
For reasons related to its deepening economic crisis, Cuba's entourage of 494 athletes at the Pan Am Games includes only those who are believed capable of winning medals, according to Reynaldo Gonzalez, the country's Minister of Sport. Included will be the boxer Felix Savon and the high jumper Javier Sotomayor, both Olympic champions. Absent will be the distance runner Ana Fidelia Quirot, an Olympic bronze medalist at 800 meters, who suffered severe burns in a fire at her home in January 1993. She had skin graft surgery, Gonzalez said, and "is not yet ready for competitions like this one."
Cuba could also lose more of its top stars through political defections that have already come in the sports of boxing, weight lifting, baseball, softball and basketball. Some 40 Cuban athletes defected at the Central American Games in Puerto Rico in November 1993.
"It's not a big concern," Gonzalez said. "You have to put it in perspective. It happens all the time, in a lot of countries. Athletes are free if they want to defect. But I don't believe it is ethical to emphasize the news about the few who defected over the accomplishments of the many athletes who stayed."
The opening ceremonies will be held here Saturday. Gymnastics competition began today, and the United States men finished second to Cuba in the compulsory portion of the team competition.
The United States will field Olympic-caliber teams in such sports as gymnastics, swimming, boxing, wrestling and cycling. The caliber of other American teams, particularly baseball and men's basketball, have been affected by the time of year, which is the end of summer in the Southern Hemisphere.
The United States threatened not to send a baseball team here, until field improvements were made at the Pan Am stadium in Buenos Aires. A college team had to be found that could fit a trip into its schedule with a minimal interruption. St. John's University was the choice.
Because this is tournament time in college basketball and the middle of the National Basketball Association season, players from various teams in the Continental Basketball Association, including the former Michigan star Rumeal Robinson, will represent the United States in men's basketball.
After Puerto Rico withdrew from the women's basketball competition, saying that six team members were playing college ball in the United States, the event was canceled. Only four teams were remaining -- the United States, Argentina, Brazil and Cuba -- one short of the minimum of five for a Pan Am tournament. Particularly affected were several members of the United States team who had passed up opportunities to play in Europe this season.
"We're greatly disappointed," Krimsky said. "We had a strong team."

HEADLINE: House Votes to Help Medical Profession in Court

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
After intense lobbying, pharmaceutical companies and doctors succeeded today in being included in a sweeping measure taken up by the House that would for the first time set limits in all of the nation's courts on damages awarded in civil lawsuits.
The House is set to vote on Friday on the complete measure, the last bill in a three-part Republican package intended to sharply reduce the number of lawsuits that go to trial. Like the two previous measures, which were easily passed by the Republican-controlled House, the bill debated today is expected to win approval, though the prospects in the Senate are far less clear. 
 The pharmaceutical industry had long sought the provision it won today, an amendment that would make it immune from punitive damages in suits involving drugs or devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The House approved the amendment by a voice vote. Drug companies would not have immunity if they gave false information to the F.D.A.
The American Medical Association, which represents about 40 percent of the country's doctors, has lobbied heavily this week to have medical malpractice awards included in some of the limits.
These were among the amendments to the measure taken up by the House today. In all the measure would make it more difficult for plaintiffs to win punitive damages against people they sue for negligence. It would set a cap on punitive damages of $250,000 or three times the amount of actual damages awarded, whichever is greater. It would also make it more difficult to win product-liability lawsuits, those arising out of claims that a product like a car or a toaster or a heart valve malfunctioned.
Punitive damages are awarded by juries on top of actual damages to express outrage or punish defendants for flagrant misconduct. The legislation would not put limits on actual damages like lost wages and medical expenses. The punitive damages are at the heart of complaints that the legal system is out of control with juries capriciously making excessive awards.
In the amendment backed by the doctors, introduced on the floor today by Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California, jury awards for factors like pain and suffering would also be limited to $250,000 in medical malpractice cases.
"We consider this a litmus-test issue," said James Stacy, a spokesman for the medical association. "This is the first time that a cap on such awards has been on the floor of the House." The association was calling doctors around the country today, telling them to urge their representatives to approve the Cox amendment.
Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, said the bill would curtail what he called lawsuit abuse. "Lawsuit abuse saps our economy, eliminates jobs, pits neighbor against neighbor and injures our country's global competitiveness," he said.
The measure, like the other two bills in the package, is generally favored by corporations while opposed by consumer groups and trial lawyers.
The amendment sought by the medical association would work this way: A plaintiff sues a doctor after, say, a botched operation. The patient could sue for his actual damages, like lost wages or extra medical costs incurred. He could also sue for pain and suffering but under the amendment only up to the cap of $250,000. The cap for punitive damages would be $250,000 or three times the actual damages, whichever is greater.
Doctors and their advocates have been complaining for more than 20 years about skyrocketing malpractice insurance premiums, which they say are caused by the enormous awards for pain and suffering given by sympathetic juries. Punitive damages are infrequently awarded in medical malpractice cases.
Mr. Stacy of the medical association said the incidence of high awards for pain and suffering was the reason many insurance companies had stopped providing medical malpractice insurance.
For the last week, several chiefs of individual pharmaceutical companies have come themselves in Washington to lobby members over the drug amendment, House staff aides and industry representatives said.
Louis Hoynes, senior vice-president and general counsel of the American Home Products Corporation of New Jersey, said in an interview today that the industry was facing a growing number of lawsuits brought by people who are merely hoping to hit the jackpot with a sympathetic jury. The number of suits in which there is a sizable punitive damage award is rare, Mr. Hoynes acknowledged, but he contended the threat of litigation discourages development of new drugs.
But Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, said the amendment would give pharmaceutical companies an absolute defense against reckless behavior. He said if such an amendment were in force, women would have been blocked from getting extra damages for such problems as those caused in the 1950's and 1960's by DES, a drug that had been widely prescribed for morning sickness in pregnant women but resulted in severely deformed offspring.
Representative Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican who sponsored the amendment on behalf of the drug industry rejected arguments that the Republicans were using the Food and Drug Administration as a shield for drug companies while simultaneously trying to weaken its procedures for approving new drugs or medical devices.
The House also passed by voice vote an amendment that would include products that are rented from the bill's protections, a provision that was sought by car rental companies. Although the Democrats are outnumbered in the House, they did manage to pass one amendment, which would hold companies more responsible, but it applied only to foreign companies.

HEADLINE: Balkan Brinkmanship

 BODY:
After smoldering over the winter, the brutish war in the Balkans may be re-ignited by Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman. The barrel of kerosene he is carrying is a March 31 deadline for the withdrawal of the 12,000 United Nations troops stationed in Serb-occupied areas of Croatia.
He imagines that Croatian forces, stronger than they were three years ago, can now defeat local Serbian militias and restore these areas to Croatian Government control. That ignores the virtual certainty that the Serbian Government in Belgrade would respond by sending its own powerful military and Bosnian Serb forces into the battle. 
 The consequences could be nightmarish. U.N. troops in Bosnia, cut off from supply lines, might have to be withdrawn as well. The open coordination of Serbian units across the fragile frontiers of former Yugoslavia could carry the war to powderkeg areas like Kosovo and Macedonia, which until now have managed to stay out of the fighting. The geographic containment of the conflict, the only indisputable achievement of three years of outside intervention, would be shattered.
A C.I.A. study on ethnic cleansing in Bosnia makes clear that the top Serbian leadership in Belgrade has sponsored a systematic policy of eliminating non-Serb inhabitants from territory it seeks to incorporate. Similar policies have been carried out, with the blessings of Belgrade, in Serb-held areas of Croatia and would doubtless be unleashed elsewhere if the fighting re-ignites and spreads.
The Clinton Administration's top European diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, is leading an international effort to persuade Mr. Tudjman to relent. He deserves the full support of Britain, France, Germany and Russia.
Mr. Tudjman has a legitimate grievance. The United Nations forces, sent to Croatia in 1992 under a peace plan negotiated by Cyrus Vance, the former Secretary of State, failed to act as a buffer against the Serbs. Since the U.N. troops arrived, the Serbs have transformed their territory into a small Serbian republic and used it as a staging ground for the war in Bosnia. But expelling the U.N. forces would be a grave mistake, and Croatia would be its first victim.
Washington's best hope is to appeal to predominantly Roman Catholic Croatia's longstanding desire to extricate itself from Balkan conflicts and associate itself more closely with the West. Mr. Holbrooke must make clear that such association would become impossible if U.N. troops were expelled. The other half of the message should be that Croatia's chances for economic association and support from Europe would increase, and the prestige of its President in Washington and other Western capitals would grow, if he agrees to let U.N. troops remain. Germany would be the most likely source of new aid. Russian consent would be necessary for any agreement to direct U.N. troops in Croatia to play a less passive role.
The violent breakup of the former Yugoslavia has been the major European failure of the post-cold-war era. Washington, rightly reluctant to commit American troops, has refrained from active crisis management, leaving the diplomatic initiative largely in British and French hands. But London and Paris, through a mixture of incompetence and pro-Serb bias, have all but expended their credibility among Croatians and Bosnians. By reasserting American leadership now, the Clinton Administration can help avert a wider war in the Balkans.

HEADLINE: Better Ways to Employ Substitute Teachers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding your March 1 news article about substitute teachers ("Teacher's Absent. Now What?"): 
 I am a substitute, and for many of us, the issue is an economic one. Approximately $98 a day seems adequate until you break it down and see that you're not paid for holidays, and when summer rolls around you're out of a job! Who can survive on this irregular income?
A solution would be to hire substitutes on an annual basis with benefits and let them work in one or two districts as needed. This is an excellent way to attract quality substitutes. The teachers would benefit, and the children would have teachers to rely on when their regular teachers are absent. The districts would get to know these teachers.
That would solve the problem of substitutes with no accountability. It would weed out the undesirables. When the district and children are familiar with substitutes, children are less likely to misbehave because they know this teacher will see their regular teacher. There are solutions, but it's going to take planning and a commitment to our children's education.

HEADLINE: The Catskills, on the Ropes, Rally for an Indian Casino

BYLINE: By DAVIDSON GOLDIN 

DATELINE: MONTICELLO, N.Y., March 9

 BODY:
Pat Croissant invested $1 million in Scalawags restaurant in 1987. With fewer customers each month, she says she'll lose everything unless the economy of the Catskills picks up soon.
So when the Oneida Indian Nation last week proposed building a casino on the grounds of the Monticello Raceway here, about 90 miles northwest of New York City, she thought her troubles might be over. 
 But the plan requires Gov. George E. Pataki's approval, and so far he has said no.
At a standing-room-only meeting of the Sullivan County Board of Supervisors today, local residents rallied in support of the Oneidas' proposal and said they would fight to change the Governor's mind. Without a casino, they said, the region's economy will continue to slide.
"If you look at the golden age of the Catskills, and the hotel industry, we had tens of thousands of rooms, and now we're down to 5,500," said Andrew Boyar, the board's chairman.
According to the Catskills Resort Association, hotel room bookings are down 35 percent from 1989, and the industry has lost more than 2,000 jobs since 1985, leaving only 4,000 jobs. The salary for the average hotel worker in the region is less than $13,000 a year.
In 1980, the raceway recorded its highest single-day attendance of more than 17,000. Now, a crowd of 1,000 is rare.
"If casino gambling doesn't come in some form soon, this community will lose everything," said Ms. Croissant, who has been a leader in the region's push to legalize casino gambling. She has already had to close a snowmobile business that once drew as many as 500 customers on a weekend day, and today her large dining room had just a handful of customers during lunch hour.
She and other local leaders said that they understand the Governor's concerns that any new casino on non-Indian land should provide tax revenue to the state. Under Federal law, an Indian casino would be exempt from state and local taxes.
Ms. Croissant and the leaders said that they favor legalized gambling at the region's resorts regardless of whether the Oneidas' plan goes through, but that the Oneidas' plan represents the most immediate hope.
"Some criticize this as a quick fix," said Pat Pomeroy, chairwoman of the County Planning Board. "Well, tell that to anyone who works in an emergency room. First, you stop the bleeding, they you develop a long-term cure."
Efforts are under way in the Legislature to legalize casino gambling through a constitutional amendment -- a process that would take at least three years since it would require the approval of two consecutive Legislatures and two referendums. Governor Pataki has said he supports the initial passage of such an amendment while officials study the impact of gaming on the state's economy.
"This casino is the only hope we have right now," said Gene Barbanti, who owns a Century 21 real-estate agency here. "If we wait three years, some more hotels are going to close, and some businesses will surely fold."
The Oneidas now run the Turning Stone Casino in Verona, 35 miles east of Syracuse, under the terms of a 1988 Federal law that permits sovereign Indian nations to operate the same games of chance that states allow at charity "Las Vegas nights."
But the raceway here is not part of the Oneidas' territory and can only be opened to casino gambling if Federal officials and the Governor approve.
The Oneidas have offered annual payments of $5 million to the county for 10 years and have said they are willing to negotiate payments to the state.
Officials said today that Sullivan County's unemployment rate was 8.5 percent and that nearly two-thirds of the high school graduates between the ages of 20 and 24 were unemployed.
The Oneidas estimate that their casino would employ 2,800 people at an average salary of $22,000 a year and would create 3,000 additional jobs throughout the community.
A spokesman for the Governor, Chris Chichester, said today that Mr. Pataki remained opposed to an Indian casino in the Catskills, but Mr. Boyar, the county board chairman, refused to give up hope.
"Our plight is quite well documented," he said. "The Governor has to be responsive to the needs of constituents, and we're his constituents."

HEADLINE: House Passes New Standards Limiting Awards in Civil Suits

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
With little suspense and overwhelming support from the new Republican majority, the House today easily passed a measure that for the first time would set standards in all of the nation's courts for civil lawsuits.
The measure was approved by a 265 to 161 vote, giving the House Republicans a clean sweep this week on all three bills that made up a legislative package intended to sharply reduce the number of lawsuits nationwide. 
 The package now goes to the Senate, which is certain to be far less hospitable to at least two of the bills. President Clinton has said he opposes all three measures in their current form and White House aides said he is hoping the Senate rejects or revises the package.
The bill approved today would set limits on monetary awards available to people who sue for damages caused by devices as diverse as lawn mowers, toasters and artificial hearts. The measure, which would apply to state as well as Federal courts, would also set limits for the first time on the amount of punitive damages a jury could award a patient for pain and suffering in a medical malpractice suit. The American Medical Association, which lobbied heavily for the measure, complained to lawmakers that occasional large awards in celebrated malpractice cases have corroded the doctor-patient relationship and placed unfair costs on its members.
Congress can impose new Federal standards because almost all civil lawsuits in state courts involve interstate commerce, which Congress has the power to regulate under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Thus, under the House bill, even lawsuits brought in state courts would have a limit in punitive damages of three times a plaintiff's actual damages, like lost wages or medical expenses, or $250,000, whichever is greater. In medical malpractice cases, damages for pain and suffering could not exceed $250,000.
Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who heads the House Judiciary Committee, looked back on the week in which his party rolled to easy victory on its effort to drastically overhaul the legal system and said he was stunned. "I guess we're still getting used to being the majority party," he said. "I never dreamed we'd get to see the day when we would even be debating some of these issues on the floor."
Responding to accusations that Republicans had simply aided their patrons in business, Mr. Hyde said corporations provided jobs and growth in the economy, adding, "We shouldn't make an enemy or adversary of them just to satisfy some populist urge."
The possibility of blockbuster verdicts, he said, has led to a system that provides incentives for lawyers to bring unwarranted lawsuits. "The truth is that we're interested in a legal system that's fair," he said.
The debate this week pitted a range of powerful interests against each other in a high-stakes game. Trial lawyers, allied with consumer groups, were the principal opponents of the legislation, and thus the principal losers, so far.
In addition to the business community and the American Medical Association, other major beneficiaries would include the pharmaceutical industry, which successfully lobbied for a provision to limit damages to patients who sue drug makers.
All the bills are derived from the Republicans' Contract With America. The Senate, more lawyer-friendly than the House and less fervent about the campaign manifesto, is expected to seek significant changes in parts of the bills.
Senator Larry Pressler, a South Dakota Republican who heads the Commerce Committee, which is likely to be responsible for at least two of the bills, said he believed only one had a prospect of passing: the one approved by the House today involving product liability suits and medical malpractice.
"I think the prospects are grim for the other two," he said. "I know it's not good news for supporters of the Contract With America, but it's going to be tough going in the Senate." He said he expected Democrats would try to defeat the measures with a filibuster. To overcome that, supporters would need 60 votes to invoke cloture to end debate. "The only one that I think we could get cloture on is the product liability bill," he said.
He said he had relayed that assessment in a memorandum to Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican whip.
Mr. Pressler also said he expected the Senate would strip the measure of the provision that so pleased the pharmaceutical industry. That provision would make drug companies immune from most damage awards if the Food and Drug Administration had approved the product.
The White House had little presence in this week's debate, apparently hoping the President would be spared by the Senate from having to decide on a veto. "We feel that the package of the three measures together doesn't do enough to protect the interests of the American consumer," the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said. "The President will be seeking modifications of this legislation as the legislation now moves to the Senate."
Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group, said, "In the end, it's the consumer that is going to suffer from all of these measures." Limiting product liability lawsuits, she argued, would remove a powerful incentive for manufacturers to make their products safer. "This legislation should be called the corporate and medical wrongdoer's protection act," she said.
Larry Stewart, the president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which lobbied against all the measures, said the effect of the legislation would be to "give the rich an economic club to force ordinary Americans to stay out of the courts or take less than what they're entitled to." He said it was hypocritical of the Republican sponsors to have inserted a provision that would exclude commercial litigation from the limits on damages.
"If a machine blows up in a factory, the workers would be limited, but the factory owner isn't," he said.
The House Republicans began their march to victory on Tuesday by passing the Attorneys Accountability Act, a measure that would create enormous pressure on parties in a civil lawsuit to settle their dispute before going to court. The bill would put in place a sharply modified version of the so-called English system in which the loser in a civil lawsuit pays the legal costs and fees of his opponent. Under the measure, if a party in a lawsuit rejects a settlement offer from the other side and the jury comes in with an award less than that offer, that party would have to pay legal fees of the side making the rejected offer.
On Wednesday, the House approved a bill to limit the ability of stockholders and their lawyers to file suits accusing companies or stockbrokers of fraud.
 
LEGISLATION
Overhauling the Legal Sysytem: The Final Round
 
The House of Representatives today passed the last of three bills today aimed at reducing the number of lawsuits in the nation's civil justice system. The first measure, the Attorney Accountability Act approved Tuesday, is intended to discourage what sponsors call frivolous lawsuits by making some lawyers liable for their opponents' as well as their own legal fees. On Wednesday it passed the Securities Litigation Reform Act, which seeks to discourage investors from bringing lawsuits charging companies with fraud.
 
Yesterday the House passed the Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act, which would limit punitive damages in cases involving defective products and personal injuries. Here are the act's provisions:
 
STANDARDS:

Current Law: There are no uniform Federal laws governing personal injury and liability lawsuits for defective products, which are typically handled in state courts.
 
Proposed Change: Would set new Federal standards for these cases.
 
PUNITIVE DAMAGES
 
Current Law: A plaintiff generally may be awarded punitive damages, intended to punish willfully malicious conduct, in cases where he can prove that the manufacturer was "flagrantly indifferent" to consumer safety. Punitive damages are distinct from compensatory damages, which can be economic (medical costs, lost wages) or non-economic (compensation for such intangibles as mental distress, pain and suffering).
 
Proposed Change: A court may award punitive damages in any type of civil suit only if a plaintiff establishes by "clear and convincing evidence" that the defendant intended to cause harm or displayed a conscious, flagrant indifference to others' rights. Punitive damages would be capped at three times the plantiff's award for monetary losses (such as lost wages and medical bills) or $250,000, whichever is greater.
 
MEDICAL MALPRACTICE
 
Current Law: Plaintiffs may be awarded unlimited damages for pain and suffering from medical malpractice suits.
 
Proposed Change: Would limits damages for pain and suffering in these cases to $250,000.

USE OF ALCOHOL OR DRUGS
 
Current: In some states, an intoxicated individual who primarily causes his or her own injury is able to prevail in litigation.
 
Proposed Change: An injured person would be barred from recovering any damages if a court determines that the person was more than 50 percent responsible for the harm suffered because of drug or alcohol use at the time of the injury.
 
JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY
 
Current: In cases involving multiple defendants, any of the parties could be responsible for paying 100 percent of damages. If, for example, one party is unable to pay its share, the plaintiff may present his bill to the party with the "deepest pockets."
 
Revision: In non-economic damage awards in product liability cases, defendants would be responsible only for the proportion of the harm they caused. Liability is still joint and several for economic damages.
 
RETAIL SELLERS
 
Current Law: Many states impose strict liability standards against retail sellers in cases involving defective products.
 
Proposed Change: Retail sellers, including those who rent or lease equipment, generally would be liable only for damages caused by their own actions - not for simply selling a defective product.
 
STATUTE OF REPOSE
 
Current: Fifteen states have enacted statutes of repose - the number of years for which a manufacturer can be held liable for his product. None are longer than 15 years.
 
Proposed Change: Would establish a 15 year limit, with certain exceptions, for which a manufacturer would be liable.

HEADLINE: Emotional March Gains a Repentant Wallace

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala, March 10

 BODY:
The marchers swarmed around the old man in the wheelchair, some to tell him he was forgiven, some to whisper that he could never be forgiven, not today, not a million years from now. Yet to all of the people who retraced the steps of the Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights march 30 years ago, George C. Wallace offered an apology for a doomed ideal.
The former Alabama Governor, whose name became shorthand for much of the worst of white Southern opposition to the civil rights movement, held hands with men and women he had once held down with the power of his office. To one aging civil rights war horse, he mumbled, "I love you." 
 Three decades ago, he was preaching the evil of integration and found approval, even adoration, in the eyes of many white Alabamians. There was the legendary stand in the schoolhouse door, to keep blacks from registering at the University of Alabama. It was his state troopers who used billy clubs and tear gas to control and intimidate marchers on the way to Selma. Then, he took his message nationwide in a run for President in 1968.
A would-be assassin's bullet in a Maryland shopping center in 1972 made him a cripple, but his old words and views echo today on the lips of conservative politicians and others, even though the man people here just call "Th' Guv'na' " has long since capitulated, apologized and begged for forgiveness.
Now 75, in a wheelchair for a third of his life, he was too old and sick to make a speech to the 200 marchers, mostly black, who gathered at the St. Jude School in Montgomery, as they did on this day three decades ago. Instead, an aide read his remarks as Mr. Wallace, who is almost completely deaf, sat in silence.
"My friends," the aide read, "I have been watching your progress this week as you retrace your footsteps of 30 years ago and cannot help but reflect on those days that remain so vivid in my memory. Those were different days and we all in our own ways were different people. We have learned hard and important lessons in the 30 years that have passed between us since the days surrounding your first walk along Highway 80."
A woman in a brown beret quietly said, "Amen."
"Those days were filled with passionate convictions and a magnified sense of purpose that imposed a feeling on us all that events of the day were bigger than any one individual," the speech continued in its borrowed voice. "Much has transpired since those days. A great deal has been lost and a great deal has been gained, and here we are. My message to you today is, Welcome to Montgomery.
"May your message be heard. May your lessons never be forgotten. May our history be always remembered."
The marchers applauded. For 10 years now, Mr. Wallace has admitted the wrongness of his deeds 30 years ago. Still, to many of the people who suffered at the hands of the law-enforcement officers he commanded, it was important that he said it on this symbolic day.
But 30 yards away, 58-year-old Rufus Vanable sat in the shade of a tall pine tree and refused to hear.
"I ain't even interested in what he's saying," said Mr. Vanable, a retired construction worker who was part of the march that was bloodied on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. "If you lived through it, you wouldn't be either. If he thinks this will ease his mind in some way, let him do it. I'm not interested in looking at his face. It brings back too many memories.
"Seeing him say that he's sorry ain't gonna do me no good at all."
Like many others in the crowd, he said Mr. Wallace, a religious man, was trying more to clear a path to heaven than to soothe the painful memories of others. He said that he held no malice for Mr. Wallace and that he even believed the former Governor had changed, "but it means a hell of a lot more to him that it does to me."
"He's trying to get right with his maker, that's what he's doing," Mr. Vanable said. "It was hell. Any man who'd sic dogs on a child. He ain't made up for it."
As the marchers sang "We Shall Overcome," Mr. Vanable sat under his tree and sang to himself. Mr. Wallace, lost in the crowd, never saw him, either.
Others were more forgiving.
"Thank you, for coming out of your sickness to meet us," said Joseph E. Lowery, the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and an organizer of that first march. "You are a different George Wallace today. We both serve a God who can make the desert bloom. We ask God's blessing on you."
The politics and economics of race are more complicated now, and the marchers, including the old survivors of meaner days, worry that the nation is going backward in its racial tolerance. They hear modern-day leaders blame blacks, because of crime and welfare, for what is wrong with America.
The marchers said they hoped those leaders were watching as George Wallace joined hands with them and bowed his head with them. It might be only symbolism, they said, but it was the right kind of symbolism.
"It's very important, in this day and time," said Gerri Perry, the principal at St. Jude. "It is important for people to see him, saying this.
"Back then, 30 years ago, I didn't think I would ever see anything like this."
What she saw was an old man wanting to set things right, for whatever reasons. The marchers did not ask him to be there. He asked them if they would give him a few minutes of their time.
He might be the only Alabama Governor to meet them. As of Friday afternoon, the marchers and Gov. Fob James, a Republican who ran on a conservative platform, had still not agreed to meet.
Instead, the marchers gathered around the man they had once hated. That old Wallace, the fiery judge who stood on the back of trucks and shouted, "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever," was nowhere around.
"He's been about to die for the last 10 years, and he's still living," Mr. Vanable said. "God's gonna make him pay."

HEADLINE: Space Station Insures a Future for Our Children;
The Inspiration Factor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was greatly disturbed by the tone of "Is NASA Among the Truly Needy?" (editorial, March 6). Growing up in Britain in the 60's and training as a scientist, I was particularly attracted to this country by the vigor of the space program. 
 You argue for the burial of the manned space program. Those of us determined to keep the dream alive can only hope and pray that the present lack of a manned mission to Mars via a base on the moon or a space station is only a temporary setback to mankind's space endeavors. An editorial calling for a Mars mission would have been more apt for the era we live in.
Overspending on defense during the 80's and the desire to preserve Social Security and Medicare at the present levels have created the need for short-term fiscal gratification, to which a vigorous manned and unmanned space program falls an easy victim. But the manned space program is an investment in our future:
First, developing the mineral and energy resources of our solar system will create great wealth for earth, stimulate the planet's economy and reduce environmental pollution, more than making up for any extra deficit produced now.
Second, if the modest shuttle program is killed, the expertise to create future space technologies will be lost and can only be recovered at great expense later.
Finally, the inspirational impact of space exploration upon humans' ability to foster creative potential in a way that can produce surprisingly rapid direct technological and social benefits must not be underestimated.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senators Would Kill 4 Agencies and Slash Benefits

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
The Senate's Republicans moved belatedly but forcefully into the debate on Federal spending cuts today, disclosing proposals to abolish four Cabinet departments and slice as much as half a trillion dollars over the next five years from the growth in entitlement programs like Medicare and farm subsidies.
This was the first concrete indication that Republican senators, like their House counterparts, intended to follow up on their repeated demands for a balanced Federal budget with an actual plan to achieve it. And it placed the political onus on the Senate's Democrats, who complained only Wednesday that Republican budget policy was all talk and no action. 
 But it did not guarantee, or even make more likely, that spending cuts would actually pass both houses of Congress. Some of the Republicans' ideas already face intense opposition from interest groups or the White House; others are couched only as suggestions, not legislative proposals, and their prospects are unclear.
All are now in the hands of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, who presented one of the ideas in a speech today.
Mr. Dole told newspaper executives that he favored eliminating the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Education, Commerce, and Energy. He would do away with some of their duties entirely, shift others to the states or private enterprise, and farm out whatever remained to other Federal offices. With 74,000 employees and annual budgets totaling $70 billion, he said, the departments are "overfunded, overstaffed and resoundingly unnecessary."
Mr. Dole, whose proposal was identical to one made last month by freshman Republicans in the House, called for eliminating the entire $3.6 billion budget of the Commerce Department and replacing public housing with vouchers that the needy could use to pay rent to private landlords. But he offered few hints as to which other duties would be killed altogether and which retained. Nor did he or aides say how much money his proposal would save.
Mr. Dole's speech did not address other budget elements. But other Republicans said he received from fellow Republican senators this week a draft of a plan to attack what most experts identify as the root of the deficit: spending on Federal benefits.
The draft was assembled by a group of senators led by Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire freshman whom Mr. Dole chose this winter to conduct a review of entitlement spending.
Senate leaders asked Mr. Gregg to cut the projected growth of the programs by $385 billion over five years. But his draft, now circulating in the Senate, goes further. It outlines as much as $495 billion in savings and suggests that Republican leaders meet their $385 billion goal by eliminating his least attractive proposals.
A final version of the Gregg report will be sent to the Senate Budget Committee to guide Republicans preparing an alternative to the five-year budget blueprint that the White House issued last month. But Republican officials indicated today that they expected few important changes in the report's recommendations.
The draft offers the most specific recommendations for major deficit reduction proposed so far by leaders of either party. They fall into five major areas.
One is health care. The draft would require Medicare beneficiaries to pay a fifth of the cost of home health care and laboratory tests, both of which are now fully covered. It would raise better-off retirees' premiums for Part B services, primarily physician care. In the longer term, it would also cut costs by giving retirees vouchers that they could use either to buy coverage from managed care organizations or pay their Medicare premiums; the beneficiaries could keep most of the savings.
Those changes, with an additional $20 billion that the Republicans take from White House budget proposals, would reap a total Medicare saving of at least $120 billion, the draft says.
Medicaid, the insurance system for the poor, would be shifted entirely to the states and financed by a Federal block grant that would grow by 4 percent a year. That would save $115 billion.
A second area of proposed cuts is welfare. The draft adopts Republican governors' plan to turn most Federal welfare services over to the states and finance them with block grants, saying this would save $40 billion. Supplemental Security Income, a fast-growing benefit for the disabled, would be "fundamentally reformed" to limit eligibility and costs, at a $22 billion saving. And the growth in the earned-income tax credit, which assists low-income working families, would be cut $27 billion, not only by eliminating fraud but also by closing loopholes that now prevent investment returns from being counted as income.
A third area is Federal pensions. The draft proposes applying cost-of-living increases only to the first $13,800 of annual Federal retirement benefits, the same level used to calculate increases in Social Security checks. The report also suggests increasing Federal workers' contributions to some pension accounts. Total saving: $17 billion.
A fourth proposal would revise the Consumer Price Index so that it reflected a lower rate of inflation. Since that index is used to calculate benefit increases in a range of Federal programs, the move would automatically cut Government expenses. The five-year saving, assuming an annual rate of inflation half a percentage point lower than the current index suggests, would total $64 billion.
Finally, the draft urges Congress to review and cut many of the 350 other entitlement programs, from a paring of farm subsidies -- a $15 billion saving -- to a two-week delay in mailing the first unemployment check to jobless workers, on the theory that most receive two weeks' severance pay. Total savings would amount to $50 billion.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A CLOSER LOOK: Proposed Cuts in Entitlements"
Recommendations to Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, from a commission charged with finding cut in various entitlement programs. If no cuts are made, spending on all entitlement programs (excluding Social Security) is projected to reach $3.2 trillion by 2000.
 
PROGRAM: Health care
CUTS OVER FIVE YEARS ($ BILLIONS): $255 to $275
SUMMARY: Medicare would give tghe elderly incentives to join lower-cost managed care plans and increase some premiums.
Medicaid would provide funds through block grants for states to use as they choose; woulf limit growth to 4 percent a year.
 
PROGRAM: Welfare
CUTS OVER FIVE YEARS ($ BILLIONS): $89
SUMMARY: Would give block grants to states for some programs; benefits would be denied to drug abusers, alcoholics and some categories of disabled people who the plan say are not "truly disabled."
 
PROGRAM: Federal pensions
CUTS OVER FIVE YEARS ($ BILLIONS): $17
SUMMARY: Would limit cost-of-living increases; would increase worker contributions to offset future increases.
 
PROGRAM: Other
CUTS OVER FIVE YEARS ($ BILLIONS): $50
SUMMARY: Recommends a review of all 350 other entitlement programs; cuts $15 billion from agriculture subsidies.
 
PROGRAM: Adjustments to calculations
CUTS OVER FIVE YEARS ($ BILLIONS): $64
SUMMARY: Recommends changes in the way the Consumer Price Index is calculated, pointing to Federal Reserve and Congressional Budget Office estimates that the index is overstated.
 
PROGRAM: Total
CUTS OVER FIVE YEARS ($ BILLIONS): $475 to $495
SUMMARY: Depends on cuts in health care.

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE TUMBLES TO 5.4% ON SURGE IN HIRING

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
An unexpectedly large number of Americans found new jobs in February, and the unemployment rate matched a four-year low by dropping three-tenths of a point, to 5.4 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
After a tumultuous week in the financial markets, as the dollar hit record lows against both the German mark and the Japanese yen before recovering somewhat, investors found something to cheer in the latest figures. Under the weight of a yearlong series of interest-rate increases engineered by the Federal Reserve, economic growth is finally showing signs of slowing to a pace that could help extend the expansion that began in 1991. 
 The jump last month in job creation might typically have led to a selloff in markets that are often unnerved by evidence of exuberant growth that could lead to higher inflation. But traders were encouraged to buy United States assets because the economy appeared to be growing fast enough to keep any threat of recession at bay.
After an initial drop, bond prices rose as traders and investors delved behind the early headlines that suggested a rebound in growth to find further signs of an economic slowdown and a lack of pressure to bolster wages. The Dow Jones industrial average soared more than 50 points to a record, and other stock indexes climbed as well on expectations that profits would remain strong. The dollar regained some of the ground it lost earlier this week.
The dollar, which was helped by Mexico's announcement of a new austerity package, got an extra lift as currency traders appeared to conclude that the Fed now had no reason to flirt with lowering rates to bolster the economy and might even lift them at least once more. The central bank has historically avoided raising rates solely to make the dollar more attractive to international investors. The American financial commitment to Mexico has been one of several factors depressing the dollar.
Most analysts saw good news in today's figures. "I just can't see inflation becoming a major problem, even with the decline of the dollar," said Mark P. Vitner, an economist with the First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C.
But others, including some Federal Reserve officials, saw more of a a mixed signal. "It just emphasizes the fact that it's very hard to read the tea leaves right now," said John P. LaWare, a member of the Federal Reserve Board. "There are parts of the economy that are soft and other parts that are doing well. This is another piece in the puzzle, and it's hard to fit them all together."
And William A. Brown, chief economist at J. P. Morgan & Company, said February's 318,000 jump in payroll jobs and upward revisions for December and January showed the economy still had considerable momentum. Yet most analysts said the Fed would probably pass up the chance to raise rates at its policy meeting on March 28, deferring action until later in the spring when it can better judge whether the economy is on track with a growth target of 2.5 percent or so.
President Clinton hailed the report as evidence that the Administration's economic strategy was working. "The fundamentals of this economy over all are healthier than they have been in a generation," he said at a news conference.
Dismissing critics who had predicted that tax increases would smother growth, the President boasted of the creation of 6.1 million jobs during his first two years in office. He took the opportunity to argue that a Republican tax-cut plan was too costly.
There was something for everyone in the February job report. While 318,000 new jobs were added to nonfarm payrolls, there were also some soft spots in the job market that provided reassurance to Wall Street that wages were still stable.
Unemployment fell almost everywhere, with the jobless rate dropping to 7.3 percent in California from an 8.2 percent rate in January. The rate was also lower than the 7.7 percent of December, suggesting that California, which accounts for nearly $1 of every $8 generated by the American economy, is clearly on the mend. Unemployment in Texas dropped to 5.1 percent from 5.8 percent in January.
Across the nation, average hourly earnings were unchanged last month at $11.31, the report showed, after spurting 6 cents in January. Wages are closely watched by investors and policy makers since they account for more than two-thirds of the average company's costs.
Moreover, the length of the private-sector workweek eased four-tenths of an hour, or 24 minutes, thereby more than erasing a sizable January increase. This caused a drop in the index of aggregate weekly hours, which skidded eight-tenths of a percent while the index for manufacturing was unchanged.
While factory jobs grew by 27,000, this was less than the 40,000-plus gains in each of the preceding four months.
The principal gains were in services, which advanced 191,000, the most in almost a year. Of this, 73,000 was in business services -- mostly temporary help and computer people, the Labor Department found.
The figures are adjusted for normal seasonal variations but are subject to wide swings when the weather is unusual.
Geographically, the South showed the most improvement last month; its jobless rate fell five-tenths of a point to 4.8 percent, the first time since 1979 the regional rate has been below 5 percent.
But unemployment also dipped two-tenths of a point, to 5.9 percent, in the Northeast, and three-tenths of a point, to 6.4 percent, in the West. The jobless rate in the Midwest was unchanged at 4.3 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S., Protesting Rights Abuses, Ends Military Aid to Guatemala

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
The Administration announced today that it was suspending the last of its small military aid to Guatemala. The decision came two days before an American woman plans a hunger strike in front of the White House to draw attention to the disappearance of her husband in Guatemala.
Administration officials acknowledged today that they were suspending the $200,000-a-year program partly in response to pressure from the woman, Jennifer Harbury. She is seeking the Administration's help to get information about her husband, a Guatemalan guerrilla leader believed to have been captured in 1992. 
 In a statement today, the State Department said it was suspending the program to protest what it called human rights abuses, and Guatemala's failure to turn over information about six killings and disappearances, including the case involving Ms. Harbury's husband. The five other cases also have American connections.
In 1990 the United States cut off most military assistance and all arms sales to Guatemala because of concerns about widespread rights abuses. Civil war has persisted in Guatemala for 40 years, and 100,000 people have died.
Ms. Harbury said in an interview today that she believed the military had held her husband in a secret prison and tortured him since he was captured in 1992.
Christine D. Shelly, a State Department spokeswoman, said "it is our considered assessment" that Ms. Harbury's husband, Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, "died in military custody in 1992 after a short but indeterminate period of detention and interrogation."
But Ms. Harbury said she was confident her husband was alive because several Guatemalans told her last fall when she conducted a hunger strike in Guatemala City that they had recently seen him alive, accompanied by several soldiers.
The Administration is seeking to prod the Guatemalan Government and the guerrillas to sign a peace agreement. Seeking to demonstrate its evenhandedness, the Administration also announced today that it would deny visas to guerrilla leaders to punish the movement for recent kidnappings and economic sabotage.
Despite the Administration's announcement, Ms. Harbury said she would begin her hunger strike on Sunday. "It's just a little step" by the State Department, she said, adding that she wants the Administration to cut off all aid to Guatemala.
Ms. Harbury, a Harvard Law School graduate who has written a book about Guatemala, said she would end her fast only when her husband is returned alive or when the Government there turns over his remains.
She fasted for a month in Guatemala City, and said she ended her fast when she was invited to meet with Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and other officials, who said they would help her. Disappointed by the Administration's response, she said she planned to resume her fast in front of the White House in an attempt to embarrass the Administration into applying more pressure on Guatemala.

HEADLINE: Cocaine's Reality, by Garcia Marquez

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: NEIVA, Colombia

 BODY:
Speaking with the wisdom of 67 years and the gravity befitting a Nobel Prize winner, Gabriel Garcia Marquez proposed a new solution for the eternal problem of his country's cocaine exports to the United States.
"All the money that Colombia invests in fighting drugs should be invested in the United States to research synthetic cocaine," the novelist said in an interview recently. 
 Elaborating on this theory, he said that just as outlaw American gardeners took the marijuana business away from Colombian growers in the 1980's, outlaw American chemists could take away the cocaine business from Colombian traffickers in the late 1990's.
While his suggestion is unlikely to find favor in Washington, it comes freighted with the weight of a revered man who is Colombia's unofficial spokesman.
Presidents come and go, but the owlish writer, universally known by his nickname, Gabo, endures. His novels stray from starched official history into the realm of earthy and magical tales. In Colombia's press, his blunt views routinely win wider audiences than cautious statements from diplomats and Government officials.
A day spent with Mr. Garcia Marquez quickly sketched the dimensions of the man.
At the airport in Cartagena, where he lives, travelers recognized the author in his black-rimmed glasses and repeated his nickname in awe. At a prison in Itagui, outside Medellin, three convicted cocaine traffickers known as the Ochoa brothers tripped over themselves vying for the honor of serving him lunch. At a barracks in Neiva, uniformed helicopter pilots from Colombia's anti-drug police ignored the national police commander and jostled for position in souvenir photos with the writer.
Steeped in the Latin world, Mr. Garcia Marquez speaks little English. He has residences in Cartagena, Mexico City, Barcelona and Paris. Once denied a United States visa because of his long friendship with Fidel Castro, the author patched things up somewhat last August at a dinner with President Clinton on Martha's Vineyard.
On a plane carrying him to Medellin for his meeting with the Ochoa brothers, Mr. Garcia Marquez gripped the arms of his seat -- he has a fear of flying -- and opened up.
"My worry is that the U.S. will use the fight against drug trafficking as a pretext for intervention," he said. "The drug problem has been presented in reverse. In the U.S., addicts supply themselves as easily as they buy milk or newspapers. And yet we are accused of not doing enough against drug trafficking."
Pausing to point out a swamp where a Colombian passenger jet crashed in January, Mr. Garcia Marquez said drug trafficking is deforming Colombian society.
"Drug traffickers taught people that they were stupid to work," said the man who grew up in a depressed banana-growing town. "The notion of easy money is Colombia's worst problem. Today a young man swallows some pills filled with cocaine with the idea that with one trip north, he can buy a house."
Because of an addiction to easy money, Colombia now leads the world in kidnappings, he said.
"We are down to quickie 'secuestros' -- someone grabs a woman for four hours, then lets her go for a million pesos," he said, a ransom equivalent to $1,250.
Where Washington conservatives and this friend of President Castro see eye to eye is expressed in his lament that impunity breeds disrespect for the law.
"I enjoy driving, but not here," he said. "These same Colombians who run red lights and block intersections in Bogota are well behaved in Miami. I know because I have been in their cars. When there is authority, Colombians behave."
Although they reach the belief from very different directions, Mr. Garcia Marquez and the Republicans newly in power in Congress agree that the United States should not be hasty in lifting the decades-old embargo on trade with Cuba.
"If the blockade is taken away, it will create quite a problem for Fidel because the Cuban people believe that all their problems will be solved once it is lifted," said Mr. Garcia Marquez, who regularly goes to Havana. "In Cuba the Government's big worry is to not let the process escape from their hands. The potential for violence from the Cubans in Miami is very great."
With European and Latin American investors now flocking to Cuba, the United States investment ban helps insure that Cuba will not revert to its 1950's status as an American economic colony, he said.
Updating an old Latin American taunt for a new era, Mr. Garcia Marquez said with ill-disguised glee, "As long at the blockade endures, the U.S. loses market share."

HEADLINE: Mexico's Plan Drives Peso Up 18%

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 10

 BODY:
Mexico's turbulent financial markets responded enthusiastically today to the economic recovery plan that the Government introduced on Thursday night, while ordinary Mexicans fumed over big price increases and higher sales taxes required by the tough measures.
 The peso, after declining for six straight days, rebounded strongly, gaining 18 percent over Thursday's level to close at 6.3 to the dollar. On Thursday, the peso had plummeted to 7.45 to the dollar, its lowest point since the currency was devalued in December. 
 Today, a peso was worth nearly 16 cents, compared with a little over 13 cents on Thursday, though well below the old level of 28.90 cents before the first stage of the devaluation on Dec. 20.
 Stock investors in Mexico City and New York also reacted positively to the harsh but realistic economic plan announced on Thursday night by Mexico's Finance Minister. The main Mexican stock-market index gained 3.31 percent, while in New York, American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, the phone monopoly, jumped $4.125 to close at $28.625 in trading of more than 22 million shares on the Big Board.
 Financial analysts, however, observed that in economic crises, the markets have several times reacted favorably to what were regarded as positive developments, only to turn around as new worries arose a few days later.
 In Washington today, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin and several other officials defended the Clinton Administration's $20 billion bailout plan for Mexico and warned Congress that interference with its execution would hamper efforts to restore investors' confidence in Mexico. The Mexican Government has already spent $3 billion of the United States loans and loan guarantees to defend the peso.
 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said he hoped that the plan would help Mexico recover. "The good news is that the markets have responded to it in a positive manner," he said.
 Mexican officials, while clearly satisfied with the way their economic plan has been received, were reluctant to consider today's market movements as positive signs, even preliminary ones.
 "All we're asking for now is a truce to show that this is going to work," said Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz, a principal author of the plan. He said he would fly to New York on Tuesday to meet with Wall Street investors and explain the severe austerity measures.
 "What I'd ask of them is to stop going short on Mexico," Mr. Ortiz said. "Let us get on with solving our problems."
 Several times during an interview, he said the new economic measures were bitter medicine that would cause a lot of pain as they restored a degree of stability to Mexico's badly battered financial markets. But there was no alternative, he said.
 Kenneth R. James, senior vice president of James Capel Emerging Markets Sales in New York, said that based on what he had seen of the economic plan, he was now more willing to give Mr. Ortiz the respite he was seeking.
 "Can I live with it?" he asked. "Absolutely."
 But Mexican businessmen expressed fear that the plan would bankrupt them, while labor leaders expressed a grudging willingness to restrain pay demands in order to keep their members working through an expected deep recession.
 Currency traders said the peso's surprising rebound today reflected greater confidence created by the economic steps. The Mexican stock exchange also recovered strongly, gaining nearly 51 points to close above 1,591, partly because investors saw the peso moving in the right direction.
 In its basic outlines, the economic emergency plan envisions that Mexico will end this year with a budget surplus. To create the surplus, the Government will cut its budget about 10 percent while increasing revenue through tax rises and higher prices for goods produced by some state-owned companies. As a result, Mexico will remain in recession throughout 1995.
 Mr. Ortiz said he hoped that the plan would reduce the country's reliance on imports, while sufficiently spurring exports that it would end 1995 with a trade surplus. Annual inflation is expected to reach 42 percent, while salaries for minimum-wage workers will go up 10 percent. Other contract wages will be negotiated between unions and employers without the constraint of Government guidelines.
 The Government did not raise either personal or corporate income taxes, as, according to rumors, it intended. It did, however, propose to increase to 15 percent, from 10 percent, the value-added tax, a broad-ranging national sales tax on goods at each stage of their production and distribution.
 Analysts saw the peso's sharp gain today as an indication that the economic plan could help stabilize the value of Mexico's currency even if it stopped short of fixing a new exchange rate. "We haven't had a day like this in a long time," said Jaime Campbell, a trader with C.B.I. brokerage in Mexico City. "They've diagnosed the illness and given the prescription; now we need to wait and see if it is the right prescription."
 The largest single price increase under the plan was levied on gasoline, which rose 35 percent at midnight Thursday. Further increases of eight-tenths of 1 percent a month through the rest of 1995 will mean a total rise of 48.5 percent. Before prices were raised last night, regular unleaded gasoline had cost about 75 cents a gallon. The increase brings the cost of a gallon of gas to $1.18, while the minimum wage will rise to $2.60 a day.
 "It's just not right," said Jesus Zavala, a salesman from Mexico City, who grumbled as he bought gasoline for his white Topaz. "With this Government, every day is worse. While prices are going up, our salaries are going down."
 Other Mexicans who woke up this morning to find that gasoline had gone up in price by one-third were similarly angry.
 "It's the worst time to raise the price of gasoline," said Salvador Soledad, 36, a toy salesman. "Everything is more difficult now, and then the Government raises prices. This is going to bring on discontent."

HEADLINE: At Issue in College Sit-In: Desire to Keep Studying

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: EAST ORANGE, N.J., March 10

 BODY:
It did not look like much of a protest, with about two dozen students scattered around a college library, cramming for midterm exams.
 But a glance at the clock showed that the time was 4:22 A.M. Under a new austerity schedule, the library was supposed to have closed for the night more than six hours earlier. And the students, holding their ground in perhaps one of the final battles to save Upsala College, were demanding nothing less radical than the right to study for another year. 
 "Even if they wanted to, they don't have enough security staff left to kick us out of here," said Darnell Grant, the student government president.
 At this point, the odds against Upsala, a tiny private institution with a massive debt, appear insurmountable. On March 3, the trustees voted to close the college at the end of May unless a fiscal miracle occurred. Despite a pervasive sense of futility on the campus here, students and a couple of sympathetic faculty members pulled one last all-nighter to bring attention to their school's plight -- and to reflect on some of the very difficult real-life lessons in politics, economics and sociology they are learning.
 "All the problems and statistics that students at other schools read about, we live them here," said Mr. Grant, a senior majoring in political science. "We know all about urban blight. We know all about the abandonment of cities."
 Students complain that the white-flight mentality that swept through Newark and surrounding towns after the 1967 riots spread to the school's pool of applicants and eventually to the college's board of trustees as enrollment gradually grew to more than two-thirds black and Hispanic. But even as they accused the trustees of betrayal, they spoke lovingly of the school itself and of faculty members who stubbornly refused to give up on them.
 "Even if the school closes, as long as I know that while I was here I struggled to keep it open, that to me is a great experience, fighting for my education," said Maritza Lozada, a 25-year-old political science major from Paterson, who helped organize the United Coalition to Save Upsala College. Ms. Lozada has taken to wearing black a lot lately -- "both to mourn the loss of the college, and because black represents the power of the people" -- and is trying to get her credits transferred to the Newark campus of Rutgers University.
 Mr. Grant, 22, who credited Upsala with transforming him from a tough freshman off the streets of Irvington into a future teacher with dreams of writing books, said he has also enjoyed fighting the good fight.
 "I'm not saying it's helping me complete my course work, but the struggle is so important it gives new meaning and direction to my studies," he said. "A lot of people take for granted that you have the right to go to class, that you have the right to go to the library."
 Andrea Tschemplik, a classical philosophy instructor who is also an Upsala alumna, said the school was small enough for faculty members and students to form unusually close ties. For years, enrollment hovered around a thousand, though it is now down to 435.
 "This place is so unique I feel like I have to do anything I can to keep it open," Ms. Tschemplik said, picking at a plate of Chinese food delivered to the library just after 3 A.M.
 Like many faculty members and students, Ms. Tschemplik has made great sacrifices to help keep the school running. Faculty members took a voluntary 40 percent cut in their already meager salaries at the beginning of the year, and most are now doing double duty as administrators. Ms. Tschemplik, who has seen her salary dwindle from $24,000 to less than $15,000, has been working 10 hours a week in the registrar's office, besides doing her teaching.
 Rodney Newby, 24, a senior in the communications department, has been working extra hours at the financial aid office to make sure students have their paperwork in order. He watched his 5-year-old nephew, Quran Justice, whose mother is also a student, running among the stacks this morning and said the boy was his inspiration.
 "I feel like if I don't help save an institution that gives, quote unquote, minorities the opportunity to attend school, what's going to happen to him?" said Mr. Newby, an Air Force veteran who managed video stores before going back to school. "I need to make sure he gets a chance."
 Mr. Newby, like the other students, was unfazed by the absence of response from school administrators to the sit-in, which had the approval of the library director.
 "Just because they're not here now doesn't mean they don't know I'm here. I have to be here."
 At a few minutes after 6, the last dozen students decided to call it a night, and Ms. Tschemplik walked across campus to her office to stare at the wall for a few hours before a faculty meeting aimed at producing an alternative to the trustees' bankruptcy plan, one that would keep Upsala open.
 "This has been an incredible night," she said. "The time I've spent with these kids, the stories they've told me, are things that will stay with me."
 Did she feel the protest was likely to have any effect on the school's future?
 "Probably not," she said. "You still need someone with a plan and with money."

HEADLINE: Stocks and Bonds Soar on Positive Jobs Report

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In the first big rally since the dollar began falling sharply this month, financial markets rose yesterday, with stock prices hitting record levels, bond prices moving higher and the dollar gaining against the German mark.
 The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 65 points and closed at a record 4,035.61, up 52.22 points. Other leading stock indexes exceeded or came close to records, too. Stocks from General Electric to Coca-Cola to Lotus Development all rose sharply on heavy New York Stock Exchange volume of 383 million shares. 
 The immediate cause that sent financial markets higher was a stronger-than-expected unemployment report yesterday that showed the February jobless rate in the United States falling to 5.4 percent from 5.7 percent in January.
 But traders cautioned that the rise might be short-lived. Fundamental factors, like the weak Mexican economy, may continue to drag down the dollar. A falling dollar adds to uncertainity and market volatility and makes stocks and bonds less attractive to foreign investors, a big source of investment capital for the United states.
 "I don't think the dollar has found its bottom yet," said David De Rosa, a currency trader at the Swiss Bank Corporation.
 And next week markets could be battered by important economic reports, like the February Consumer Price Index on Thursday, and special trading factors, like the expiration of quarterly options on Friday.
 Long-term interest rates fell as bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.46 percent, from 7.51. The dollar ended trading in New York at 90.90 yen, little changed from 91.02, and the dollar rose to 1.4155 German marks from 1.4035.
 A more stable financial market in Mexico may have also helped the dollar, at least for now. Mexican stocks and the peso soared as Mexico started receiving money under the Clinton Administration's aid package and the Mexican Government announced an economic austerity program.
 Only a few months ago, a report showing a drop in unemployment could have sent the stock market -- and probably other markets -- down sharply because falling unemployment is seen as a sign of rising inflation. Yesterday, while each market seemed to read something slightly different in the jobs data, traders and investors came to positive conclusions.
 For stock traders, the jobs report meant that a recession was less likely and that corporate earnings might continue to rise. "It was party time for Wall Street because the jobs report was good news for profits," said Todd Clark, managing director for equity trading at Mabon Securities.
 For bond traders, the fine print in the jobs report, like the hourly earnings and workweek data, was weaker than the headline decline in the jobless rate.
 At first, bond prices plunged in the morning for about 10 minutes after the release of the jobs data. "The headline sent us lower, but as the underlying data came out, the market shifted quickly because the jobs data was flattish rather than inflationary," said Barry Kirschner, a bond trader at Chase Securities.
 For currency traders, the jobs report meant that the Fed might now have to raise interest rates again, which could make the dollar more valuable for currency traders. An interest rate increase, however, might hurt stock and bond prices.
 Some currency traders, however, saw no effect at all from the jobs data, saying that short-term technical factors were responsible for the rise in the dollar. They pointed out that most of the rally in the dollar came in overnight trading in Europe before the jobs data were released here. The dollar jumped some more after the employment report, but then fell back. And it was no surprise that the dollar rose against the mark rather than the yen, Mr. De Rosa of the Swiss Bank said.
 The dollar-yen relationship is based mainly on the United States-Japan trade relationship and is strongly influenced by trading in the Tokyo time zone, Mr. De Rosa said. By contrast, the dollar-mark relationship is based mainly on liquidity in many countries in Europe and issues inside the European Union, and is also more influenced by round-the-clock trading.
 The Dow rose so quickly that "circuit breaker" rules, which are intended to slow high-speed computer-guided trading, were imposed. The Dow has now pushed past its old Feb. 24 record of 4,011.74. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 6.41 points to a record 489.57, exceeding the previous Feb. 24 record of 488.26.
 The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 5.98 points, to 802.22, close to its 1994 record of 803.93. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks closed at 256.01, up 1.22 points, still far from the old record of 271.08 on March 18, 1994.
 Advancing stocks substantially outnumbered declining stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,612 stocks rising in price and 675 falling in price. Sixty-one stocks hit new highs and 29 touched new lows.
 Telefonos de Mexico, the most heavily traded stock at 22.4 million shares, rose 4 1/8, to 28 5/8. American portfolio managers often buy or sell Telmex, the largest stock on the Mexican exchange, as a proxy for the entire Mexican stock market. Mexican and other Latin American stocks rose after Mexico received its first $3 billion installment under the international aid plan.
 Chicago and North Western Holdings, a rail carrier, rose 8 1/8, to 34 1/4, after Union Pacific bid $35 a share, or $1.2 billion, for the company. Union Pacific gained 7/8, to 51. Wabash National, a maker of truck trailers, rose 4, to 31 7/8, after management said profits were expected to meet analysts' higher projections.

HEADLINE: Brazil Currency Moves Spur Huge Rise in Latin Markets

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, March 10

 BODY:
The president of Brazil's central bank said today that the Government would defend the nation's currency at all costs and declared that speculative attacks against the Brazilian currency, the real, had failed.
 Officials moved early today to stop the outflow of foreign reserves by raising interest rates and limiting dollars that banks can hold in foreign-exchange operations. A series of measures caused the real to gain 2.7 percent against the dollar in early trading, and the main Sao Paulo stock market index to soar by 25.62 percent in a single day. 
 Other big Latin American stock markets also rose very sharply -- by 12.83 percent in Argentina, and 9.40 percent in Chile.
 The prices of Latin American bonds also jumped, led by gains in Brazilian debt. Closed-end funds in the United States that invest in Mexican and South American stocks rallied sharply, as well. The rebound was led by such issues as the Mexico Fund, the Mexico Equity and Income Fund, the Emerging Mexico Fund, the Brazil Fund, the Argentina Fund and the Latin American Discovery Fund. Their prices rose as much as 26 percent.
 The real later weakened, closing at 0.88050 to the dollar.
 The central bank chief, Persio Arida, said the bank would not yield "to any speculative attack against the real." The currency is the backbone of an anti-inflation program that in eight months has kept inflation under 2 percent a month, down from 45 percent before the real began circulating in July. Speculators tested the Government's will after the central bank moved on Monday to widen the trading range.
 The central bank said it would buy or sell dollars to keep the real at a rate of exchange between 86 and 90 centavos through April, and 86 to 98 centavos after May 2.
 Since the move came at a time of turmoil in Latin American financial markets, when it was unclear at what rate officials wanted the real to trade, speculators began testing the 90-centavo floor.
 "I don't have any doubt that the foreign-exchange measures are coherent with all the actions taken up to now," Mr. Arida said, referring to Monday's widening of the trading band.
 The immediate effect of the Government's measures today was that whoever bet against the real was hurt, said Gilson Schwartz, chief economist at Banco de Boston in Sao Paulo. "The Government waited, waited, and then released the measures at the right moment," Mr. Schwartz said, adding that the speculators would come out badly.
 The Government is thought to have spent $4 billion or more since it moved on Monday to widen the currency's trading range.
 Selling dollars to keep the real within the band may have been costly, Mr. Schwartz said. But the dollars the Government now buys back will be cheap. "It's fantastic," he said. "The Government will recover the reserves it lost and even make a profit."
 However, he said it would take time to see whether the measures will help improve investor confidence in Brazil and reverse a sharp slide in stock and bond prices in recent weeks.
 Today, officials raised interbank lending rates to 6 percent a month, from 4 percent on Thursday, to make the real more attractive than the dollar. It also plans to sell $10 billion in new debt indexed to the dollar.
 In a third series of measures, the central bank limited the positions that banks can hold in foreign-exchange operations to $1 million from $50 million.
 The measures put selling pressure on the dollar, said Roberto Luis Troster, chief economist at Banco Itamarati S.A., and as a result, "they now have to get rid of the dollars."

HEADLINE: Big Bank Expects Loss For Quarter

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The Bankers Trust New York Corporation announced yesterday that it expected to lose as much as $125 million after taxes in the first quarter of 1995.
 In a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the corporation, parent of the Bankers Trust Company, said that the losses would stem from two core businesses: trading for its own account, primarily in Latin America, and a slowdown in revenues from the controversial financial instruments widely known as derivatives. 
 Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from the value of underlying assets like stocks, currencies or commodities. Bankers Trust refers to them as risk management products.
 "The corporation has experienced losses in certain of its Latin America and other trading positions, as well as a sharp falloff in revenues from the sale of risk management products," Bankers Trust said in its 10-K filing. "The corporation cannot predict when the business environment will improve."
 Based on this announcement, Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed the long-term ratings of Bankers Trust under review for possible downgrade, affecting about $4.1 billion of securities. "The possibility of a first-quarter 1995 loss suggests that B.T.N.Y.'s businesses may have been impaired to a greater extent than anticipated in February," Moody's said.
 Raphael Soifer, a banking analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, said: "This year is going to turn into a rebuilding year for Bankers Trust. They are going to have to downsize the factory and restructure the business."
 On Thursday, rumors circulated on Wall Street that United States banks might face significant losses on their Latin American assets, particularly one major bank. Some bank stocks slipped that day -- including Bankers Trust, which fell 87.5 cents.
 Bankers Trust's stock rose $1.125 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $61.375. The report of the $125 million loss came out after the stock market closed. For the first three months of 1994, Bankers Trust reported a net profit of $164 million, or $1.90 a share.
 Four top Latin American traders and investment bankers left Bankers Trust for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette last month. Latin American markets have declined sharply in the wake of the devaluation of the Mexican peso in December and the financial crisis that has followed in that country.
 Bankers Trust has suffered a series of mishaps recently in the derivatives area, causing it to reclassify derivatives deals valued at $351 million as nonperforming loans. In December, it paid a $10 million fine to settle charges that it had hidden the extent of the losses from derivatives securities from one of one of its clients, Gibson Greetings Inc. It has also had public disputes over derivatives with other corporate customers, including the Procter & Gamble Company, which in February amended an earlier lawsuit against Bankers Trust seeking additional damages.
 "Derivatives were very slow for Bankers Trust in the first quarter," Mr. Soifer said. "It's not that clients aren't trading with them. But the type of trading being done is mainly plain vanilla and the dealer doesn't make much money on that."
 Bankers Trust said that the estimated $125 million loss did not include a possible charge in connection with its cost reduction program. On Tuesday, the company said that it cut 60 jobs, primarily in derivatives, as the first step in a plan to reduce expenses in 1995.

HEADLINE: Little Cheer in Jobs Data for New York Area

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
While declining national unemployment figures touched off joy in Washington and buoyed the stock markets yesterday, the celebration left New York City, New York State and New Jersey mainly on the outside looking in.
 The latest monthly unemployment figures left no doubt that if the national economy was heating up, the region was still feeling the effects of the recession's big chill. 
 "The region has certainly not participated fully in the recovery, not having gained back jobs lost during the downturn," said Anthony J. Ferrara, acting regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. "Hopefully, a growing national economy could eventually pull it along, which it hasn't done so far.
 "On the other hand, if it were to be cooled down -- and some people are talking about inducing a soft landing -- it could be a bumpy landing for New York and New Jersey."
 Connecticut is not among the 11 states for which the Labor Department provides separate figures when it releases national jobs data.
 While the national unemployment rate for February was put at 5.4 percent, a four-year low, the New York State rate stood at 6.1 percent, up from 6 percent in January but down from 7.8 percent a year earlier.
 New York City's rate climbed to 9 percent, from 7.7 in January, but it was below the rate a year earlier of 10 percent.
 Only New Jersey's rate dropped in February, to 6.1 percent from 7.2 percent in January. The rate in February 1994 was also 7.2 percent. While calling the New Jersey numbers "fairly positive," Mr. Ferrara cautioned against overreacting, saying that the figures might reflect not only a buildup of employment during December, with its holidays, but also an abnormally warm February.
 Nevertheless, Mr. Ferrara said, New Jersey added 78,000 jobs in February, for a growth rate of 2.2 percent. "That's certainly the best performance among states in the Northeast," he said.
 In comparison, Mr. Ferrara noted, New York State added only 56,500 jobs in the entire year from January 1994 to January 1995, the latest period for which data are available. "That's a minor growth rate of seven-tenths of a percent, which is the lowest among all states except Hawaii," he said.
 At the same time, he said, New York lost 15,000 manufacturing jobs. "And there again, only three states performed more poorly," Mr. Ferrara said, naming Connecticut, Delaware and Hawaii.

HEADLINE: Data on Credit Had Big Error

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve disclosed today that it had made a $ 4 billion "miscalculation" in its report earlier this week on January consumer credit, but it refused to say how the error happened.
 Consumer installment borrowing rose $ 7.645 billion in January, not $ 3.673 billion as the Fed first reported on Tuesday. The December increase of $ 6.554 billion was not revised. 
 "There was a misreading of a number," a Fed spokesman, Joseph Coyne, said. He declined to provide further details.
 Corrections of government figures of this size, while not unknown, are still rare.
 In addition to correcting the gain in consumer credit for January, the Fed also said the annual rate of credit growth was 10.1 percent -- not 4.8 percent as first reported. The error occurred in only one category and figures for previous months were not changed.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Jobs Data Push Dollar Up, With Fed Rate Rise Seen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies for a third day yesterday after a jobs report that was stronger than expected caused traders to speculate that the Federal Reserve would soon push interest rates higher again.
A rally in the Mexican peso also helped the dollar, traders said. The peso has been affecting the dollar recently because many investors are concerned that the United States has become a lender of last resort to Mexico. 
 The dollar also benefited from a big increase in American stock prices. Foreign investors need dollars to buy American securities.
After gaining in European trading, the dollar climbed further in the wake of a Labor Department report that the economy added 318,000 jobs in January, surpassing economists' expectations of a gain of 245,000.
"The very strong nonfarm payroll data is supporting the dollar, and the recovery of bonds is helping, too," Tom Hoge, corporate currency trader at the Bank of New York, said. "There is talk that these numbers will justify a Fed rate hike."
Higher interest rates often bolster a country's currency by making interest-bearing deposits in that country more attractive.
The dollar was last quoted at 1.4120 German marks, up from 1.4055 marks late Thursday in New York, and up from a record low of 1.3960 marks set Wednesday. It also stood at 90.90 yen, little changed from 91.02.
Traders said this week's negative sentiment toward the dollar stemmed from speculation that interest rates might have peaked, but today's jobs report makes that unlikely, they said.
Also, the concerns about Mexico eased, at least temporarily, after the Mexican Government disclosed an economic austerity plan late Thursday featuring spending cuts, sharp price increases for products like gasoline and electricity and higher taxes.
The peso rose from record lows against the dollar this morning. Its late quote was 16 cents, up from 13.42 cents late Thursday in New York.
The dollar gained against most currencies. The British pound fell to $1.57 from $1.6085 late Thursday in New York. The dollar rose to 1.1810 Swiss francs from 1.1725 and to 5.0455 French francs from 4.9705. The Canadian dollar was unchanged at 71.09 United States cents.

HEADLINE: Bonds Up Sharply Despite Jobs Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Bond prices rose strongly yesterday despite employment data that suggested the nation's economy was still growing at a pace that might justify caution about inflation.
 Traders instead focused on components of the Labor Department's employment report that showed little inflationary pressure. In addition, demand for bonds grew as the dollar performed better against other currencies, including both the Japanese yen and the German mark. 
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond finished up 19/32 point, or $5.94 for $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 7.46 percent, from 7.51 percent on Thursday.
 Some market analysts expressed surprise about the strength of Treasuries, which surged for a third straight day and finished near the week's high.
 "It's actually been a remarkable performance," said Joseph Liro, money market economist at S. G. Warburg. "What we have here is the dominance of bullishness on the notion the economy will slow down over the next few months so that any inflation we see will be fairly modest."
 Inflation erodes the value of fixed-length investments like bonds, causing traders always to watch for signs of it.
 The employment figures that were announced yesterday, showing a drop in unemployment during February to 5.4 percent from 5.7 percent, could have been expected to cause more worry than they did.
 Indeed, bond prices fell initially because the figures that were first reported suggested the economy was growing at a brisk pace.
 But as details emerged, market participants focused on data that showed average hourly earnings were unchanged and the length of the average workweek decreased.
 "If you pick through the number, it wasn't as strong as it looked," said Jim Kenney, head trader at Prudential Securities.
 In an unusual twist, currency traders took a different view of the employment data and ended up helping the bond market.
 The currency market saw a strong economy and inflationary pressure in the report and bid up the value of the dollar in the belief that the Fed would raise interest rates to curb inflation. Higher rates make the dollar more attractive to international investors, and that in turn makes dollar-denominated investments like bonds more attractive.
 Short-term Treasuries rose 1/32 point to 1/16 point and intermediate maturities rose 3/16 point to 13/32 point, the financial information service Telerate Inc. reported.
 The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, went up 0.24, to 1,205.53.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Flat European Sector Was Best Overseas

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
Although it's not saying much, Europe was the best of the overseas stock sectors last year. Its markets were flat over all, while markets elsewhere turned in losses.
 To make the list of top European funds for the last three years, managers had to cherry-pick stocks from many countries and industries. Foreign fund managers who use the top-down approach -- choosing countries that look promising, industries there and then specific stocks -- have had less success since the European exchange rate mechanism collapsed in 1992, leaving the Continent's economies less closely linked. 
 One way to profit in a flat market is to make bets on currencies. The top two Europe funds, from Dean Witter and Putnam, did just that, deciding not to hedge their currency risks in 1994. That meant their investments abroad gained in value as the dollar weakened.
 In its economic cycle, Europe may be several steps behind the United States, where markets were battered last year by rising interest rates after several strong years. "Europe tends to lag the U.S., so it's still in the early stages of its economic recovery," said Natalie Andrus, an analyst for Morningstar Inc.

HEADLINE: The World;
In Russia, Success Isn't Such a Popular Idea

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
IN the Moscow daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta, there is a list every month of Russia's most influential businessmen and women. But while American tycoons might kill to be listed in the Forbes 400, many Russian tycoons try to keep their names off the Nezavisimaya list. They can be killed for being on it.
 In the new Russia, success can be not only an ambiguous blessing but an actual danger. 
 The gangland hit carried out on the television executive and personality Vladislav Listyev stunned Russia. But the shock was more than just a response to crime, or to the death of a "god of the hearth," a personality who seemed like a friend to viewers.
 Mourners expressed shock at the lurid recklessness of the crime this month and the sheer vulnerability of someone so famous. They were struck again by the inability of even the successful to control their lives.
 In the development of a true market economy, already rocky in Russia, that is a deeply worrying psychological trend.
 The greatest victory of August 1991 -- when Russians beat back the attempted coup against Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and Boris N. Yeltsin emerged at the head of democrats and modernizers -- was the sense that ordinary people had finally seized some control over their destiny. It was a noted triumph of Russians over their own passive past.
 Such feelings persist and grow, especially in the young, but for those much past 45, the confidence has been short-lived. First, it was built on a myth -- in fact most Russians did nothing to stop the coup, which nearly succeeded. Second, and more important, political and economic mismanagement of reform have made Russia's path away from 70 years of repression more tortuous than it might have been.
 Even in strictly economic terms, the last, wasted year has been deeply dispiriting. In August 1994, inflation was down to 4 percent a month, the ruble was stable, investment was flowing, privatization was working, the new stock market was buoyant, hard currency was flowing back into the country, the budget deficit was being largely covered by treasury bills.
 Then the Government of Mr. Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the same Government that today promises monetary and fiscal rectitude, blew the budget on huge subsidies to agriculture, industry and many other sectors. An autumn of bingeing led to a flight of dollars, a collapsing ruble, a stagnant stock market and much-reduced investment. In January alone, the inflation rate was 17.8 percent.
 Any optimism among those laid off or working short shifts quickly died. Corruption, of course, continued, along with the usual apparatchik capitalism. And those foolish enough to have invested their rubles last summer in anything other than short-term ventures or the dollar once more lost a lot.
 Not only was a sense of confidence broken, but again there has been a kind of collective paranoia, a sense of dark forces at work, whether Western plotters or criminal ones.
 The disappointment is evident in a large opinion poll done by the European Union, involving interviews with nearly 19,000 people in 18 east European countries. Two of every three people in the fast-improving, former socialist economies of east and central Europe think the development of the free market, "largely free from state control," is the right path for their countries.

 
 
Not for Us
 In Russia, however, two-thirds of respondents believe that the free-market, small-state idea is wrong for Russia, and only 22 percent think it is right. Support for the market dropped 25 percent since the same poll a year earlier.
 In the meantime, Russian television pumps out glitzy advertisements for the good life, including a big dose of imported goods. While the advertisers are hardly crazy, and the number of "middle class" Russians is increasing, average Russians remain poor in a country where poverty is no longer a virtue, and in looking around them, they feel poorer than before.
 Hostility toward the rich remains strong; the ideology of good socialist egalitarianism was preached fairly convincingly, after all, for 70 years. Of course the party bosses lived well, but they did so discreetly.
 So success, in its modern vulgarity and show, is seen as evil by many, especially in a society where the gap is so wide. As a big Volvo or Mercedes Benz flashes along the pitted streets, splashing mud onto the proletariat, few Russians think, as an American might: great car, must be a rich guy, or a good businessman. Here, the immediate reaction is: that criminal!
 And often he, or she, is. Or started out that way. Not only because the nomenklatura could help themselves to the old state's assets. But also because many business dealings considered perfectly normal in the West, like selling at a profit, used to be criminal -- and many Russians feel they still ought to be.
 So success not only displays hubris, it becomes a kind of curse. As with Mr. Listyev, or even Vladimir Gusinsky, the very rich banker who owns a newspaper and a television station in Russia, success seems not to bring security or safety, only trouble.
 Mr. Gusinsky, in criticizing the attack on Chechnya and supporting the popular Moscow Mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, has crossed powerful Yeltsin loyalists. So despite his huge wealth and many bodyguards, Mr. Gusinsky finds it safer to stay abroad just now.
 In Russia, at least, he's simply been too successful for his own good.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS: Peekaboo;
Somewhere in the Picture There Is a President

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HE still has the planes, helicopters, codes, and enormous powers of life and death. His merest word can still move markets, if not mountains, and lately he has even begun to pick some fights.
 But in the wintry weeks since the Republicans took control of Congress, Bill Clinton has also been struggling to master a new national role: President as goalie, parrying the pucks that come skittling down Pennsylvania Avenue from Newt Gingrich. 
 Nowadays, the House Speaker's morning news conferences produce most of the words to watch, their texts transcribed by the wire services with an alacrity more often reserved for presidential pronouncements. And Mr. Clinton looks a bit like a president in a parliamentary democracy in which the prime minister has the real power.
 On Friday, Mr. Clinton took time to appear in the White House briefing room at 9:45 A.M., breaking into early-morning CNN airtime in vote-rich California to brag about a three-tenths of one percentage point decline in the February unemployment rate (and gamely heralding his own impending presence to reporters with the disembodied loudspeaker advisory normally delivered by an aide).

 
 
Taking On The Contract
 The President can easily cause a stir, particularly on foreign policy, as he did last week by allowing Gerry Adams, the political leader of the Irish Republican Army, to make his first fund-raising tour of the United States. But even when Mr. Clinton addresses an issue he helped elevate to national prominence, he tends to acknowledge the pre-eminence of the prevailing Republican oratory by inverting it.
 "I'm glad the Republicans chose to make welfare reform part of their Contract for America," he told the National Association of Counties last week, slightly mangling the rival manifesto that his aides mock as the Contract on America. "It's always been part of my contract with America."
 A few months out of the spotlight are not all bad for a President who suffered from overexposure for much of his first two years, and who can now hope to let the Republicans squabble, or stumble, at center stage as they face the prospect of cutting popular programs or fail to deliver on campaign promises during their first 100 days and beyond.

 
 
Avoiding the V-Word
 "We're not trying to compete with them on everything and drown them out," said the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry. "You have to use your bully pulpit very effectively, particularly because there's a competing microphone in town. That happens to be not only the reality we confront, but also a great opportunity."
 The White House staff is also relieved to have an open fight against clearly defined opponents, instead of suffering under the yoke of balky Democratic Congressional barons who sometimes made the President's life nearly as miserable.
 In recent weeks, Mr. Clinton has vowed to oppose or veto many proposals, from cuts in school lunch and national service programs to incursions on his foreign policy powers, from changes in liability law to efforts to reshape the provision in last year's crime bill providing Federal money to hire new police officers in the nation's cities.
 And he scored at least one victory, even if he was unwilling to seek it very aggressively or publicly: defeat of the balanced budget amendment in the Senate by a single vote.
 Indeed, Mr. Clinton is hoping that the Senate, with its majestic pace and arcane protections of minority-party rights, will be his sword and his shield, cutting down the harshest of the House's cuts and deflecting others.
 "I do think the Republicans ran on change in '94, got elected on it, are seen right now to be pushing for change and they've got the spotlight," the President's chief pollster, Stanley B. Greenberg, said last week. "But we're going to enter a period where you need the President's signature or you're going to have a President's veto."
 Harry S. Truman, a Clinton idol and the last Democratic President to face re-election with Republicans in control of Congress, played the strategy of "Just Say No" to the hilt, railing against the "do-nothing 80th Congress" at every opportunity.
But with the current crop of Republicans all too clearly "do-somethings," Mr. Greenberg says there are grave dangers for Mr. Clinton if he is seen as defending the status quo, as George Bush appeared to be doing against a Democratic Congress. Since the 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton's poll numbers have consistently been highest when he is perceived as moving ahead; when he seems stuck, lingering doubts about his character come to the fore.
 "I think the President has a very strong interest in legislation passing," Mr. Greenberg said. "I don't believe he benefits over the long term by gridlock. I think they have to find ways of passing welfare reform and other kinds of measures that enable the President at the end of his four years to say that the country, under this Administration, moved forward."

 
 
Giving In, Not Giving Up
 That helps explain Mr. Clinton's reluctance to use the V-word too often. The other risk, though, is that unless he makes his own priorities unflinchingly clear through constant repetition, he will be seen as too ready to compromise, one of the presumed faults that has dogged his entire career.
 "I think it's very important for the President to strike a clear course, particularly on New Democrat ideas like welfare reform and national service," said Al From, the executive director of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, which Mr. Clinton helped start as Governor of Arkansas. "I'd really like to see him step up. The President has one of the best ideas out there in his plan for worker retraining, and he ought to be out hammering that every day."
 In fact, Mr. Clinton took to the road with his plan for a "Middle Class Bill of Rights" of tax breaks for education and vouchers for worker training, but has had trouble winning attention for an initiative that even one White House aide mocked as "McBOR."
 It's not that the President has fallen from sight entirely. A study by S. Robert Lichter of the Center for Media and the Public Interest, a research group, found that after last November's elections, Mr. Gingrich and the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, combined, got a few more sound bites on nightly network television news than Mr. Clinton. The President's words were still featured a respectable 15.7 times a week through the end of the year, compared to 20 in the first 10 months of 1994.
 "But he's so much more reactive when he is visible that he is much diminished," Mr. Lichter said of the President. "It's another case of living and dying by the media. When Clinton came in, he got much heavier coverage than George Bush, in part because he personalized his Presidency to such a great degree. And now he's not the dominant personality in Washington."

THEY turned on the lights at the Tivoli Gardens last week and it wasn't even spring. Copenhagen wanted the 20,000 people attending the first World Summit for Social Development to get a glimpse of its most famous park, even if that meant bundling up against the cold. Tivoli's 100,000 twinkling colored lights added the right carnival atmosphere to the traveling United Nations global road show -- fresh from appearances in Cairo, Vienna and Rio. Barely six months from now, the caravan moves on to Beijing for the fourth international conference on women. Then it's Istanbul and Habitat II in 1996.
 In its 50th anniversary year, the United Nations and its Secretary General seem to be spending a lot of time and money away from home. The basic work product is the same: incremental agreements, offering something more than platitudes but something less than action. But amid the pomp and comedy of the traveling show something happens that is rare at the home office: national leaders get involved, if briefly, with the gritty details of economic, environmental and personal misery. 
 The bill for Copenhagen's Social Summit will be something between $30 million and $60 million. At least in Copenhagen the sensible Danes, who are bearing a lot of the cost, eschewed luxury. The Bella Center, an exhibition hall better appointed and scaled for fork-lift trucks than diplomats, was partitioned into spartan offices -- though public spaces were graced with pots of spring flowers, budding trees and a Tuborg beer kiosk around every corner. There was at least one metaphorical foot-stamping session high in the United Nations bureaucracy (where they know all about protocol) when it appeared that heads of state, not a few of them crowned, might have to sit on chairs without armrests.
 The United Nations is on the road in part because it doesn't get enough attention in New York. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said as much in an interview last week. "Between New York and Washington, we are passing through a terrible crisis of credibility of the United Nations," he said. "In all the United States you have total indifference, or a kind of negative indifference. But outside the United States we are able to obtain the presence of 120 countries for a subject which is quite complicated. The fact that we have 120 heads of state here to discuss it is such a success. It means support for the United Nations. It means that they believe in the United Nations, they trust the United Nations."
 Perhaps the penchant for summitry and international conferences also relates to the reality that getting anything done in the United Nations these days requires bumping up attendance to the level of people to whom other people pay attention.

 
 
Hit the Road, Jacques
 And so this global parliament on wheels and wings, complete with migrating flocks of staff, lobbyists from big businesses and small bands of advocates, is all but replacing the General Assembly as a forum for issues of international importance. In the cottage industry of books on United Nations reform appearing in this anniversary year, it is hard to find an expert with much good to say about the assembly, now that it has been largely orphaned with the death of big-power rivalry.
 Except for a few frantic weeks each fall when world leaders line up to speak from its podium, the General Assembly is a somnolent place where speeches from delegates with no power waft over empty seats. Here in Copenhagen there were packed press conferences every half hour on the margins of the Social Summit. In New York, energy crackles around the 15-member Security Council, which now drives the United Nations system, to the annoyance of many of the 185 member nations whose delegates never get inside its doors. The council has no time for fuzzy issues of economic and social change; it is preoccupied with peacekeeping and sanctions.
 "High among the changes that should mark the 50th anniversary of the U.N. is the revitalization of the General Assembly as a forum of the world's states," says the most authoritative of the new books advocating change, "Our Global Neighborhood," a report by a panel of international leaders, the Commission on Global Governance. The commission also recommends establishing an Economic Security Council to take on the new problems of the world economy, now that many countries are painfully shifting to the free market, along with issues like trade and unemployment. Such a council might also be useful, its proponents say, in overseeing the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which have replaced the United States as the prime target of attack by the developing world because of their power over national policies.
 But as anyone who has spent any time in United Nations headquarters knows, any reform is very far away. So the world gets summits.

 
 
Really Bazaar
 Or one long summit. "We should not take this conference as such per se," said the Secretary General. "There is a series of conferences, a continuum. And this continuum is important."
 When the journey that began in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro with the Earth Summit finally ends in Istanbul in June 1996 with a gathering on the world's overcrowded cities, the United Nations will have considered human rights (Vienna, 1993), population (Cairo, 1994) and women's rights (Beijing, September, 1995). Together, these meetings -- not all strictly summits (meaning intended for heads of state) -- will have taken a kaleidoscopic look at the human condition on the eve of the new century. In theory, the aim is to encourage national policy changes, over which the United Nations has little influence, to meet new problems.
 The Social Summit was not only necessary but overdue, says Denmark's Prime Minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, when critics ask him: What's the point? Danish newspapers have been unsparing this week, using words like "charade" and "flop" to describe events. "Why are we here?" asked Mr. Rasmussen, a Social Democrat. "We are here to discuss the heart of all political work: to try to make better daily lives for millions and millions of people. We are here because it is a fact of life for politics that no nation now can solve all its problems in economics and welfare alone."
 Yogesh Varhade agrees, though he did not get a chance to tell the Prime Minister. In worn shoes and a thin suit, pulling a case of documents on luggage wheels behind him, he walked the carpeted corridors of the conference center and the chilly, muddy byways of the N.G.O. Forum, a parallel meeting of nongovermental organizations several miles away.
 There, in at atmosphere that is half bazaar and half Speaker's Corner, thousands like him, on too tight a budget to buy lunch at Danish prices, have set up booths or found corners to distribute homemade tracts and pamphlets alerting those more powerful to the injustices they feel.
 Mr. Varhade, a technician who lives in Canada, was born an untouchable in India. All last week -- while Zapatistas and the Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin were getting a lot of attention, he was politely nagging one powerful delegation after another, asking for a few minutes to talk about the quarter of a billion people he says live in misery in his homeland. He got credentials to the N.G.O. Forum -- and thus access to the summit site -- as the president of the Ambedkar Center for Justice and Peace, named for Bhimrao Ambedkar, an untouchable who wrote India's constitution.

 
 
Reach Out, Touch an Untouchable
 There were down days when nobody would listen to Mr. Varhade. "And they call it a summit on social development," he complained. "I don't understand." But there were days when he scored, and got to shake a famous hand or two and leave behind a message. His goal in life is to put outcastes on some important person's agenda, and only at a free-form event like this does he feel he gets a shot. He would never get to penetrate the bureaucracy at United Nations headquarters.
 Coming to the Social Summit, he said, has put him in touch with many people like him who are beginning to form a loose network of the global neediest, a new lobby. "I may not win this year," he said. "But someday I will."

Back to the Thrilling Trades of Yesteryear

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE laying of the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable in 1866 did not just allow people to send last-minute birthday greetings or pleas for cash. The cable let them move money from New York to London and back in a few minutes, instead of waiting for steamships to make the 12-day crossing. 
 More than a century later, communications are only slightly faster but governments are still struggling to cope with the problems that have accompanied the high-speed international financial deals that the cable made possible. These deals have, in the last few weeks, swamped the dollar, sunk the Mexican peso, wrecked a 232-year-old British bank and pushed the Clinton Administration to propose lifting Depression-era American banking regulations.

 
 
Capitalist Tools
 The swift transactions permitted by the undersea cable helped generate a surge of worldwide financial and economic ties that peaked on the eve of World War I. Two world wars, the Great Depression and the massive confiscation of foreign investments that accompanied the rise of Communism and the decline of colonialism all combined to reverse the trend for several decades. But during the 1970's, most controls on the movement of money across national borders were phased out. Capitalism is once again tying more and more countries more and more tightly together.
 "To a significant extent, the industrialized nations of the world only recently reattained the levels of economic integration that they had reached at the eve of World War I," said Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, in a speech last week. "And a great deal of what we have been witnessing since 1950 is simply getting the world back to the level of integration that had been achieved in 1914."
 Yet the financial ties of today are still a pale shadow of the links that spanned the globe at the start of this century. The billions of dollars that now slosh from country to country at the touch of a button are not as big -- compared to the size of the economies involved -- as the immense flow of money among countries before 1914, Mr. Blinder noted.
 Massive Japanese investments in everything from air-conditioner factories in Malaysia to car assembly lines in Tennessee are overshadowed by the scale of British overseas investment a century ago. During the four decades preceding World War I, The British invested a quarter of their savings overseas, mainly in railroads and mines in their colonies and in the United States. By contrast, Japanese companies and individuals created fears here that they were "buying America," when they invested 10 percent of their savings outside Japan during the 1980's. Japan's foreign investment has slowed since then.
 Last month Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin called for legislation permitting American commercial banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge with each other and with foreign financial companies. The goal is to make this country's financial companies more competitive in the world. Such alliances were common before World War I, when currencies were converted easily into gold, enabling big financial institutions to move money among banking, securities and industrial ventures worldwide.
 Two weeks ago Barings P.L.C., the 232-year-old British investment bank, failed because of poor bets in Singapore on the direction of the Japanese stock market. Yet in 1890 the Bank of England had to rescue Barings after a wrong bet on the prices of bonds in Argentina. And Singapore is 152 miles closer to London than Argentina is.
 The remarkably steep decline of Mexico's currency and economy in the last several months, after foreign investors pulled out their money in response to its chronic trade deficits and political instability, has parallels in the 1870's. Then, it was the United States that depended on foreign investment money, particularly funds to construct transcontinental railroads.
 The collapse of the biggest American investment bank, J. Cooke & Company, in 1873 stopped British bankers from investing in this country. Railroad construction, which had employed a tenth of the American non-farm work force, almost ground to a halt during the six-year recession that followed.

 
 
Deja Vu, Again
 The dollar ran into trouble in the early 1890's when many wealthy Americans, frightened by a surge of populism, transferred their money to London. President Grover Cleveland rescued the dollar partly by raising interest rates -- a strategy that Alan Greenspan hinted at on Wednesday.
 To be sure, computerization accelerated international financial dealings somewhat since the days of telegraph cables. And when markets move especially swiftly, governments find it hard to respond.
 "The markets move so fast that you can't fly everybody to Washington fast enough to solve the problem," said Barry Eichengreen, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
 A broader question is whether close economic and financial ties make countries less likely to fight wars.
 Lawrence Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, contended in a speech early this month that such ties were the best way to avoid conflict. "I think you will find that successful economic growth and economic integration is the best way mankind has yet found to produce stability," he said.
 While many political scientists and economists agree, the argument is familiar. A British author, Sir Norman Angell, wrote early in this century that the economies of Europe's great powers had become so interdependent that war was impossible.
 His book appeared in 1910, four years before World War I broke out.

HEADLINE: ACCORD MAY LET U.N. PEACEKEEPERS REMAIN IN CROATIA

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
Western allies have struck a tentative deal with Croatia to allow a sharply reduced contingent of United Nations peacekeepers to remain in the country, senior Administration officials said today.
Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, had threatened to have the 12,000 troops leave after their mandate expired on March 31. United States and European officials worry that a pullout would require the help of tens of thousands of NATO troops, paralyze peacekeeping in neighboring Bosnia and cause the war to spread to other former Yugoslav republics. 
 In return for dropping his threat, Mr. Tudjman won a promise that the current United Nations contingent in Croatia will be replaced by a force of 5,000 to 6,000 soldiers, about 10 percent of whom would guard border crossings into Bosnia and Serbia.
The officials said they hoped that Mr. Tudjman would announce his decision on Sunday at a meeting with Vice President Al Gore in Copenhagen, where they are attending a United Nations conference on social development. But they acknowledged that the agreement could still collapse over details.
"It's fair to say Tudjman will announce on Sunday that the peacekeepers can stay, but in dealing with the Balkans you always worry that things can still go wrong," a senior American diplomat said.
United Nations peacekeepers were placed between Government forces and rebel Serbs in Croatia in early 1992, after a devastating six-month war in which 10,000 people were killed.
Mr. Tudjman has complained that the peacekeepers have since shirked their mandate to disarm the Serbs and have in effect consolidated the Serbs' control over some 30 percent of his country.
But the United States and several European nations have warned Mr. Tudjman that his call to expel the 12,000 peacekeepers could not only set off a new war in Croatia but also worsen the conflict in Bosnia, where hopes of brokering an accord between the Muslim-led Government and rebel Serbs have all but evaporated.
The Serbs in both Croatia and Bosnia are allied, and Croatia's Government has formed military links with Bosnia's Muslims just as the spring fighting season is approaching. An already shaky cease-fire expires in Bosnia on May 1. Diplomats fear that the hostilities could ignite tensions in neighboring Macedonia and in the predominantly Muslim region of Kosovo in Serbia.
Under the tentative deal, which had been pushed by the United States and Germany, most of the remaining United Nations troops in Croatia would be deployed along a 1,000-mile cease-fire line that separates Croatian Government troops and Serbs.
But bowing to demands from Mr. Tudjman, the plan would station more than 500 peacekeepers at two dozen border crossings along the Sava and Danube Rivers that connect Croatia with Serbia and Bosnia.
Mr. Tudjman had wanted the peacekeeping troops moved to Croatia's international borders in part to show that the United Nations would help safeguard Croatia's territorial integrity and would not permanently divide his country.
"For Tudjman this plan is important because it is a departure from the status quo and ends the creeping Cyprus-ization of his country," said a senior American official, in a reference to the Mediterranean island nation that has been divided for decades between Turkish and Greek sides.
President Tudjman appears to have changed his mind about a United Nations withdrawal after an intense burst of diplomacy this week. After Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke visited Zagreb, the Croatian capital, on Monday, Croatian officials began hinting that they were weighing an American-backed proposal to keep a scaled-down international force in the country.
In two meetings with Mr. Tudjman in the Presidential Palace above Zagreb, Mr. Holbrooke sought to sell the plan and to impress upon the Croatian leader that Washington feared a catastrophe if the peacekeepers were withdrawn.
For the United States, a major concern is that withdrawing United Nations troops from Croatia would cut off supply lines to the 23,000 United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia and ultimately force their withdrawal as well, raising the prospect of a wider war.
"Tudjman is very eager to have his country integrated into the West," an American diplomat said. "We were sending signals that we would help him do this, but that this wouldn't be possible if he took a dangerous step that we were trying to avoid."
On Thursday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher called Mr. Tudjman from the Middle East and secured his basic commitment to the reconfigured peacekeeping force, State Department officials said.
Mr. Tudjman was also offered economic aid in the form of an international program to assist the loose confederation that Bosnia and Croatia formed last year.
American officials said that even after Mr. Tudjman accepted their plan, a loose end remained: whether the Serbs in Croatia would go along with it. Peter W. Galbraith, the American Ambassador to Croatia, was sent to the Serb-held city of Knin to get the Serbs' tacit assent, State Department officials said.
On the one hand, the Serbs feared that a withdrawal of peacekeepers from the demilitarized zone in Croatia would enable Croatian Government forces to open an offensive. On the other hand, they feared that placing peacekeepers at border crossings might make it harder for them to obtain supplies from Serbia and Serb-held areas in Bosnia.
"The Croatian Serbs are the wild card at this point," a State Department official said. "They should recognize this plan is in their interest because without it, they just might get overrun by Croatian forces."
In recent days, Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, has been working with France, Britain, Germany and Russia on a draft Security Council resolution authorizing the reconfigured peacekeeping force. The Croatian Government considers the existing United Nations Protection Force in Croatia to be discredited. The resolution would therefore disband it and authorize a new one.
Mr. Tudjman originally wanted NATO forces to replace the United Nations peacekeepers, partly because he believes that they would be more effective. The United States and its European allies rejected that proposal. But to win the Croatian President's support, they agreed that most of the reconfigured United Nations force would be made up of peacekeepers from Western nations.
Because Croatia and the Serbian rebels seem poised to approve the plan, Administration officials said they did not believe that NATO forces would be needed to protect the several thousand peacekeepers who would be withdrawn from Croatia as the United Nations shrinks its force there.
The United Nations remains concerned that peacekeepers at the border crossings could be attacked or taken hostage by the Serbs, since the forces will be placed between Serbian troops in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia.
Although some European nations are pushing for the United Nations force to exceed 6,000 troops, several American officials said they were confident that 5,000 to 6,000 would be enough to keep the peace in Croatia.
Indeed, several officials said the several thousand peacekeepers who are in territory controlled by the Serbs do less to keep the peace than they do to prop up the economy there.

HEADLINE: Since '81, Experts Warned of Problem In Ice Flight Rules

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG and ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Weeks before an ATR-72 flew into freezing drizzle and crashed near Roselawn, Ind., the nation's top aviation safety official seemingly put to rest a decade-long debate, declaring there was no need to require that planes be better equipped for such weather.
David R. Hinson, the Federal Aviation Administrator, wrote in a letter to the National Transportation Safety Board in September 1994 that his agency had underwritten more than 10 years of research on the subject. "None of this work has established the foundation or justification," he said, to change the existing standards, which require manufacturers to design planes that can fly through small water droplets, not the larger droplets of freezing drizzle or freezing rain. 
 The crash last Oct. 31 of American Eagle Flight 4184 in Indiana prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to change its views. It began testing airplanes for the effects of much larger water droplets than are covered in the existing rules.
Thirteen years of correspondence between the F.A.A. and the safety board over this issue, released by the board in response to a request by The New York Times, make clear for the first time that some Federal safety experts were pushing to toughen the icing standards years before the Roselawn crash.
The accident, the first in the United States involving a modern turboprop airplane, prompted the F.A.A. to undertake an intense review of the ATR's capabilities in icy conditions. By December, agency officials were persuaded that the water droplets of freezing drizzle, about five times larger than the droplets specified by the existing standards, could cause dangerous ice shapes to build up on the plane's wings.
But the correspondence shows that the safety board had been raising questions about freezing drizzle since 1981, when it recommended that the F.A.A. revise its standards. The board asserted in 1983 that "a safety problem exists" because freezing rain and freezing drizzle were much less rare conditions than had previously been thought.
An investigation by The Times concluded last month that the Roselawn crash did not have to happen. The investigation found that the F.A.A. had brushed aside warnings from pilots, experts and the behavior of the plane itself that indicated something was awry with the plane's performance in some icy conditions.
At the recent safety board hearings on the crash, the plane's manufacturer acknowledged that it had missed chances to detect the underlying cause of the plane's sensitivity to icy conditions. But company officials insisted that their plane met and exceeded American standards.
Soon after the Roselawn crash, the F.A.A. said it would test all other airplanes to see if they had a similar vulnerability; officials expect most planes operating in this country to get a passing grade. The company that manufactures the ATR believes that it can fix the problem by increasing the size of the de-icing system on the wing's leading edge, at a cost of $20,000 per plane.
 
 
In 1981, F.A.A. Focused on Cost
 According to the recently released documents, the F.A.A., in its initial response to the safety board in 1981, insisted it would be "excessively penalizing and economically prohibitive" to design airplanes to cope with "freezing rain, freezing drizzle" and other such conditions, which it said occurred infrequently. Later, the agency said there had not been enough accidents to justify new rules. It declared in a letter to an Italian official in the late 1980's that freezing rain was "predictable, recognizable and avoidable."
The existing standards contemplate cloud-borne water droplets no larger than about half the diameter of a human hair. Freezing drizzle is 4 to 10 times larger, and freezing rain is at least 20 times larger.
The safety board, an independent agency that investigates accidents, makes its recommendations without regard to cost. By law, the F.A.A. is charged with promoting the aviation industry and regulating aviation safety. When it issues rules, the benefits must outweigh the costs to the industry. The F.A.A. has broad powers to require manufacturers to fix any unsafe conditions in planes flying in the United States.
Anthony J. Broderick, the F.A.A.'s associate administrator for regulation and certification, responded on behalf of the agency. Mr. Broderick said in an interview this week that the F.A.A., in retrospect, had "messed up" in its initial testing of the plane by not considering the effect of large droplets. It is now clear, he said, that freezing drizzle can flow past the leading edge of the wing and build up in areas behind the plane's de-icing system. But he insisted, as he had in previous interviews, that it was only after the crash in Roselawn that the agency had any reason to suspect this.
"Fifteen years ago, we didn't have the data point we do now," he said, referring to the deeper understanding of freezing drizzle that resulted from the Roselawn accident. "Fifteen years ago, if you said this to people, they would have looked at you as if you were from another planet. Nobody knew about this then."
The correspondence between the F.A.A. and the safety board on this issue, as well as internal F.A.A. documents made public at the hearings on the crash, calls that assertion into question.
 
 
Concerns Raised About Drizzle
 Contrary to the F.A.A.'s view that "none" of the research provided a basis for changing the standards, the documents made public at the hearings show that F.A.A.-sponsored scientists were raising concerns in the late 1980's about precisely the sort of freezing drizzle conditions that caused the Roselawn crash. Drizzle droplets, they had theorized, were actually more dangerous than the larger freezing rain droplets because they were of a size and shape that could most effectively build up on aerodynamically sensitive parts of the wings.
Mr. Broderick said that none of the scientists' papers explicitly called for the rules to be rewritten, or said how that could be done. The F.A.A.'s last icing expert retired in 1989. He has not been replaced, and Mr. Broderick complained in an earlier interview that the research underwritten by his agency had been "diffuse, and that's a polite word."
Mr. Broderick said that overall the icing rules had proved adequate over decades of experience, and that there had been relatively few in-flight accidents or incidents traced to ice in recent years.
"Icing was not a high priority, and as a matter of fact, we made conscious decisions somewhere in the late 1980's, early 1990's to actually reduce funding," he said. This, he added, was because the F.A.A. had not filled the expert's post and thus did not have anyone "driving this program to a clear conclusion."
The safety board began raising questions about the icing standards in 1981 when it issued a study suggesting that the larger droplet sizes were more of a threat than had been previously suspected. The study said that freezing rain had been implicated in as many as 28 percent of icing accidents involving small planes. That, the board insisted, proved that such conditions were not as rare as were indicated in the existing standards. It recommended that the F.A.A. study the issue and make changes "as necessary."
The agency immediately rebuffed that suggestion. The safety board stood its ground, insisting in a 1982 letter that "operations in freezing rain, freezing drizzle, and mixed conditions occur often enough to warrant their inclusion in the certification criteria, especially considering their hazardous nature."
After four years of differences with the safety board, the F.A.A. finally agreed to consider incorporating freezing rain and freezing drizzle into the standards and do further research on the subject. In 1989 the agency said that its research was well under way, and that it would decide what to do by 1991.
In 1990 the safety board complained to the F.A.A. that although "a vast amount" of research had been done, the agency had still not addressed the issue. The board received no response. And in a 1993 meeting with the F.A.A., board officials asked that the icing recommendation, among others, be resolved one way or another.
Mr. Hinson, the F.A.A. chief, responded to that request with his September 1994 letter.
At no time did the safety board include the icing recommendation among its list of "Ten Most Wanted" safety requests, one of its main means of publicizing recommendations that regulatory agencies are rebuffing.
 
 
Signs of Trouble Are Picked Up
 Even as the F.A.A.'s meteorological experts were disputing the need for tougher rules in the 1980's, officials in other segments of the bureaucratically divided agency were picking up signs of the ATR's particular vulnerability to ice in conditions more severe than those covered by the existing rules.
In a March 1989 memorandum made public for the first time at the safety board hearings, an F.A.A. official wrote that a smaller, similar model plane, the ATR-42, had been "plagued by a series of incidents relating to its apparent inability to carry ice or at least perform reliably in icing conditions."
The official, James McDonald of the agency's Aircraft Evaluation Group in Seattle, accurately described what is now the consensus view of the plane's problem: Ice on the wings distorted the airflow, causing the controls to move on their own and bank the plane to one side.
Mr. McDonald theorized that ice built up on the wings, distorting the airflow. For a time the plane's autopilot could compensate. But when the force grew too great, the autopilot would snap off and the plane would bank sharply to one side.
"Pragmatically we feel that the design of the wing has been the singular problem," Mr. McDonald continued. "It has been our observation on line operations that this wing is very efficient, and it follows that any distortion of airflow would be extremely disruptive. Operators and the industry as a whole are used to operating aircraft of the size and general type of the ATR-42 with thick heavy airfoils that will carry a 'ton of ice.' This wing will not."
The 1989 memorandum pointed to the most recent, and most serious incident to that time, in which an ATR-42 banked to an 80-degree angle, nearly perpendicular to the ground, while on approach to Mosinee, Wis. According to the memorandum, the French-Italian consortium that makes the plane, Avions de Transport Regional, blamed this incident on flight into freezing rain conditions beyond those covered by the existing rules on icing.
The F.A.A. did no tests to reproduce this effect, as it did after the accident in Roselawn. Nor did it try to find out precisely what sort of droplet sizes might cause the effect. Instead, officials accepted the manufacturer's argument that the problem would be solved by the addition of credit-card sized pieces of metal to the wing that would channel the flow of air over the wings.
Freezing rain had also been implicated in the previous fatal accident involving the ATR, an October 1987 crash of a flight from Milan, Italy, to Cologne, Germany.
A team of experts assembled by an Italian prosecutor eventually concluded that these conditions were indeed beyond the existing European and American rules. Such conditions, their report said, are quite common in Italy in fall and spring, and were thus a threat to aircraft of similar design.
No one at the F.A.A. or the safety board ever obtained a copy of this report at the time. But officials at the F.A.A. were aware of the controversy in Italy over the accident. In 1988, the agency received a telephone call from Vittorio Fiorini, director of engineering at the Italian civil aviation authority, who was under criminal investigation for his role in certifying the safety of the ATR.
In response, the F.A.A. wrote back that it had never considered flight into such conditions to be a "reasonable" criteria for airplane design. It would be "impractical" to protect an entire airplane from freezing rain, the agency said. "The accepted practice of the aviation community," the letter said, "is to avoid operation in freezing rain or freezing drizzle conditions."

HEADLINE: Innovative Plans Fill Pulpits In America's Rural Churches

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: BINFORD, N.D., March 5

 BODY:
The Rev. Eric J. Hulstrand, a slim young man with an engaging manner, figures he will put 20,000 miles on his four-wheel-drive Suzuki Sidekick driving to church this year.
The Lutheran pastor does not travel a simple road between home and pulpit, but a long, looping circuit over a web of rural blacktop that bisects endless miles of farmland in the eastern part of the state. Mr. Hulstrand serves eight small congregations in three counties, a duty he shares with one other full-time and equally peripatetic minister and a pair of part-timers, one of them his wife, Pam. 
 Say "circuit rider" and, chances are, it will conjure up a worn sepia image of a black-coated man on horseback, a Bible in his saddlebag.
The picture is outdated, as Mr. Hulstrand can attest, but the job is taking on new life, the result of large-scale changes afoot in the nation's major denominations. In rural America, there have always been small churches that shared a pastor. But these days, denominational leaders increasingly speak of more churches forced by necessity to experiment with ministries in a way that is far removed from the traditional ideal of one pastor serving one congregation.
These experiments involve training lay people in ministerial duties, sometimes with a visiting minister or priest acting as mentor; creating "yoked" churches, with two or more congregations served by an itinerant minister, or trying some combination of both concepts.
"Among all the denominational leaders I talk with," said John Bennett of the Missouri School of Religion Center for Rural Ministry, "I think there is a readiness and an openness to consider a variety of models in this part of the country."
Indeed, Mr. Bennett said the Presbyterian Church (USA) recently produced a document listing 17 "pastoral options" for small churches, in addition to the traditional model of a single full-time pastor. Increasingly, he said, churches "look to lay ministry, yoked ministry."
There are no statistics to measure the extent to which such forms of ministry have grown, but Protestant officials say that economics, more than any other factor, has fueled them. Small church budgets, they say, cannot meet the rising cost of having a full-time minister.
"To support a pastor in ministry in the United Methodist Church, you're talking about a $45,000 to $50,000 salary package," said Robert Kohler, the director of the denomination's division of ordained ministry.
Mr. Kohler said that the Methodists were "using more and more lay people with special training in ministry" to keep small congregations alive. Sometimes, lay ministers work with members of the clergy who may specialize in religious education or youth ministry. "It creates a team approach to ministry," he said.
Among Roman Catholics, a declining number of priests has meant that more priests who serve in rural areas have taken on an itinerant role, saying Mass in multiple parishes and performing marriages while nuns, deacons and lay people take on the daily administrative and even pastoral duties.
A similar arrangement prevails in small, isolated synagogues whose congregations bring in a rabbi to lead High Holidays services and officiate at bar and bat mitzvahs and weddings, but leave regular services to lay people.
The Hulstrands belong to the 5.2 million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the nation's third-largest Protestant denomination. Nearly 10 percent of the denomination's 9,703 pastors with congregations are serving two or more churches, said the Rev. David Alderfer, the denomination's director for rosters and statistics.
Three years ago, officials at the Lutherans' headquarters in Chicago produced a study showing that one-third of their 11,000 congregations drew no more than 50 people each Sunday and had annual budgets of $60,000 or less. Although some of those small congregations have endowments into which they can dip, most of them will "not be able to support a full-time pastoral leader," if they have one now, said Mac Minnick, the denomination's executive director for outreach.
The Hulstrands, Mr. Minnick said, "represent one of the creative" responses to this reality.
The Hulstrands, who are from St. Paul, Minn., and attended Luther Seminary there, said they had never envisioned becoming country ministers. "More and more, the people in the seminaries are like me," Mr. Hulstrand said. "They come from the city, so the thought of coming out to the country is scary."
What changed their minds was an innovative idea that Lutheran officials had for filling the pulpits of seven churches, including one in this prairie community of about 200 people. The pulpits of the churches, one of which had always had a full-time pastor, became vacant in 1992. Lutheran officials decided to link the seven into a single parish; recruit four ministers who could divide the pastoral work, while providing camaraderie to ward off feelings of isolation; and, most important, encourage lay people to become active in leadership. The result is Tri-County Ministry.
"This is a wonderful model," said Bishop Rick Foss, whose Eastern North Dakota Synod includes the seven congregations. "There is a kind of emerging spirit of willingness to look at innovative and cooperative models when it isn't going to work with the old system."
The concept proved so attractive that it drew one non-Lutheran congregation, the 54-member First Presbyterian Church in nearby Cooperstown, which had searched for a minister for three years. "It looked so hopeless," said Laverne Larsen, 65, a retired veterinarian, who is one of the 54. "Then we heard about these seven Lutheran churches."
Every Sunday, each of the four ministers tends to two churches, leading a midmorning service at one, then going on the road to preach at the other.
On one Sunday, Mr. Hulstrand started at the largest congregation, Trinity Lutheran in Cooperstown, at 9:30 A.M., then rushed to the Presbyterian church a few blocks away at 11 A.M. Mrs. Hulstrand preached at the church in the hamlet of nearby Sutton, then drove more than 20 miles to tiny Hannaford.
Across the county, the other full-time minister, the Rev. Carell J. Foss (no relation to Bishop Foss) preached in McHenry, then drove 15 miles to Binford. The ministry's fourth member, the Rev. Gretchen Diers, was assigned the circuit's two westernmost churches, in Grace City and Glenfield, which are about 20 miles apart.
The schedule -- set by Mr. Foss's wife, Bonnie, the ministry's coordinator -- rotates, so that every two months, each minister will have preached twice in each church.
It is complicated, but the ministers say they get to see everyone in the scattered congregations. And they can recycle sermons, freeing time for their specialized ministries, like the youth ministry that Mr. Hulstrand has developed.
But a major role of their ministry is helping congregants develop a sense of themselves as religious leaders, visiting the sick, heading Bible studies, even leading worship services.
"The need for visitation seems only to be increasing in these areas because of the aging population," Mrs. Hulstrand said. "There's no way a pastor can meet all those needs."
Equally important is encouraging lay people to preach when none of the ministers is available. One Sunday two months ago, for example, Duna Eugenia Frigaard, 66, the former owner of the local county newspaper, delivered the sermon at Cooperstown's Trinity Church, where she is a deacon. "We are the church as we interact with each other, as we serve," Mrs. Frigaard said.
Both Mr. Foss, 58, who spent eight years at a large congregation in Fargo, the state's biggest city, but moved here "to do something entirely different," and Mr. Hulstrand, 31, speak warmly of the overall friendliness of their surroundings. But both acknowledge the difficulties a full-time minister can face so far from an urban area.
A minister's spouse may find slim prospects for employment. "The jobs that are available aren't what they're trained in," Mr. Hulstrand said. "You wind up working in the cafe or at the bowling alley."
And there is one problem of rural demographics. "Our population grows older and sparser all the time," Mrs. Frigaard said.
For a minister in these circumstances, small victories must count for a lot. When the Hulstrands arrived two and a half years ago, they found fewer than 20 people attending the little church in Grace City, the most westerly point on the circuit. Some Sundays, only eight would show up.
But lately, attendance has soared to more than 40. "Just packing them in," Mr. Hulstrand said warmly. "There's a revival over there."

HEADLINE: The Legman for Limbaugh: At 27, a Force in the Capital

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
To hear about "scandal lurking" in the White House, the "environmentalist wackos" in Congress and the "self-important media elite" who report on both, millions of Americans turn to Rush Limbaugh.
And for his own political material, the wizard of conservative call-in radio turns to a 27-year-old who looks young enough to pass for a Congressional page. 
 His name is Joel C. Rosenberg, and his title is director of research for The Limbaugh Letter, a monthly publication that is a part of Mr. Limbaugh's empire. But he does more than clip newspaper articles. He is the eyes and ears -- and, on occasion, the muscle -- of Mr. Limbaugh in the capital.
"Everyone who can't get to Rush on the phone calls up Joel and pleads with him to get Rush to mention their pet cause," said William Kristol, a leading Republican theorist. "That's his role in our nation's capital."
Burton Yale Pines, who was a senior vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation when he hired Mr. Rosenberg as an assistant a few years back, calls him "a kid" but adds, "I've been at meetings of conservative activists, and they have paid extraordinary deference and have been solicitous of him."
From the Heritage Foundation's Capitol Hill headquarters, where Mr. Rosenberg retains office space even though he no longer works for the foundation, he faxes material to his boss in New York, home base for Mr. Limbaugh's syndicated radio and television programs, and telephones tidbits to him or his staff.
Mr. Rosenberg trolls the corridors of Congress, makes the rounds of conservative strategy sessions and, to pick up intelligence and "keep the Clinton Administration guessing," even shows up unannounced at Democratic functions. Compounding the influence of Mr. Limbaugh -- whom associates say he worships -- he sends Congressional leaders excerpts from the broadcasting superstar's on-the-air ruminations.
Some conservatives ridicule Mr. Rosenberg, although not for publication, as little more than a glorified go-fer trading on the Limbaugh name. Certainly he does not hesitate to exercise the power that his affiliation with Mr. Limbaugh grants him.
On more than one occasion he has dared to take on the House majority whip, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, at closed-door meetings of prominent conservatives. At a luncheon just the other day, for instance, Mr. Rosenberg provoked angry exchanges when he took issue with Mr. DeLay's recommendation that Representative Robert K. Dornan, Republican of California, lead Congressional efforts to effectively eliminate the position of Surgeon General.
"We can't have B-1 Bob leading the charge," participants quote Mr. Rosenberg as saying, a reference more to Mr. Dornan's reputation as a take-no-prisoners firebrand than to his ardent defense of the B-1 bomber, built partly in his district.
Mr. Dornan, who was not at the luncheon, says he confronted Mr. Rosenberg a week later. "He assured me that he was misunderstood," Mr. Dornan said. "So many people got up to dress him down and holler at him that he never had the opportunity to explain." By Mr. Dornan's account, that explanation was that Mr. Rosenberg had simply thought it best for a new face, a House freshman, to lead the drive on the issue. (Nonetheless, it was Mr. Dornan who won the designation in the end.)
Since he sometimes fills in as host on Mr. Limbaugh's radio program, Mr. Dornan said, he was all the more surprised at word that Mr. Rosenberg had attacked him. "Joel is young and new to the process," he said. "So I have to take Joel at his word that a Rush Limbaugh representative is not going to be lashing out at the person who gets the highest ratings sitting in for Rush."
Mr. Limbaugh and his staff are reported to be concerned that Mr. Rosenberg has been too confrontational in his dealings with lawmakers, but no one from the Limbaugh organization would agree to be interviewed about him. Kit Carson, Mr. Limbaugh's chief of staff, would only confirm Mr. Rosenberg's title and say that neither he nor Mr. Limbaugh had any comment to make.
Nor would Mr. Rosenberg himself say very much. "I'm a behind-the-scenes kind of guy, and I like it that way," he said in explaining why, after discussing it with Mr. Limbaugh, he too was unwilling to submit to a full interview, or even be photographed.
Interviews or no, Mr. Rosenberg is becoming more visible on Capitol Hill. During the Congressional debate on the balanced-budget amendment, his was a familiar presence in offices of conservatives like Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho. "Rush Limbaugh has a pretty loud horn, and we wanted him to play it as loud as he could on the balanced budget," said David Fish, Mr. Craig's press secretary. "We reminded him of that through Joel."
Grover Norquist, president of the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, said that when the House was debating a measure that would have tightened restrictions on lobbying, Mr. Rosenberg faxed Congressional leaders excerpts from Mr. Limbaugh's condemnation of the proposal. That way, he said, the lawmakers did not have to worry about opposing what might otherwise have been a popular bill. "Joel let them know that their constituents were up to speed on the weaknesses of the bill," Mr. Norquist said. "Then the bill got beaten."
Mr. Rosenberg graduated from Syracuse University with a film degree in 1989 and lives in Alexandria, Va., with his wife, Lynn, and their baby. He was hired by the Limbaugh organization a year ago at the recommendation of former Education Secretary William J. Bennett, for whom Mr. Rosenberg worked at another conservative organization, Empower America, after leaving the Heritage Foundation.
"Rush doesn't need eyes and ears in terms of newspapers and stories," said Peter Wehner, the policy director at Empower America. "But Joel can act like a filter," he said, telling Mr. Limbaugh, " 'You might want to keep your eye on the flat tax.' "
Mr. Rosenberg considers himself something of an expert on Israel, where he has traveled extensively and spent a year as a student at Tel Aviv University. The summer before his graduation from Syracuse, he worked at the State Department, helping produce a videotape that introduced Israel to Foreign Service officers newly stationed in Tel Aviv.
Mr. Rosenberg was reared in a Jewish household but now describes himself to acquaintances as an evangelical Christian. Mr. Pines, his former superior at the Heritage Foundation and now the chief operating officer of National Empowerment Television, was taken aback two years ago when Mr. Rosenberg, who "regarded himself as a rather committed Zionist," was attacked by allies of Israel for opposing American loan guarantees to the Israelis. That opposition "enraged some folks," Mr. Pines said.
To hear some Democrats tell it, there is reason for surprise in Mr. Limbaugh's having a researcher at all. A report last year by the liberal advocacy group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting concluded that Mr. Limbaugh was guilty of dozens of instances of "sloppiness, ignorance or fabrication."
In an article last November in the Heritage Foundation's Policy Review, Mr. Limbaugh denounced the report and said his commentaries were steeped in facts and figures.
"My tools are not right-wing demagoguery, as is so often charged," he wrote. "My tools are evidence, data and statistics. Economic analysis. Cultural criticism. Political comment. I demonstrate. I illustrate. I provide my audience with information that the mainstream media refuses to disseminate. And I do so in an entertaining, enjoyable way."
Few could be enjoying it any more than Mr. Rosenberg. As an aide to the House Republican leadership put it, "As long as Limbaugh's ratings stay up, Joel's in good shape."

HEADLINE: Bhutto Vows to Strike Back at Gunmen

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: KARACHI, Pakistan, March 11

 BODY:
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, her Government shaken by the killing of two United States Consulate officials here on Wednesday and a deadly mosque bombing on Friday, visited Karachi today and vowed to adopt tougher tactics, including "ruthlessness when required" toward gunmen who have fostered near-anarchy in Pakistan's biggest city.
As Ms. Bhutto spoke, the coffins of the two slain Americans were draped in American flags and driven to Karachi airport for a sunset ceremony on the airport tarmac that was attended by weeping family members and staff from the United States Consulate. After farewell speeches and a recorded playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner," a Marine guard carried the coffins aboard a United States military transport plane for the flight to Washington. 
 Tensions in the city worsened overnight as television images of the bombing at the Shiite mosque on Friday inflamed passions. With the death toll now at 15 from the bombing, and from an attack on survivors moments later by masked men with automatic weapons, crowds at funerals of the victims in the poorer sections of east Karachi stoned television crews and chanted anti-American slogans, apparently believing Shiite leaders assertions that the United States had inspired the attack because of its hostility toward predominantly Shiite Iran.
Although senior Pakistani officials said there had been no breakthroughs in the hunt for the Americans' killers, it became clearer during the day that the murders had struck at the core of the United States' fragile relations with Pakistan. While the two countries have been working together in the search for the killers, to the extent that Pakistan allowed a 50-member group from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to help lead the hunt, both Governments have been barely able to disguise their mutual bitterness over the killings.
In Ms. Bhutto's remarks to reporters, after an emergency meeting with the city's top police and government officials, there were even hints that the Pakistani leader held the United States partly responsible for the attack on the consular officials.
Among other things, Ms. Bhutto cited the United States' past sponsorship of militant Muslim groups in Afghanistan that have spread weapons, drugs and Muslim militancy into Karachi, as well Washington's stepped-up pressures for a crackdown by the Bhutto Government on Pakistani drug lords who have turned Karachi into one of the world's largest heroin-trafficking centers. Theories on the identity of the Americans' killers have centered on the possibility that the attack was ordered by Muslim fundamentalist groups, by drug lords or by an armed gang that was somehow influenced by both.
"At the time of the Afghan war, the entire West landed over here and helped create holy warriors whose job it was to go into Afghanistan and fight the 'Holy War,' " Ms. Bhutto said. "When the war ended, the West packed its bags and left countries like Pakistan, Egypt and Algeria to pick up the pieces and deal by themselves with these warriors they trained, who wanted new wars to fight."
For their part, American officials have said privately that the Bhutto Government and its predecessors, by doing little in face of the thousands of killings in Karachi in recent years by groups spurred on by ethnic, religious and criminal rivalries, helped create the lawless climate that led to the Americans' deaths.
A hint of the estrangement over the killings came when Ms. Bhutto failed to attend the airport ceremony for the two slain Americans, Jackie Van Landingham, 33, of Camden, S.C., and Gary C. Durell, 45, of Alliance, Ohio.
Until the last minute, American diplomats were hoping that the Pakistani leader might attend, and even left a seat free at the center of a row of steel chairs occupied by family members of the two victims. Instead, at almost the same time, Ms. Bhutto's motorcade drove to another part of the airport, where the Prime Minister boarded her government plane for Islamabad, the capital.
Newspapers in Karachi had speculated that Ms. Bhutto, who was born in Karachi and maintains a family home here, would dismiss the Chief Minister of Sind Province, whose capital is Karachi, because of the growing violence. But she neither dismissed the official, Abdullah Shah, nor ordered an expected shake-up of the police command, which has been accused of avoiding clashes with the city's most dangerous armed gangs, and sometimes of working with the gangs.
Instead, she resorted to tough words. She said it was time for an all-out crackdown on "the forces of sectarianism, ethnicity and narcotics that have combined to create terror and harassment in the city."
She added: "We have decided that when innocent people are being killed, the Government has to respond, and in a very firm and ruthless manner."
In other remarks, Ms. Bhutto hinted at the growing resentment within her Government, and more broadly across Pakistan, with what many here perceive as Washington's betrayal of past friendships. Once a close military ally of Washington's, and the third-largest recipient of United States aid after Israel and Egypt, Pakistan has been virtually snubbed in the past five years, losing nearly $600 million a year in economic and military aid because of Washington's disapproval of Islamabad's nuclear weapons program.
Since returning to office 17 months ago, Ms. Bhutto has sought to improve relations, adopting market economic reforms, encouraging Western, and particularly American investment, and making a stronger effort than in the past to control drug barons. Several top drug barons have been arrested, and are being held pending Government moves to extradite them to the United States. In January, the largest-ever hauls of opium and pure heroin resulted from government raids in the North-West Frontier Province.
In her remarks to reporters, Ms. Bhutto recalled these steps, and said the drug barons had reacted by channeling money to militant fundamentalist groups in Karachi that had been responsible for much of the killing. Although she did not say so directly, the Prime Minister appeared to suggest that the killing of the two Americans might have been part of this conspiracy.
"Because our battle against narcotics continues, the narcotics dealers have decided to finance the sectarian groups and to hire guns to create fear and harassment," she said.
Among many Pakistanis, the possibility that the Americans were attacked on the orders of drug barons has been a favorite theory, and some accounts in Pakistani newspapers have even suggested that they were engaged in anti-narcotics work. The speculation has been encouraged by the evasiveness displayed by American diplomats when they have been asked to detail the work assignments of Ms. Van Landingham, Mr. Durell and Mark McCloy, an American consulate employee who was wounded in the attack.
Consulate officials have described Mr. Durell as a communications specialist and Ms. Van Landingham as a secretary in the economic section. Asked about Mr. McCloy, one consulate official snapped back: "I told you, he worked in the consulate's postal section, that's all. He was a postal worker."

HEADLINE: Once a Sideshow, Private Organizations Star at U.N. Meetings

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, March 11

 BODY:
It started in Rio de Janeiro, with the 1992 Earth Summit. Now no big United Nations conference takes place without it. It is called the NGO Forum, a gathering of private organizations on the edges of the main event. But dull or powerless it is not.
This week, as delegates to the World Summit for Social Development were bickering over phrases on issues like debt cancellation and whether a statement on workers' rights would be offensive to national sovereignty, the forum, a group of nongovernmental organizations, was generating more headlines, news conferences and controversy as it busied itself lobbying and sometimes attacking the establishment. 
 The Alternative Declaration of Principles, the NGO Forum's plan for fighting poverty and rectifying social wrongs, was finished well before the Social Summit's formal document, and was published in full by a handful of daily conference newspapers circulating among delegates and the press.
The forum's declaration warned, "We are on the point of leaving to our children a world we would not want to live in ourselves."
But it also welcomed the common understanding and hope generated by a week of networking with like-minded friends.
Soon after opening, the forum became a tourist attraction for Danes, who led wide-eyed children through the Global Village, a slightly unkempt version of the World's Fair.
With each United Nations conference, the forum grows to encompass a wider spectrum of groups and causes. When the subject is as broad as social development, there seems to be no limit.
Along Main Street of the Global Village, which sprung up in a hangar-sized hall on the former Danish navy base where the forum was meeting, women's organizations from Africa set up shop selling handicrafts near European advocates fighting for greater AIDS awareness. A Danish neo-communist distributed leaflets in front of a Pakistani self-help project's stall. Two rows of little blond children from a local school dressed in exotic foreign costumes tried gamely to sing about humankind above the din of a thousand voices.
Strollers could buy a tiny symbolic plant to help raise money for refugees returning to farms thousands of miles away, hear from Zapatista rebels about their plight in southern Mexico, encounter peoples' health collectives and listen to Swami Agnivesh, standing beside a heavy chain, talking about slave labor in India.
"It's a big umbrella," said Bella Abzug, the former United States Representative from New York who founded the Women's Environment and Development Organization. Since Rio, Ms. Abzug has become a patron and sage to many groups that take part in the NGO Forum.
"For us to realize our dreams," she told the summit delegates in a speech last week, "we must keep our heads in the clouds and our feet on the ground."
In a few years representatives of some of these private organizations have become members of official delegations or sought-after consultants on issues politicians do not follow with such zeal.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in an interview this week that the importance of the private organizations as partners of the United Nations was growing and that he would like to see them take an active part in helping to build democracy at grass-roots level.
Ms. Abzug said: "The NGO's have done a significant job educating the U.N. It's because many of them are experts -- a lot more expert than government representatives in their fields."

HEADLINE: In a Tense Zone in Croatia, Respect Wanes Along With U.N.'s Mandate

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: KNIN, Croatia, March 10

 BODY:
Told that Croatian troops were massing in a demilitarized zone, the Czech commander of United Nations troops around this separatist Serb city jumped into a four-wheel-drive vehicle the other day and rode out to protest.
But when the commander got there, United Nations officials said, the Croatian Government troops in the so-called zone of separation bluntly told him he had no business interfering. One Croatian officer even warned that he might be "declared persona non grata" if he sought to enforce his mandate to keep combatants out of the area. 
 "There's no respect," the commander, Maj. Gen. Rostislav Kotil, reflected during an interview.
The incident suggests the uneasy role of the 12,000 United Nations troops in Croatia, whose future has hung in the balance since the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, threatened to expel them two months ago. [Senior Clinton Administration officials said on Saturday that the Western allies had been reached a tentative deal with Mr. Tudjman to keep a much reduced force in the country.]
The Croatian President has taken a hard line in negotiations with Western diplomats, saying the troops' three-year presence as a buffer force has only helped solidify the 1991 conquests of the rebel Serbs. The peacekeepers' mandate is formally scheduled to expire March 31.
Since Mr. Tudjman demanded the pullout in January, the position of the United Nations troops has become increasingly tenuous. Most worrisome, said Lieut. Bob Rogers, a Canadian officer in the United Nations force, the cease-fire zone itself "is starting to collapse," with both sides seeking to gain ground and sending bellicose messages to diplomats in Washington, Zagreb and elsewhere.
Beyond words and persuasion, the United Nations troops have little leverage to try to prevent cease-fire violations. The peacekeepers may use their weapons only if their lives are threatened.
Standing atop a rainy, rocky hilltop near Drnis, at town in the cease-fire zone, Capt. Ole Saitambao, a Kenyan member of the United Nations force, watched powerlessly the other day as Serbs openly plowed a road to a neighboring summit in breach of the cease-fire.
Within sight of a United Nations observation post at Skbranje, Serbian rebels were digging new emplacements this week on a site that Canadian peacekeepers now ruefully call "Bunker Hill."
The United Nations forces in Croatia are deployed along a clearly defined cease-fire line, a ribbon of land one and a half to two miles wide that follows the perimeter of the areas seized by rebel Serbs in 1991. Under the terms of the cease-fire signed a year ago no armed Serbs or Croats are supposed to enter the "zone of separation," let alone dig trenches in or near it.
In another area 6 to 12 miles back from the cease-fire line, Serbs and Croats are supposed to keep their heavy weapons in depots where the United Nations can inspect them.
Under the current mandate, which now seems certain to be modified in diplomatic negotiations, the United Nations troops are also charged with protecting the few Croats still living in the separatist Serb region. They also clear mines from graveyards and escort people from both sides to bury their dead or visit graves.
The region under the Serbs' control, some 30 percent of Croatia's territory, is not much to look at. The fighting and the Serbs' systematic efforts to drive out Croats have left a terrain of near-empty villages, wrecked houses, booby-trapped ruins and hastily dug cemeteries.
"There's the mass grave," said Lieut. Jamie Robertson, a Canadian officer, in a matter-of-fact way, gesturing toward 26 wooden crosses in an unkempt field in Skbranje.
The churches are flattened. Schools are destroyed. At night, a single light from a Serb home might be the only glimmer in a village whose Croats have been slain or expelled.
Gunfire sometimes rattles, as it did several times this morning near a Canadian outpost. The cherry trees have begun to blossom with the coming spring, but the thaw only coaxes weeds in agricultural fields that have no one to till them.
The countless land-mines strewn on the front-lines here will probably take 50 years to clear, said Sgt. John Butler, a Canadian engineer.
Many United Nations officials consider Mr. Tudjman's condemnation of the peacekeepers for maintaining the division of the country to be unfair. Such criticism ignores the way the United Nations troops have kept the two sides apart, they say, and even fostered the beginnings of a reconciliation.
After intense and then sporadic fighting, "there has been a year of cease-fire between two parties," said General Kotil, the commander of 4,200 United Nations troops in the southern part of the Serb-held region, known as the Krajina. "It's a clear example that something is working."
Before Mr. Tudjman's announcement in January, the two sides had taken the first, halting steps toward economic cooperation, opening a main highway and an oil pipeline and fielding teams of technicians to discuss rebuilding water and electric power supplies. Those contacts have now been suspended.
But many United Nations officials acknowledged that their mission faltered, for neither Serbs nor Croats displaced in the fighting have been able to return home. In preserving the cease-fire line, the United Nations troops are thus also cementing a line of ethnic division.
"The security situation has simply been too uncertain for that," said a United Nations official in this so-called Serb capital, a strategic railroad town ringed by snowy mountains. "We are accused of cementing the status quo, but it's one of the paradoxes of peacekeeping that maintaining the status quo is what we are supposed to do."
Behind the lines, the Krajina Serbs have done their best to implant a Serbian mini-state. Phone lines and supply routes run from Knin to Belgrade. The currency used here and the Cyrillic script are Serbian, too. The Krajina Serbs now have their own parliament, Government and army, all supported by Serbia, but not much in the way of prosperity.
That gives the United Nations force another, less official role. While it may not trade on the local market, it employs hundreds of Serbs as drivers, cooks, cleaners and interpreters, spending millions of dollars on rents, salaries and even contracts for the removal of sewage and garbage.
That, some observe, makes peacekeeping the only growth industry in town.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Recommend Wolfensohn to Head World Bank

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
President Clinton has chosen James D. Wolfensohn, an investment banker and arts patron, as president of the World Bank, the White House announced today.
The selection is formally a recommendation to the World Bank's directors, who elect the president. By tradition, the World Bank presidency goes to an American and the directorship of the International Monetary Fund to a European. 
Mr. Wolfensohn, 61, will succeed Lewis T. Preston, who is ill with cancer and who has asked to retire before his five-year term ends next year.
The Administration chose the Australian-born Mr. Wolfensohn, a naturalized American citizen, over two other insiders: Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs and a former World Bank chief economist, and Stanley Fischer, also a former chief economist at the bank and now a deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Wolfensohn, who actively sought the World Bank presidency, has maintained his investment banking business in New York while serving part time and without salary since 1990 as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
Mr. Summers's candidacy may have been hurt by his role on behalf of the Administration's Mexico rescue package in Congress, where it was unpopular. While the World Bank presidency is not subject to Senate confirmation, the Administration is seeking Congressional support for multibillion-dollar contributions to the World Bank's International Development Agency.
In making the announcement today, President Clinton said Mr. Wolfensohn "has already had an extraordinary career in finance and public service, spanning four decades and three continents." Mr. Clinton said that Mr. Wolfensohn's international background and wide-ranging contacts would permit him to be a "forceful advocate for the bank and development issues."
Mr. Wolfensohn, a member of Australia's fencing team in the 1956 Olympics, became an American citizen in 1980. The chairman of his firm, James D. Wolfensohn, Inc., which advises major corporate clients, is Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman.
Before founding his firm in 1981, Mr. Wolfensohn was a partner in Salomon Brothers. He received undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Sydney and an M.B.A. at Harvard Business School.
But what has most distinguished him from myriad other wealthy investment bankers has been his involvement in the arts. A cellist, he served as chairman of Carnegie Hall for more than 10 years and helped raise money for refurbishing the hall in time for its centennial.
As chairman of the cash-starved Kennedy Center, he has raised money to help the center remain open. His daughter Sara is a concert pianist. He and his wife, Elaine, also have a son, Adam, and another daughter, Naomi.
The World Bank entered its second half-century this year facing questions about the environmental consequences of its large-scale development projects and doubts about the efficacy of channeling money to state-owned enterprises in countries with unstable governments.
The bank, which issues about $17 billion in loans each year, has increased its spending on environmental and human development projects, but has been criticized on those issues in the past. A coalition of environmentalist, human rights and even competing aid groups, calling itself the "50 Years is Enough" campaign, said last year that the bank should mark its 50th anniversary by going out of business.
The bank has also been criticized as overstaffed. Mr. Preston recently announced plans for a 12 percent staff reduction during the next two years, and Mr. Wolfensohn has said he would like to make further cuts.
The World Bank president earns a salary of $190,000 a year plus a $90,000-a-year expense account.

HEADLINE: NASA Turns to Industry for Next Generation of Launchers

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
The space agency has begun a competition within the aerospace industry to design and build a new family of reusable rockets that would eventually replace the space shuttle and other satellite launchers.
In a move that could fundamentally change the way the nation puts payloads into space, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration last week selected four companies to propose new launch systems that would not only greatly reduce the costs of space flight but also take NASA out of the business of building and operating its own fleet of rockets. 
 If the program is successful, experts said after the Wednesday announcement, it will result in a new generation of reusable rockets, owned and operated by private industry, that the Government and other customers would pay to use when they needed to launch satellites or other cargoes.
Turning the space launching business over to private industry would not only reduce the cost of the space program and the size of NASA, they said, but would also encourage a robust commercial space business in the United States to compete with the rocket-building programs of other nations.
Under the plan, the Government would pay for research on crucial new rocket technology and would finance the building of sub-scale, flying test rockets to see if the new systems worked. Then it would be up to the aerospace industry to finance the construction, operation and marketing of the new rockets.
"This will fundamentally change the space program and fundamentally change NASA," the agency's administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, said on Friday. "NASA will become a smaller, leaner research and development agency emphasizing cutting-edge science and technology, and not putting its resources into operating rockets."
Speaker Newt Gingrich endorsed the NASA plans in a speech on Monday in Georgia, saying the new approach to space flight would be akin to the relationship between commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers, with airlines stating their needs and the aircraft industry building planes to meet them. Contractors have told him, Mr. Gingrich said, that they can probably build a new rocket to replace the space shuttle in a third of the time for no more than 40 percent of the cost of the Government doing it.
Experts said the effort is economically viable if NASA and other Government users serve as "anchor tenants," providing a core of business as the industry develops a larger, private customer base.
"This concept represents a real transition to the next phase of space flight," said Dr. John Logsdon, director of George Washington University's Space Policy Institute in Washington. "It's certainly the next step beyond the shuttle for routine and affordable access to space."
About half of NASA's $13 billion budget goes for maintaining and operating its aging fleet of four space shuttles. While reusable, the shuttles are complicated machines based on early 1970's technology. On each flight of the shuttle, its large external fuel tank is discarded and its twin rocket boosters must be recovered at sea for refurbishing, an expensive process.
The new program calls for developing a large, totally reusable, unpiloted rocket that takes off, goes into orbit and returns as a single unit. Such a rocket should be able to lift shuttle-size payloads and carry 25,000-pound cargoes to the planned international space station, program officials say.
In addition, the program calls for developing a smaller, mostly reusable rocket that could cheaply take small payloads -- between 1,000 and 2,000 pounds -- into low Earth orbits.
NASA said it would negotiate contracts with three groups of companies for the first phase of the large-rocket project, on which the Government will spend $24 million over 15 months and the contractors will contribute a matching amount. During this period, the contractors are to design a vehicle and develop business plans and operations strategies.
The Government will then decide whether to go to the second phase, building and flying an experimental rocket called the X-33 by the end of the decade at a cost to the Government of about $650 million.
Mr. Goldin and other supporters of the program said they would prefer building prototypes of the two leading contenders for Phase 2 and having a fly-off to decide which is best, but it is uncertain if money for this would be available.
NASA selected these three X-33 proposals:
*The Lockheed Advanced Development Company of Palmdale, Calif., has proposed building a wingless, flat-bottomed rocket called a lifting body that would take off vertically and land horizontally like an airplane.
*Rockwell International Corporation's Space Systems Division of Downey, Calif., working with Northrop Grumman of Los Angeles and other partners, has proposed a winged ship that looks somewhat like a large shuttle, which Rockwell builds, but without external tanks or boosters. It would also would rise vertically and land horizontally.
*McDonnell Douglas Aerospace of Huntington Beach, Calif., working in partnership with Boeing Aircraft of Seattle, said it had not yet settled on a design, but experts familiar with its program said the company was considering both a winged model similar to the other proposals and an innovative concept that would both take off and land vertically on downward-firing engines. The company built and flew a small, vertically landing test rocket, called the DC-X, in 1993 and 1994
For the small-rocket project, which would produce a prototype called the X-34 to fly in late 1997, the agency selected the Orbital Sciences Corporation of Dulles, Va., in partnership with Rockwell International. The companies plan to spend $100 million on the project, and NASA will contribute $70 million for research and testing through 1999.

HEADLINE: As World Leaders Confer on Poverty, Mitterrand Urges New Tax

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, March 11

 BODY:
The largest gathering of world leaders ever assembled began a two-day marathon of speeches today on improving the lives of the world's 1.3 billion most destitute people. Many promises were made, but few new high-level commitments or concrete proposals.
President Francois Mitterrand of France, making his last appearance before a large international audience before elections in France next month, was an exception. He supported a proposal to tax speculative international currency transactions as way of raising money for development. The suggested levy was proposed by James Tobin, an American who was awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize for economics. 
 Austria also made a concrete gesture, saying it was writing off $100 million in debt for the poorest nations, in line with a recommendation to lender governments in a declaration to be signed Sunday. The declaration also asks the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to reexamine the indebtedness of countries in distress and find more ways to cushion the harsh measures that are often part of economic reform.
The declaration urges, but cannot compel, donor Governments to earmark 20 percent of aid for spending on education, health and other human development programs. It asks other countries, including those receiving assistance, to devote 20 percent of their budgets for spending in the same areas. Most developing countries are far below that figure.
President Mitterrand, who has cancer and who appeared drawn and weak as he spoke, said he had no illusions about the difficulty of establishing a tax on financial transactions. But he challenged the audience of more than 115 government leaders to make a real commitment.
"Are we just acting before the world?" he asked. "Or are we really determined to raise social issues to the rank of peace and the economy?"
On Sunday, the assembled kings, presidents and prime ministers will sign a declaration negotiated this week during working sessions of the World Summit for Social Development. Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to speak on Sunday, along with President Fidel Castro of Cuba.
The declaration includes a broad plan of action, saying that democracy, a rule of law and human rights and environmental protection are needed for public well-being. Several large developing nations objected to these references.
One argument holding up negotiations this week was over national sovereignty. Developing nations lost a fight to have the principle of noninterference stated explicitly -- to spare them international scrutiny of their policies.
Today Prime Minister Li Peng of China, Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao of India and President Suharto of Indonesia, representing three nations that regularly oppose the expansion of international human rights monitoring, all demanded that the world allow them to find their own way to social progress.
The declaration is vague on the issue of raising money for development aid, to the distress of many private assistance groups and some United Nations officials. This has led to considerable discussion of the Tobin tax by private groups that have come to lobby at the conference.
The idea is likely to be explored in a preliminary way at a meeting of the seven major industrial nations in Canada in June, said George Greene, policy director at the Canadian International Development Agency. Such a tax would help Governments like the United States that are under pressure to reduce foreign aid, he said.

HEADLINE: The Safety Zone;
Coast Guard Tries to Rid Waters of Deficient Foreign Ships

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The aging Russian freighter did not seem menacing, just another maritime pack animal hauling scrap metal or waste paper or some other bulk leftover. But when it crept into New York Harbor the other day, it became an outlaw. The United States Coast Guard moved in. The vessel was impounded. Its crew was interrogated. Its records were checked. Its holds were searched.
It was not that the freighter, the Favorit, was smuggling drugs or illegal immigrants. Its sin was its condition: its hull was pocked with leaks, and its decks had rusted to a crumbly orange. It was in danger of causing an accident that might disable shipping lanes that are as finely calibrated as the runways of a busy airport. 
 "Would you let somebody you care about sail on this?" said Lieut. Eric G. Westerberg, a Coast Guard inspector, as he walked through the ship's belly, thumbing every so often through a Russian-English dictionary for words like "crack" or "broken" so he could question members of the crew.
As the shipping industry endures another year of recession, more poorly maintained vessels from other countries are plying the seas, hoping to make do without costly repairs. Some find their way to New York Harbor, a cramped and bustling place where a seemingly minor mishap can wreak heavy financial losses on companies whose ships or goods are delayed.
Seeking to protect the safety and health of United States harbors, the Coast Guard has started a campaign to rid the waters of substandard ships that are registered in foreign countries, often detaining them for weeks at anchor or in terminals until their owners fix the deficiencies. The new policy mirrors similar ones in Europe and Japan.
Since last May, when the stepped-up inspections began, 21 foreign-flag ships, most of them freighters, have been detained by the New York office of the Coast Guard, including four at the Port of New Haven, officials said. Just yesterday, the office was holding another Russian freighter at New Haven until it made repairs.
The total since May includes the most well known of violators, the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2, which was held at dock for more than a day in December.
The Queen Elizabeth 2 would most likely have been penalized under the old rules as well, for passenger ships have long been subjected to rigorous inspections because of the greater risk to human life should accidents occur.
As a result, it is rare for them to be detained because their owners take precautions not to run afoul of the rules. And tankers have come under intense scrutiny since the Exxon Valdez oil-spill disaster in 1989.
The big change involves freighters. Nationally, 303 foreign-flag ships were cited by the Coast Guard in 1994, four months of which fell under the old rules, officials said. The total for 1994 is a sharp increase over that for 1993, though it is difficult to make an exact comparison because the Coast Guard kept track of detentions differently before last May, officials said.
"This is a threat that is beginning to materialize," said Roger Kohn, a spokesman for the International Maritime Organization in London, an arm of the United Nations that regulates shipping.
"Owners are not replacing ships the way they used to, so the ships are getting older and older," Mr. Kohn said. "The average age is 18 years, and that's very old. Some owners are finding it difficult to do the maintenance that is necessary. They are also going for cheap crews from developing countries. If you look at the casualty and accident records each year, you find that the same group of countries comes at the top of the list."
The violations are wide-ranging: faulty steering, navigation, engines or firefighting or lifesaving equipment, including lifeboats; structural damage to the ship, like the leaks on the Favorit; defects that lead to pollution, like oil spills, or poorly trained crews.
The Coast Guard stresses that only a small percentage of foreign-flag ships are in poor shape. It has found that those in violation of the policy are usually registered in nations that may take little interest in whether the ships are seaworthy.
The agency has targeted ships that are registered in 15 countries, including India, Argentina and several others in Latin America. Even as the Favorit was forced into drydock in January, another freighter, the Harkishin, which sails under an Indian flag, was being detained in the harbor because of leaks and defects in its lifeboats and electrical systems, the Coast Guard said.
The inspection of the Favorit provided a glimpse of the hazards that the Coast Guard often detects.
After the Favorit, which was built in the 1970's, hobbled into a drydock at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Lieutenant Westerberg and three other Coast Guard officers spent several hours examining the structure of the ship and its equipment. They learned from the crew that in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, the leaks in the hull had been letting in dozens of gallons of water a minute.
The crew had resorted to a desperate fix: pushing wooden boxes filled with concrete against the leaks and buttressing them with rods. The damage was apparent. But the Coast Guard also discovered shoddy lifesaving equipment and sections of hull weakened by corrosion.
"There are more vertical cracks here," Lieutenant Westerberg said at one point, slamming a hammer into a beam to test its strength. "Do you realize the potential of that? We suspect that many of the freight vessels that disappear without a trace break in half. It's a cause for concern whenever cracks develop in the middle of a ship."
Lieutenant Westerberg and the other inspectors -- Lieut. Jennifer Rusiecki, Lieut. Chris O'Brien and Lieut. David Flaherty -- said the crews of the impounded ships tend to be cooperative, often because they are grateful that owners are being pressured to make repairs. The crew of the Favorit was no different, dutifully pointing out, in halting English, the damage and the repairs in progress. The ship left after being detained for more than a week.
Many owners of foreign-flag ships, including United States companies that have registered their vessels in other countries because of less costly regulations, were at first wary of the new policy, questioning whether foreign-flag ships were being picked on. But some now say that the Coast Guard has carried it out fairly.
"It's certainly had an impact in upgrading the quality of ships coming to U.S. ports," said Philip J. Loree, the chairman of the Federation of American Controlled Shipping, which represents American companies that have registered vessels in Liberia, the Marshall Islands, the Bahamas and Panama.
"If you had called me last May or June when this was announced, I would have said that there was great concern," Mr. Loree said. "But I can say now that in the American ship-owning communities, there is almost zero concern."
Mr. Loree and other shipping executives also said that when rickety ships create accidents, everyone in the industry suffers.
There has not been a serious incident in New York Harbor involving a foreign-flag vessel in recent years, but there have been close calls. And foreign ships have done serious damage elsewhere. In the Houston ship channel, for example, a freighter registered in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a Caribbean island group, collided with a barge in 1992.
The accident caused $1 million in damage to the vessels, and the shipping channel was closed for three days, causing $6 million in delays for shipping companies, Federal officials said. Investigators later criticized the crew of the freighter, the Juraj Dalmatinac, for failing to use its navigation equipment properly.
It is the fear of a similar disaster that hangs over New York Harbor, which many thousands of vessels visit every year.
"This has traditionally been a problem," said Capt. William W. Sherwood, the president of the New York Sandy Hook Pilots Association, whose members assist commercial ships with navigation.
"We see on occasion vessels that are in pretty tough physical shape," he said. "We have had vessels that have had problems with oil spills or have damaged a particular segment of the waterway. The port effectively loses its ability to function. So anything that the Coast Guard can do is very much welcome."

HEADLINE: In Gambling Debate, Foes Await Bridgeport Casino Vote

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., March 10

 BODY:
The political and business leadership of this city is determined to show state legislators that Bridgeport voters want a casino so much that they will vote overwhelmingly for it in a referendum on March 28.
In a fiercely waged contest, the Bridgeport Regional Business Council expects to spend $190,000 campaigning for a casino, which it says is the key to transforming the struggling city's port into a tourist attraction like the Inner Harbor in Baltimore. 
 But whatever a casino might do for Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city, its impact on the state began to loom larger this week, as the General Assembly's Public Safety Committee approved a bill that would establish a commission to select a Bridgeport developer.
Signing that bill, the Mashantucket Pequot Indians warned Gov. John G. Rowland, would cost the state the $130 million a year the tribe provides from the profits of its Foxwoods casino, by breaking a compact negotiated by his predecessor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., that gave the Pequots a monopoly on slot machines.
Bills drafted to replace the Pequot millions would not only put a casino in Bridgeport, but also spread slot machines across the state in parimutuel establishments like jai alai frontons and teletracks.
"This is not about a casino in Bridgeport," said a lobbyist for the Pequots, Charles Duffy. "Those are not parimutuel facilities with a few slot machines; they're casinos, too. All of this struggle, to replace revenue that is coming to them regularly and without travail."
The Pequot money has stood in the way of expanding casino gambling in Connecticut ever since Mr. Weicker, an opponent of casinos, negotiated a deal that gave the state a 25 percent share of the tribe's slot-machine revenue in return for the games' being permitted only on tribal reservations.
Since the state gains more than $130 million a year from the deal, and since $85 million of that is distributed to towns and cities for tax relief, legislators have always known that any bill authorizing a casino would have to replace that money.
Developers like Mirage Resorts and Donald Trump have pledged to make up the revenue, but one problem is how to cover potentially hundreds of millions lost between the Pequots' expected cutoff and the new casino's opening two, three or four years later.
"The issue is, the Pequots are up and running now, and we don't want any down time in that revenue stream," said State Representative Stephen D. Dargan, a Democrat from West Haven who is co-chairman of the Public Safety Committee. "Everyone has a grave concern with the budgetary constraints upon us."
"But I've said many times," he continued, "I don't think the state or we as a legislative body want to be held hostage by the Pequots."
The current bill provides for putting slot machines in parimutuel establishments within 90 days and permitting a temporary riverboat casino in Bridgeport to replace some of the revenue. The developer would cover the remaining difference, minus any taxes it paid to the state during construction.
But Mr. Rowland, who has endorsed a Bridgeport casino as a way to restart the city's economy, surprised many legislators this week by threatening to veto the casino bill because of the Pequot money.
He later reassured the Public Safety Committee that he would support a bill that fully replaced the Pequot money -- if, in addition, Bridgeport residents approved a casino in a referendum, and if a majority of its jobs went to Bridgeport residents. He also asked the Pequots to consider bidding to be the developer.
The momentary alarm underlined for casino advocates the task they face in reassuring not only their opponents in Bridgeport, but also legislators across the state, that the revenue and jobs from a casino here will help rebuild the city without harming the rest of the state.
The goal, said Paul Timpanelli, president of the Business Council, is to have revenue from a single casino finance the redevelopment of the city's harbor, producing another family-oriented Baltimore Inner Harbor instead of another Atlantic City.
Property taxes on a casino estimated at $15 million a year, plus $15 million from the city's share of a casino tax, could finance in a decade the development of other new businesses that otherwise might take 30 years to build, he said.
"We're not just for a casino," Mr. Timpanelli said. "We're for an overall development plan centered on the waterfront. We have a plan, and we have a means of expediting that plan with a casino."
This week, Bridgeport's Mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, released a consultant's study that concluded that a casino here, little more than an hour from New York City by rail, highway and ferry, could gross a billion dollars a year, easily outdoing the Pequots' contribution to the state.
But the projections of casino developers are already under attack by opponents here, who include clergy groups and a coalition called Bridgeport Residents Against Gambling.
Noel Furie, a leader of the residents' group, borrowed money for a billboard above the Connecticut Turnpike that says "Casino gambling -- a lousy deal for Bridgeport." The group, she said, has about $800 on hand to wage a campaign against the Business Council's efforts, and hopes to spend $10,000.
Bridgeport, Ms. Furie said, already has a strategic plan that focuses on developing the port and new industries like entertainment, and a casino and its self-contained shops and restaurants would simply draw people and money away from those.
She argued that the casino would also make the city unattractive to new families with young children, and to businesses that might consider the city. "Nothing else is going to happen as long as the casino interests are here as a possibility," she said.
A recent survey of clergy by the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport found that a large majority of those responding opposed a casino, said the Rev. John S. Kidd, the council's executive director. Moral and social issues connected to gambling were only one concern.
"They believe the casino interests are holding out promises they aren't going to fulfill," he said. "They describe casinos as vacuum cleaners, as a variety of images suggesting a casino costs a community more than it contributes."
Just how much a Bridgeport casino, in heavy competition with Foxwoods and other casinos under development, can contribute to the city and the state compared with what Foxwoods guarantees now, will soon be scrutinized by the legislature's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
"People keep asking, how can you guarantee this, and you can't guarantee it," Mr. Timpanelli said. "You have to have a good marketing plan."

HEADLINE: A Bronx Miracle

 BODY:
The Bronx may well be the nation's most nfamous symbol of urban blight. Battered by highway construction begun in the 1950's, abandoned by the middle class in the 60's, torched by arsonists through the 70's, the South Bronx in particular became a bombed-out relic and a synonym for hopelessness and decay.
 But that image is no longer accurate. Take a Sunday drive and you will be surprised to see that the burned-out Bronx is largely gone. The dispiriting stretches of ghost buildings that once loomed along the Cross Bronx Expressway have either been reclaimed as cooperative apartments or cleared to make way for hundreds of new town houses. 
 After Mayor Edward Koch initiated a citywide $5 billion housing renovation plan in 1986, the city and not-for-profit groups began renovating thousands of apartments each year. Additional city funds were committed to help subsidize the construction of new homes. The Bronx has clawed its way back and is rapidly becoming a borough of middle-class homeowners. Since 1986, 19,000 apartments have been refurbished and more than 2,500 houses have been built for working-class home buyers, with 2,000 more in the pipeline.
 The heroes of this story are the not-for-profit community development corporations that build and rehabilitate buildings and counsel the first-time home buyers who make up just about all of the new owners. The C.D.C.'s organize the process and instruct the buyers in everything they need to know, including the art of applying for a mortgage in a community whose real estate the banks once looked upon as having zero value.
 The banks and some builders remain skeptical. Thus the buyers must part with their down payments while the homes they wish to buy are yet to be built. For a working-class family living in the much-maligned Bronx, this requires a huge leap of faith.
 That faith is paying dividends. Neighborhoods once made up entirely of the poor are being economically integrated. With ownership comes pride in community -- and vigilance against crime and disorder. While small patches of desolation remain, the vast empty stretches have all been renewed. Neatly kept town houses have cropped up where the eyesores used to be. Markets and retail stores are cautiously returning to the neighborhoods.
 Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer declares with pride that his community has reversed middle-class flight. Only the next census will show how true that is. But for now, the signs of promise spring abundant.
 The Bronx has shown that government can help pull communities back from the brink and rebuild inner cities. The question is whether Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki will eradicate the housing program in the next round of budget cuts. If they do, a vital tool for reclaiming other battered parts of New York City will be lost.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Smoking Mountain

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
Of the many jokes making the rounds about Mexico's President, Ernesto Zedillo, maybe the most appropriate one is this: Mr. Zedillo is in a rowboat with the Pope and a big wind blows the Pontiff's miter off his head. Mr. Zedillo climbs out of the boat, walks on water and retrieves the Pope's cap. The next day's headlines in the Mexican newspapers read: "Zedillo Can't Swim."
 Since taking office Dec. 1, Mr. Zedillo has been overwhelmed by Mexico's economic crisis, which erupted 19 days after he was sworn in. This has left the impression that his Cabinet is the gang that couldn't shoot straight. His aides openly concede that they were not prepared to deal with the economic situation, largely because they thought they were going to inherit a Rolls-Royce economy and when they discovered they had the keys to a jalopy about to be repossessed they weren't sure what to do. It has taken them two months to come up with a real rescue plan. 
 But what has been obscured is that Mr. Zedillo, while stumbling around in economics, has simultaneously instituted an impressive series of political reforms -- making Mexico more open, democratic and less corrupt than ever before -- for which he has gotten no credit, at home or abroad.
 Since coming to office, the Yale-educated Mr. Zedillo has sacked the entire corrupt Supreme Court, which he replaced with new judges and made independent of the presidency; he has suppressed the guerrilla insurgency in Chiapas; he has empowered the traditionally rubber-stamp Mexican legislature with real oversight responsibilities; he has given the political opposition a significant role in his Cabinet; he has begun instituting the rule of law, where arbitrariness used to reign, and he has jailed the brother of ex-President Carlos Salinas, in a courageous effort to root out corruption in Mexico's Mafia-style ruling class.
 In the short run, Mr. Zedillo is calculating that because Mexico is about to go through a brutal recession, with massive unemployment, having a more open political system that allows for more demonstrations and channels discontent via the ballot box may enable this society to blow off steam without blowing off the lid.
 In the long run, Mr. Zedillo is gambling that by diffusing power, rather than concentrating it like his predecessors, he will ultimately have more legitimacy, more authority and more cooperation from labor and business in getting this economy out of Chapter 11. That is a big bet. Mexico has always been a country that relied on a strong presidency to deal with crises, and what is democracy to Mr. Zedillo could be a tempting power vacuum to his opponents.
 "This moment is one of a profound shaking of the political system," said Antonio Lozano, Mr. Zedillo's gutsy Attorney General, whose investigations of the previous Government have turned up a trail of murder and drug money that has rattled the traditional power elite. "I have received full support from the President for my investigation. But we need support at home and from abroad."
 That's for sure. As I left Mr. Lozano's office, I went to close his door and it was so heavy with bullet-proof glass and steel I could barely move it. No Toto, this isn't Kansas.
 And that's what worries me. Talking with several of Mr. Zedillo's aides and ministers I came away feeling that they are "nice guys," who are in a bit over their heads. They lack what Mexican politicos call "colmillo," or fangs. They need our help, and I think they deserve it. If Mr. Zedillo succeeds, we will finally have the sort of democratic Mexico as a neighbor that we have long coveted. If he fails, there will be an explosive, nationalist backlash here that will certainly spill north.
 "Wall Street can help by giving us a break -- stop attacking us for 90 days," Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz told me Friday. "You don't have to be bullish on Mexico; just stop dumping the peso. Give our plan a chance."
 There is a semi-active volcano east of Mexico City known as "Popo," an Indian word that means smoking mountain. Last December, the same week Mexico announced its disastrous peso devaluation, Popo started to spew smoke and ash, after a long period of inactivity. Let's not fool ourselves. Mexico today is Popo. It is a smoking mountain, and Ernesto Zedillo is sitting on top of it.

HEADLINE: Grover Cleveland's Gold Strategy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your profile of Robert Rubin ("The Education of Robert Rubin," Feb. 5) garbles the historical comparison of present day Mexico with Grover Cleveland's Administration. President Cleveland, a "gold Democrat" and an unflinching defender of the gold standard, did not seek to repeal gold backing for Government bonds. Rather, by convening an extraordinary session of Congress at the height of the financial panic in the summer of 1893, he sought the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890. The Sherman Act, an unholy compromise between Western silver-mining interests and eastern Republican protectionists, had authorized monthly Government purchases of silver, thus adding millions of silver certificates to the nation's money supply. The increase in the money supply undermined the credibility of our commitment to the gold standard in the eyes of our European creditors. Thus, it was the prospect of an inflationary shift to the silver standard, and not the President's actions, that precipitated the European capital flight that had paralyzed the nation's money markets. 
 Unlike Mexico, the United States managed by 1896 to avoid devaluing the dollar. Yet if Newt Gingrich attends to the lessons of history, he should note the way Republican tariff policies, as well as Republican spending on veterans' pensions, aggravated the crisis by depleting the Government's gold reserves when they were needed most.LOREN GATCH Ithaca, N.Y., Feb. 7

HEADLINE: The Israeli-Egyptian Cold Peace Once Fostered Medical Ties

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re your March 7 news article on the bitter debate among Arabs over cultural ties with Israel: It is puzzling to witness the deterioration in attempts at normalization between the Arab countries and Israel. 
 When a disease called Rift Valley Fever threatened the Middle East in 1979, the Camp David peace agreement between Egypt and Israel allowed for the first cooperative health program ever in the region between the Kuvin Center for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Ain Shams University in Cairo.
 This $10 million, 12-year program was financed by the United States Agency for International Development and managed by the National Institutes of Health.
 The program was successful as judged by the publication of 50 joint papers, international meetings held in Egypt and Israel, control of the disease problems we were contracted to deal with, and Israeli scientists working as visiting professors in laboratories in Cairo and Egyptian scientists working in these same cooperative programs in Jerusalem.
 Most of all was the establishment of a core of Middle East scientific talent that became a family of scientists with an esprit de corps whose medical discoveries benefited the region and the world.
 Now the peace has turned cold, and the cultural links Egypt has with Israel are at a minimum to maintain "normalization."
 Some of our dearest Egyptian medical colleagues and scientists have had to seek employment in the Persian Gulf states and elsewhere because they were discouraged or prohibited by governmental authority from cooperating with Israel.
 Egyptian professional bodies still ban cultural exchanges with Israel.
 Our window into the world of Egyptian medical and scientific talent has been a wonderful experience with deep relationships established between dedicated individuals who yearn to see their country prosper. It is shameful that politics is preventing cultural regional cooperation.

HEADLINE: Hit the Poor. Reward the Rich.

 BODY:
The stark unfairness of the House Republicans' legislative agenda was on display last week when committees approved three bills that would drive millions of poor people off welfare in order to finance tax cuts that have been made even more favorable to the rich. The G.O.P. is careering in a destructive direction.
By cutting perhaps $70 billion, or 15 percent, out of poverty programs over five years, the G.O.P. would drive hordes of the poor off welfare without any help in finding jobs. This assault on the indigent cannot be explained away as a necessary belt-tightening to reach a lofty purpose, like cutting the Federal deficit. The Republicans need these cuts now to offset their first round of tax cuts, even before they get down to deficit reduction. 
 Last week they released proposals for cutting taxes that start with the skewed promises in the Contract With America and make them worse by giving less relief than originally planned to low-income families. A large part of the tax cuts goes to upper-income families with capital-gains income, retirement savings accounts and Social Security benefits. Middle-class families with children get a tax credit. But gone are previous proposals to provide refundable tax credits for poor families in two categories -- those with children and those that incur expenses for adoption.
To help pay for these tax cuts, the welfare bills would discard the current pledge to aid every entitled poor person. They would cap Federal spending for cash assistance, food stamps and child welfare and turn over fixed pots of money, called block grants, to the states for them to spend largely at will. These ingredients do not mix well.
Block grants would be callous to the poor and harmful to the economy. When recessions hit, Washington now automatically spends whatever additional welfare money it takes to assist newly impoverished families. But under block grants, welfare money would not increase as the economy soured. Instead, the states would stay within preset spending limits either by raising eligibility standards or reducing benefits. That would eliminate a tool Washington has used to fight off recession: pumping money into the hands of poor consumers.
The Republican bills would also discourage work. States could qualify for block grants either by placing a high percentage of recipients into jobs, a costly exercise, or by reducing welfare rolls. Fiscally strapped states would almost certainly duck spending money on welfare-to-work programs and simply save money by paring caseloads.
Block grants would be destructive for another reason. States compete against one another to attract tax-paying families and corporations. A state that would raise taxes to pay for job placement and other poverty programs would risk repelling taxpayers and attracting poor residents from nearby states.
To embrace the G.O.P. plan, you have to believe at least three tales. First, teen-agers will stop having babies they cannot afford to raise if they face a future without welfare. Second, states will indeed spend money to help the poor in economically strained times. Third, the tax cuts that the G.O.P. proposes will lead to an economic resurgence. Not one of these propositions finds wide support among experts.
On welfare reform, President Clinton's vision has been largely right: he would offer assistance to the indigent if they agreed to undergo training, accept job placement and identify the fathers of welfare babies. The G.O.P.'s vision is largely wrong: it would drive recipients off welfare even if they were willing to play by these reasonable rules.

BYLINE: By Laurel Graeber 

 BODY:
THEY WHISPER
By Robert Olen Butler. Penguin, $10.95.
This novel is a tale of marital hypocrisy in which Ira Holloway, a man of about 35, betrays his wife not only by seducing other women but also by drawing away from her the love of the couple's young son. Presented as Ira's sexual history, it is "a shape-shifting narrative that lingers in the reader's moral consciousness and memory," Jane Smiley said here last year. 

JOSEPHINE: The Hungry Heart
By Jean-Claude Baker and Chris Chase. Adams, $12.95.
Josephine Baker, the alluring singer and dancer who faced racism in American society but became the toast of France in the 1920's, is the subject of this ambivalent biography. She emerges as a talented, determined and brave woman who could also be childish, manipulative and dishonest. Jean-Claude Baker, who was taken under the performer's wing when he was a boy and later adopted her surname, tells the story with Chris Chase, a professional writer. Last year our reviewer, Mindy Aloff, praised the book's "rhetorical fluency and narrative techniques," adding that Baker's "legend is dismantled with a vengeance, yet . . . her humanity is affirmed."
THE BALTIC REVOLUTION: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Path to Independence
By Anatol Lieven. Yale University, $15.
In a revised and updated edition, the author examines the ethnic nationalism of these former Soviet states and its implications for the West. Such a political climate, he argues, fostered the drive for autonomy but also gave rise to authoritarian new governments. His "sensitive account" succeeds in "raising questions, sharpening our vision and forcing us to reconsider our notions," Liah Greenfeld said here in 1993. The future of the former Soviet Union is also explored in the newly revised RUSSIA 2010: And What It Means for the World, by Daniel Yergin and Thane Gustafson (Vintage, $13). Analyzing studies conducted by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm, the authors imagine four possible scenarios: economic collapse, a military dictatorship, miraculous prosperity or civil war. In 1993 our reviewer, Serge Schmemann, said the work is like "a sophisticated board game, challenging the reader." Two books about the dark side of the Soviet past have also been reissued. THE UNQUIET GHOST: Russians Remember Stalin, by Adam Hochschild (Penguin, $12.95), features interviews with both perpetrators and victims of the dictator's repression, as well as their descendants. The result is "a perceptive, intelligent book demonstrating that the significance of the gulag transcends the confines of one country and one generation," Paul Goldberg said here last year. STALIN AGAINST THE JEWS, by Arkady Vaksberg, translated by Antonina W. Bouis (Vintage, $13), discusses the regime's murderous anti-Semitism, which was disguised by giving Jews empty appointments and meaningless awards. Last year one critic said it "draws much important new information to the surface."
THE GRANDMOTHERS' CLUB
By Alan Cheuse. Southern Methodist University, $10.95.
Ordinary life proceeds in extraordinary ways in this novel, which concerns a group of elderly women who discuss the fates of the generations they've spawned. At its center are Minnie Bloch and her son, Manny, a rabbi. It is "a bitter, brilliant series of songs, heartless and tender," Jerome Charyn said here in 1986.
ON LOOKING INTO THE ABYSS: Untimely Thoughts on Culture and Society
By Gertrude Himmelfarb. Vintage, $12.
Post-modern academia is under attack in these seven essays, which underscore the dangers of espousing "value-free principles" and regarding morality as a variable to be manipulated. Last year our reviewer, Michael Howard, said, "They are unashamedly and enjoyably bellicose, and their succinct form makes them all the more effective." Miss Himmelfarb's 1968 collection, VICTORIAN MINDS (Ivan R. Dee, $16.95), has also been restored to print. In this intellectual history she analyzes the philosophies of thinkers ranging from Edmund Burke to John Buchan. "She is always sharp, and often original," John Clive said here.
THE FLIGHT OF PETER FROMM
By Martin Gardner. Prometheus, $15.95.
Is religious belief justified, and if so, what kind? These are the questions posed by the author, whose main characters, a lapsed Pentecostal divinity student and his skeptical Unitarian teacher, dramatize the possible answers. In 1973 our reviewer, Martin Levin, called the book "a brilliantly illuminating metaphysical novel."
THE PAINTED ALPHABET
By Diana Darling. Graywolf, $12.
Myth and magic blend in this tale of a Balinese peasant who travels into the mountains with his wife and niece, seeking enlightenment through the teachings of a holy man. Based on a traditional Balinese dance drama, the novel "is a vastly entertaining story, told with warmth, humor and wisdom," Edward Hower said here in 1992.
SILK HOPE, NC
By Lawrence Naumoff. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11.
When two sisters inherit the family farm, their reactions illustrate the different ways of regarding home: as a refuge to preserve or as an encumbrance to flee. Last year our reviewer, Linda Barrett Osborne, found the novel "irresistible . . . a love note to the American past."
DEADLINE
By Gerry Boyle. Berkley, $4.99.
A burned-out newsman leaves New York City for Maine, where he is to edit a small mill town's weekly paper. Instead of peace, he finds murder and corruption. This is "a bone-cracking first novel" that "strongly conveys that stark terror of isolation," Marilyn Stasio said here in 1993. LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: HOUSES AS ART;
The Masterpieces They Call Home

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger; Paul Goldberger, chief cultural correspondent for The New York Times, won a Pulitzer Prize for his architectural criticism.

 BODY:
WHEN I FIRST SAW the model in the architect's ffice, long before construction began, it struck me as a case of overbearing architectural hubris. The arrogance of it all -- those huge logs, fastened together with steel, serving as columns to support this vast gable confronting the snow-capped peaks. Who needed such monumentality? Weren't the mountains monumental enough? What kind of people would build such a house?
Then I went west to see it. The house, by Cesar Pelli, architect of notable skyscrapers like the World Financial Center in New York but of few private dwellings, turned out to be -- well, surely no modest cottage in the woods (it's 10,000 square feet on 90 acres) but much more than the rich person's extravagance I had feared. 
 It had an aura, a presence, that only true works of architecture possess: it managed, in a way that seemed almost mystical, to be at once powerful and endearing. The house is long and tall, organized around a central spine of columns made of huge logs. The spine functions as a kind of interior street, running down the middle of the structure and reaching up to support a pitched roof. The rooms of the house are placed on both sides of this central spine, which also contains the stair and balconies overlooking the double-height living room. The rest of the exterior is formed by more log columns, with panels of wood and glass set in between them.
The design merges worlds that by all normal measure have nothing to do with each other: the sleekness of modernism married to the embracing warmth of a log cabin. And for all the hugeness and luxury (the house cost several million dollars), in the end it celebrates the land far more than it defies it. This house possesses human warmth but also the essential quality of all art, which is the ability to make us see the world in a slightly different way. I thought of Frank Lloyd Wright; I thought of Wright's Arkansas follower, E. Fay Jones; but I thought most of all of Cesar Pelli and how he had designed something that is not like any building I had seen before.
The experience of visiting this house gave me pause. It reminded me of the first rule of architecture criticism -- that nothing ever matters except the real building. More, the visit underscored the extent to which -- for all that has happened in architecture, for all that has happened in the economy, for all that has happened in the evolution of cities -- the design of the single-family, private house remains an architectural touchstone. Houses are still what many architects want most to build, even though they take more time, cause more stress and earn lower fees than most commercial projects. They are utterly irrelevant socially. Yet they are architecture's laboratory. The creation of a serious, ambitious house -- a house that will serve not merely as a sign of wealth but also as a sign of cultivation -- has an allure to certain clients like no other way of spending money.
Houses may be the last form of private artistic patronage. Few of the rich commission paintings or sculpture any longer, or support the writing and performance of music, and when these things do occur in our time, they tend to be public events, not private ones. But at the end of the 20th century, a house can be what a piece of chamber music was in the 18th century: a work of art commissioned for the owner and his friends alone. When a person of means orders a house from a serious architect, it is pure patronage, not philanthropy. It does no good for anyone except the owner and the architect.
In an age when most of the arts have become relentlessly democratic, the commissioning of an architecturally ambitious house is a statement of private connoisseurship. No one will see it unless the owner wants them to; in some instances, no one will even know that it exists, since far from seeing their act of patronage as a means to fame, a great many of the builders of patronage houses avoid publicity like the plague. The owners of the Pelli house in the mountains hesitated for a year before allowing pictures of it to be published here, and when they finally said yes, they insisted that their names not be used, even though they are as proud of the house as if they had designed it themselves.
Important houses, no matter how private, do have a way of coming to light, first in design magazines and then in the architectural history books, where they influence other architects and shape the developing taste of architectural students. Architectural fashions shift slowly. But patronage houses can change them profoundly: there is no question that the architecture of our time would be different if, say, Robert Venturi had never designed his 1962 house for his mother or Charles Gwathmey had not designed his 1966 house for his parents, both celebrated masterworks of patronage in our age. (See "Be They Never So Humble," page 60).
Of course, the Gwathmey and Venturi houses were built for patrons who, like the architects themselves, had more zeal (in their case, parental zeal) than money. Most of today's patrons are different: they are rich and also anxious about how their houses will play in the outside world, particularly in the supposedly pared-down 90's. A patronage house may be important enough to find its way into architectural history, but it is an outrageous thing to spend your money on -- millions of dollars and countless hours struggling with an architect to get a roof over your head and, moreover, a roof that doesn't look like anyone else's, so that it will likely be all the harder to sell someday. (Try selling a Frank Gehry house. Gehry tried to sell his own celebrated house in Santa Monica, Calif., a remake of a Dutch colonial house that looks as if it had been partly deconstructed, and after two years and no nibbles he gave up and stayed there.)
And yet. Virtually all of the patrons I spoke to seem driven by the determination to embark on a creative act. It is not only because they see what passes for elegance and grandeur in the standard upscale American house -- those garish, 20,000-square-foot imitation Taras -- as vulgar and boring. They see their patronage as a kind of mad adventure. All of them, from the clients who have had a lifelong interest in architecture to the clients who came into it barely having heard of Frank Lloyd Wright, seem to embark on the process in search of some connection to the making of art.
Surely that is why Frank Gehry, the soft-spoken California architect whose work is now in such demand, has had so little luck in persuading his most extravagant house client, a Cleveland insurance company owner named Peter Lewis, to cut back on the house he is designing for him -- a house that is now estimated to cost some $30 million. (Architects generally negotiate their fees as a percentage of a project's construction cost, and there is quite a range: from a low of 10 percent to a high of 25 percent. Usually, the more complex the project, the higher the percentage, with 15 to 20 percent the most common.)
"I'm a do-gooder Jewish liberal to the core, and it's hard for me to think I'm solving any problems doing a rich guy's house," Gehry says. "I said to him, 'Why don't you just build a little $5 million house and give the rest to charity?' Do you know what he said to me? He said: 'Look, I'm going to give lots to charity -- this is only a small part of my wealth -- and can't I have this one indulgence in my life? It may be a folly, but I would like to be identified with this kind of effort.' "
 ONCE -- AS RECENTLY AS 30 or 40 years ago -- it cost a hefty but not an insane amount of money to commission an architect to design a house, and often the most important houses, the ones that pushed ahead the art of architecture, were modest ones, houses designed for people who had more artistic daring than cash. Some of Frank Lloyd Wright's most important clients were schoolteachers and journalists and academics who came to him with bags of cash representing their life savings and they got wonderful, if small, houses, just like Charles Gwathmey's parents.
But if Gwathmey's parents, an artist and a photographer, came now to Amagansett, L.I., where their house was completed in 1966, they would probably be laughed out of town by the first real-estate agent who heard their budget ($35,000, the equivalent of $165,000 today). It costs so much to build even the smallest custom-designed house that there aren't very many small custom-designed houses being built, period. Hiring an architect to create something special has become almost exclusively a sport of the rich.
The people who do embark on this mad indulgence seem to fall into three general categories: the patrons who are motivated by pure belief, for whom the house is a chance to prove the glory of architecture; the patrons motivated by hubris, for whom the house is a trophy, a chance to prove their own stature, and the patrons motivated by the collecting instinct, for whom the house is another way of indulging in a larger process of acquiring art. These, at least, are the conscious patrons. But there is also, I think, a fourth kind of patron, the accidental patron, the client who does not intentionally start out on the mission of building a serious house but who finds a talented architect, establishes a comfortable relationship with him and, in the process of fulfilling the basic needs of a house, ends up transcending them and creating a great work.
DEEDIE ROSE, A DALLAS art collector and president of the Dallas Museum of Art, might well be the Platonic version of the architecture-believing patron. A longtime lover of great buildings, she set out from the beginning to produce a house that would not only shelter her family but would communicate to them and to her friends her enthusiasms and even, she hoped, in some way advance the art of architecture. Rose began by hiring Lawrence Speck, dean of the University of Texas School of Architecture, not to design the house himself but to put together a list of important architects around the country and advise her on how to choose among them. She then embarked on a national tour to meet these architects and see their work. The process -- which Rose called "more fun than anything I've done in my life" -- took three months. It finally brought Rose and her husband together with Antoine Predock, an Albuquerque-based architect who designed a sprawling, crisply geometric structure of concrete, glass and steel that has gotten Dallas talking more than any piece of architecture since I. M. Pei's Symphony Center.
Like all of Predock's work, the Rose house is a striking abstraction, at once sleek, sensuous and minimal. The front of the Rose house is a series of terraced limestone planes, planted with local flora; the entry tunnels through this mass of masonry. This is not a design that makes any pretense of relating to its neighbors; indeed, on a street of banal suburban houses its blunt geometries hit you like a ton of, well, limestone. Once through the door, however, the house breaks wide open and creates its own universe: the interior is a set of bright, sharply angled spaces, with huge walls of glass facing a stunning site overlooking Turtle Creek. The climax is the "skyramp": a black steel bridge extending out 60 feet from the cylindrical dining room and rising 35 feet up into the trees. It is a platform intended to give Rose's husband, who is an avid bird watcher, a place to pursue his hobby. But since it literally slices into the sky, it has become a kind of exclamation point for the entire house, an exuberant burst that counters the sharp forms and concrete walls of the interior spaces.
Rose's earnestness led her, at first, to put almost too much trust in Predock. "We described to him what we wanted from the house -- a sense of mystery, a place that would unfold gradually, architecture that would delight," she says. "But I never told him how I wanted it to look. After all, he is the architect, and he came up with something that never in 1,000 years could I have dreamed up.
"Then, about halfway through, we thought we were done and I realized I couldn't do a furniture arrangement in the living room. I called him up and said: 'Antoine, how could you put a sofa in the living room? Where can I hang a painting?' It made me realize I hadn't taken the responsibility I should have as a good client, because he couldn't see inside my mind and I hadn't told him everything I needed. We had a very tense couple of days and had to redo all the construction drawings, but we came back to the same design and made it work."
That Rose saw this problem as her failing and not the architect's may say more about her graciousness as a patron than about the realities of the architectural process. Predock recalls Rose as "very insightful, very impressive -- her patronage extended even to the ecology of the site, to the way the house would use native Texas plants and materials." As to the changes made just before construction started, he admits there were some tense moments but minimizes the conflicts in retrospect and says that despite her last minute crisis of confidence in the design, Rose "never messed around with the main flow of experience in the house."
PETER LEWIS, FRANK Gehry's wealthy Cleveland client, must be the most striking example in the country right now of patron motivated by hubris -- the patron who views his house as a trophy. An intense, wiry, energetic man, he has yet to see one bit of construction on his place. He has spent nearly eight years working with Gehry on design after design for a 35,000-square-foot house that Lewis himself calls "a blatant bid for immortality on my part -- it could be another Fallingwater." (The evolution of Gehry's thinking about the house is shown above.)
"I had never heard of Frank Gehry before I went to a lecture of his, and afterward I called him up and said I just bought a piece of property and do you want to do the greatest house you ever did?" Lewis says.
"He wants to push the limits," Gehry says of Lewis. "He has paid for experiments in technology so that we can use the most advanced materials; he has commissioned Philip Johnson to work along with me doing a guest house; he's brought in Richard Serra, Larry Bell, other artists -- the more we push it, the more excited he seems to get."
The Lewis house, if it gets built according to the current design, is a set of seemingly discordant curving elements, arranged around a central courtyard that can be used for large parties. The various elements are made of different materials -- glass, stone, metal -- and in the plan, they combine to create a sense of swirling form. Much of the success of Gehry's work has always come from his tight juxtapositions of contrasting forms and materials, and it is difficult not to wonder whether expanding it to this huge scale, not to mention this level of grandeur, will diminish the intensity that is so essential to his architecture.
Unlike most trophy patrons, who are wild with impatience, Lewis seems willing to wait for Gehry. Indeed, he seems almost to care about the process as much as the product. And for all his determination to build a house that will put his name in the architecture books, he has not been particularly involved in the esthetics of the design. He has given Gehry nearly carte blanche. And when asked what he likes best about the design, he hesitates, then speaks about how his philosophy in business is to hire good people and give them plenty of room.
"I did say I wanted to build a space where a man and a woman could live together in a perfect arrangement, a place where you could have grand parties, an indoor pool and the greatest bathroom in the world," he says. But the rest was up to Gehry. "I'm interested in artists, in creative people. I've paid Frank whatever he's billed and told him to push the envelope."
VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE trophy patron is the collector patron, who may have some elements of the other types but is not nearly as attached to the house being built for him. Richard Ekstract, a former New York publisher of electronics magazines who is now chairman of the Home Office Association of America, is the collector patron par excellence. Within not much more than a decade, he has renovated one house with Robert A. M. Stern and built one with Alexander Gorlin, and for the last two years, he and his wife have occupied a house by Diana Agrest and Mario Gandelsonas -- which they have now put on the market so that they can commission another architect to build them another house.
"I like creating new things -- I like the process," Ekstract says. "Everyone says to me, Are you crazy? But I would hope that the next house we do would be even more exciting. I guess I'm like those deal makers -- going from one deal to the next."
All of the Ekstract houses are within a few miles of one other in the Hamptons on eastern Long Island, where the chief local crop sometimes seems to be the latest house to come forth from the drawing boards of Gwathmey, Stern, Jaquelin T. Robertson or Richard Meier. Even in this company, the Agrest and Gandelsonas house is a striking presence. A kind of exploded farmhouse, it consists of traditional architectural tropes that say "house" arranged to look like abstract elements. The main rooms are set in a long wing with a low, vaulted roof; projecting from it are several wooden towers containing bedrooms and a glass, silolike form with a study at its base and a master bathroom above. A freestanding wooden gazebo, a kind of tree house without a tree, is perched on the lawn, reached via a bridge from the master bedroom. Beside the pool is a stark stucco wall in the manner of Luis Barragan, but sliced by a pair of wooden sheds containing cabana rooms, a perfect metaphor for the way in which the house attempts to put common imagery into a starkly dramatic new context.
"I said I wanted a traditional country house," Ekstract says, "but Mario waxes very poetic. He can be mesmerizing. You get caught up in the momentwhen he is talking to you and you feel you are making history. I would tell him we needed room for our art. He would say the house should be the art, that everything here should challenge your eye."
But if his needs were not being fulfilled in the house, why did he give in? Should he not have questioned the architects more along the way? "You know, I'm a trustee of the New Museum; I collect art. If I were not respectful of the cutting edge, I'd be a hypocrite," he says.
While Ekstract may recall having been dragged, kicking and screaming, by his architects, they remember differently. "Richard saw a project for another house we did in East Hampton that was never built and said he loved it and wanted us to do something similar for him," Diana Agrest says. "When we were designing the house for him, we kept trying to keep it simpler and he kept wanting more, more, more."
Conflicting versions of history notwithstanding, the Ekstract house is actually more comfortable than its startling form at first suggests. It is logically planned, with a master suite reachable by a private stairs on the other side of the house from the three guest bedrooms. And there is large and comfortable space for both indoor and outdoor entertaining. It was exceptionally difficult to construct, however. The first contractor who worked on the house had serious financial problems and left the job; the house was finally finished by a second builder. The only ventilation in the master bedroom comes from a door to the gazebo, since the windows were finally nailed shut -- this being the only way to stop them from warping and leaking. It is the only one of several patronage houses I visited that had significant post-construction problems -- and the only one in which architect and client ended the process no longer speaking.
"I would ask them to accept responsibility and they would say, 'We're theoreticians, we're intellectuals,' " Ekstract says. "I said to them, If you felt that way, why did you build a real house?"
The architects, not surprisingly, remember it differently. Diana Agrest says: "I don't build a house just to deal with a theoretical issue, never. Actually, Richard was very good as a patron -- it only became difficult at the end, when we started having problems with the contractor."
The Ekstract house has mellowed considerably in the two years since it was finished, as the wooden sections have faded to a natural, weather-beaten gray, the landscaping has grown in and the sharp-edged forms have become less startling. Indeed, the real surprise of this house is how, now that it has lost its power to shock, it retains a power to please.
IF RICHARD EKSTRACT WAS somewhat of an inadvertent patron in his most recent effort, the Laybournes were truly accidental patrons. Geraldine Laybourne, president of Nickelodeon, the children's television network, and her husband, Kit, an independent film producer, hired the Berkeley-based Richard Fernau and Laura Hartman to design their vacation house in Colorado after their misgivings about an earlier scheme by another architect led them to decide not to build it. The intention was to construct a relaxed country house that would encourage a sense of involvement with the land and what resulted was a casual compound of buildings, a kind of gentle, modernist play on a Colorado mining camp that hints at a certain funkiness but is, in fact, as carefully composed as anything by Mies van der Rohe.
Richard Fernau is uncomfortable with the whole notion of patronage and says he likes to think of the Laybournes less as patrons than as collaborators. "The idea of carte blanche, of letting the architect do whatever he wants, is antithetical to the way we work," he says. "I think it is almost pornographic. We do not think of our work as having one meaning that clients get in the way of. We are much more interested in having real involvement with our clients, in having the client become part authors of what we are doing."
The Laybournes, Fernau says, gave him and Hartman only "extremely vague" instructions. The couple had produced a 30-page memorandum for their first architect, and when all that attention to detail didn't yield the house they wanted, they decided to move entirely in the opposite direction -- to architects they could bond with. "We spent a lot of time together getting to know each other," Fernau recalls. "We would go to Colorado and look at old mining areas; we would walk the land; we would have dinner and drink lots of wine."
"Richard actually watched Nickelodeon to try to learn more about me," Geraldine Laybourne says. "He and Laura wanted to figure out our personalities."
The sense of a natural, easy collaboration that arose between the Laybournes and Fernau and Hartman does not in itself guarantee a workable house, of course. Frank Lloyd Wright and Edgar Kaufmann, the great patron who built Fallingwater, perhaps the most important patronage house of the 20th century, liked each other's company and became good friends, but it did not spare Fallingwater from leaks. Gwathmey's de Menil house in East Hampton, a magnificent modernist villa, has an awkwardly proportioned living room and an uncomfortably tight stairs; Pelli's spectacular house in the West has a poorly thought-out relationship between the entry drive and the front door, leading most visitors to come in through the garage.
Nor is this tension between art and livability a new one. The Villa Rotonda by Palladio was not exactly livable and Monticello certainly wasn't, unless you were Thomas Jefferson. Le Corbusier's Villa Savoie is controlling, rigid, absolute in its crisp determination to symbolize the machine age -- but it is profoundly exhilarating. If this is oppression, then this is a house that makes you want to be oppressed. So, too, with the greatest patronage houses of the postwar era. Of course, there is no privacy in Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House or its great sibling, Philip Johnson's Glass House, but there is utter magnificence. And why should the shortcomings of these houses matter to those of us who do not have to sleep in them? (When the Glass House was new, one visitor sniffed that it was all very nice, but she certainly couldn't live there. "I haven't asked you to, Madam," was Philip Johnson's reply.)
ROBERT A. M. STERN, WHO HAS designed some of the grandest and most ambitious houses of the last decade, has made his reputation largely by rejecting the argument that an overwhelming esthetic experience is worth sacrificing the comfort of daily life. To Stern, people who tolerate difficult modernist houses are the architecture world's equivalent of fashion victims, highly cultivated sheep being led into foolishness by huge egos. Stern argues that a talented architect's highest contribution should not be to invent new form but to take traditional elements like space, proportion and detail and produce them more skillfully and organize them more inventively than a builder or a lesser architect might be able to do.
"I think a really good architect has a sense of how spaces unfold visually, how you get people to move through space, how people really live," Stern says. "The house is the one kind of building that is experienced day in and day out by the same people, not like a museum you go to just a handful of times. It is a series of extraordinarily complex specifics that an architect has to put together and end up with something general enough to be understood by a lot of people."
In his insistence that it is part of the goal of the serious house to be comprehensible and readable -- that it be what he calls "in the most profound way sensible" -- Stern is somewhat of a renegade, almost a Luddite. Most leading architects who design houses, if too clever to risk alienating clients by openly discounting comfort, seem almost to feel that acknowledging the search for comfort as a primary goal in design would be akin to admitting a weakness. To Stern, that weakness is a strength. In a sense, his work is not unlike that of the great revivalists of the 1920's, architects like David Adler, Delano & Aldrich and James Gamble Rogers who served the rich not by challenging their beliefs but by giving them the highest quality possible of the tried and true.
While Stern is not completely alone among serious architects of the first rank who design in mainly traditional styles -- there is, for example, Jaquelin T. Robertson, whose shingled manses and historicizing villas rival Stern's and whose client list is at least as well populated with prominent members of the Wall Street aristocracy of the 1980's -- the clear majority of patronage houses being built now are much more modernist in style. The determined architecture victims of today have gone back to modernism. In fact, if patronage houses as a group were to be taken as an index of where American architecture is going, it would be hard not to conclude that the post-modern revolution of the 1980's is more or less over.
There is nothing radical now about going back into history, as there was in the late 1970's and early 1980's when the work of Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown still seemed startling and Philip Johnson and John Burgee could shock the world by proposing a skyscraper like their AT&T building with its Chippendale top. Back then, the art patrons Peter and Sandra Brant, who built a notable Venturi house in 1970 in Greenwich, Conn., could appear to be moving even closer to the cutting edge by commissioning the distinguished classical architect Allan Greenberg to build them a mansion inspired by Mount Vernon, as they did in 1983.
But once the prosperity of the 1980's sent demand for traditional architecture soaring, often more because it looked opulent than because it had a serious message to impart, all connections between traditional architecture and the cutting edge disappeared. It became harder and harder for architects like Stern, Robertson and Greenberg to distinguish their work from that of their lesser competitors who produce traditional houses for the rich without any real intellectual aspirations. Not that their work is the same as the garish Georgian manses and Spanish villas and French chateaus put up by builders; far from it. It's just that the difference between their houses and the grand pretensions of the suburban landscape often comes down to subtleties like better proportions and finer detailing. There isn't a different intellectual concept underlying the serious architect's version of a traditional house; it's just more likely to be done with sophistication, intelligence and restraint.
THAT SAID, IT SHOULD NOT BE surprising that the modernist firm of Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel has emerged as perhaps the apotheosis of patronage architecture: the one to see if you are rich, take architecture seriously and want to commission a house that will be widely recognized as Important. Hiring Gwathmey Siegel involves a commitment not only of vast funds but of a willingness on the part of the client to accept Gwathmey and Siegel's design style and process of working. If you hire Gwathmey, you want not only his name but also his particular brand of modernism, influenced by the modernist master Le Corbusier but in some ways even more determinedly abstract, more rigidly formalist, more concerned with the interpenetration of spatial volumes than Le Corbusier was. And probably more obsessive in its regard to detail.
"We don't compromise on certain principles of architecture and order," Robert Siegel says, "but those principles can be adjusted and tuned to an endless variety to respond to a client's needs."
In other words, a Gwathmey Siegel house looks like a Gwathmey Siegel house. But not all Gwathmey Siegel houses look exactly alike. A client's site, his budget and his program -- how many bedrooms, how much entertaining space, the need for such things as a home office or gym or screening room or playroom -- obviously play a role in determining the final form. But these things must be fit into Gwathmey and Siegel's continuing quest to explore the nature of architectural space.
"A house is the architectural problem in microcosm," says Gwathmey, who adds that clients come to him and his partner because "they endorse the idea of making a house a work of art, of being part of the process of making the history of architecture."
Modesty is not a virtue often found in the architects of patronage houses. Gwathmey is celebrated both for his stubbornness with clients who he feels are unsympathetic to his ideas and for his patience with clients who are. "Charles is a remarkable teacher," Siegel says. "He can spend endless time to make a person comfortable -- if he feels that person is responsive."
And if he doesn't? Woe to the client. Gwathmey, who may be architecture's most perplexing combination of hotheadedness and gentleness, has been known to explode at clients, to write them angry letters and to resist to the end unwanted changes in his designs. But his passions have earned the loyalty of a remarkable array of powerful people like David Geffen, Steven Spielberg (who is now on his fifth Gwathmey project, an apartment renovation in New York) and Ronald Lauder, to mention just a few. Gwathmey clients, as a rule, are not easily intimidated. They relish the give and take that working with Charles Gwathmey entails. There is an allure to Gwathmey, particularly in the entertainment business, where for many clients he is the man you have to get into the ring with to prove that you're big time.
One Gwathmey client in the movie business, who insisted that his name not be used, recalls the period when his house was being designed as exhilarating. "We really did collaborate," he says, "but it worked because of my background, which is to deal with creative people every day. Their value is their vision, yet it needs to be guided into practicality. A house is not a monument -- people have to go to the bathroom. We were always saying things like 'No, you can't have stone on the floor there; it's too cold or too noisy.' But I wanted a Charles Gwathmey house, not a house by me, and so every time I said no to something, I was smart enough to leave it up to him to find a substitute. By the end, all the ideas in the house were still his, not mine."
WHOEVER THE CLIENT AND whatever the relationship, the house is the arena in which an architect can express his ideas most easily. Architects who routinely design skyscrapers and museums crave the chance to do houses if only because there is no purer testing ground for architectural issues. When the family that built the large Pelli house out West first approached Pelli, it was in the hope that he would provide a referral to another architect, since the husband had met Pelli on one of his skyscraper projects and respected his judgment. Pelli, a suave Argentinian-born architect who could be played by the actor Ricardo Montalban, said he would like to do the job himself: that after dozens of huge commercial buildings, he wanted to design a house.
William Pedersen, the chief design partner in the firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox, has done the same thing. In two recent houses, one in Vermont and another on Shelter Island, L.I., Pedersen, whose practice consists mostly of high-rise and institutional buildings, was desperately eager to break out of corporate work and spread his wings as a designer. In a sense the two houses are almost a form of validation for Pedersen, whose commercial work, for all its strength, offers far less leeway for expression. He may have designed dozens of skyscrapers, but he needed those houses to gain a certain kind of credibility as an architect.
It is a paradox: an architect who designs only houses is viewed as too small-time and inexperienced to take on major public buildings; yet an architect who designs no houses at all is viewed as lacking a certain esthetic legitimacy. Early in an architect's career, he or she often gets nothing but houses to design, so they are the places in which a style is created and refined; the houses done later in a career prove that an architect can still dance a deft solo and still has creative juices flowing.
WHILE ARCHITECTS like Robert Venturi and Michael Graves continue to produce occasional houses that quite brilliantly reinterpret traditional form in a newer, more challenging way, most of the houses that seem to be pushing the art forward deal in one way or another with issues of abstraction. It may be the Gwathmey Siegel search for a pure, abstracted kind of space, coolly divorced from direct connections to culture. It may be the Japanese architect Tadao Ando's sensuous forms in concrete, even sparer than Gwathmey Siegel's. It may be Richard Meier's exceptionally elegant compositions, pristine objects intended to prove that abstraction can, in its way, be shimmeringly beautiful (a new Meier house now rising in Texas summarizes 30 years of this quest with exceptional grace). Or it may be the approach of a younger generation of architects, influenced both by Frank Gehry and the Deconstructivists of the late 1980's, who seem to want to celebrate blunt structure, hard-edged materials and juxtapositions of angular form and space. To these architects, the celebration of conventional "house-ness" in the manner of a Stern design is mere sentimentality, barely a step above Disneyland.
There is plenty of romanticism to these neo-modernists, of course, though few are naive enough to take on the utopian dreams of the early modern architects who inspire them. The modernism of today is far less innocent: it has no intention of changing the world, and the sensibility of its architects has been shaped not only by their modernist forefathers but by their post-modern parents. Today's modernism rejects both the pieties of modernism's rejection of history and the pieties of post-modernism's insistence on returning to history.
There are some younger architects, like Eric Owen Moss of Los Angeles, who take it all one step further. They believe it is the responsibility of serious architecture to question values and that the most valid way for a house to become memorable is for it to challenge its occupants. Moss sees his aggressive and powerful compositions, with their sharp forms and odd angles, as a way of deliberately upsetting the visual, and ultimately the psychological, status quo of their owners. As a bleak novel or a film noir can inspire profound, if disturbing, thoughts about the human condition, so Moss wants his houses to shake their occupants out of complacency. He is interested neither in the purely formal search of Gwathmey and Siegel nor in the feel-good architecture of Stern, both of which, in the end, aspire to present to the world a kind of order, a sense of certainty. In its very disorder, Moss wants his architecture to carry a message about uncertainty -- even about the discordance and anguish of human society.
Is that a lot to cope with? Obviously. But the owners of patronage houses want more than mere shelter, as the patrons who commissioned Bach concertos wanted more than background music. Patronage contains more than an element of ego and even -- let's come right out and say it -- narcissism. Patrons want to create something that will last beyond them.
And sometimes it does, as in the case of the handful of houses -- Fallingwater, the Villa Savoie, the Glass House -- that have become 20th-century icons as powerful as Picasso's "Demoiselles d'Avignon" or Stravinsky's "Sacre du Printemps." Most patronage houses do not become cultural artifacts, of course; they are still houses, houses whose main purpose is to shelter their owners with a degree of emotional intensity that they could not find elsewhere.
Many of these houses affect the culture in another way, however, which is that they tend to influence other houses: architecture begets more architecture, as architects (and clients) see it and want something like it or something that melds what they see with demands of their own. And no matter how much architects would like it to be thought that their designs spring full-blown from their brows, architecture, all architecture, is inevitably shaped by other architecture.
FRANK ISRAEL IS A LOS Angeles architect who is producing what is perhaps the most important cutting-edge residential work in California, after Frank Gehry. His most recent house, in the Berkeley area, was designed for a client who told him she wanted something different, something that, as she put it to Israel, would enrich her life and the lives of her husband and their children. The client, Sharon Drager, a vascular surgeon, got an angular house of copper and stucco that is tightly composed and beautifully crafted, riding the prow of a hill like a -- well, like a house. The startling thing about this house is that, for all that the architect and client were joined in their belief that it should be different, it is not, in the end, so unusual. It is not a spaceship or an explosion or a piece of sculpture. It is more like an essay on the continuing evolution of modernism, a structure that gracefully melds the sensibility of early modernism with that of today.
The success of the Drager house underscores the extent to which the modern versus post-modern argument may have become irrelevant. A house is a house, and houses are almost invariably about other houses, however much their architects may want us to think that they are completely original creations. This is the real way in which patronage houses have an effect on society: they influence other houses, not literally (nothing is more pointless than a copy of a house designed to be unique) but by letting their ideas seep into new places. For it is impossible to completely reinvent the idea of the house, and few architects, however radical their purely architectural impulses, are foolish enough to try. Whether it is a Stern mansion paying quite literal homage to the Spanish colonial (as in a recent design for a sumptuous mansion outside Houston) or an abstract essay in copper, wood and stucco by a Frank Gehry protege, the underlying architectural theme is still the idea of the house itself, the tension and energy that springs out of the conflict between an architect's notions of form and a family's notions of how it wants to live.
These two things are always somewhat at war, except in houses where either side has abdicated. When the architect abdicates, there is no architecture and that is the end of the story. When the client abdicates, things are rarely much better, since almost invariably an architect's best work comes out of a strong, sometimes even painful, dialogue between client and architect. If the client who can only say no is impossible to contend with, the client who can only say yes is not really any better. The client who loves architecture so much he leaves his architect alone may not be serving architecture at all, for the truth of architecture is that its essence comes out of turning mundane, real-world needs into art. When those needs are thrown to the winds, the dialectic out of which architecture happens no longer exists.
This, in the end, may be the real test of a great patron: not only a love of architecture and an ample bank account but a clear vision to present to an architect. By a vision I do not mean a design scheme but a set of goals and a willingness to hold one's ground when the architect wants to push too far from those goals. If the client holds too firmly, the architect's ideas may be crushed; if he does not hold at all, the ideas lack the connection to the real world that makes a house something more than just a building that could be built anywhere for anyone. Patronage houses are not only challenges from architects. At their best, they are challenges from the patrons.

Gwathmey Siegel
DE MENIL HOUSE, EAST HAMPTON, L.I. (1983)
This moderist villa by the sea was built for Francois de Menil, who was so captivated by being an architectural patron that he gave up a career as a film producer and became an architect himself. It is one of Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel's most self-assured houses, marrying the crispness of their earlier work to the formal, monumental grandeur of a traditional mansion. (Norman McGrath)
 
Walter Chatham
CHATHAM HOUSE, SEASIDE, FLA. (1988)
Chatham built this two-part house for his family, and it immediately caused an uproar: Seaside is one of the nation's most carefully planned neotraditional communities, and Chatham's crisp structure struck many as an attempt to sneak moderism past Seaside's gingerbread guardians. It was, but Chatham broke none of Seaside's strict design guidelines, deftly proving that you can reinvent traditional architectural form if you know what you are doing. (Michael Moran)
 
Frank Gehry
SCHNABEL HOUSE, LOS ANGELES (1989)
"I always wanted to take an 80-by-100-foot lot and create a village," is how Gehry explains the genesis of this house, built in the Brentwood section for Marna and Rockwell Schnable. The basic idea here: each room is a separate pavilion with a different geometric shape, and together the pavilions make a sculptural and architectural whole. (Grant Mudford)
 
Simon Ungers and Tom Kinslow
T HOUSE, WILTON, N.Y. (1992)
This house, named for its shape, directly expresses the aspirations of its owner, Lawrence Marcelle. The dominant form of the structure is a two-story-high, 44-foot-long library, cantilevered over a lower wing that contains a living room, kitchen and bedroom. The message: a rigorous symbolic order in which the functions of daily life support and elevate the higher pursuits. (Eduard Hueber/Arch Photo)
 
Josh Schweitzer
MONUMENT HOUSE, JOSHUA TREE, CALIF. (1990)
Architecture for the desert, in living color. Schweitzer and two friends built this house for their own use. The interiors are simple and matter-of-fact; it is the stucco exterior, three boxes with trapezoidal cutouts for windows and an entry porch, that gives this small place its combination of starkness, playfulness and monumentality -- and its remarkable ability to stand powerfully against the desert landscape. (Tom Bonner)
 
W. G. Clark and Charles Menefee
REID HOUSE, JOHNS ISLAND, S.C. (1987)
Clark and Menefee merged influences as diverse as farm sheds and Palladian villas to create this very modern whole. It's a structure that manages at once to be monumental and intimate. Here, traditional form is brilliantly reinterpreted, as in the 14-foot windows opening onto a two-story living space. (Mick Hales)
 
Charles W. Moore
MOORE HOUSE, AUSTIN, TEX. (1984)
Moore, who died in 1993, was one of the few architects who designed houses for himself throughout his career; this was his last, a container for his collections of toys, models, books and memorabilia. The living room is a highly complex set of spaces in which every step, every window, every piece of molding plays a role in a larger, tightly scripted drama of architectural pleasure. (Timothy Hursley)
 
Steven Holl
STRETTO HOUSE, DALLAS (1992)
Several themes are interwoven here: proportions based on the golden section; rhythms based on the connections between the curving roof sections and the concrete-block masses of the house itself, and, most important, the way the house's form echoes the site, marked by three spring-fed pools and cascades. (Paul Warchol)
 
Richard Meier
GROTTA HOUSE, HARDING TOWNSHIP, N.J. (1989)
Meier's pristine, elegant houses have been a stunning presence for a generation, and while Meier's basic stance is unchanged, he continues to refine, refine, refine. It's all in the sureness of composition as shown here: a half-cylinder plays off beautifully against the structure's straight lines and solid masses. Modernism not at the cutting edge, but with the lightness and nimbleness of a dancer. (Scott Frances/Esto)
 
Frank Isreal
GOLDBERG--BEAN HOUSE, HOLLYWOOD (1992)
An exuberant play on the style of the 1950's, this is one of the most sensuous of patron houses. It's a place in which the love of color, shape and texture is brilliantly joined to the discipline and rigor normally associated with more somber, late-moderist enterprises. (Grant Mudford);

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
What of Cities If the Blueprint Is Republican?

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
IS ARCHITECTURE LIKELY TO BE affected by the Republican agenda? How can it not be? Architecture is a social art. To a more or less conspicuous degree, every building bears the imprint of the social contract. And last November's elections expressed a national desire to renegotiate the terms of that contract. Sooner or later, that desire will express itself in built form. If things go according to the Contract With America, architects can at least look forward to a brisk trade designing prisons.
A correctional facility may not be every architect's idea of a dream commission, but it could stand as a good symbol for the grim mood in which much of the profession now finds itself. Thus far, the 90's have not been golden years for architecture. Many architects were thrown out of work by the recession and remain underemployed, at least by standards of the 1980's. Some feel cut adrift by the absence of a unifying ideology or style. Others are feeling displaced by the exaggerated claims for cyberspace and virtual reality: will buildings be reduced to mere pit stops on the information highway? Above all, perhaps, many feel let down by the Clinton Administration and its failure to bring architects together behind a compelling urban vision. 
 Two years ago, there was considerable hope that a new administration would help restore a sense of idealism to a profession that had lost its ethical bearings in the building boom of the 1980's. Clinton was the first baby-boom President, the first post-cold-war President and the first President elected since the population has become predominantly suburban. And he campaigned on the theme of change. It was natural to hope that his Administration would help to formulate a new vision of urban America.
Many thrilled to the prospect that the 1990's might conform to Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s theory about the 30-year cycle in American liberalism. The 1930's and the 1960's were both recalled as periods of great public works, when architects were able to channel their social idealism into housing, transportation and parks and in urban design initiatives that raised the level of these projects. Would the 1990's witness a renewal of that tradition?
There were encouraging signs that this hope might be fulfilled. In the past two years, there have been some impressive museum shows dealing with urban issues and countless conferences on the public realm. In trade publications like Progressive Architecture, an emphasis on the social dimension of architecture has displaced the esthetic slant that prevailed in the 1980's. Some architecture schools have revised their curriculums along similar lines.
These efforts, undertaken to boost professional morale, have partly backfired. For one thing, whatever their value in raising the civic consciousness of the profession, the shows, conferences and publications appeared to make little discernible impact on government decision makers. Indeed, they ran counter to a political trend that was evident long before the November elections. While architects were talking up the virtues of the public realm, politicians were warming to the prospect of privatization. This did not increase the likelihood that the 90's would be a legendary decade of public works.
Then, too, it was disconcerting to see that all the attempts at consciousness-raising did not add up to a coherent picture. For instance, "Urban Revisions," an exhibition of recent urban plans at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles last year, offered a view of the city as a contemporary Tower of Babel, a metropolis abuzz with the competing voices of modernists, post-modernists, neo-traditionalists, deconstructionists, environmentalists and assorted mavericks. Consensus and solidarity were conspicuously absent.
In "Urban Revisions," the colorful display of professional discord presented a strong contrast to the form that idealism took in architecture for much of this century. Coherence, standardization, universal application: these were the hallmarks of the Radiant City proposal drawn up by Le Corbusier in the 1920's. With blocks of nearly identical skyscrapers rising at regular intervals from a lush landscape of green, open space, Le Corbusier's vision of the modern city was taken up as a model by a generation of architects and planners. But to a later generation, the Corbusian model did not look so idealistic. Instead, it came to symbolize the determination by architects to recast the city in their narcissistic self-image. In 1961, following the publication of Jane Jacobs's seminal book "Death and Life of Great American Cities," many architects began to reject uniformity and standardization in favor of diversity and complexity.
If "Urban Revisions" made one thing clear, it was that these values still prevail. Architects remain phobic about master planning. Heterogeneity remains the paramount urban virtue. But what would a government decision maker have made of this well-intentioned, sprawling mess? What kind of vision emerged from all these disparate urban revisions? Or, to put it another way, how can architects come up with a comprehensive vision so long as the idea of comprehensiveness remains in disrepute? While complexity may be an urban virtue, solidarity may have its uses after all.
In other words, the current malaise in the architectural profession stems from something more than disappointment with the Clinton Administration. It also arises from the profession's dawning awareness that it is time to rethink some of the assumptions that have guided its thinking on urban issues for the past 30 years. Architecture had "devolved" long before the Republicans proposed scaling down Federal programs. But the November elections have thrown the crisis of architecture's devolution into sharp relief. While progressive architects may have grasped the value of complexity, politicians are under no compulsion to follow suit. If voters are willing to spring for easy answers, who are politicians to resist the popular will? Why not build more prisons? Who doesn't want safe streets?
ARCHITECTS WHO HAD THEIR hearts set on the renewal of public works must feel a twinge of envy as they scan the Contract With America, particularly the section on the proposed Taking Back Our Streets Act, with its rousing call to build more jails. Why weren't progressives able to put together an effective agenda for parks, schools, subways, housing, museums, hospitals, recycling plants and airport transit? But the moment one starts to compile such a list, one begins to see the futility of it, at least compared with the elegant simplicity of the Republican contract. There's nothing wrong with the cities that a few more prisons can't cure is one way to read the contract. It's the ultimate easy answer, as stirring, in its way, as Le Corbusier's Radiant City. But how dispiriting it is to compare these two simplistic visions: the utopian dream city of green, open space, and the dystopian nightmare of gates and cells! Has the century of progress been one grand march from hope to fear?

Haiti Makes Effort To Revive Tourism

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
HOPING to overcome nearly a decade of neglect and the impact of three years of political turmoil and economic sanctions, Haiti's recently restored democratic government has begun an effort to revive tourism in a nation that has been almost entirely bypassed by the Caribbean vacation trade. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has appointed a cabinet-level Secretary of State for Tourism, and the country has initiated contacts with leading international cruise lines, hotel chains, tour operators, airlines and trade groups.
The campaign has been undertaken with the full realization that Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, must improve both its image and its infrastructure if it is to attract foreign visitors. "It is no secret that Haiti is far behind our Caribbean neighbors in development, especially in the tourism area," Maryse Penette, a former diplomat and restaurateur who heads the new tourism secretariat, acknowledged in an interview. "We do not intend to delve into the market of mass tourism, for we realize that would be unrealistic." Nevertheless, she added, the Aristide administration believes that tourism, if developed properly, can become "our No. 1 source of foreign exchange in the future." 
 Maj. Eric Flaxman, a partner in a travel agency in the Philadelphia area who is the American military advisor to Ms. Penette, said that Haiti hoped in the initial phase to persuade visitors to neighboring countries such as Jamaica, Cuba and the Dominican Republic to make short side trips here, and will also focus on cruise ship passengers. Though Haiti has its share of beaches, the Government believes it will have better luck attracting visitors if it emphasizes the country's African-French culture, including colonial architecture, artwork, music and folklore.
A few adventurous souls, European and Japanese students and backpackers for the most part, began turning up almost as soon as American troops landed here last September. But the first sign that mass commercial tourism has returned came on Jan. 23, when Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines once again began calling at Labadee, an isolated peninsula on Haiti's northern coast. Royal Caribbean suspended visits there after Mr. Aristide was overthrown by a military coup on Sept. 30, 1991; economic sanctions imposed by the Organization of American States and the United Nations then put an end to what was left of the tourism industry.
"Labadee was always an extremely popular port with our passengers and crew because of its natural beauty and the wide variety of activities available there," said Jim Lida, a spokesman for the Miami-based cruise line. "President Aristide and his officials have made a concerted effort to re attract tourism since he was restored to office, and since we had an established record in Haiti, we thought it was now appropriate to return." Under current plans, two 2,500-passenger ships will call each week at the secluded anchorage.
After the return of Mr. Aristide last October, all the foreign airlines that traditionally served Haiti also resumed service to Port-au-Prince: American Airlines from New York and Miami, Air Canada from Montreal and Air France, ALM and Copa from points in the Caribbean. But newcomers are also appearing. Carnival Air Lines began daily service from Miami on Jan. 19 with one-way fares as low as $99, and American Eagle is to begin flying from San Juan on April 15.
The most severe bottleneck, officials agree, is the shortage of hotel space. A Club Med with 704 beds, closed since 1986, is expected to reopen in a few months, but the country has just 4,000 beds, of which only 1,200 are classified as international standard. Negotiations are near completion on renovating several large properties abandoned in recent years, but construction of any new hotels will take considerably longer.
What few hotel rooms meet international standards have almost all been snapped up by international organizations that are helping in the rebuilding of the country or by businesses. Such diseases as malaria, dengue and typhoid remain a danger, especially in the countryside, sanitation is precarious and transportation links are tenuous.
"Haiti could be developed into a very good tourist destination," said Reuven Wertheim, chief executive officer of Carnival Air Lines. "It has all the naturals -- fun and sea and nice people, a unique culture. All it needs is the infrastructure."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Handling Financial Troubles

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
IT doesn't take much to send a tight household budget into a tailspin. A job loss or temporary layoff, a sudden rise in real estate taxes or an unexpected medical bill can all quickly trigger a cash crunch for those without a safety net.
Add to that list the adjustable-rate mortgage. 
 "In the past year, 55 percent of all new housing loans were adjustable-rate mortgages," said David Lereah, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington.
Most adjustable-rate mortgages are "re-priced" every year, Mr. Lereah said. Interest rates have surged in the last 12 months. And, he said, such loans are most attractive to "consumers on the margin, those trying really hard to qualify."
"Virtually all of the ARM-holders with one-year ARM's will be repricing with 2-percentage-point increases," he said. "That can mean a significant increase in monthly payments. Mortgage delinquency rates will be on the rise."
What can a homeowner do when the mortgage is due and there isn't enough in the bank to cover it?
"Almost every type of debt is negotiable in one way or another," said William Joyce, a Westchester lawyer who specializes in averting foreclosures and bankruptcies. "There are all kinds of deals out there."
One of the most important things to do when trouble arises, Mr. Joyce said, is to be up-front with the bank or mortgage company. "The worst thing you can do is bury your head in the sand and allow things to get out of control," he said.
Donald L. Shapiro, president of the New York Federal Savings Bank in Manhattan, agreed. "Come in, sit down and explain what the problem is," Mr. Shapiro said. "Generally, a bank will want to work with people who are open and aboveboard."
Most lenders, he said, prefer to avoid foreclosure proceedings and will usually find some way to help a homeowner who can come up with a workable plan to surmount a financial difficulty. "Banks don't want other people's houses," Mr. Shapiro said.
Keith T. Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates, a financial publishing company based in Butler, N.J., said that in some cases a lender will defer part of the mortgage payment for a few months so that the borrower can get back on track.
If the financial crisis is only temporary, he said, there are other possible solutions.
"If you have any equity in your home you might be able to tap into an equity line and draw funds to pay the bills, at least until you have improvement in your circumstances," Mr. Gumbinger said. "But remember, you're really borrowing from yourself. This is not a permanent solution."
Another possibility, Mr. Gumbinger said, particularly for those who have adjustable-rate mortgages with increasing interest rates, is to take out a new adjustable-rate loan. "You can always find an adjustable with a lower rate," he said. "And there are ways to roll in the closing costs."
The disadvantage of frequent refinancing, however, is that the term of the mortgage begins all over again. "You can do it every year," he said. "But you're never going to own your home that way."
For owners of condominiums and co-ops there are maintenance charges to contend with in addition to the monthly mortgage payment. If there is not enough money to pay both, which should be paid?
"That's a very difficult call," said Bruce A. Cholst, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-op and condominium law. Mr. Cholst said that most people would probably make the mortgage payment first, thinking that if the mortgage payment is made, the bank cannot foreclose. But nonpayment of maintenance charges in a coop, he said, gives a bank the right to begin foreclosure proceedings even if the mortgage is current.
"First and foremost, communicate with the board," Mr. Cholst said. "Neighbors are more likely to cut you some slack than a bank."
Another course of action for cash-strapped homeowners is to obtain the services of a credit counselor. "If you need help negotiating with your lender, we will act as a go-between," said Lynn Gerrity Ames, director of counseling for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service in Syracuse.
Ms. Ames said that credit counselors are often quite successful at negotiating informal "forbearance" agreements between homeowners and their lenders. The credit counselors, she said, help borrowers "reprioritize" their budgets and present workable payment strategies to their creditors.
"It sounds simplistic, but just scaling back your budget and making different choices can make the difference," Ms. Ames said.
Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a subsidiary of the National Foundation for Consumer Credit in Silver Spring, Md., is a nonprofit organization with 1,100 offices nationwide. Durant Abernethy, president of the foundation, said that about one-third of the offices provide services free of charge. The remainder, he said, offer services at an average of about $9 a month. The location of local offices can be obtained by calling (800) 388-2227.
What happens, though, when negotiations fail and the bank initiates foreclosure proceedings?
The most obvious answer -- and often the least desirable -- is to sell the property to pay off the mortgage. But that isn't always easy, and in some cases the selling price may not cover the outstanding mortgage.
For homeowners with Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages, however, the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development recently instituted a "pre-foreclosure program" designed to minimize the impact of a forced sale on both the seller and the mortgage holder.
Under the program, homeowners whose F.H.A. mortgages are in default can apply to HUD to participate in the program. The program allows the owner to sell the property at market value through a licensed broker, even if the sale price is less than the balance of the outstanding mortgage. "We pay the difference to the lender if there is a shortfall," said John Petricco, the area coordinator for HUD in Albany. Moreover, the owner is not held responsible for the deficiency.
By protecting both the borrower and the lender against a shortfall, Mr. Petricco said, the program encourages an orderly sale of the property and avoids lengthy and expensive foreclosure proceedings.
The pre-foreclosure program is available only to those with F.H.A.-insured mortgages, Mr. Petricco said. But other defaulting borrowers should consider suggesting to a foreclosing lender that the borrower be given time to sell the property at market value, even if the sale generates a shortfall, without any further obligation on the part of the owner.
"I would imagine that if you're a lending institution, and you're about to foreclose on a mortgage, you're going to have to seriously consider it," he said.

HEADLINE: Why Can't SoHo Have Trees?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a SoHo resident for nearly 20 years I'm tired of people who don't live here, like Margot Gayle [Letters, Jan. 8] and the whole Landmarks gang telling us we can't have trees. It shows a small, bureaucratic mind-set. Whether trees existed here 150 years ago is beside the point. SoHo is a living, breathing part of this city. It's not a museum. And its many sightseers, workers and residents deserve the beauty, shade, warmth and, yes, oxygen that trees provide. 
 In the 19th century there were no sodium lights in SoHo, but today they're necessary because they provide an element of safety. In the 19th century, galleries, stores and tourists didn't exist here, but today they all help the city economy. In the 19th century artists didn't live in these factory buildings but we're lucky they did 30 years ago -- because it was they, and not city planners, who saved SoHo. In fact, they saved Soho from urban planners who wanted to raze the buildings and put in a lower Manhattan expressway.
Small minds may be able to live in the past, but cities have to change. And it was SoHo's ability to change -- from obsolete manufacturing to residential use -- that kept it alive. This residential aspect should be strengthened, not stifled.
People are the heart of a city, but it's the trees that are its soul. And it seems outrageous that at the close of the 20th century, there are still those who can't see the value that trees add to the quality of life in this concrete jungle.
Please, let's not go backward into the 21st century.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/White Plains;
Balancing Tranquillity With Tax Benefits

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN 

 BODY:
SHOPPERS headed for The Westchester, the new luxury mall scheduled to open in White Plains next Friday, will use routes bypassing the city's 13 residential neighborhoods.
That will please the city's nearly 50,000 inhabitants who are as determined to protect the residential tranquillity of their tree-lined streets as they are eager to enjoy the property tax benefits a varied economic base provides. 
 The balancing act is difficult, but the city is intent on combining the best aspects of both environments, preserving gracious neighborhoods while serving as the business, retail and government hub of Westchester County.
"White Plains is a place that is carefully trying to straddle polar opposites of city and countrified suburb," said Mayor Sy J. Schulman. "How do we balance our desire to be a dynamic city while preserving the small-town quality of our neighborhoods? We worry all the time."
Preserving continuity, Mr. Schulman said, requires citizens with a "citywide mentality," which the city has in abundance. Many participate extensively in its activities, often through a network of neighborhood associations.
Others join civic groups, including the 30-year-old Beautification Foundation, which has raised more than $1 million for gardens, small parks, a carillon and barrels of flowers to participating merchants.
The city's recent call for volunteers to develop a new comprehensive plan attracted 400 residents, and Mayor Schulman observed, "The process may be as important as the product.
"Four hundred people is incredible," he said. "That's 1 percent of the city."
The planning groups have plenty to think about. The Westchester, one of four malls within a walk of one another, is needed to help White Plains recoup some of the 18 percent in property taxes it has lost over the last decade as companies including I.B.M., Nynex and AT&T have vacated space while others have won tax abatements.
The million-square-foot mall, anchored by Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus and including Tiffany and F.A.O. Schwarz, will increase the city's retail market to 4 million square feet. City officials say it will eventually generate $3.5 million in property taxes and $5 million in sales taxes annually.
Downtown revitalization, which already includes new sidewalks, trees and lights, has taken on a new urgency with the arrival of the new mall on the edge of the city's business district. Shops and restaurants on Mamaroneck Avenue, the city's main shopping thoroughfare, are already suffering from mall competition and the loss of area office workers.
There are a number of good ethnic restaurants downtown, including The Bengal Tiger, Reka's, Fujinoya and Dawat, but the city has no movie theaters, although the council is considering at least two proposals. A local law banning live entertainment was recently lifted.
IF location is everything, White Plains has it all. Halfway between the Tappan Zee Bridge and Long Island Sound, the city is a commuter's dream, with direct access to three major highways.
Downtown, a public-transportation hub adjacent to the headquarters of the county's bus system includes express trains to Manhattan, just a half hour away by rail. Westchester County Airport is five miles away.
Most of the estimated 200,000 people who commute to White Plains daily are workers headed downtown or to corporate parks ringing the city, students enrolled at Pace University Law School or the Lubin Graduate School for Business, or shoppers.
Originally called Quarropas, or the White Marshes, by the Siwanoy Indians, White Plains has had a rich past. On July 9, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the New York Provincial Congress sitting in the courthouse on Broadway. Three and a half months later, a crucial battle was fought in and around the city.
The most recent notable event occurred only 30 years ago. As Renoda Hoffman, a lifelong resident and city historian has observed, "There are few small cities in the nation that have changed so quickly and so radically as White Plains."
In 1964, the city launched a massive central urban renewal project -- now nearly complete -- that has rebuilt a third of the central business district. Involving almost $100 million in Federal and state grants, the effort has transformed the area, tearing down the library Andrew Carnegie financed along with blocks of urban blight. New roads have been built and office superblocks created. Residents were moved and 712 units of subsidized housing were built elsewhere.
Today, the central business district includes the 850,000-square-foot Galleria mall, a modern library, a police headquarters, the transportation center (known as TransCenter), the County Courthouse and several parking garages. A new Federal Courthouse will open by the end of the year.
Strict zoning has allowed little more than a corner deli to operate in most residential neighborhoods, and an $11 million neighborhood revitalization program has helped preserve the quality of residential life surrounding the downtown hub.
Kenneth Wyatt grew up on Battle Hill, a fringe neighborhood where his parents still live. Three months ago, Mr. Wyatt, a wine importer with Remy Martin, decided to move back to White Plains from Manhattan with his wife, Emmy, a human resources consultant, and their son, James Calvin Wyatt 2d, who celebrates his first birthday today.
"I feel good about having him grow up where I grew up," Mr. Wyatt said, referring to the city where he was born. "We got a really good residential value." The family now lives in a four-bedroom colonial in the gracious Soundview neighborhood.
The city needs to pay more attention to its fringe neighborhoods, Mr. Wyatt said. "The value of my real estate is tied directly to the quality of life in other neighborhoods," he said, adding that "my parents are concerned about where they live."
Mr. Wyatt's neighborhood borders Scarsdale where, he said, "our taxes would have been double." A black whose wife is white, Mr. Wyatt said he chose to return to a city where different races live harmoniously and, he added, "I love my commute. I can leave my house at 6:20 A.M., and I'm at my midtown desk with a bagel at 7:20."
Single-family homes make up about 31 percent of the 20,714 housing units in the city, many of them built before 1950. Four- to six-bedroom Tudors, colonials and Victorians can be found less than a mile from downtown, some available for under $400,000.
Small three-bedroom Cape Cods can be bought for $250,000, but they are hard to find.
HOUSES are also moving briskly at several developments of newly constructed luxury housing in the south end of the city, led by Toll Brothers of Huntingdon, Pa., which has revived a number of languishing projects. At Hillair Estates, 4-bedroom homes are being sold with prices starting at $595,000, many to empty-nesters moving from elsewhere in the city, said Nancy D'Arcy of Houlihan/Lawrence. At Ridgeway, 80 semi-detached 3- and 4-bedroom homes are selling for $354,900 to $459,900.
Interest in the city's luxury apartment complexes has also revived after several stood partially empty for several years. At the 244-unit Westage Towers, one-bedroom condominiums start at $118,000, 2-bedrooms at $235,000 and 3-bedrooms at $330,000.
Portions of the 235-acre New York Hospital-Cornell Medical site are likely to be developed despite the protests of nearby residents.
Both the middle and high school have been named Schools of Excellence, a Federal designation based on the quality of curriculum, students and teachers. Two years ago, the district was rated among the top 10 in the nation by Expansion Management Magazine for families involved in corporate relocation.
Of the 330 members in last year's graduating class at White Plains High School, 88 percent went on to higher education. There were three national Merit Scholarship winners and 31 finalists and commended students. The boys basketball team won the New York State championship.
The district is participating in two significant national educational reform efforts -- calling for higher student performance standards and helping younger students become more responsible -- and an elementary school program to encourage parent participation in the schools while insuring racial balance has won national attention.
Parents of incoming kindergarten children are invited to select from five elementary schools, each offering a distinct academic emphasis. The Parent Choice program has been so successful, said Dr. Saul Yanovsky, the superintendent, that 90 percent get their first choice, and most others get their second choice. Last year, in a district that includes a 52 percent minority enrollment, 40 percent of incoming parents chose a school that was not in their neighborhood.
The city provides 200 acres of outdoor recreational space, two outdoor swimming pools, 28 tennis courts, 17 baseball and softball diamonds and the Ebersole Skating Rink with its attached warming house.
County parkland in the area includes the Bronx River Parkway Reservation, with hiking and bicycle trails, Silver Lake Park and the 18-hole Maplemoor Golf Course. There are also two private golf clubs, Ridgeway and Westchester Hills.

 HOLIDAY MISCREANTS: The city's Fourth of July celebration is an annual tradition, featuring a big parade, community picnic and fireworks display. But one 19th century celebration nearly ended the fun. On the eve of the holiday, an unusual amount of attention surrounded a Revolutionary War cannon on the Broadway Commons. Shortly before midnight, the cannon, filled with blasting powder and newspapers, exploded. Windows were blown out for blocks around and pieces of the cannon landed all over the city, one 21-pound chunk tearing through a barn a quarter of a mile away. The perpetrators were never caught.

HEADLINE: Reconstructing a Spanish Ghost Ship and a Tale of Slavery

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
WELL into the last century, piracy was still a matter of great concern, and several sightings of a mystery ship off the Atlantic coast in the summer of 1839 both fascinated and bothered sailors and newspaper readers alike.
The ship, described as a "long, low, black schooner," would be seen and then disappear, only to reappear a bit further north. It was like a ghost ship, zigzagging aimlessly and seemingly lost. Then, in late August, the mystery ended when the ship was confiscated off Montauk Point by a naval brig doing surveys in the area. 
 Her name was the Amistad and she had a number of black people on board, including a few children, who had been captured in Africa, taken to Cuba, sold into slavery and put on the Spanish schooner to go around the island from Havana to a sugar plantation in Principe.
They rebelled, taking over the Amistad and in the process killing the ship's captain and cook while losing several of their own number. The slaves -- led by a young man called Cinque -- then attempted to return to Africa by forcing the two men who had bought them to steer the ship in an easterly direction. But at night the slaveowners would change direction, to the northwest, hoping to land at a port in the United States where they could arrange for the slaves to be imprisoned and punished
After the ship was confiscated at the entrance to Long Island Sound, it was towed to New London and the slaves were taken to the New Haven jail, charged with piracy and murder. In jail, they became instant celebrities. More than 5,000 people paid 12 1/2 cents each to see them exercising on the nearby town green. Life masks of each were made by a wax museum entrepreneur. A local artist painted a portrait of Cinque.
More importantly, the prisoners became a rallying cause for abolitionists. Their incarceration was followed by a series of court actions, in Hartford, New Haven and finally in Washington, D.C.
The fate of the Amistad slaves was finally decided after former President John Quincy Adams, old and tired, made a dramatic appearance before the United States Supreme Court to plead their case. The High Court ruled that a decision by the district court in New Haven was correct: the Amistad passengers had been illegally pressed into slavery, which, although it was widespread in Cuba, was technically illegal there.
Three years after they had been captured in Africa, 35 of the original group of 53 slaves were returned to their native land, Sierra Leone, as free people. The other 18 had died in captivity or during the takeover of the Amistad.
Records concerning the Amistad slaves -- court papers, newspaper stories of the time, a book that appeared shortly after they were imprisoned in New Haven, detailed descriptions of each of them, the portrait of Cinque -- have documented the Amistad story thoroughly, except in one major respect: the Amistad itself.
What was the ship really like? Where had it been built? How long was it? How wide? What eventually happened to it? In many ways, after a century and a half, the Amistad is still a mystery ship.
Questions about the ship have become important this year, particularly to Quentin T. Snediker because he is in charge of building a new Amistad. He calls it a "reconstruction" for which he has no blueprints.
Last October, the Connecticut Afro-American Historical Society received a $2.5 million grant from the Connecticut's Department of Economic Development to build a reproduction of the Amistad to be used as a floating museum, as a reminder of the horrors of slavery. The society turned to Mystic Seaport, the internationally known maritime museum, and Mystic turned to Mr. Snediker. The 44-year-old white-bearded Mr. Snediker looks like a ship captain in the age of sail and indeed he once did fit that role but long after the age of sail. A graduate of the New York Maritime College, he later was responsible for constructing the Mystic Clipper, a 100-ton sailing vessel, and from 1973 to 1981 was the captain of the passenger ship. He has also been in charge of maintaining Mystic Seaport's fleet of vintage sailing ships and most recently had been an official of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in Maryland.
One major difficulty in duplicating the Amistad, Mr. Snediker said, is that there is only one painting of it, now at the New Haven Historical Society, which is unsigned and undated. The painting may be an accurate depiction, but it may have been done long after the ship disappeared, he said. Maritime paintings were numerous during the period but they were mostly of famous clipper ships, or of passenger ships between cities along the East Coast or on its rivers. The Amistad -- the "long, low, black schooner" -- became famous only after its major story was told and it was tied up, covered with barnacles and slowly rotting, at New London.
It is known that in 1841, the ship was bought by a Rhode Island man, John Holland of Newport, for the low price of $250. He renamed her Ian, took her to Newport, and resold her. She was sailed to the French island of Guadalupe in the Caribbean, and there the trail turns cold.
For the last few months Mr. Snediker said, he has been checking the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and several other sources for any information he can obtain on the Amistad. When the checking is completed in the next few months, he said, he will start drawing up plans for construction of the ship.
Mr. Snediker has no doubt that he can obtain enough specific information to produce a nearly exact duplicate of the ship. "We will never know whether a nail went here, or over there, but it will be a good reconstruction," he said, adding that ships have a habit of leaving extensive paper trails to work with.
"There have always been very tight regulations on ships, because of revenues they bring in and politics of the times. So documents do exist here and there," Mr. Snediker said.
Information on the size of the Amistad, for instance, was available at the old United States Customs House in New London, now a museum. The legal document of the ship's sale to John Holland, registered there on June 4, 1841, gives dimensions of the ship, starting with her length of 64 feet. Descriptions of her cargo, other than slaves, are in old newspaper accounts.
A major misconception about the Amistad and one that has continued to be perpetuated in newspaper stories, Mr. Snediker said, is that she was a slave ship.
Rather, he said, she was a coastal schooner. "They were the tractor-trailers of their day," Mr. Snediker added. "They were part of daily life. They carried raw materials, produce, passengers -- and occasionally slaves."
On its fateful slave voyage, the Amistad was also carrying clothing, saddles and bridles, lookingglasses, foods, books and olive oil.
In style, the Amistad was a Baltimore model schooner, Mr. Snediker said, a sleek, fast ship with masts that leaned back developed during the War of 1812 to prey on enemy shipping. She could have been built in Baltimore or at many other locations on the East Coast.
After Mr. Snediker finishes his plans, construction will take about two years, he said, with no fewer than 6 and as many as 12 skilled workers -- carpenters, shipwrights, riggers, caulkers, sailmakers -- busy at any one time.
He does not know whether the work will be done indoors or out at the seaport -- "We're leaning to outdoors under a shelter," he said -- but he and Khalid Lum, president of the Connecticut Afro-American Historical Society and director of educational planning and development for Amistad America, the nonprofit organization set up to reproduce the ship, agree they want the construction of the ship to be a very public event.
"We want to do it where lots of kids, and others, can see it and possibly help out," Mr. Snediker said. That is important, he added, because there is a big lesson to be learned from the ship.
"The revolt always fascinated me," he said. "These people suffered horribly, and even though there were only 53 of them, they represented six million Africans. It was a glimpse of the horror of slavery."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Q & A: Jorden Schiff;
For Principal, 28, Youth Is No Barrier

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
AT an age in life when most people are working on the first rung of their career ladders, Jorden Schiff is closing in on the top rung of his.
In January of this year Mr. Schiff, who is 28, became one of the youngest public school principals in the state when he was hired by the High Bridge School District to take over the top job at the 300-student High Bridge Elementary School. 
 Mr. Schiff has been a teacher since 1989 -- the year after he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Rutgers University in New Brunswick. His first assignment was at the Somerset Hills School, where he instructed emotionally disturbed boys. Later he taught fifth grade in Bridgewater.
In August 1993, Mr. Schiff moved into his first administrative post when he was appointed supervisor of fine arts for elementary schools in the North Brunswick School District. That same year, he was hired as the assistant principal in the Judd School in North Brunswick.
In October 1994, while browsing through the classified advertisements in a local newspaper, Mr. Schiff discovered that the High Bridge School District was looking for a principal. He and about a dozen other candidates applied for the job.
After two interviews with the High Bridge Superintendent of Schools, and then a third call-back before the full school board, the search committee still had not made a decision.
It was only after several members visited the Judd School and talked to students, teachers and Mr. Schiff's supervisor there that their choice became clear.
Mr. Schiff talked recently about his new position.
Q. How did you feel when you first learned that you had just become one of the youngest principals in the state?
A. I was very excited. I felt that all the hard work at graduate school had finally paid off. That was my initial reaction. My next reaction was: "Now I have a real responsibility and a real opportunity to make a difference with kids."
Q. Why do you think the board chose you over the other applicants?
A. Well, I think they were looking for someone who had a background in elementary education, and I think my experience with special education also tilted the decision in my favor.
Q. At 28, aren't you considered quite young for a principal?
A. Yes, and I think it's a shock for most people dealing with me as their administrator. At first blush, people look at me and they pretty much know my age and think, 'Wow, he's young!'
But after spending some time with me and talking about educational issues and how to solve problems and how to make decisions, the age becomes less of an issue. Once they deal with you on that level, it becomes an issue of character, not an issue of age.
Q. So what does a school principal do?
A. There are really a hodge-podge of many different responsibilities. What I do on a daily basis is help provide a warm and caring environment so that the children and the staff and the community feel welcome. I believe that facilitates the learning process.
The principal also bears the responsibility for what goes on in the school in terms of curriculum, instruction, student achievement, staff development, community relations, getting parents involved, and developing opportunities for private industry to come and form a cooperative bond with the school.
Q. What do you believe is the most important issue in elementary education today?
A. I think we need to take a critical look at the way we assess students' performance in the classroom. We need to have a more comprehensive approach, where we balance standardized assessment scores with performance-based assessment and where we look beyond students just reaching a particular standard.
For example, if you have a student who is scoring at the 99th percentile on standardized achievement tests, I still would want that child to grow and meet his or her potential. We want to see everyone move and everyone grow, not just students at the 50th percentile.
Q. What do you think is the basic responsibility of a principal of an elementary school?
A. You have to work from the bottom up. You have to make sure you have the basic needs for all the children satisfied. You need good facilities; before you even worry about anything else, the children have to be safe and they have to be healthy. They have to be in a clean and adequate facility before you even discuss instructional curriculum. It's a fundamental educational issue to address those basic needs.
Q. What do you think might be missing in elementary classrooms today?
A. We have dedicated professionals in schools across the country. We have many, many teachers doing what they believe is right for the kids. What we need, though, is strong leadership. We need people at the principal's level who are able to take the teachers and give them a focus, give them a vision. I think we need quality leaders who know how to deal with people, who know how to problem-solve, and who are willing to take risks.
Q. Isn't that difficult to do when you're the new kid on the block?
A. You can't effect change without upsetting the apple cart. But I'm not someone who's going to come in and tear up the place. I'm a very balanced administrator. I solve problems in a deliberate fashion, I take incremental steps and I don't rush headlong into things. I take a slow and measured approach, and that seems to be working rather well.
Q. What do you bring to the job at 28 years old that makes you unique?
A. I'm about a generation older than the students here, and it hasn't been that long since I was in a classroom myself. I'm closer in age to the children, and there's a different rapport that a younger person can have with the kids. I think I can make contributions that people in the generation that preceded mine didn't even have an opportunity to make.
I was in graduate school when the new ideas for curriculum were being developed. I've had a chance not only to study them in school, but to apply them in the classroom as a teacher. I also think my background in computer technology is going to be a benefit for the school.
Q. In what way?
A. I think we're at the tip of the iceberg with educational technology right now. People are now asking, "How can we use this technology effectively in the classroom as an instructional tool?"
Here at High Bridge, we have a computer lab at the school, and we're using it to enhance our writing program. We have kids in kindergarten in there. We're teaching basic computer skills, word processing, spreadsheets, databases, telecommunications.
Q. Do you miss being a teacher?
A. Very much so. But being a principal in a school like this keeps me close to the classroom and the students. I'm in and out of the classrooms all day long, and even though I'm not directly teaching them, I still feel I'm an integral part of the education process.
Q. What do you think you'll be doing 10 years from now?
A. Ten years there may be some other opportunities, but right now, I'm focusing on being the best principal I can be.

Looking at U.S. Markets Through Japanese Wallets

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE American stock market hit a four-year low last week, more than 20 percent below the record set way back in June of 1990, before the last recession.
If that doesn't sound like what you thought you read in the papers, its because you measure stock prices in dollars. In dollars, the market hit a record high on Friday. But for a Japanese investor, one who measures profits and losses in yen, the statement is true. On Tuesday, the S.& P. 500 was at its lowest level, in yen, since Jan. 22, 1991. 
 On June 12, 1990, the S.& P. 500 closed at 367.27. By the end of last week, it was up 33 percent since then. But the value of the dollar, in yen, had plunged 41 percent. Put them together, and the value of the S.& P. 500, in yen, was down 23 percent.
All of which shows that sometimes currency moves can dwarf anything else for international investors. It also may help to explain why, to some foreigners, American stocks look cheap. FLOYD NORRIS

HEADLINE: 'Morphing' Into The Toy World's Top Ranks

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
AT the New York toy fair in February 1993, a Japanese company with limited name recognition in the United States displayed a new line of action figures in a small showroom and struggled to get toy buyers to look. "We had to go out in the hall and drag some of them in," recalled Trish Stewart, marketing director for the company's American subsidiary.
The action figures, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, went on to become one of the greatest hits in American toy history. At last month's toy fair, the manufacturer, the Bandai Company, couldn't keep the crowds out of a showroom that was four times as large as the old one. 
 The phenomenal, and unexpected, success of the Power Rangers provided a new opportunity to Bandai, which has long been Japan's largest conventional toy company but which had so little success in the United States that its American subsidiary seemed to outsiders to be on the verge of disintegrating a few years ago. Now, like the toys it makes, Bandai has a chance to transform, or "morph," into a major player in the American and European markets.
Makoto Yamashina, the company's aggressive president, aims to have Bandai's sales, about $2.2 billion, surpass those of the American giants Mattel ($3.2 billion) and Hasbro ($2.7 billion) by 2000. That would make Bandai the largest conventional toy company in the world and No. 3 over all behind video game kings Nintendo and Sega, which expect revenues of about $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, in the fiscal year ending this month.
To do that, Bandai plans to ride the wave created by Japan's fertile comic book and cartoon industries, whose products are gradually catching on around the world. This fall, two or possibly three new Japanese children's programs will debut on American television. Bandai, which specializes in character-based toys, will have the licenses for all three.
The most highly anticipated of the new programs is "Sailor Moon," a cartoon series about a long-legged, clumsy, blond junior high school girl who transforms into a heroine with super powers. A big hit in Japan for two years, the Sailor Moon program has also done well in France, Spain and Hong Kong.
 
New Directions
 Bandai is also plunging into the multimedia and video game business in partnership with Apple Computer Inc. In December, Bandai said it would make and sell the Pippin Power Player, a $500 scaled-down version of Apple's Macintosh computer that will plug into a television set and play games and educational programs stored on CD-ROM's.
"We need another $2 billion to $3 billion business," Mr. Yamashina, who writes books about religion when he is not hatching new super-hero action figures, said about the move into multimedia.
But there are numerous risks ahead. Unlike more stable toys like Mattel's Barbie doll, Bandai's character toys can rise and fall sharply with the unpredictable shifts in moods among fickle youngsters. Coleco Industries, whose Cabbage Patch dolls were as popular in their day as Power Rangers are now, fell into bankruptcy when sales of the dolls declined and the company was left with huge inventories.
Last Christmas, American parents frantically searched for scarce Power Rangers as Bandai struggled to meet demand. But now the shortages are abating. Mr. Yamashina said he expects Power Ranger sales in the United States to increase to about $400 million in 1995 from $330 million in 1994 because of new products and because Twentieth Century Fox will release a Power Ranger movie for the summer. In Europe, he said, sales might rise as high as $150 million this year, compared with $100 million last year.
But some analysts think Power Ranger sales will start falling this year. "I would say the second half of the year in the U.S. will show a very steep decline in Power Ranger merchandise," said Sean McGowan, toy analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company in New York, who was basing his judgment partly on the sensitive barometer provided by his own 5-year-old son. "He hasn't asked me for a Power Ranger toy since Christmas," Mr. McGowan said.
The video game business is also treacherous. Mattel failed in video game machines. Bandai has been trying, with mixed success, since it made imitations of the early Atari Pong game in 1977. Its latest hardware effort, the Playdia CD-ROM player for toddlers that is sold in Japan, has been swamped in the marketplace by Sega's child computer, the Pico. Already, Mr. Yamashina concedes, the Macintosh-based multimedia player, due in the fall, has slipped behind schedule, and it will be difficult to get high volumes into the market in time for Christmas.
IN the fiscal year that ends this month, Bandai expects to record sales of 220 billion yen, or $2.2 billion at the exchange rate of 100 yen to the dollar. That is up 22 percent from a year ago. The company expects net income of $110 million, compared with a loss of $18.6 million a year earlier, when Bandai pulled out of an unprofitable agreement to distribute Nintendo video game cartridges in Europe and wrote off its inventory.
Many analysts here estimate that profits and revenues will be flat or grow only slightly in the year that begins in April. Bandai's stock, traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has fallen from 5,040 yen a year ago to 3,240 yen on Friday. (To further enhance its visibility in the United States, Bandai is considering a New York Stock Exchange listing.)
But Mr. Yamashina is nothing if not ambitious. "He might make a mistake once again, but he will find the way," said Yoshio Tsukuda, a toy wholesaler. "That is what he has done in the past."
Bandai (pronounced BAHN-dye) was founded as a toy wholesaler in 1950 by Mr. Yamashina's father, Naoharu. The company name comes from part of a Chinese phrase meaning "things that are eternal." Within a year Bandai began manufacturing its own toys, concentrating on cheap metal replicas of planes and cars that were exported to the United States. "We called them $1 toys," Mr. Yamashina recalled.
But after that good start, Bandai never had much success in the United States. Perhaps its biggest hit before the Power Rangers was the Gobots, vehicles that transformed into robots, which were sold in the United States by Tonka Toys in the mid-1980's.
But if it did not succeed abroad, Bandai found the key to success in Japan. It aggressively licensed characters from comics and television shows to make into toys. Today, character merchandise -- mainly toys but recently also clothing and candy and other goods -- accounts for more than 80 percent of sales.
Comic books, many of which contain liberal doses of sex and violence, are almost a national mania in Japan, read by children and adults alike. The successful comics are often made into animated cartoons. While Japan is known as a nation that lacks competitiveness in software -- like computer programs and movies -- comics and animations are an exception. Japanese comics and cartoons have developed big followings in other parts of Asia and in Europe, and cult followings in the United States.
Bandai employs people in their 20's and 30's to scan comics, cartoons, video games and commercials looking for characters that might appeal to children. The company creates no characters itself.
OFTEN, Bandai goes for the toy license at the time a successful comic is ready to be made into a cartoon for television, so that the toys can appear at about the same time as the program. Bandai pays a royalty of 2 to more than 10 percent, depending on the character. Bandai usually conceives of the toys to be made from the character but contracts out design to an independent company. It then either makes the toys itself or contracts out the manufacturing.
To sell its toys, Bandai becomes the main sponsor of the shows for which it has the license. There are now 35 half-hour-long cartoon shows on television in Japan and Bandai is the sponsor of 18.
"Our stance is to be the first licensee for any character," said Mr. Yamashina, who added that only about one-third of the characters turn into successful toys.
Take the case of Sailor Moon, which has been Bandai's biggest hit in Japan recently, far outselling the Power Rangers.
The character was created by Naoko Takeuchi, a woman just out of college who quit her job as a hospital pharmacist to seek her fame and fortune as a comic strip author. In 1992, Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon, as it called here, was accepted, out of hundreds of submissions, for publication in Nakayoshi, a monthly magazine filled with serialized comics for girls.
Thanks to Sailor Moon, Nakayoshi's circulation began soaring, so Toei Animation decided to make it into a television cartoon program. The comic and the television show are big hits among young girls (and also, it is said, among computer nerds and some other men).
Bandai, which expects to sell about $220 million worth of Sailor Moon toys, clothing and other goods in the fiscal year that ends this month, pays a 3 percent royalty that is split among Toei Animation, the broadcasting station, Nakayoshi and Ms. Takeuchi. As a result of her success, Ms. Takeuchi, now 27, tools around Tokyo in a Porsche and is about to buy a Ferrari.
DIC Entertainment, a children's programming subsidiary of Capital Cities/ABC, is now adapting the cartoon for American audiences and it will be shown starting in September. "The issue of a girl being empowered is a wonderful theme you just don't see in American animation," said Andy Heyward, DIC president.
DIC was well on its way to giving the license for the American toys to Kenner, a Hasbro subsidiary, Mr. Heyward said. But Toei Animation argued that Bandai, because it already makes the toys for Japan, would be able to begin sales in America more quickly. DIC turned down Bandai's request to get licenses for merchandise other than toys because those other areas are not Bandai's main business.
This fall, Saban Entertainment, the Burbank, Calif., company that brought Power Rangers to America, will put on the air another Japanese kids' show called "Masked Rider," a live-action program that was first broadcast here in 1971 and has been off the air for several years. Bandai has already introduced toys from the program into the American market.
The third show that could go on the air in the United States this fall is "Dragon Ball," another Toei Animation cartoon, which is being Americanized by Funimation Productions of Fort Worth.
Bandai has now started to look abroad for characters to license. Its first such move was for an American cartoon figure, the Tick, a 7-foot, 400-pound blue super-hero.
Mr. Yamashina said he does not get directly involved in choosing characters to license. "I leave it to young people," he said. "I don't touch it. It's like the fashion business. It requires a keen sense for young people."
As a young person himself, Mr. Yamashina was surrounded by toys and wanted to do something else with his life. After graduating from Keio University with a degree in economics, he joined a publishing company, hoping to become an editor, but was assigned instead to sell encyclopedias. After two years, he left and joined Bandai.
In 1980, Mr. Yamashina became president at 35. His father still comes into the office once a month or so to give advice. Mr. Yamashina and his father own a combined 5.3 percent of the company, a stake worth about $80 million.
MR. YAMASHINA is considered an aggressive manager who has trouble following traditional practices like lifetime employment. He once told a Japanese newspaper that getting rid of unproductive employees is like pulling weeds. After taking over from his father, he purged many of his father's associates to install a younger group loyal to him.
"He fires people quickly," said Atsuko Tatsumi, editor of the Weekly Toy News and of the English-language monthly Japan Toy and Hobby Market Report. "Even people who worked 30 to 40 years for his father, he fires them."
Mr. Yamashina has also angered some retailers and wholesalers in Japan because he has worked to streamline the toy distribution system here. The mom-and-pop stores and multiple levels of distributors are giving way to big chains like Toys "R" Us that buy from manufacturers directly. As the largest toy company, Bandai has set the pace by selling to these retailers.
With his nearly fluent English and direct style, Mr. Yamashina apppeals to Western executives. Satjiv Chahil, vice president and general manager of the new media division at Apple, said Bandai has little of the bureaucracy and time-consuming protocols of the other Japanese companies Apple has worked with. "He's been swift, responsive and open," Mr. Chahil said.
Mr. Chahil said Apple had wanted a toy company to sell a simplified Macintosh, a product that was too inexpensive for Apple to sell profitably itself, but had not had Bandai in mind. But at the Macworld Expo in Tokyo about a year ago, Mr. Yamashina approached Apple.
"We instantly were on the same wavelength," Mr. Chahil said. "In less than an hour, we had come to a virtual agreement on what we wanted to do."
The Pippin Power Player is an attempt to come up with a machine that combines the low price of a video game machine with the versatility of a personal computer. "Just one that is able to meet your will," is Bandai's slogan, using the awkward English that is considered fashionable in Japan.
CD-ROM's made for Pippin will be playable on the Macintosh, though not necessarily vice-versa. Apple is designing the product and Bandai will contract out for its manufacturing and sell it.
But while Pippin is designed to combine the best of video game machines and computers, it might end up being considered too slow and expensive for a video game machine and too unsophisticated for a computer. Moreover, Mr. Yamashina freely acknowledges that little or no profit can be expected on the players, especially since Apple is planning to license other companies to make Pippins as well.
But Bandai hopes to prosper from software. As with Nintendo and Sega, Bandai and Apple will charge a license fee to each software company that wants to make programs for Pippin. Bandai also hopes to sell its own software for the machine.
Mr. Yamashina has two children, a 20-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter, and it is unclear yet whether either will enter the toy business. In his spare time, Mr. Yamashina likes to sail and play golf.
He is also the author of two books about religion that he said he wrote out of curiosity. One seeks to explain the words of Buddha and the other the Bible. Mr. Yamashina himself does not adhere to any religion.
His book about the Bible tries to uncover its hidden truths. For instance, where the Bible states that Adam lived 930 years, Mr. Yamashina writes that he knows from inspiration that the real age was 120 years and was hidden using a Jewish code. To see the truth, rearrange the number 930 as (9+3) x 10 + 0 = 120.
Apparently, Mr. Yamashina's inspirations about religion are not nearly as perspicacious as his inspirations about toys. Unlike the Power Rangers, he noted, "My books don't sell at all."
 
 
 
A Morphin Power Pitch
ACCORDING to Haim Saban, the man who brought the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers program to American television, the show almost didn't make it. "I had been schlepping the Ranger series for nine years until I got one buyer," said Mr. Saban, owner of Saban Entertainment, a children's programming company in Burbank, Calif.
The American program is a descendant of a Japanese show called "Go Renjaa," or "Five Rangers," which was created by the Toei Company, a leading movie company, and first broadcast in Japan in 1975.
The program has undergone many changes since then, but a Ranger-related show is still on the air in Japan. Sales of Ranger toys in Japan are steady but not spectacular, at about $50 million a year, said Makoto Yamashina, president of the Bandai Company.
Mr. Saban said he and Mr. Yamashina had been talking for 10 years about bringing a television program related to Bandai's toys to the United States. Most American television executives rejected the Rangers as too silly, but the Fox Children's Network decided to broadcast the show in the fall of 1993.
The program is live-action, not a cartoon. It is about teen-agers who can be transformed into super-heroes who fight aliens with karate chops and fantastic robots. Saban reshot some scenes using American actors.
While Mr. Yamashina denies it, some industry executives say that within Bandai there was some reluctance to make the toys for the American market because the company had never done well in the United States. Now, thanks largely to sales in the United States, Power Ranger toys account for about one-fifth of Bandai's total revenues.

 BODY:

Americans Can Still Get 100 Pennies for a Dollar
The plunging dollar and peso have, it seems, matched headline for headline lately, which could lead a casual observer to think this country's woes match Mexico's. That's silly, of course. For starters, while Mexico's currency has lost half its value in a few months, the dollar, after falling for a decade, has lost far less. But the bigger point is that America is big enough, ultimately, not to care that much. We buy 90 percent of our stuff right here, and that spending won't be seriously affected by what happens across the ocean. So while Alan Greenspan hinted at raising rates again, which arrested a dollar slide last week, some economists say it would be foolish to go through such hoops that it lands us in recession. Look at it this way: it's not that the dollar is low, said Paul Krugman, a Stanford economist, but that "the yen and the mark are getting ridiculously high." 

Welcoming a Jobs Report
Declining unemployment is always good news -- as it was last week when the rate fell to 5.4 percent, a four-year low. This report was especially welcome, for it showed that with all the Fed's rate increases, economic growth persists -- with no inflation to speak of. And payrolls increased by a surprisingly high 318,000. The not-so-good news, yet again, was that job growth was concentrated in temporary workers and part-timers -- hardly foundations for careers. But the market thought positive, as the Dow leapt 52.
 
When in Doubt, Sue Someone
Few would disagree that this nation is awash in lawsuits, many of them frivolous. "Lawsuit abuse saps our economy," said Representative Henry Hyde. What to do? The Republican solution is simply to throw out most of the bath water in sweeping tort reform, but will the baby be thrown out, too? No, the House insisted, as it plunged ahead last week on its crusade to limit investors' suits against companies or brokers and put a cap on damages in civil lawsuits. It also voted to force the loser in a Federal civil suit to pay the opponent's legal costs. A clear deterrent to frivolity, say supporters, while critics say corporations could pay less heed to safety.
 
Do-It-Yourself Health Reform
Who says health care reform fizzled? New twists pop up everywhere -- they just don't have "Made in Washington" labels. "The future," said one health economist, "is in the large capitated medical group" -- unsettling language that simply refers to the per-capita fee that H.M.O.'s charge. And those H.M.O.'s won't be the sole domain of insurers and other middlepeople. Across the nation, doctors have already been finding strength in groups, and now they're going a step further, banding together -- in El Paso and elsewhere -- to create their own H.M.O.'s. These cost-pinching days, the economist said, "individual doctors don't stand a chance."
 
Welfare, by Lots of Other Names
This is the age of militant self-sufficiency. Don't expect handouts, don't go whining to the courts about life's slings and arrows -- that's the message to folks on the sidewalk. But do corporations fit this ruggedly independent mold? Not exactly. With Washington's checkbook in the news, some attention has shifted to business subsidies -- what Robert Reich calls "aid for dependent corporations." The "market promotion" program of the Foreign Agricultural Service, for one, doles out $110 million a year for things like helping Campbell advertise V-8 Juice in Argentina. And the Cato Institute said last week, "Corporate pork is pervasive."
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Facing Grim Facts in Mexico
For a while, there was a sense that a quick fix was possible in Mexico -- that the crisis was a blip that could be corrected with a few carefully targeted billions from outside. That was not the tone last week though. "There's no easy way out," said Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz; one observer saw "no magic cure." With the peso at another low, Mexico's Government adopted a tough economic plan that pointed unambiguously to hard times: raising gasoline prices 35 percent, the value-added tax to 15 percent.
 
One for All, All for Barings?
It made a great story. A trader barely out of his financial diapers brings down a venerable British firm singlehanded, proving yet again the amazing power of whiz kids let loose in the money shop. Sorry, but the case of Nicholas Leeson and Barings's collapse doesn't look that simple now. A glance at the way many American firms now operate -- elaborate controls, monitors and double-checks -- suggests that the fault, dear Barings, was not in your superstars. That, at any rate, was the tack taken by Mr. Leeson's lawyers last week. As one of them put it: "The reporting so far has not even scratched the surface" of what went on. "Everything he did, he did as an employee of Barings."
 
An Outcast, Still in Business
Iran, theoretically an outcast nation, has not exactly been cast out of the world's business loop. True, since that 1979 hostage mess, most American trade with Iran has been banned -- direct trade, that is. But by Al D'Amato's estimate, 25 percent of Iran's oil has been bought by American companies, for sale elsewhere. And last week the spirit of this ostracism was stretched closer to the breaking point when Conoco, through a Dutch affiliate, made a $1 billion deal to develop an oil field on Sirri Island, off Iran. It's "within the intent of the law," Conoco insisted, but the White House said, "This is not a helpful development." And Mr. D'Amato, saying he was "deeply distressed," said the Senate Banking Committee, which he heads, would try to tighten the embargo.
 
COMPANIES
 
USAir, Shrinking to Fit
Some of the nation's airlines have shown in recent years that shrinking, not expanding, is the way to go. American cut its capacity 5 percent a year or so ago, and America West trimmed 12 percent, and both moves proved profitable. Now USAir -- which lost $685 million last year, partly because of fears resulting from the crash of two of its jets -- is trying this approach. Last week it said it would cut 5 percent of its capacity, dropping 240 flights while adding some new ones. In most cases, though, this cutback will simply involve trimming some flights on certain routes, not whole routes.
 
This Time, It's Not I.B.M.'s Fault
Yes, there are some dark sides to computers taking over our lives -- like that mix of neck, arm and hand maladies known as repetitive stress injuries. But who's to blame for R.S.I. -- the user of the keyboard or the manufacturer? Some have tried to pin it on the latter, saying designs are faulty and conducive to injury, while keyboard makers insist that work habits are the culprit. Like any self-respecting dispute these days, this one sometimes lands in court. And last week, in a closely watched case, the manufacturer -- I.B.M. -- came out on top. A Minnesota jury decided that I.B.M. was not liable for injuries that a secretary blamed on a keyboard. This could well embolden other companies not to settle similar claims. And it could give workers added reason to take those recommended rest breaks.
 
A Gift of Words
Imagine a world without paperbacks -- no mounds of three-for-a-dollar romances at garage sales, no bookshelves that seemingly fill to bulging of their own volition. Truly a bleak prospect, but one we need not face -- thanks, in large part, to a man named Ian Ballantine. In 1939, Mr. Ballantine and his wife, Betty, founded Penguin U.S.A. -- and, later, Bantam and then Ballantine Books, making a big contribution to creating a mass market for all sorts of tales. Their titles over the years ranged from "The Grapes of Wrath" to the works of Ray Bradbury and J. R. R. Tolkein. Mr. Ballantine died last week at 79; untold millions of books survive him.
 
Quick: What's 3% of Zero?
Here's an existential question: if the Yankees aren't playing, can they be fairly said to exist? Do they exist, that is, in the sense of being worth anything? Well, two years ago, someone offered $500 million for the team. But that was then. Now, a part owner named Harvey Leighton is trying to sell his share -- just over 3 percent -- and can't find a buyer, even at the seemingly bargain price of $2.95 million for 1 percent. One possible problem: George Steinbrenner, who owns 55 percent and has such a grip that one former investor said, "There's nothing more limited than a limited partner in the Yankees."

HEADLINE: Argentina, a Victim of Mexico's Fall, Tries to Recover

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
ARGENTINA isn't Mexico. But Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's finance minister, has had a hard time trying to convince investors and creditors that his nation is really different.
Since Mexico surprised the financial markets in December by devaluing the peso, the ripple effect has been felt throughout Latin America -- and nowhere more so than in Argentina. The country's once-vibrant economy is threatened by recession as credit dries up, foreign investors take flight and Argentines pull their money out of banks. 
 Until a rebound on Friday, fueled largely by the announcement of Mexico's austerity plan, Argentine stocks dropped roughly 38 percent since the Mexican devaluation on Dec. 20. Additionally, an estimated $3 billion of deposits has been withdrawn from Argentine banks. Recently, four banks were forced to close for lack of funds, and the Government has cobbled together emergency support for other endangered banks, hoping to prevent a collapse.
Mr. Cavallo said last week that his Government would seek another $2 billion from the International Monetary Fund. The new request comes just a week after Argentina said it needed $420 million from the I.M.F. to supply funds to its strapped banks. After Mexico, it does seem as though the next currency ripe for devaluation is Argentina's peso.
On numerous trips to the United States and Europe this year, Mr. Cavallo has tried to assure investors and bankers with two messages: Argentina is on more solid economic footing than Mexico, and there is more discipline in his country's exchange-rate system, which should blunt speculation.
In the last four years, Argentina's growth rate -- roughly 7 percent annually -- has been far higher than Mexico's. Argentina's current-account deficit, though rising, is proportionately far less than that of Mexico, which reached 7.6 percent of gross domestic product last year. And inflation in Argentina, once a textbook case of hyperinflation, has dropped to less than 5 percent.
Much of the improvement here dates from April 1991, when the Argentine Congress passed the "Convertibility Act," which pegs the peso tightly to the dollar at a one-to-one ratio. Under the convertibility plan, every Argentine peso in circulation is backed by a dollar reserve in the central bank. Mexico had no such fixed system.
In a recent interview with Telem, a local news agency, Mr. Cavallo blamed speculators for growing hysteria and pressure on Argentina to devalue. He insisted that no Argentine economy indicator justified the steady losses on the stock market.
"The economic signs are very positive, and I hope market operators in Argentina as well as abroad will see this and will reverse the climate of panic or terror that is being installed here," Mr. Cavallo said.
The first signs of a squeeze on Argentina's economy appeared early last year when interest rates in the United States and Europe began rising. That made Western investors more likely to keep money in their home markets, slowing the inflow of foreign capital to Argentina and other developing nations. But Argentina was hit hard when the Mexican financial crisis prompted many foreign fund managers and investors to pull out of Latin America. The decline in foreign investment is expected to stunt economic growth in Argentina and reduce tax revenue, raising questions about whether the country can meet its debt payments.
In an interview last week, Mr. Cavallo insisted that Argentina's debt payments of $5.2 billion would be made on time this year and that the funds had already been allocated. "Any statements saying that we are not going to meet payments are false," Mr. Cavallo said.
Asked if a recession might arise from the lack of liquidity, Mr. Cavallo said that there would be "a decrease in production" in 1995 but "not a strong recession."
Economists now predict that with the loss of foreign investment and the credit crunch, Argentina will post no growth this year and may even shrink slightly, compared with earlier forecasts of as much as 6 percent growth.
The real threat in Argentina, economists say, is less of capital flight in the traditional sense than an old-fashioned run on the banks. Argentina's convertibility system is intended to make conventional currency speculation pointless.
But bank withdrawals are running so high because depositors -- both Argentines and some foreigners -- are afraid that the banking system could collapse. Local bankers here report that many Argentines are withdrawing dollars from their savings accounts and placing them in safety deposit boxes or under mattresses at home.
In the past, Argentina relied on foreign investments to balance its trade accounts, paying for its imports and other obligations from abroad. Yet with foreign investment declining, Argentina has been forced to adopt an austerity package to avoid what Mr. Cavallo has called "the unthinkable -- devaluation."
The Finance Minister announced the austerity program two weeks ago. The main elements are $1 billion in budget cuts and a drive to generate another $2.5 billion in revenue by eliminating tax deductions and cracking down on tax evaders. The measures are intended to help close a projected budget deficit of $4.5 billion this year.
Most economists and financial analysts here believe that Mr. Cavallo will stand by his word and not devalue the peso, despite the growing pressure on the currency. Were Mr. Cavallo forced to reconsider, a devaluation would require approval of Argentina's Congress. Any devaluation, analysts say, would certainly not occur before the Presidential elections in May.
Most economists and analysts believe that the inherent strength of Argentina's economy should make it possible for Mr. Cavallo to avoid a devaluation. But the skittishness of depositors and investors, both at home and abroad, after the Mexican collapse could make it all the harder to stay on course. And the jump of nearly 13 percent in the Argentine stock market on Friday shows, for better or worse, how much investors still link Argentina's fortunes to those of Mexico.
"It's been a long, difficult haul trying to persuade people that things are stable and Argentina is different from Mexico," said Christopher Eccelstone, an analyst for Interacciones, a brokerage firm here. "What's happening is that everybody got it wrong on Mexico and they are trying to make sure that they don't get it wrong again on Argentina."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Is South Korea Poised to Rise Again?

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
IT may seem foolhardy to write again about a so-called emerging market when blood is running all over the floor of Latin America's stock exchanges, but then is South Korea really an emerging market, given that the term is virtually synonymous with being a developing country?
The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's business promotion arm, coined the emerging market designation and includes South Korea in its index of such markets, as do other financial houses tracking these new and relatively undeveloped stock exchanges. 
 Yet South Korea, along with Taiwan, is very close to joining the industrial world and there is a case for saying that its stock market does not deserve to be tarred with the Mexican brush. In the worldwide flight to quality now under way, Seoul may have more to offer than intrinsically weaker emerging economies.
With an average income of $7,670 in 1993, according to the latest World Bank figures, South Koreans earn twice the income of workers in Malaysia, Mexico or Indonesia. And South Korea should cross the $8,356 barrier sometime this year, becoming a high-income country instead of a middle- income one. Later this month South Korea is due to apply formally to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the rich countries' Paris club.
South Korea, which already has the world's second-largest steel manufacturer, traditionally vies with Japan to be the world's top ship builder. Last week, it became the 26th country to "graduate" from the World Bank, and is now an aid donor rather than a recipient.
"South Korea is on the borderline of becoming a high capital, knowledge-based economy, although its leaders still often see themselves as third world," said Robert G. Rich Jr., a former United States Ambassador to Seoul and head of the Korea Economic Institute of America, which is based in Washington.
South Korea's stock market, which peaked last November, has not escaped the emerging-market sell-off brought on by the Mexican fiasco, falling about 20 percent since then.
However, the decline is certainly being aided and abetted by a tighter monetary policy as the Central Bank fights economic overheating by attempting to slow last year's 9 percent growth rate -- Asia's fastest -- to a target of 7 percent for 1995.
The case for remaining bearish on South Korea is essentially political. Kim Jong Il's Communist state in North Korea could implode. If it does, the argument goes, South Korea would face even greater budgetary strains in taking over that impoverished country than the collapse of East Germany placed on West Germany after the Berlin Wall came down. Since Seoul would be forced to pump resources into the North to avert an economic catastrophe there, deficit spending and inflation would rise.
The bullish case, on the other hand, rests on the premise that none of the above will happen, allowing South Korea to gradually expand its business links with the North, effectively taking over North Korean economy without undermining the longtime Communist state.
"Economic integration followed by slow political integration is what the South wants and what would reassure China," said Michael Porter, an analyst who follows South Korea for Smith Barney Inc.
Some South Korea watchers expect the present phase of tight liquidity and market weakness to give way to easier conditions later this year, with interest rates coming off their present 15 percent peak and stock prices strengthening.
According to this view the strength of the Japanese yen will help South Korea's chaebol, as its dynastically controlled conglomerates are called, to remain competitive, allowing them to cash in on the heavy investments they have made recently in new Japanese capital equipment.
Analysts say June's regional elections should encourage monetary easing. Meanwhile, both domestic and foreign interest in the stock market ought to pick up. Plans to raise taxes on bank-deposit interest and to make it harder to conceal real estate ownership should push funds toward stocks.
At the same time, the Seoul Government plans to raise the 12 percent limit on foreign holdings in any quoted company to 15 percent this year, thus creating more space in the market for foreign investors. "For all these reasons we expect to see the market rise again later this year," said John Bai, the Korean expert for Baring Securities.
Investing in the South Korean market is not easy, however. Individual foreign investors face a regulatory obstacle course, so country funds make the most sense.
The two oldest, the Korea Fund and the Korea Investment Fund, traditionally command a premium because they hold blue chips now closed to foreigners. The Fidelity Advisor Korean Fund and the Korea Equity Fund are more recent, while January saw the creation of the Mathews Korea Fund by the Mathews International Fund Group in San Francisco.

HEADLINE: At Work;
A 'Married, With Children' Bias?

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
IN lots of ways, Rebecca Mark and Jeffrey Lockman are not a typical American family. They aren't married, they don't live together and both are gay.
They do, however, share responsibility for what most people would consider the defining aspect of family: a child. Together with Mr. Lockman's partner of 11 years, a physician who asked not to be named, they are raising Benjamin, now seven months old. Ms. Mark, an English professor at Tulane University in New Orleans, and Mr. Lockman, a Tulane psychology professor, live near each other, to make those sanity-saving baby handoffs easier; they own a house together, where Ms. Mark lives with Benjamin; they spend much of their free time in each other's company, and have a joint checking account. Ms. Mark and Mr. Lockman's partner are the baby's genetic mother and father, but the three adults have a legal agreement that they should all be considered parents. Imagine Murphy Brown forgoing single parenthood for a child-rearing arrangement with long-time companions Ward Cleaver and Mike Brady and you have their family configuration. 
 So when Ms. Mark and Mr. Lockman learned from colleagues at Tulane that married couples who both work on campus do not pay a monthly charge for dependent health care coverage, the pair decided to apply. The university didn't exactly say no, but it didn't say yes, either, leaving the two professors to charge that Tulane's coverage is at odds with its nondiscrimination policy and raising questions about how family is defined and who may confer legitimacy on one form versus another. Though the Lockman-Mark situation is unusual, the issues raised apply as well to unmarried heterosexual couples who have children together. As all types of nontraditional families become more common, institutions and companies are increasingly likely to find themselves grappling with such issues.
A Tulane official objected, saying the "benefit" heterosexual couples get is essentially a coincidence of their legally sanctioned union. Tulane contributes $200 a month toward health care for every employee. That automatically makes one person of a heterosexual marriage a dependent, and means they pay no further cost to cover their children. Single parents must pay $200 for dependent coverage. Because the benefit lasts until children are college-age, it could be worth close to $50,000.
Whatever commitments Mr. Lockman and Ms. Mark have made to each other on Benjamin's behalf, for insurance purposes, she is considered a single mother. Sexual orientation, the university says, is immaterial. "This is a single-mother-with-a-child issue," said Ronald Mason Jr., senior vice president and general counsel at Tulane. "Technically, she is not Lockman's dependent. They have no legal relationship."
The two professors point out that as gay people they would be prevented from marrying. In any case, they would not marry each other because theirs is a relationship based on the desire to bring up a child together, not to sustain a romantic-economic union. By refusing to recognize them, they argue, the university is elevating heterosexual matrimony over other forms of commitment. "The university is not supporting its gay families and children," Ms. Mark said. Mr. Lockman added: "Our family seems very different on the surface, but the values and stability of our unit are very much the same as other families. Families come in different forms."
Not according to the Internal Revenue Service and insurance industry standards, the guidelines Mr. Mason says Tulane uses to define dependents. Marriage is the issue, he says, and Tulane doesn't want to know the details. "People don't get married for a lot of reasons," Mr. Mason said. "We don't get into the whys. All we know is that she is an unmarried mother with a child."
Like most universities and hundreds of companies, Tulane has a nondiscrimination policy that includes language covering marital status and sexual orientation. That, the professors argue, is the core of their complaint. "Either they have a policy or they don't," Mr. Lockman said. "They shouldn't be picking and choosing whom it applies to."
If Tulane is in violation of its own policy, it is certainly not alone. Nondiscrimination statements are easily ignored because their legal force is ambiguous. But, said Suzanne B. Goldberg, a staff lawyer at the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay legal rights group, "a nondiscrimination statement is part of a university's promise to its employees. The purpose of the benefit is to assist employees who are raising children together. It seems to me that marriage is immaterial to the purpose."
Last year Tulane considered and -- because of the cost -- decided against paying for dependent coverage for unmarried employees, including domestic partners. Mr. Mason acknowledged that Mr. Lockman and Ms. Mark's application for dependent health care has moved the university to re-evaluate its coverage. "We're looking at a cafeteria-style plan, where employees can choose the coverage they want," he said. "There's a lot of need out there and a limited ability of the university to provide." The university committee that has tabled the professors' request twice will rehear it sometime in the next few weeks.
The professors see a judgment on their lives and the legitimacy of gay and other nontraditional families in Tulane's current policy. "I get outraged because marriage becomes something that gives you benefits," Ms. Mark said. "Look around, and see all the women who can't afford coverage, at a liberal university." Mr. Lockman is particularly impatient with the cost analysis: "It's a moral issue. They are discriminating against our type of family."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Looking Back at the Overlooked

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
WITH all the attention paid to mutual funds these days, some good ones still slip by.
Maybe it's because more than 5,000 funds are vying for attention. Or maybe it's a matter of marketing. Or just bad luck. 
 The bottom line: There are a few small winners waiting to be discovered. And because more and more good funds are shutting out new investors, it's worth investigating these so-called forgotten funds.
There are five such funds on the sixth annual list as compiled by Morningstar Inc., the fund research company in Chicago. Each holds less than $ 125 million and has had the same manager for at least three years.
Three ply their trade in the fixed-income arena, offering alternatives to leery bond-fund investors. For stock investors, there is a conservative equity pick and a more aggressive one.
The $ 102 million Loomis Sayles Bond Fund walks its own path, Morningstar said. Its returns differ greatly from the United States corporate bond market, given the investments made by its manager, Daniel J. Fuss, in discount-priced bonds, convertible holdings and foreign debt.
"We're not much of a believer in market forecasting," he said. "We're bond pickers."
His typical investor: his father-in-law, who invested all his retirement money in the fund and lives off the income. The fund yields just over 9 percent.
The portfolio sports an average credit quality of BBB, just above junk-bond level, and its maturity now averages 20 years. While the fund is less than four years old, "its prowess in both bull and bear markets, along with unusual breadth, give us a good dose of confidence about its future," Morningstar wrote.
Michael C. Brilley has managed the $ 36 million Sit U.S. Government Securities Fund since its 1987 inception. It owns government issues only and yielded 6.84 percent in January. He says his goal is to "position ourselves as a more conservative bond investment with a fairly intermediate duration," now about 2.2 years.
That's lower than usual for the fund, which currently has higher-than-usual investments, 10.9 percent, in Treasury bills waiting for the market to rise another 10 to 15 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, before reinvesting. "We look for a modest increase in inflation, to about 3 1/2 percent by year-end," Mr. Brilley said.
A big chunk of the fund -- 70 percent -- is in Ginnie Mae manufactured housing pass-through certificates, loans for buyers of mobile homes. These are less volatile than conventional Ginnie Maes because prepayments are rare and the loans are smaller.
Edward A. Killen helped his brother, Robert, research investments for 16 years and signed on as official manager of the $ 63 million Berwyn Income Fund in June. Berwyn can keep no more than 25 percent of its holdings in common shares; otherwise, Mr. Killen can pretty much do what he wants.
He describes Berwyn as "relatively defensive, a complement to an equity fund."
Fund shareholders agreed to let him invest in junk issues last June, and that is where most of his corporate exposure is now. "We feel that the credit risk is less than the principal risk in higher-grade securities," he said.
Despite the tremendous correction in Treasuries in 1994, "the basic industry economy is very strong," he said. The fund's two largest sectors are computers, 12 percent, and oil and gas, 10.3 percent.
Convertible securities account for 43 percent of the fund, which recently yielded 8.2 percent. Common stocks, 18 percent of holdings, include Occidental Petroleum and A. O. Smith, a maker of frames for utility vehicles.
The $ 105 million Franklin Equity-Income Fund stands out because it relies on high-dividend stocks and convertible preferred shares, not bonds, to create its income. The fund recently yielded 5 percent. Its co-managers, Frank M. Felicelli and Douglas Barton, seek blue-chip stocks yielding at least 25 percent more than the market.
Their biggest sectors are utilities and basic materials, both 15 percent. The biggest holdings: Chemical Banking, Hanson P.L.C. and GTE.
The $ 80 million Wasatch Aggressive Equity Fund is not a "gunslinging, churn or burn fund," its manager, Samuel S. Stewart Jr., says. Wasatch's 1994 turnover was just 40 percent.
Mr. Stewart looks for small growth companies with "an identifiable and sustainable advantage in markets where they have room to at least double the size of the company in at least five years." Its biggest holdings are Loewen Group, a British Columbia company with 80 percent of its funeral-home-consolidation business in the United States; U.S. Cellular, in Chicago, and Heilig-Meyers, a furniture store chain in Richmond.
Mr. Stewart cheered last year's bad market: "We're finding plenty of companies in the current environment given the fall in prices."

HEADLINE: Markets Rise and Fall, but He's Always Looking Up

BYLINE: By ANNE MATTHEWS; Anne Matthews teaches journalism at New York University's graduate program and writes frequently about contemporary social issues.

 BODY:
TO the Manhattan financial astrologer Arch Crawford, 1995 is slated to be a grim untidy year: plenty of earthquakes and a stock market heading south.
"Prices will top the first week in April," he says firmly. "Then a good summer rally. Mid-November brings a serious, serious correction." He pushes at his wire-rimmed glasses, concentrating. 
 "I see at least a 1,000-point drop in late '95, with the Dow stabilizing at 2,600 to 2,800. But there'll be a sharp rally after Thanksgiving, back above 3,200," he says kindly, draining his decaffeinated cappuccino.
Archibald A. H. Crawford, 53, is a professional astrologer, a Merrill Lynch alumnus and an Aries -- "a fine sign for investors," he adds, in a soft North Carolina drawl. Mr. Crawford specializes in market timing -- the art of calling portfolio switches in and out of the stock, bond and gold markets -- and his recommendations appear in a monthly newsletter, Crawford Perspectives. Its motto is "Market timing by planetary cycles and technical analysis since 1977"; a year's subscription is $ 250.
Early last month, Mr. Crawford's forecast was "instability, big time" for March 5 and 6 -- the start of the currency crisis as it turned out. Two months ago, he predicted earthquakes for the days that brought the Kobe tremor. He kind of predicted the 1990 start of the Gulf war: "expect some major catastrophe Aug. 2-7," his newsletter warned, "Mars opposite Pluto suggests coercion, force." So far, forecasting the October 1987 stock market crash is his biggest triumph. "Be out of all stocks by Aug. 24," he warned clients late that summer. And -- win some, lose some -- he has made a number of miscalls, like the market collapse he envisioned in late '82 that turned instead into a record rally.
Mr. Crawford's view of the stars is severely statistical -- or tries to be. "What I do is totally science," he insists, "but in the process some very strange stuff, weird magic, comes to light." Believing that heavenly events affect human events that sometimes affect financial markets, Mr. Crawford calculates percentage changes in the Dow Jones back to 1897, relates that data to astronomical events like sunspots or solar flares and, aided by 28 conventional market indicators, fits the whole into a cyclical prediction line.
He doesn't make specific portfolio recommendations. Instead, he advises his clients on mutual fund switching (among money markets and gold, stock and bond funds) and on the optimal moments to go to cash. Trading under his direction can be brisk, even hyperactive: followers last year would have switched in and out of the market, on average, every eight weeks.
What unnerves more conventional stock analysts is Mr. Crawford's latest ranking by the Hulbert Financial Digest, based in Alexandria, Va., which is widely considered the most rigorous national observer of financial-newsletter performance. Of the 42 market timers assessed over the last year, Mr. Crawford is No. 2.
"Numbers and track record are all I watch," says the publisher, Mark Hulbert, a touch stiffly. "If tea leaves or sunspots or piles of dirty laundry in my apartment prove significant, I have to take notice." He adds: " His three- and five-year records have beaten a buy-and-hold strategy. And he did slightly outperform the market in 1994."
Last Wednesday, Mr. Crawford was ranked No. 1 in stock and bond timing by the Investment Newsletter Timer Digest published in Greenwich, Conn., by James H. Schmidt, a former Wall Street brokerage house vice president.
New York has other financial astrologers, but Mr. Crawford is one of the few to offer a newsletter and a hot line. (In the fiercely competitive, ego-intensive world of financial advising, the cooler players offer a "900" number with twice-daily updates.) One longtime competitor, William Meridian, currently manages investments in Abu Dhabi. Another, Henry Weingarten of the New York School of Astrology, offers the Astrologers Fund, a mutual fund run on astrological principles. The school is planning a May symposium on astrology and the market.
There are, of course, those who question the Crawford strategy. "The random walk theory allows for all kinds of people to have a good year occasionally," says Howard A. Rubel, vice president of investment research at Goldman, Sachs. "But most professional investors focus on fundamentals -- earnings, track record, market share, cash flow. Their interests don't include the ethereal."
WHO consults an astrologer before making stock trades?
Mr. Crawford's approximately 1,000 current subscribers include heads of several regional brokerage houses; executives from the Indian subcontinent who live in the West yet retain a taste for astral authority; 4 of the 20 champion investors profiled in Jack Schwager's recent book "The New Market Wizards," Mr. Crawford claims (he declines to name them), and enough Zurich gnomes and Bonn bankers to warrant a separate German edition.
"North Americans have no idea how seriously Europeans take mystical investing," says one Credit Suisse banker.
Although oracle investing is very much taboo on Wall Street, it has begun to draw second looks, if not respect. Eighty percent of all mutual-fund buyers and financial newsletter editors now fail to beat the markets, says Mr. Hulbert. "In last year's bond rout," noted Institutional Investor in January, "more wealth was wiped off balance sheets than in any other market debacle since the crash of 1929."
"The ultimate American fantasy has become security: social, emotional, spiritual, financial," says Hayden White, a professor in the history of consciousness program at the University of California at Santa Cruz. And investors are reacting in very different ways to Wall Street's now-chronic insecurity, a condition aggravated by industry layoffs and terrorist checkpoints. Some redouble their herd instincts; others discover a lusty appetite for the strange. At the same time, Wall Street is morphing into an entertainment form rich in stars and sinners, cults and rites. And New Age objets.
Traders once content with lucky socks can now soak in jinx-remover bath salts. They can check the Internet's Divination Web before buying bonds. They can pay for emergency sessions at the Wall Street Hypnosis Center with Mastercard's new Horoscope Card, embossed with the user's name and zodiac sign. Thriving astrological-software companies like Astrolabe let anyone try star-based trades.
Financial astrology is now part of the multibillion-dollar New Age movement -- disorganized, apolitical and growing. "Washington doesn't get it, but Wall Street should be more nimble on this," observes David H. Thorne, a former real estate developer who heads New Age Publishing in Watertown, Mass. "We're talking many, many billions, a growing chunk of the new economy. One in three Americans now pursues alternative forms of health care. Natural foods and products annually top $ 6 billion. New-age music, another $ 1 billion. Self-help and new-spirituality publishing? Billions there too. It's not just crystals any more. Besides, a financial astrologer who can beat the markets is a guy to watch."
As the nonrational turns ever-more marketable, all manner of seers are popping up: chaos-theory visionaries, sunspot trackers, astrologers who work up natal horoscopes for companies based on their hour of incorporation, mutual-fund clairvoyants, feng shui consultants who free unlucky conference rooms from evil spirits.
ARCH CRAWFORD, studied physics and math at the University of North Carolina, but left without a degree to work as a research assistant to Robert Farrell, the long-time Merrill Lynch technical research chief. In 1963, Mr. Crawford discovered his metier when he read an article in The Wall Street Journal on investors who used heavenly events to guide commodities buying. In his spare time, Mr. Crawford began serious research into the subject, looking for connections between astrological goings-on and the prices of stocks, copper and gold.
After a three-year stint in the Army in the late 60's, including a year in Vietnam, Mr. Crawford worked as a financial analyst and stockbroker and even studied to become a psychologist. Then in 1975 he had a dream, he says, that he should return to Wall Street trading. He bought options and made money. He combined astrological methods and technical indicators; he made more money.
Today, Mr. Crawford is joined in his newsletter venture by his wife, Carolyn Snedden, whom he met in 1988 at an astrology convention in Las Vegas, Nev. Ms. Snedden -- who casts $ 150 personalized horoscopes for investors who want to know which days are good for clear-headed trading -- has spiffed up Crawford Perspectives, taming her husband's idiosyncratic page layouts, if not his staccato prose ("Dec. 2: Jupiter conjunct Pluto. Perigee new moon. Powerful. Low in bonds!" "Dec. 6: Mars square Pluto = More about war, fires, murder.").
Nonetheless, financial astrologers like Henry Weingarten, of the Astrologers Fund, are bullish about their brand of financial forecasting. "Getting fund managers out of the closet is really our goal," says Mr. Weingarten. "We had $ 4 billion in funds represented at our last conference. Financial astrologers are everywhere. You know them only as investment bankers with terrific records. Let a pension fund announce it's run by astrologers, and 20 percent of the clients vanish. The other 80 percent, of course, say, Great, fine. But there's tremendous prejudice -- tremendous!"
In the unruly world of alternative finance, Mr. Crawford is as buttoned-down as they come, meeting fellow market-cycle enthusiasts for cocktails and forecasting at the Princeton Club, delivering painstaking addresses on astrological methodology to the Market Technicians Association. "But there's always a bunch in the back of the room," he acknowledges, "growling that I'm a travesty of justice."
Mr. Crawford's newsletter's recommendations to dive for cover when Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn and Venus conjunct are likely to continue to circulate through research departments and executive suites, if only in brown paper bags. Asked if they would ever consult his hot line, a dozen traders and analysts had the same firm reply. Yes, all agreed -- but from a pay phone.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Lamborghini Diablo VT;
'Do You Know, Mr. Vader, How Fast You Were Going?'

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
IF Darth Vader agreed to do another "Star Wars" sequel and rented a weekend place in Malibu, what would he drive?
Corvettes and Vipers have the muscle, but lack the finesse. Ferraris have finesse to spare, but look too much like Japanese knock-offs of Ferraris to make the proper impression in Tinseltown. 
 What's left for the ultimate macho guy? A Diablo VT, Automobili Lamborghini's ultimate macho driving machine. And just in case The Force deserts Mr. Vader at some inopportune moment on the twists and turns of Topanga Canyon, he can rely on the Diablo VT's four-wheel drive to save his bacon.
Lamborghini, you may not remember, is a relatively recent (1964) addition to the world of exotic cars, the hobby and passion of the Italian tractor maker. And while it is apparently not true that Ferruccio Lamborghini went into the car business because he got wretched service from the imperious Enzo Ferrari, the myth has a certain appeal.
The first Lamborghini, the 12-cylinder 350GT, was designed by an engineer pirated from Ferrari. And while Lamborghini never challenged the Ferraris on the race track, its futuristic Countach, introduced in 1973, beat all contenders as the tough car of choice for those who didn't have to ask how much it cost.
Signor Lamborghini probably never made money on the cars, and production never exceeded a few hundred a year. And when the rest of his industrial empire tottered in the 1970's, he relinquished control of the tiny auto maker. It ended up in the hands of Chrysler in 1987, which invested in one new design -- the Diablo -- and was mulling over plans for more when the market for exotics evaporated in the recession of the early 1990's.
Megatech, a group of Indonesians, bought the name and the factory near Modena, Italy, a year ago. The latest model to come to America is the mid-engine V12 Diablo VT, which pushes 492 horsepower through all four wheels.
Like the Countach, the Diablo is a jaw-dropper. The aluminum body, 43.5 inches at its highest, is one long swoop from the huge rear wing to the front spoiler. The doors pivot vertically on hydraulic arms, opening just enough to allow driver and passenger to wedge into bucket seats anchored a few inches above the floor pan.
But unlike the user-unfriendly Countach, the Diablo VT is made to be driven by mortals. The seats are comfortable -- well, comfortable enough to use for hours at a time without chiropractic intervention. Controls, including those for the powerful (if noisy) air-conditioning and adequate radio, are within easy reach, and the analog instrument panel is a model of clear design. All the right surfaces are covered in beige leather.
What's more, the view over the short, sharply sloped hood is excellent. And -- surprise, surprise -- the rear spoiler sits high enough above the engine compartment to provide adequate rear vision.
A Diablo may look as if it is moving when it is parked, but the real adventure begins when you turn the key. The 5.7-liter, 48-valve aluminum engine, positioned just inches behind the driver's head, idles with a delicious rumble reminiscent of a Harley-Davidson. The stick on the five-speed, chrome-gated transmission, though, clunks into first like the control lever on one of Signor Lamborghini's old tractors; presumably it will slide with more grace when the car is broken in.
Takeoff (what would you call it?) is undramatic, the throttle feeling almost sluggish. That sounds like a serious handicap, but it is not: the Diablo VT behaves itself in traffic, noodling along in first or second gear below 30 miles an hour without complaint. The real action -- that is, most of the 428 foot-pounds of torque -- hits when the monstrous engine is turning above 4,000 r.p.m.
Hence, while the engine breathes without the aid of a turbocharger, the power kicks in after a brief pause with what feels like "turbo lag." This noticeable delay in gratification is a sensitive subject for the image makers at Lamborghini, who assert that the Diablo VT can still make it from zero to 60 in 4.1 seconds without vaporizing the clutch. But such improbable boasts should not discourage those tempted to buy the Diablo to drive rather than to brag about: once the mighty 12-cylinder is turning at warp speed, the acceleration is astounding.
The Harley-like rumble becomes a MIG-like howl as the car explodes from 30 to 70 in second gear. The noise and the proximity to the asphalt heighten the sensation of speed, especially on curves. But the electronically controlled suspension -- it automatically stiffens the otherwise pliant shocks on bumpy surfaces -- assures a comfortable ride. And four-wheel drive eliminates the threat that the rear end will break loose on anything less than the most reckless provocation.
Allow me to elaborate. The Diablo VT is subject to the laws of physics; push it hard enough in a turn and the superfat 17-inch tires will eventually lose their grip. But unlike rear-wheel-drive cars with engines this powerful there is no danger that a loss of nerve -- a lift of the throttle that shifts the weight balance from rear to front in the middle of a turn -- will send the Diablo VT spinning toward the guardrail.
Is this latest Lamborghini worth $239,000, plus assorted taxes? Probably not as an investment. The days of watching exotic cars appreciate in the garage is apparently over. Probably not in terms of pure performance, either. Top-of-the-line Porsches and the new "entry level" Ferrari F355 are nimbler -- and half the price.
But the Diablo VT is a wonder on its own terms: kinetic sculpture, proof of affluence and amusement park ride wrapped into one. And if that isn't sufficient temptation, the nice folks at Lamborghini will throw in a set of leather luggage specially designed to fit the miniature trunk.
 
INSIDE TRACK: Recherche styling and brute power in one handy, unaffordable package.

THE END OF REFORM
New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War.
By Alan Brinkley.
371 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50. 
IT is by now a commonplace that the New Deal era in American history has come to a close, an observation given emphatic punctuation by the conservative Republican sweep of the 1994 elections. Liberalism, for nearly half a century this country's regnant political philosophy, apparently now belongs to history -- and to the historians.
Over the history of all the modern liberal tradition, of course, hangs the shadow of the New Deal. Venturing into battle against the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt and his fellow reformers blazed a new pathway into the political future. Escaping from the confining doctrines of laissez-faire that had stunted previous reform campaigns, so the conventional story goes, the New Dealers transformed the character of government and began the process of building contemporary American society.
Yet even in that heady and creative moment, as Alan Brinkley explains in "The End of Reform," liberalism was not free of travail. Overestimating the scope and strength of the mandate he received in his hugely lopsided 1936 re-election (in which he carried every state except Maine and Vermont), Roosevelt recklessly attempted to "pack" the Supreme Court with additional Justices who would presumably be more amenable to his programs. Ultimately, this episode squandered the prodigious political capital with which he began his second term and stalled the New Deal in its tracks.
Moreover, the hullabaloo over the Court was closely followed, in the fall of 1937, by a recession even more precipitous -- though, as it turned out, shorter-lived -- than the slide that had begun in 1929. Argument now intensified about what course liberalism should take. Reformers of all persuasions bombarded Roosevelt in 1937 and 1938 with a bewildering battery of conflicting advice. Government power, liberals agreed, must be invoked. On the precise policies that might be deployed there was no agreement whatsoever.
Much of this book focuses on the "intense ideological struggle" of late 1937 and 1938. It was, says Mr. Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia University, "a struggle to define the soul of the New Deal." By extension, it was also a contest to define the content of liberalism itself. The outcome of that contest, in Mr. Brinkley's view, left much to be desired. What's more, he provocatively suggests, the resolution of the policy debates of the 1937-38 period, effectively institutionalized in the great upheaval of World War II, seems to explain "why modern American liberalism had proved to be a so much weaker and more vulnerable force than almost anyone would have imagined a generation ago."
Rehearsing arcane debates among economic policy makers -- the kinds of chart-flourishing, number-wheezing specialists known to a later generation as wonks -- tests the skill of even so accomplished a writer as Mr. Brinkley. Yet from the cacophony of opinion that filled the air in the late 1930's, Mr. Brinkley teases out several distinct voices. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau intoned pieties about restoring business confidence by balancing the budget. Assistant Attorney General Robert Jackson, the ubiquitous insider Thomas Corcoran and a raft of eager young men, many of them proteges of the Harvard law professor Felix Frankfurter, urged an all-out attack on the allegedly stultifying power of monopolies. One older New Dealer dismissed this crowd as "boys with their hair ablaze." And ironically, Thurman Arnold, the chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, had once sneered at the antitrust statutes as so much "thick priestly incense"; he argued instead for an invigorated regulatory state in which expert bureaucrats would continuously fine-tune the nation's economic machinery. Marriner Eccles, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Roosevelt's confidant Harry Hopkins championed deficit spending not just for relief purposes, as in the early New Deal, but for the general purpose of economic stimulus, a stimulus that the private sector seemed chronically unable to provide.
The spenders carried the day, persuading Roosevelt to submit a budget for fiscal 1939 that consciously embraced a deficit for purposes of economic recovery. Roosevelt's decision is usually cited as the first deliberate embrace of the ideas of John Maynard Keynes in the history of American economic policy, a point familiar to readers of Herbert Stein's classic 1969 study, "The Fiscal Revolution in America." Yet as Mr. Stein also points out, Keynes did no more than provide a coherent rationale and a politically usable explanation for economic practices that grew not from the tidy pages of textbooks but from the jumble of circumstance and adaptation. Deficit spending had become by 1939 a virtually inevitable policy, given the demonstrated inefficacy or political unpalatability of such alternatives as the failed National Recovery Administration or a drastic tax reduction -- not to mention the evolution of powerful constituencies whose claims to Government funds were quickly assuming the character of rights. Mr. Brinkley's account expands on that insight of Mr. Stein's and exposes the practical and political logic of the deficit strategy that was finally adopted.
Yet if Mr. Stein found much to admire in Roosevelt's "fiscal revolution," which underlay America's prosperity in the post-World War II era, Mr. Brinkley finds much to regret. A specter haunts this book -- the specter of "planning" as envisioned in the N.R.A. of 1933 and later known as "industrial policy." Though he does not develop the point fully, Mr. Brinkley suggests that when the liberals of the late 1930's abandoned hope for a far-reaching overhaul of the American economy and instead embraced the Keynesian notion that government's principal duty was to protect national economic health by underwriting aggregate consumer demand, they in fact beat a craven retreat from "genuine" reform. They deferred to a later day the moment when state power would have to be applied to the economy in more vigorous and intensive ways.
It is arguable whether that day of reckoning has now arrived. Surely much current evidence, both here and abroad, suggests other strategies for achieving economic vitality and social progress. It is further arguable whether it was liberal spinelessness and the revitalization of American capitalism occasioned by World War II that thwarted the emergence of the kind of interventionist government that Mr. Brinkley seems inclined to favor. As he acknowledges here -- and as he brilliantly argued in his earlier book, "Voices of Protest" -- suspicion of centralized state power is deeply rooted in American culture, and yields but grudgingly even in the face of traumas as disruptive as the Great Depression. Indeed, even the early New Deal, which Mr. Brinkley describes admiringly as "awash in ideas" for ambitious reform, was, in the last analysis, remarkably cautious in its encroachment on the prerogatives of private capital. Given the history of the intervening half-century, who can say that such caution was altogether misplaced?

HEADLINE: Leased-Employee Concept Rides Again

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to "leased employees," Pinkerton started the practice more than 100 years ago with guards that protected Pony Express riders. Yet, it was only recently when the costs of employee benefits and personnel administration skyrocketed, that the Pinkerton man was transformed into an industry called out-sourcing.
"What we mean by out-sourcing is that we take over all the functions of a company's human resource department," said Steven Tessler, head of an employee management concern called Corporate Management Group. "What we do is contract with companies to provide them with such things as health insurance, pension plans, payroll processing: all the administrative responsibilities that were formerly handled by a company's human resource staff or its people in the comptroller's department." 
 Mr. Tessler, 42, lives in New Rochelle. He founded the Corporate Management Group in Manhattan four years ago. The company recently opened a regional office in Scarsdale.
"Inflationary factors, such as the 20 to 30 percent annual rise in health-care costs, has prompted companies to look for ways to curtail costs. Mr. Tessler said that that had contributed to the rapid growth of his company.
"I've been an entrepreneur from way back -- from the days I ran a college student window-cleaning business," he said. "I guess I like the excitement of starting businesses. With Corporate Management, I was lucky in the timing because I managed to plug into an emerging growth industry. Since 1991 we have grown from a 0 to the largest company of our kind in the Northeast. We are now doing business in 23 states for 116 client companies who have a total of over 15,000 employees among them, and this year we expect to generate $60 million to $70 million in sales."
By consolidating small and medium-size businesses into groups, Mr. Tessler said, savings allow Corporate Management to give businesses and their employees the widest choice of options for health, pension and other benefits.
"For example, when you are buying health insurance for 15,000 employees, it obviously gives you much more clout in the marketplace and you can get a better price," Mr. Tessler said. "So instead of having to reduce the health care and fringe benefits, companies are actually able to offer employees more when we act as their human resource department."
And, he emphasized, what is equally important is that it evens the playing field.
"When small companies can't attract employees because they can't compete with the big boys, the Fortune 500's, in offering employee benefits, they lose out."
Although the majority of clients are small to mid-size companies, Mr. Tessler observed that there are also a number of Fortune 500 companies represented.
"We don't work for the entire Fortune 500 company but rather for a division or a department of the company," he explained. "For example, Bankers Trust is a client. And we work for their security division: their bank guards and concierge people and for their infirmary, which is the internal medical division of the company, which is about 50 of their employees."
By eliminating personnel administration, Mr. Tessler said, companies benefit by having more time and energy to devote to their main event and that lets them expand their business and become more profitable.
"One client said that the extra time he gained -- he estimated it at 80 hours a year -- proved to be more valuable to him than the saving he got in his health costs," Mr. Tessler said.
Another client, Yoram Shemesh is the president of World Class Films, a packaging materials company employing 130 people in Yonkers. Mr. Shemesh and his partner, Tom Gessler, have been in business since 1976. It was their controller, Lorelei Koran, who upon speaking to Mr. Tessler, suggested that World Class Films use the services of Corporate Management Group.
Mr. Shemesh recalled: "She said that by freeing her from unproductive things such as workmen's compensation, unemployment paperwork, payroll and other nonrevenue-producing areas that took up 40 percent of her time, she thought she would be more effective because she would be able to devote more time to strategic planning. We talked to Mr. Tessler, and we decided to go ahead with it. A health plan was a big factor. We are able to buy better coverage cheaper with more flexibility, which is tailored to each employee's need."
Although Mr. Shemesh said that there have been no reductions in staff since he contracted with Corporate Management, he added that "staff members now have time to do more productive things."
Stuart Kolbert, who opened Corporate Management's Scarsdale office in January, said that the company had already signed up six clients in Westchester.
"However," he said, "employee leasing is not a concept everyone is able to relate to. We can talk to 100 companies before we sign up two clients."
The prototype of a most unlikely candidate is, he said, "a business owner who is in his late 50's or early 60's who has been running his business for 20 or 30 years." He continued: "The perception of having an outsider come in and take over functions of his company is one of losing control. It's an emotional thing but a very powerful deterrent."
On the other hand, Mr. Tessler said, not every company that is willing to become a corporate-management client can do so.
"We walk away from about one-third of the business we are offered because, basically, we are underwriters," he said. "We have to assess the element of risk because when we sign a contract with a company we become the employer of record. We are the ones who are held accountable if a company can't meet its payroll. So we screen our clients carefully before we take them on."
Companies with 10 or more employees pay Corporate Management 3 to 6 percent of gross payroll in fees, he said, while companies with fewer than 10 employees pay a yearly fee of $1,000 to $2,000 for each employee.
"Their contracts come up for renewal in January," Mr. Tessler said. "And our renewal rate is very high. Clients don't leave us, but sometimes we have to terminate relationships. This past January we had to terminate five relationships. Companies who can't meet our payroll are, to my mind, dead in 24 hours."
Mr. Tessler and Mr. Kolbert met when they were both working for the same employee-leasing concern in Manhattan. Both have strong sales and marketing backgrounds. Mr. Kolbert, 57, a Scarsdale resident, was the co-founder and former executive vice president of RAMS Marketing, a real estate sales and marketing company in the New York City area.
"When I sold out to my partner in 1988, I felt I was too young to retire, and I was looking around at businesses," Mr. Kolbert said. "I happened to stumble on employee leasing. It sounded interesting but too good to be true, so in order to do a little research I went to their national convention to see it for myself. What I found was serious people in a real industry. And I thought it supplied impressive benefits to both employers and employees."
The Westchester office, Mr. Kolbert said, gives the company local representation. "Clients like to see a real somebody," he said.
Corporate Management also has offices in Los Angeles, Washington, and Cherry Hill, N.J.

PUBESCENCE is quirky and unpredictable, filled with individual variations on a universal theme. Too many instructive books for children have diagramed sex and reproduction -- or worse, romanticized those subjects. But in "It's Perfectly Normal: A Book About Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health" the author, Robie H. Harris, and the illustrator, Michael Emberley, manage to be honest without losing their senses of humor. Ms. Harris's text is informal, wide-ranging and candid; Mr. Emberley's pictures are informal, wide-ranging, candid and funny. No fact or image is too embarrassing for them to take on. If you doubt me, just turn to page 23 and check out the girl looking upside down into a mirror to locate her anus, vagina and urethra -- all conspicuously apparent to the reader.
Other pages discuss and portray different-size penises, different possibilities for birth control and safe sex, and different ways a baby can be born. The illustrations show an array of anatomical shapes, ethnic variations and sexual persuasions. The design is a marvel of coordinated information and illustration. This is cartooning at its best -- witty, expressive and accurately reflective of human antics. Perhaps the closest relative to the bird-and-bee duo who comment throughout "It's Perfectly Normal" is the mammoth who chats to the reader in David Macaulay's handbook "The Way Things Work." In fact, "It's Perfectly Normal" is a kind of human companion to Mr. Macaulay's marvel of mechanical explanation.
One of the advantages of the design of "It's Perfectly Normal" is that the cartoon illustrations extend its appeal to readers in a remarkably broad age range even though the book is intended for early adolescents. A younger child can enjoy the art while a parent paraphrases an introduction to the facts of life. An independent reader in the lower grades can seek definitions of both familiar and less familiar terms in privacy. Preadolescents can test their knowledge against what's so clearly demonstrated here. And adolescents can give a superior smirk while secretly learning what they most need to know about sexual survival in a world threatened by sexually transmitted diseases.
"Heartbreak and Roses: Real Life Stories of Troubled Love" is a book aimed straight at adolescent sexual survivors. Based on interviews with a dozen teen-agers of both sexes, these brief stories describe dramatic situations that developed in their love lives. Janet Bode, who was careful to include a cross section of economic classes and ethnic groups in her powerful book "The Voices of Rape," does the same thing here. Bonnie learns to leave an abusively jealous boyfriend. Louis suffers the whims of a flirt he's fallen for too hard. Pam details her first painful intercourse. Ofelia, who uses a wheelchair, explains how her boyfriend's understanding overcomes the sexual awkwardness of her disability. Kirsten's romance with a skinhead is depicted in the familiar comic-book style of Stan Mack, Ms. Bode's co-author. I would like to have seen a note on how these interviews were collected and how much they were edited (some of the dialogue is fictionally smooth). I admit, however, to zipping right through them with only the occasional incredulous pause. Adolescents' lives often do sound like soap operas; two teen-agers I know consumed this book in the same afternoon.
"Changes in You and Me: A Book About Puberty, Mostly for Girls," by Paulette Bourgeois and Dr. Martin Wolfish (there is a companion volume for boys), did not hold their attention. It's a responsible book, but not much fun. For those who like their sex serious and straight-faced, however, here is an encyclopedic presentation with transparent overlays that would be satisfying if the figures underneath were not so stiffly drawn. The scope of the information is exemplary, including, for instance, information on toxic shock syndrome, douching and pelvic examinations that most girls need to know and may not find elsewhere. Unfortunately, this is offset by misinformation, such as these questionable assertions: "Most girls are healthy and fit and have no weight problems. . . . If people tease you about your weight, then you probably are carrying more weight than is healthy." Or vague information: "Before two people have sexual intercourse, they usually kiss and touch each other above and below the waist." Nevertheless, this book is better than no book. As a 14-year-old once wrote in a term paper on sex education, "It is important to understand what you are getting into before you get into it."

HEADLINE: Access Gets New Meaning In Local Politics

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
A PUBLIC-SPIRITED citizen no longer has to use paper to post a notice at Town Hall, the library or any other public agency. That's because, increasingly, the bulletin board is of the electronic variety.
Want to know the date of the next town meeting? Learn how to compost yard waste? Obtain some assistance figuring your state taxes? Research a term paper? Chat with the mayor? Look up a bill that's making its way through the legislature? You can do it all on line through government computer services that are springing up around the state. 
 A project manager for the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, David W. Chrzanowski, said that more than 400 calls were logged on his agency's bulletin board service in its first few months of operation.
The service lists information about management of solid waste, with tips on recycling, hints on how to make things from natural ingredients and environmental news being particularly popular these days. "The software out there these days is very user friendly," Mr. Chrzanowski said. "To date we haven't had any critical comments about our service. It would be great if all state agencies were on line, be- cause it would mean more people could get involved with the
process."
Stephen W. Lewis, who set up his own computerized bulletin board service for information about the legislature last year, said allowing people to access information electronically would also save copying, paper, postage and other costs associated with traditional forms of disseminating information. With the push of a button and at almost no cost an electronic message can be copied to millions of homes.
"At this time it's impossible to quantify what the savings might be, but they would not be insignificant," Mr. Lewis said. "We could maintain a huge mailing list without any real expense."
"We have in Connecticut a very highly educated, very high-income state, so this would be a natural place to establish computer access to government. I guess it's just that there haven't been enough people in government who have the experience with computers to bring these ideas forward."
But a new legislative task force is recommending wider use of the information superhighway as a way to encourage participation in government.
Its report urges state support for libraries to purchase computers that would be available to the public, that legislative data be made available via toll-free telephone lines and that legislators be given electronic mail addresses.
One task force member surveyed members of the General Assembly on E-mail; 82 percent of those responding said they would be interested.
Richard Ferrari, a Republican of East Granby and a member of the task force, said that disseminating information via printed documents "is little better than scribes scribbling down the stuff."
Computerized bulletin boards and E-mail will give legislators the chance to communicate with more of their constituents.
"We're supposed to be accessible to our constituents, and this is just another way to be accessible," Mr. Ferrari said. "The more information we get out there, the better. It's essential, for us to do a good job, that people know what we're doing and react to it."
Mr. Lewis, the administrator of the legislature's public health committee, set up a bulletin board service a year ago that lists the committee's bills, as well as general information about the legislature, including a list of the names, home telephone numbers and addresses for all 187 state legislators.
"When I first suggested the idea to the Office of Legislative Management, I don't think anyone knew what I was talking about," Mr. Lewis said. "I got them to agree to give me a copy of all the bills on diskette -- if I provided the diskette."
Mr. Lewis set up the system on a computer in the basement of his home. As of the end of January, the bulletin board listed 564 available files and had logged more than 1,000 calls, with 222 active users.
"There are new users coming on line every day," Mr. Lewis said. "If you took that interest and multiplied it times the number of committees up here, it could mean thousands of users on a daily basis."
Libraries have been at the forefront of the trend in Connecticut. The capitol region's Library Council has developed an electronic card catalogue known as Connect, which users can access via home computers or from terminals in any of the 23 participating libraries.
People tapping into Connect can download magazine abstracts and, in some cases, the full text of articles. They can search for books by author, title or subject. Data bases are also available through CARL, the Colorado Association of Research Libraries, which has expanded to 411 institutions across the country.
"From the response we've been getting at member libraries, I guess a lot of people have modems and are using them," said Betsy Wilkens, assistant executive director of the council. "It's exciting that people can actually bring the library into their homes."
The director of administrative services at the Ferguson Library in Stamford, Nicholas A. Bochicchio Jr., said a dial-up service has more than 1,000 registered users.
In addition to the library's catalogue, users can call up back issues of the local newspaper. The library also provides Internet access to three other city agencies -- computer services, traffic and parking, and the health department -- with four more being hooked up.
"I'm not a real techie person, but I've got Internet access on the computer next to my desk," Mr. Bochicchio said. "It's not an easy source of information, and I think that's one thing librarians don't like about it, but there's an enormous amount of information there, and you need to know how to get to it."
Mr. Bochicchio said he was also negotiating with local groups about the possibility of an on-line community calendar, with individual groups updating their own entries periodically.
Schools, too, have been technology pioneers. The principal at Brookfield High School, Dr. Thomas M. Smyth, said a bulletin board operating there gives people information on town meetings, events, meetings of groups such as the Rotary and Lions, and cancellations.
"It's just starting to become popular," Dr. Smyth said. "I think it's the type of thing that, over a two-year period, will double or even quadruple in use. It's the same thing that happened with computers -- there's a lag between when the technology becomes available and when it reaches the masses. There's a learning curve."
And, as was the case with computers, it will be the children who drag the parents into the modern information age, he predicted. Children will get up in the morning after a snowfall, for example, to check the bulletin board for a school-closing message and parents will be looking over their shoulders at the other services available. Before long, the parents will sign on to find out about a town meeting.
Town governments are also getting interested. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities conducted a survey a year ago and found two dozen towns using telephones to access computer databases, or making information available to other computers via phone lines. "And there's been a lot of activity since then," said Kevin T. Maloney said, the group's spokesman. An all-day seminar about the Internet this month was well attended, he said.
The group's newsletter, Connecticut Town and City, regularly lists the way municipalities are using computers for communications.
The Mayor of Meriden, Joseph J. Marinan Jr., has a bulletin board that he uses for an occasional electronic chat with town residents. He said he has filled two positions on town commissions with people he met on line and has received a lot of feedback on the town's snowplowing, sanding and street repair.
"It took a while to get comfortable with it, but there were people right there, on line, helping me through the process," Mr. Marinan said. He has now ordered all town departments to adopt E-mail by the next fiscal year.
"You send a memo out and there's too many people involved -- the department head has to dictate it, the secretary types it, someone brings it to the mail, someone delivers it, then another secretary opens it, and finally the other department head reads it," Mr. Marinan said. "It's too expensive to have all those hands on it, so everyone's going on line. It's a question of getting smarter."
And a regional economic development effort is also under way. The Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association, a Fairfield County business group, is setting up a prototype electronic community that would offer information on job training programs, venture capital sources and other data important to businesses getting started or expanding.
"We have a growing reliance on knowledge and computers are instantaneous and very powerful in that regard," said Joseph M. Ercolano, vice president of the council. The problem now, he said, is making sure the information is not just on line but accessible as well.
"There are still some people without the capability to tap into these services," Mr. Ercolano said. "There are public terminals available at libraries and other locations, so I don't think ultimately the technical issues have to be overwhelming. It's going to be a question of making sure people know what services are available and how to get to them."
Mr. Ferrari said that as a member of the computer task force he advocated opening legislative data to computer users, but he is concerned that not everyone has a computer, a modem and familiarity with on-line databases and electronic bulletin boards. "I use our computer at home for word processing only, like 90 percent of the people with computers," Mr. Ferrari said. "This is a computer as powerful as the one that brought Voyager to Mars, and I'm printing letters on it. It never even breaks a sweat."
A different problem, he said, is the sheer volume of information now becoming available. "The thing I see as a problem is that there's getting to be so much information out there," Mr. Ferrari said. "This is going to be another pile for people to go through, and maybe people won't have the time to digest it all."
Yet another consideration is cost. Although information disseminated via computer networks is less expensive than sending someone a paper copy, the task force estimated that providing five toll-free lines into the legislature's computer databases would cost, depending upon the degree of public usage, between $45,000 and $125,000 a year.
"The legislature will just have to see if the demand makes it worth the cost," Mr. Ferrari said. "If the public uses it heavily enough, it will continue to grow."

HEADLINE: Word for Word / Pie Fights;
Italy Has Pizza Wars Over Crusts. Americans Do It for the Dough.

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO 

 BODY:
IF you think pizza cools down when you carry it across the ocean from Italy to America, just try transporting a pizza war.
 A few months ago, Romano Fornasari, a Northern Italian pizza instructor from the Associazione Pizzaioli Europei e Sostenitori (the European Pizza Makers Association and Supporters), which represents 173,059 Italian pizza workers, made a terrible faux pas: he gave his students guidelines for what a "true pizza" is, delineating everything from the consistency of the dough to the size and weight of the finished pizza and how it should all sit in the stomach. 
 The reaction from Naples was fast and furious.
 Since 1984, the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana (the True Neapolitan Pizza Association) has proposed issuing a governmentally recognized trademark for Neapolitan pizza (something like Italy's guarantee of authenticity for wines, the Denominazione di Origine Controllata, or D.O.C.). But Mr. Fornasari's description was not what they had in mind.
 Soon the fracas spilled over into various Italian newspapers and magazines. Even Antonio Bassolino, the mayor of Naples, was dragged into the fight. ELISABETTA POVOLEDO
 In October 1994, the newspaper Corriere della Sera summarized Mr. Fornasari's rules:
 Let's begin with the rules. They have been dictated by Romano Fornasari, instructor with APES, the Association of Pizza Makers. The Pizza "D.O.C.," he maintains, must have a soft border (which in Naples is called a cornicione) and not higher than one and a half centimeters.
 The diameter must not exceed 28 centimeters and the total weight must not exceed 200 grams. "The dough must not be too leavened" -- adds Fornasari -- "because the pizza must continue to leaven in the stomach subduing the feeling of hunger for many hours."
 In the same issue, Antonio Pace, the founder of the True Neapolitan Pizza Association, rebuked Mr. Fornasari, who is not from Naples but from Granarolo, in the northern Italian region of Emilia:
 He would do well to occupy his time with Grana padrano [an Emilian cheese] which he knows very well . . . but he should leave pizza alone. . . . I don't want to hear any more from people, from Oslo or who knows where, who want to teach us our job. We set up the "true pizza" association so that it was possible to establish real rules.
 
 
 
All in Your Imagination
 Those rules refer to the ingredients, to the principal characteristics, and to the possibility of variations that do not conflict with good taste and that pass the indisputable judgment of the technical committtee. But pizza is imagination, not a question of centimeters or grams. And above all it is Neapolitan. . . .
 What's weight or diameter got to do with it? . . . The secret of pizza is in the handling, the dough, the cooking. For example, he does not talk about the oven, which must be wood fueled and must arrive at a temperature of over 400 degrees Celsius, so that the cooking is over in a minute. And then that bit about leavening continuing in the stomach, it's another piece of nonsense. Pizza must be digestible, very digestible."
 That was not the end of the matter. The magazine Europeo threw fuel on the fire by recalling in its November 1994 issue that during a radio interview, Silvio Berlusconi, who was then Prime Minister, had weighed in about the gravity of pizza:
 Foreigners see Italy as the Mafia, pizza, and fortunately, AC Milan [the Prime Minster's soccer team].
 At that point, the mayor of Naples, Antonio Bassolino -- who has his hands full wrestling with one of Italy's highest unemployment rates and with the Camorra, the Neapolitan version of the Mafia -- had no choice but to jump in too:
 What does it mean putting the Mafia and pizza on the same level? . . . The Mafia must be fought, pizza must be defended. . . . It is the most eaten food in the world, a Neapolitan product that has had planetary success, which must be defended from degenerative imitations and above all from mistaken opinions. . . .
 America has its own pizza wars, but they are not fought over crusts. Indeed, no one seems to argue much about the characteristics of pizza, or how they should sit in the stomach. (On Tuesday, the Pizza Expo in Las Vegas, Nev., will honor winged pizzas, breakfast pizzas and dessert pizzas.) What does fire up a pizza war in America is a scrappy two-for-the price-of-one offer.
 The latest edition of "Pizza Today," the publication of the National Association of Pizza Operators, recapped the highlights of pizza wars on this side of the Atlantic:
 Winter 1992. Pizza Hut -- feeling invincible after capturing a huge chunk of the delivery market -- covetously eyes Little Caesars' domain, the carryout, deal-shopper market. To overtake it, the company designs and begins testing what it believes will be the atomic deal-shopper weapon: Bigfoot, a 12-inch by 24-inch pizza. . . .
 Spring 1993. Little Caesars -- always vigilant of every move by a foreign army -- engineers in record time a counter-weapon. Then ka-boom! To the apparent surprise of Pizza Hut, Little Caesars rolls out a pre-emptive strike on Bigfoot. The price of Big!Big! Cheese with one topping is a profit-pinching $8.88.
 
 
 
No Sasquatch?
 Summer, Fall, Winter 1993. Pizza Hut scrambles to blunt Little Caesars' surprise attack and launches its national Bigfoot advertising within weeks. The company commits an incredible $60 million to the campaign.
 Meanwhile, Domino's Pizza tries to ambush both of them with the cleverly conceived Dominator. But, because the company fails to back up the product with a heavy marketing arsenal, Dominator never becomes a major contender in the Giant Pizza fight.
 Spring 1994. The time for the Mother of All Pizza Discount Battles has finally come. Frustrated by shrinking profits and stagnant (or sliding) sales, some pizza companies pull out the stops in what amounts to . . . a fanatical scorched-earth rampage.
 The most notable attack, memorable for its creativity and put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is commitment, is Little Caesars' "Third Pizza for a Buck" campaign . . . an offer that threatens to transport pizza discount into a new sphere -- "buy one, get two free!"
 . . . Summer 1994. Having lost faith in the idea of winning the pizza wars with discounting, some pizza companies begin searching for ways to retreat with dignity . . . lo and behold, they discover that not every pizza buyer is intrigued by cheaper pizza. To the contrary, a significant number of them . . . seek out a better pizza-eating experience rather than a cheaper one. . . .
 Little Caesars virtually scuttles the sacrosanct Pizza!Pizza! program . . . and replaces it with a Quality!Quality! program. . . .
 Fall-Winter 1994. The waning months of '94 see Little Caesars' major competitors stepping forward to contest the company's claim to the quality domain. Pizza Hut . . . announces that "Bigfoot just got better."

HEADLINE: Denver Journal;
City, Fighting Back, Puts Emphasis Downtown

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
From the very beginning, when its fortunes depended almost exclusively on gold, silver, oil and real estate, Denver has been a boom-and-bust town, riding a Wild West economic roller coaster, now soaring, now crashing.
Good times and bad, they always seem to hit harder in Denver. 
 Throughout the 1970's, no American city boomed more than this one, as high-rolling oilmen, land speculators and savings and loans bet it all. At one point, a dozen office high-rises were going up downtown, enough to double existing rental space.
Then, poof!
Recession struck in the early 1980's, bursting the boom balloon, and the city tumbled as far down as it had been up. Things were so bad at one point that a desperate office developer, stuck with a brand-new but ghostly empty high-rise, put an ad in national publications that offered "a whole building" for what it would cost to rent "a closet" in Manhattan or "a shelf" in Tokyo's Ginza.
Now the economic worm has turned again.
Today much of that building is rented. Denver is thriving, its newly opened $4.9 billion airport the most visible, but hardly the only, example of another impressive economic comeback. Fueled by a new building boom -- a good part of it paid for, Great Depression-style, with public works money -- the city's downtown pulsates with new stores, new restaurants, new cultural attractions, even a new ball park.
"Somehow Denver always manages to fight back, only to go down again later and then fight back still again," said Tom Noel, a history professor at the University of Colorado and the author of a dozen books on the city and the state. "We'll just have to wait and see if this particular boom lasts."
Why so many wrenching ups and downs for Denver?
Some people say the problem is greed. They contend that beginning with its founding by gold prospectors in 1858, the city has always tried to make a living by hungrily exploiting every last thing that nature has to offer, from the gold, silver, oil and other resources that lie beneath the ground to the rain, snow and bright sunshine that come down.
Others postulate that Denver's problem is municipal schizophrenia: that the city is of two minds about itself and thus is prone to setting economic goals in conflict with one another. They argue that one moment Denver is reveling in its way-out-West status as the nation's most geographically isolated major metropolis, and the next moment trying to slip out of its cowboy boots and into the tasseled loafers and sophistication of New York and San Francisco.
Still others say that Denver is just snake-bit, a victim of a long string of bad breaks.
Whatever the case, the city's optimism is once again soaring as high as the Rockies, which rise in snowy grandeur on the western horizon.
It has captured worldwide attention with the opening of its shiny new international airport -- never mind the sticker-shock cost and the infamously balky baggage system. But equally impressive, if less noted, its downtown is no longer just another struggling business district, mostly known in the rest of the country, if at all, for the 1890's elegance of the lobby of the venerable Brown Palace Hotel.
The rejuvenated downtown now boasts not only a new baseball stadium but also a new library, a new rail system and a soon-to-be-completed amusement park.
Whole blocks of decrepit old inner-city office buildings and factories have been transformed into restaurants, clothing boutiques, art galleries and microbreweries.
"Denver is on a very good roll these days," said former Gov. Dick Lamm, a Coloradan not known for effusive praise of growth and expansion.
But what of tomorrow, always a fair question given some of the city's yesterdays? Are old mistakes being repeated today?
The proud promoters of the new airport continue to insist that within a few years at least 50 million passengers a year will be passing through the stunning new terminal. But aviation experts say a more realistic figure is 30 million at best, which could mean serious trouble when it comes to paying off the construction bonds.
Housing developers are once again rushing headlong with speculative tracts, relentlessly chewing up huge chunks of the great American prairie stretching eastward from Denver. Only a year or so removed from the latest bout with hard times, most Denverites are in no mood to entertain the cautionary warnings of growth-control advocates.
And there are even some stirrings among office developers about putting up new high-rise projects.
True enough, the huge surplus of office space left from the last collapse is being steadily whittled down. But by just about any business measure, the city is still very much a renter's market.
Denver's economic bounce-back means there are jobs to be had here now. And every week sees the arrival of 2,000 people, a migration that has pushed the population of the metropolitan area above two million.
In earlier days, the Denver economy was narrowly balanced, heavily dependent on a few major job sources like mining, agriculture and defense. But now, at the start of the latest growth era, the job mix is much broader and better balanced.
While the old employers are still around, other industries are of increasing importance -- tourism, higher education, transportation, computers, communications.
"We've got a much bigger cushion now to catch us if we stumble, and that's a very significant change," said the city's chief cheerleader, John Lay, president of the Metro Chamber of Commerce. "We've become a genuine world-class city. Now if we can just find a way to build an ocean."

Not only is it boasting a new $4.9 billion airport, but the popular Denver Amusement Park, above, is relocating near the South Platte River, where the Denver Nuggets owner is planning a major arena.

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
The Renaissance Banker: James David Wolfensohn

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
In today's Wall Street of 12-hour days and 7-day weeks, James D. Wolfensohn is probably as close as the modern investment banker can get to being a Renaissance man.
A renowned international financier, Mr. Wolfensohn has for 14 years successfully forged his own company, James D. Wolfensohn Inc., into an investment banking powerhouse that competes with giant firms like Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Brothers, while doing annual business of $8 billion to $10 billion a year. 
 An accomplished cellist, committed philanthropist and student of development and environmental issues, Mr. Wolfensohn, also rebuilt Carnegie Hall, where he is board chairman emeritus, and has headed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington for the last five years.
President Clinton on Saturday nominated the charismatic and feisty Mr. Wolfensohn, 61, to be the next president of the World Bank. Mr. Wolfensohn, who has involved himself with environmental and development issues for 30 years, was the favored candidate of Vice President Al Gore to succeed Lewis T. Preston, who asked to retire early from the World Bank after he received a diagnosis of cancer in January.
The World Bank's directors are expected to vote on Mr. Wolfensohn's proposed appointment within the next few days, and provided his appointment is ratified, Mr. Wolfensohn will take over the World Bank early this summer.
His anticipated arrival comes at a particularly challenging time in the development organization's history. Its clientele has never been more diverse and complex. It is seeking to aid the states of the former Soviet Union, to insure that fast-growing developing nations do not destroy themselves environmentally and socially in their rush for economic prosperity and to halt the slide in the fortunes of the very poorest peoples in the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
The 50-year-old organization, which was founded at the Bretton Woods conference and makes $17 billion in loans a year, has also recently been challenged by those who argue that its mission is over and that it has been insensitive to environmental concerns. Those critics, grouped in the "50 Years Is Enough" coalition, were not in their Washington offices yesterday and offered no comment.
All those interviewed yesterday sang Mr. Wolfensohn's praises.
"Jim Wolfensohn is an unusual banker who brings a whole range of qualities that few in the financial community have," said Maurice Strong, the chairman of the World Resources Institute and of the Earth Council, who headed the United Nations 1992 conference in Rio de Janeiro on environment and development. "He cares deeply about the issues of sustainable development and will be a strong leader for the World Bank at a critical stage in its history." Mr. Strong, who is also president of Ontario Hydro, first met Mr. Wolfensohn when the two men worked together at a conference on the environment and the economy in Stockholm in 1972.
Mr. Wolfensohn, born in Australia but now an American citizen, did many of his first investment banking deals in developing countries and is a self-described devotee of the economist Barbara Ward, whose books, like "The Rich Nations and the Poor Nations," dealt with development issues. He is also a board member of the Business Council for Sustainable Development, the Population Council and a trustee of the Brookings Institution, with a long history of involvement in development and environmental issues.
Those socially progressive credentials are backed by a master's in business administration from Harvard and a law degree in Australia. He was a partner at Salomon Brothers for 10 years, where he was head of investment banking and was the firm's lead investment banker in the reorganization of the Chrysler Corporation when that car maker was on its knees.
Mr. Wolfensohn, an open and approachable man, also has a reputation for speaking his mind and working quickly to get a job done, qualities that can sometimes leave others feeling that they have been treated brusquely.
"He's a Renaissance man, with extremely good judgment and great integrity," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International Inc. and a former official in the Carter and Reagan Administrations. Mr. Hormats, who has known Mr. Wolfensohn for 25 years, said, "The World Bank now needs a banker-plus" to run it and that Mr. Wolfensohn is "a superb candidate for that job."
Gedale B. Horowitz, Salomon's senior managing director, said: "He's a first-class person, intelligent, charitable and caring. He's always handled himself with class."
Reached at his Lexington Avenue office yesterday, Mr. Wolfensohn declined to be interviewed until his appointment had been voted on by the World Bank board. His friends, though, say he considers the opportunity to run the World Bank the chance of a lifetime.
Mr. Wolfensohn returned from several weeks' working overseas for interviews last week with President Clinton and Vice President Gore. It is understood that he argued for a proud reassertion of the vision of the institution and its mission, though he cautioned that it would initially take him some time to properly understand the agency and the challenges it faces. A friend and admirer of Mr. Preston, Mr. Wolfensohn has also argued for pushing ahead with Mr. Preston's desire to focus the agency better.
Because of his responsibilities at the Kennedy Center, to which he was appointed by President Bush, Mr. Wolfensohn has been deliberately apolitical in recent years, but friends describe his political views as centrist, perhaps leaning to the Democratic Party.
In Mr. Wolfensohn's absence from his firm, Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, is expected to continue as chairman. Mr. Wolfensohn succeeded in getting Mr. Volcker to join his investment bank in 1988, persuading him to pass up opportunities to work at the biggest and best-known companies on Wall Street. James D. Wolfensohn Inc. now has 10 partners and more than 140 employees and offices in London, Tokyo and Moscow, as well as an investment banking partnership with Fuji Bank of Japan and Lord Rothschild of Britain.

HEADLINE: An Arab Ally Has Warning For Clinton

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: RABAT, Morocco, March 12

 BODY:
Before departing for a trip to the United States, King Hassan of Morocco, a pillar of Middle East peace efforts for decades, warned in an interview that the momentum for peace was receding, pushing Arabs and Israelis into "absolutist" positions.
The King, whose family has long maintained friendly ties with Israel and Jewish populations around the world, said in an interview on Saturday that unless peace efforts move ahead before the American and Israeli election seasons arrive this summer, a wave of instability will sweep the region. 
 Speaking in his office at Rabat's ornate, Moorish-style royal palace, King Hassan said he would urge President Clinton, whom he is to meet for the first time on Wednesday during a state visit, to reconsider the consequences of sanctions on Iraq and Libya.
"Iraq is a country and a population," the King said. "We must not see only Iraq of Saddam Hussein. We must see the Iraqis of the next 10, 15 or 20 years. We cannot continue to humiliate and despise a people without thinking what may come of it."
The King said sanctions deserved to be re-examined in light of their economic and social impact on the countries and their neighbors.
"There is an article in the United Nations Charter which says that if we impose sanctions upon a country, other countries that would be hurt by that would be compensated," he said.
Morocco now loses nearly $1 billion each year because of the sanctions against Libya and Iraq, he said.
King Hassan, who has reigned for 34 years successfully balancing enforcement of Islamic religious practices with steady modernization of the country of 28 million, said he takes issue with those who characterize Islamic militancy as the principal adversary of the West in the post-Communist years.
Islam, he asserts, is not to be confused with Islamic fundamentalism.
"I have yet to see a militant who advocates Islamic fundamentalism for the love of God. Fundamentalists preach their ideology because they consider Islam the elevator to take power. The day I see a fundamentalist who preaches religion for the love of God then I'll say, fine, let's listen. But so far, I haven't heard that".
He said the chaotic spread of fundamentalism and the sorry state of Middle East peace efforts were paramount concerns that he would raise in Washington.
"For all the parties involved, there is an important common denominator: time. The Palestinian Authority must be affirmed as soon as possible. If we leave it in its present condition, it risks getting weaker. The time factor also plays for the Israelis, who will enter an electoral period in July. And the time factor also plays for the Americans because next year is presidential election year," the King said.
King Hassan said that while he is confident that the "will for peace" that started in Madrid during the Middle East Peace conference of 1991 is "irreversible," but cautioned it could be overtaken by "elements of instability"
"There is a psychological cross-fertilization that must be taken into account. Until now, the Arab world was against Israel because of the Palestinians. As soon as the air cleared up between Palestinians and Israelis, the Arab world took a deep breath of relief. It is certain that if the situation became negative between Palestinians and Israelis, the Arab world will return to its questioning and could revise the situation again. That is why I talk of instability, an instability of behavior, not of politics."
Casting a look at a crisis closer to home, the King said the war between Muslim fundamentalists in Algeria and its military-dominated Government cannot be resolved by force of arms, but only through dialogue.
"It is certain the Algerian drama is very regrettable for the Algerian people and their neighbors and for a certain image of Arabism and Islam."
He also noted, mockingly, that a NATO statement issued a few weeks ago said the organization must now turn its attention to fighting Islamic fundamentalism.
"NATO is a defense organization for the North Atlantic region. I don't think NATO was created to fight fundamentalism, but to fight Soviet guns and missiles.
"Anyway, if fundamentalism has to be engaged in battle, it would not be done with tanks. Fundamentalists don't have armored divisions, they are not scud missiles, and not an atomic weapon. It is a behavioral question, a psychology which cannot be fought with armadas but with other ideas."
Asked how it would be possible to resolve the issue of Jerusalem, King Hassan said Israelis have to give some ground on the ultimate ownership of Jerusalem.
"The Israelis can enlarge West Jerusalem as much as they like, but Holy Jerusalem is something that has been profoundly anchored in the Arab and Muslim world for 14 centuries. We are not claiming all of Jerusalem, but just that holy Muslim part of Jerusalem." he said.
"Now, do we tackle the Jerusalem problem immediately or in a further stage? That, is a matter of strategy. We don't want everything. We want what's ours."

HEADLINE: A Union and Waiters Face Off in Chinatown

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
Beating drums, displaying a coffin and chanting, "Slavery must go," a group of about 200 labor advocates and restaurant-union members protested outside the Jing Fong restaurant in Chinatown yesterday. They accused the restaurant's management of violating labor laws by demanding shares of waiters' tips and refusing to pay minimum wage and overtime.
But the protesters faced equally vocal opposition outside the restaurant, on Elizabeth Street, from about 40 Jing Fong waiters and their relatives. Carrying a large aluminum board to deflect the bad luck brought by the coffin, the workers clanked a wok and serving plates and chanted, "Leave us alone" and "Let us live." 
 The clash reflected the complexity of labor issues in Chinatown. Officials of the Chinese Staff and Workers' Association, which has led sporadic protests against Jing Fong for a month, said they were fighting for better pay and working conditions at the restaurant, which they said paid as little as 75 cents an hour, far less than the minimum, which varies from $2.25 to $2.90 for employees making tips.
They said the conditions were typical in Chinatown, which has only one unionized restaurant, the Silver Palace, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January.
Workers at Jing Fong said they had voted unanimously last month not to join the union, Local 318 Independent Restaurant Workers' Union, because they feared that labor disputes could lead to unemployment.
"The union won't be happy until all of us are out of a job," said David Chow, a Jing Fong waiter. He said the protest had hurt the restaurant's business and caused him to lose at least $200 a week in tips. "The Silver Palace has already filed for bankruptcy," he said. "I want to have to freedom not to be controlled by them. I don't want to have to pay dues and demonstrate whenever they tell me to. By carrying a coffin and deterring customers from coming in, they're smashing our rice bowls."
Mr. Chow and other workers disputed the union's claim that they were underpaid, saying that Jing Fong workers were the highest-paid restaurant workers in Chinatown, averaging about $2,000 a month.
Despite the protest, the Jing Fong restaurant was packed. Customers said they were unfazed by demonstrators outside.
"I would normally not cross the picket line," said a customer who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But I don't have a problem with it this time, because the workers are against what the union is doing."
Neither the union nor the Chinese Staff and Workers' Association would comment. But Stanley Mark, program director at the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which supports the protest, said that despite opposition from the Jing Fong restaurant workers, the union had the right to force employers to abide by state and federal labor laws.
The union's latest efforts have also prompted members of the Chinese Restaurant Association, an organization representing Chinatown restaurant owners, to discuss changing their ways, said two association members, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Members met on Saturday to discuss ways to improve working conditions. They have also agreed to consult with the National Labor Relations Board and the State Labor Department to improve their understanding of the American labor law, the members said.

HEADLINE: Failure by Pledged Donors Drains Gaza-Jericho Fund

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 12

 BODY:
An international aid effort for the Palestinian Authority has been thrown into crisis because donors have not honored pledges to support a fund for the fledgling self-rule administration in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
The fund, administered by the World Bank to help cover the authority's operating expenses, has run out of money, aid officials said. The donors have failed to honor pledges worth about $36 million out of $60 million made at a meeting in Brussels in November. 
 The donors pledged at the meeting to provide an emergency aid package for the Palestinians through the end of March. The fund, called the Holst Peace Fund, was set up to help meet the authority's operating costs. It is named after Johan Jorgen Holst, the late Foreign Minister of Norway, who helped broker the September 1993 self-rule accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The Palestinian Authority has begun collecting taxes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Revenues fell last month, however, because Israel denied entry to thousands of Palestinian laborers after a suicide bomb attack killed 21 Israelis. United Nations officials in Gaza have estimated the loss to the economy there at $2 million a day.
After the Israeli-Palestinian accord was signed, foreign donors pledged $2.5 billion in aid for five years. But lack of coordination among the donors and Palestinian inability to process the aid led to delays in delivery of the contributions. Out of $800 million pledged for last year alone, only $228 million was delivered.
Officials coordinating the aid effort here warned that the Israeli-Palestinian accord could unravel if it loses financial support. The current crisis threatens payment of salaries to about 24,000 employees of the Palestinian administration, including teachers, doctors and office staff.
Odin Knudsen, the World Bank representative in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said donors were less eager to give money for such day-to-day expenses than for development projects.
"This aid is invisible, because it shows up in salaries and not in new roads or sewage systems," he said. "But this kind of money is essential because it keeps the administration going. If it is not paid, it can lead to a political crisis."
While the United States honored its $12 million pledge for the Holst Fund, several European and Persian Gulf nations are among the donors that have not made their payments. The officials said the Europeans had been slowed by bureaucratic delays. The Persian Gulf states, which pledged more than $20 million, are reluctant to help Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, who heads the authority. Gulf nations cut off earlier financial support for the P.L.O. after Mr. Arafat supported Iraq during the Persian Gulf war.
Informal talks and a formal donors' meeting are planned for April to discuss outstanding pledges and ways to cover the expected Palestinian budget deficit for the rest of this year, estimated to be $250 million.

HEADLINE: U.S., China Will End Trade Rift

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 12

 BODY:
Ending months of recrimination, China and the United States agreed today to press jointly for Beijing's entry into the new World Trade Organization on a "flexible, pragmatic and realistic basis."
The accords signed here today seek to put an end to the atmosphere of enmity that has characterized Chinese-American trade negotiations in general, and in particular, the negotiations over China's entry into the world trading system. And for the first time since December, the Beijing authorities have given a clear signal that they intend to return to the negotiating table after the collapse of China's original bid for membership in the World Trade Organization. 
 The words from both sides at a news conference were warm and optimistic. Yet few details were offered of what changes China might undertake to satisfy the requirements of the international trade body, the organizational successor in Geneva to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. And until those issues are resolved, many vexing issues remain.
The World Bank noted last year, for instance, that "on average, China's tariffs" and other trade barriers "remain higher, more numerous and more dispersed than those of most other large developing countries."
Tariffs on American cars, computers and Japanese fax machines all run 100 percent or more. China bans all American citrus fruit from its market and has refused to accept wheat shipments from the Pacific Northwest or tobacco from the Southeast.
The United States, in agreeing to sponsor China's renewed bid for membership, also pledged to make concessions that would allow China to phase out some tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers over a number of years under the more lenient rules written for developing countries.
The agreement was reached here between the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and China's Trade Minister, Wu Yi, in resolving Beijing's suspension of a 1992 market-access accord that was to have opened the Chinese market to a broad assortment of American goods.
As part of today's accord, China agreed to resume applying the market-access agreement no later than the end of this month.
Over the last two months, Western diplomats here had begun to wonder whether the Communist Party leadership was balking over the high price China would have to pay as a World Trade Organization member. Under the organization's rules, China would be forced to expose its heavily protected domestic industries to competition from Western and Japanese goods, while at the same time opening foreign markets for its products.
The United States Ambassador to China, J. Stapleton Roy, recently told analysts with the American Embassy here that Prime Minister Li Peng seemed to be signaling a leadership decision when he departed from the prepared text of a speech to the National People's Congress on March 5. In the original text, Mr. Li said China was "willing" to join the World Trade Organization, but in delivering the speech, he changed the wording to say that China "should" join the group.
An American trade official said today that "a date has not been set yet" for new negotiations in Geneva, "but I would assume it would be relatively soon."
Under the eight-point accord, the United States would in some cases grant China the special developing-nation exemptions that allow it to phase out trade barriers over a number of years. But Washington would insist that Beijing drop some trade barriers more quickly, using timetables required of more advanced industrial nations.
An American official said this would be a hybrid formula that would look at China's demands for exemptions issue by issue.
China's insistence on being granted exemptions as a developing nation was the most contentious aspect of the eight-month negotiations last year that ended in China's failure to become a founding member of the World Trade Organization on Jan. 1.
But today, even that was glossed over in the agreement, which says that the United States would support China's entry "as a founding member."
Further, "the United States and China will pursue China's W.T.O. accession talks on a flexible, pragmatic basis, and agree to address realistically the issue of China's developing-country status" under the trade organization's guidelines.
In his statement, Mr. Kantor said he and the Chinese Trade Minister "agreed that both countries, in negotiations at all levels, will exhibit a positive attitude in recognition of our growing relationship."
Under the agreement, China pledged to base any restrictions on American agricultural products on "sound science." By agreeing to conduct specific tests and risk analyses, Beijing would be expected to end its ban on American citrus fruit out of fear that the Mediterranean fruit fly, recently re-emerged in Southern California, could be transported to China.
"That is not based on sound science," an American official said today. "That's a market barrier that's unfair."
Mr. Kantor came here for the formal signing of an agreement to end Chinese piracy of copyrighted American music, videos and other intellectual property, ending a dispute that nearly erupted into a trade war last month. In his statement, he said he had also won Chinese consent to pursue greater market access for American telecommunications and insurance companies.
Mr. Kantor, making his first trip to China, "will personally be involved with a review of all relevant proposals as regards the W.T.O. accession of China," the accord said.

HEADLINE: TOP FED OFFICIALS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC FOR HIGHER RATES

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Senior Federal Reserve officials are expressing little enthusiasm for raising interest rates further despite sharp recent declines in the dollar and in the unemployment rate, which have created some pressure for another increase.
Four of the Federal Reserve Board's seven governors, in interviews on Friday, said they thought the American economy was slowing to a point of steady, sustainable growth with moderate inflation. At the same time, they discounted the warnings of some economists that the central bank's seven interest rate increases over the last 13 months might brake growth so drastically that the economy would fall into a recession. 
 "There are signs of a slowing down, but it's a slowing down in the rate of growth -- it's not the kind of slowing down that says you're in a nose dive," said John P. LaWare, one of the Federal Reserve governors.
The question of interest rate increases was reopened last week when the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, hinted that he might consider raising rates if the dollar's fall threatened to increase inflation.
Any such interest rate increase would be a departure from the Federal Reserve's traditional practice of paying little heed to currency values in deciding on interest rates. Many analysts and economists took the comment at the time as a sign that the central bank suddenly found itself faced by new and conflicting international demands just when it thought it had adequately moderated economic growth by pushing rates higher.
All four governors interviewed declined to discuss the dollar in specific terms. Mr. LaWare did say that he doubted a low dollar would increase exports so much that overstretched factories would raise prices, feeding inflation. .
While three of the seven Federal Reserve governors were not available, the tenor of the comments of the other four about the domestic economy supported the view that Mr. Greenspan's remarks on Wednesday were not a threat to raise rates soon but an effort to stop the dollar's slide by nudging currency traders to stop selling dollars and start investing in the United States in hope of higher returns here.
Mr. Greenspan's comments on Wednesday represented a subtle shift in tone from his Congressional testimony two weeks earlier. Mr. LaWare and the other governors interviewed all echoed the gist of Mr. Greenspan's earlier testimony: Enough drag has already been put on the economy to slow it from last year's overheated growth, and there is no sign that the Federal Reserve applied the brake too heavily.
The problem with this stance is that it has unnerved currency traders, who sent the dollar plunging to record lows against the German mark and Japanese yen early last week.
Mr. LaWare, however, defended Mr. Greenspan's original testimony two weeks ago. Federal Reserve officials should not "ignore what we think is going on in the economy and continue to indicate we're on a path of tightening simply because some external factor is soft," he said.
Federal Reserve officials are reluctant to respond to short-term problems like the dollar in part because changes in interest rates can take nine months or more to affect the economy. Federal Reserve officials make policy changes based on their forecasts of the economy's future health.
"I think that we all recognize that monetary policy acts with a lag, and we have to build some of that into our thinking," said Susan M. Phillips, another governor. "Recognizing that we've got these lags, I think there's still a sense that there are more of these effects in the pipeline" from interest rate increases over the last year.
To be sure, the Federal Reserve's calculations could change in a hurry should there be an unexpected shift in the economy's fortunes or a plunge in financial markets. Janet L. Yellen, another Federal Reserve governor, was particularly guarded on Friday. "We've seen some signs of a moderation of growth, but it's too soon to make a call on what's happening and the employment reports remain confusing," she said.
The bond and stock markets interpreted Friday's report of falling unemployment by concentrating on underlying signs of an economic slowdown and then rallying strongly. Federal Reserve officials also said they looked at the details of the unemployment report on Friday and found few signs in them of inflation pressures.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, was chatting in his office with a visitor Friday morning when he abruptly realized that his copy of the unemployment report must have arrived. Returning from his secretary's office with the document, he plunked himself down in a green-and-red-striped easy chair next to an unlit black marble fireplace and began reading the key statistics aloud.
He started with the 318,000 new jobs that the American economy produced in February. He only briefly mentioned the fall in the unemployment rate to 5.4 percent in February from 5.7 percent in January. But he really stopped and took notice of a figure that many Wall Street analysts initially played down on Friday: the average length of the workweek, which fell by 24 minutes, to 34.5 hours.
"What I personally tend to look at is the index of weekly hours -- it's just me -- and it's down," suggesting that the economy cannot be growing that strongly, Mr. Lindsey said.
Employers tend to hire more workers when their existing workers are putting in long weeks and earning a lot of overtime. A shortening of the average workweek means that employers may feel less pressure to hire more workers in the coming months -- an early signal of a slowing economy.
Shorter workweeks also tend to mean that people are producing fewer goods and services.
Mr. LaWare cited other evidence of weakening economic growth. "Auto sales are off a little bit, and production schedules have been cut back," he said. "Housing starts and permits are down somewhat, at least for one month. One month does not a trend make, by a long shot, but we're seeing purchasing agents indicating that the order flows are not as heavy as they were, and the order books are a little thinner. Retail sales have not been anything that you could describe as exuberant. There are just a lot of little things like that, that add up to a slowing down."
Yet the central bank's reluctance to continue raising interest rates is proving difficult for Federal Reserve officials to explain to financial markets and politicians alike.
The Federal Reserve raised rates repeatedly last year even as inflation was falling. That angered Main Street but delighted inflation-wary investors on Wall Street.
Now Federal Reserve officials are inclined to hold rates steady, and perhaps reduce them eventually, even as inflation may rise this spring. That may not please Wall Street but is also unlikely to mollify Main Street businesses, like car manufacturers who are continuing to lose sales because of rising interest rates on car loans.
Mr. Greenspan tried to explain some of this in his testimony before Congress two weeks ago, but ended up contributing to the dollar's plunge.
"Because the effects of monetary policy are felt only slowly and with a lag," he said then, "policy will have a better chance of contributing to meeting the nation's macroeconomic objectives if we look forward as we act -- however indistinct our view of the road ahead. Thus, over the past year we have firmed policy to head off inflation pressures not yet evident in the data. Similarly, there may come a time when we hold our policy stance unchanged, or even ease, despite adverse price data, should we see signs that underlying forces are acting ultimately to reduce inflation pressures."
But when the dollar subsequently began to plunge on March 2 in response to the Senate defeat of the balanced budget amendment, some traders cited the use of the word "ease" as reducing the incentive to hold dollars. The Senate defeat was widely interpreted by foreign traders as a signal of weak resolve by the United States to reduce its budget deficit, although Democrats and Republicans criticized this view as inaccurate.
The four governors who were interviewed represent a full range of views at the Federal Reserve and had all coincidentally agreed early last week to interviews on Friday. The other three governors are Mr. Greenspan, Alan S. Blinder and Edward W. Kelley Jr.
The seven governors decide interest rate policy together with the presidents of 5 of the 12 Federal Reserve regional banks. They meet eight times a year; the next meeting is scheduled for March 28.

HEADLINE: New York City Stops Foreclosing on Tax-Delinquent Buildings

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Overwhelmed by the expensive task of managing thousands of dilapidated apartment buildings that have become the city's property because their owners failed to pay property taxes, New York City has quietly halted the process of foreclosing on any more buildings.
Officials say that the city -- which in the last two decades has become the largest landlord in the five boroughs and a powerful force in maintaining the housing stock in poor neighborhoods -- simply cannot afford to keep playing this role. 
 The city now spends at least $220 million a year managing the 3,000 occupied buildings it already owns. It has not taken a property in foreclosure since 1993, according to the Department of Finance, the city agency responsible for assessing and collecting taxes.
City officials say they are looking for alternatives to foreclosure that might include a variety of programs to help prop up landlords who are having trouble paying their taxes, as well as new programs to return the city-owned buildings to private landlords.
"Our focus has been on trying to find long-term solutions to some of these problems," said Deborah Wright, Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which manages nearly 30,000 units the city owns. "By that I mean, how do we reform our strategy so we can protect the existing tenants and get buildings out to private hands and have them remain there?"
City officials and housing experts agree that the heart of the city's problem is that many of its poorest tenants cannot pay rents that support the cost of the buildings. The city's seizure of buildings in the past has in essence been a housing subsidy for the poor, as the city holds onto buildings that would not be financially feasible for another landlord to run.
Now, city officials are trying to come up with alternatives that might be less expensive. But city officials say such proposals could take months to form.
The cost of managing the housing has grown steadily over the last decade, from about $180 million in 1986 to $220 million this year. City officials fear contributions from Washington, which now account for nearly two-thirds of the cost, are unlikely to increase and may well decline.
New York is not alone in foreclosing on owners who do not pay their property taxes. If the owners make no attempt to reclaim them, most cities auction off these buildings. But in New York, although many tax-foreclosed properties do end up on the auction block, there are few takers for large apartment buildings where tenants do not cover expenses.
Advocates for both low-income tenants and landlords in New York have suggested many ideas for changing the system. Some say the city needs to consider a taxing policy that takes into account the ability of the buildings tenants to pay rent.
Others say the city could ease the impact of recent increases through lower water and sewer charges. Still others say that the city needs to approach landlords who fail to pay their taxes much more quickly, before the building falls into disrepair. Currently, a notice of foreclosure is filed when a property is 12 months behind if its annual tax bill is $2,750 or more. Owners then have up to two years or more to rescue their properties before the city takes title.
As the process wears on, buildings usually deteriorate rapidly because no maintenance is being done. This means the city faces huge costs when it does take over the building.
Landlords in particular say that the city's rent control laws, which prevent steep increases in rents, need to be abolished.
"It's not a question of owners walking away from their responsibility," said Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord advocacy organization. "Most owners are falling behind for legitimate reasons. They cannot afford to operate their buildings at rent levels over which they have little control."
City officials say they realize that they cannot simply eliminate foreclosures, but they have no timetable yet for resuming them.
Critics of the city's "unofficial moratorium" on foreclosures say that even a short-term moratorium on the current backlog of foreclosures means that thousands of apartments in the city are getting only emergency maintenance right now, like repairing broken boilers on freezing days.
"The cost of managing these buildings is huge," said Frank P. Barconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a nonprofit research organization. But he said that when the city delays foreclosures, it makes it harder and harder for some building owners to catch up eventually on their payments. "For these landlords, the hole is getting deeper. When landlords lose their buildings, the tenants suffer."
Moreover, since tax policy must by law be equitable, the city has made no attempt to take over the more valuable properties that could have been auctioned and gone back on the tax rolls.
At the end of fiscal year 1994, tax-delinquent owners for all categories of properties, including commercial buildings and single-family homes, owed a total of $403.4 million in back taxes. Property taxes represent about 43 percent of all the city's tax revenues. The Department of Finance projects that property taxes will bring in nearly $7.4 billion this fiscal year.
The city has not always been a red-ink landlord of such a huge number of apartment buildings. After taking over and managing buildings as an antidote to widespread abandonment in some neighborhoods in the 1960's and 70's, the city made significant progress in cutting the number of apartment buildings it held from the mid to late 1980's.
But the early 1990's, when the economy soured, introduced a new wave of abandonment. In 1988 the city filed foreclosure proceedings against 6,609 property owners. By 1993 the number of foreclosure filings was 18,003.
At the same time, fewer landlords were trying to get their property back. In 1988, for example, 6,021 delinquent owners retrieved their properties. But in 1993, only 5,816 owners saved their buildings.
Officials are not sure exactly how many buildings the city would have seized if the foreclosure process had proceeded, but in 1993 it took in 397 buildings and still is responsible for 75 of them.
Exactly how much it costs to run the city's thousands of buildings is still in question. City officials have asked Arthur Andersen & Company, an accounting firm serving as a pro bono consultant, to determine the "real" costs to the city of its housing management responsibility.
Ms. Wright said the cost of managing and upgrading the housing that has come into city hands reaches beyond what the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development spends.
"The real cost to the city of being in this position is not really known," said Ms. Wright. "There are lost taxes and water and sewer charges, the cost of liability of ownership, and the interest the city pays on the debt we take to cover the cost of management."
"We don't want to send the signal that you don't have to pay taxes," said Ms. Wright, "We believe that it is just a small number of landlords who are trying to get around the system. Most tax-delinquent owners are having real problems meeting their expenses."
Any efforts to change the system, experts say, would have to be carefully constructed to keep landlords who don't need such help from abusing the system.
Some housing advocates say any new housing policy must take into consideration the poverty of tenants in these buildings.
"I don't disagree that part of the solution is in private ownership," said David R. Jones, executive director of the Community Service Society, a housing, health and education advocacy group for the poor. "But the conservatives are right in that you cannot play with the economics of the situation. Poor people just do not have the incomes to pay rents high enough to make these buildings profitable to many private owners."
"Whatever policy changes are made," Mr. Jones said, "must be realistic about what people can pay. When poor people lose their housing options , you raise the number of homeless. One way or another, the city will pay the cost."

HEADLINE: Christopher Recuses Himself On Conoco's Iranian Oil Deal

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, March 12

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that he has withdrawn from policy discussions on a sensitive oil deal between Conoco Inc. and Iran because his former law firm is representing the American company.
Mr. Christopher told reporters en route to Saudi Arabia that he decided to take "a very conservative position" after the State Department informed him last week that Conoco had retained O'Melveny & Myers, the Los Angeles-based law firm where he had been chairman. 
 Thomas E. Donilon, Mr. Christopher's chief of staff and a former partner at the firm, has also recused himself.
"In conflict of interest matters I think you have to take a conservative position," Mr. Christopher said. "I will not be stepping out of Iran policy by any means."
President Clinton and his advisers were stunned last week when they learned that the Houston-based oil company had clinched a deal to develop two huge offshore oil and gas fields in the Persian Gulf, a senior Administration official said.
In recent months, Conoco had informed the American Consul General in Dubai in vague terms of its negotiations with Iran, but American officials did not take the talks seriously, assuming Iran could not afford such a contract.
The Administration did not learn that the oil company had retained the law firm until Thursday when Conoco representatives came to discuss the deal with the State Department, an Administration official said.
A lawyer familar with the deal said today that O'Melveny & Myers had represented Conoco Inc. for several years on a variety of foreign and domestic matters. He said it was one of several outside counsels working for Conoco and said that the firm had intended to inform Mr. Christopher before the deal was announced, but that the news was made public before the Secretary had been told.

 Mr. Christopher said he has an ongoing association with the firm because of his retirement benefits.
News of the deal has pushed the Administration to speed up a review of its policy toward Iran, and various agencies have prepared papers laying out options ranging from largely symbolic steps to an executive order imposing a total unilateral ban on trade with Iran.
Mr. Christopher has taken a tough line against Iran, because of its support for terrorism and its determination to build a nuclear weapon.
His absence in discussions of the oil deal will deprive the Administration of Iran's harshest critic. Officials traveling with Mr. Christopher deny that Conoco intentionally sought to weaken the Administration's arguments against the deal by cutting out Mr. Christopher.
In recent months, Mr. Christopher has told aides that he is increasingly uncomfortable with the policy that allows American oil companies to buy Iranian oil and sell it abroad and allows Iran to buy an array of nonlethal items from the United States.
That inconsistency has made it difficult for Mr. Christopher to persuade allies to block investments, loans and credits to Iran.
The deal is particularly worrisome for the Administration because it means that for the first time since Iran's revolution 16 years ago, a major American company is willing to invest huge sums of money in Iran's faltering economy and that Iran is willing to work on a major joint project with an American firm.
The contract with Iran, which was signed by a Dutch affiliate, Conoco Iran N.V., does not violate American law because none of the oil and natural gas is to be brought to the United States.

HEADLINE: Gore Says U.S. Will Shift More Foreign Aid to Private Groups

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, March 12

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore, speaking today at the close of a United Nations conference on poverty, said that within five years the Administration plans to channel nearly half its foreign aid through private organizations rather than governments.
The United States will also increase support to projects that decentralize political power and give more authority to local communities in developing nations, Mr. Gore said at the World Summit on Social Development, which was attended by more than 120 world leaders. 
 Both steps, part of what the Administration is calling its New Partnerships Initiative, respond to critics of foreign assistance who say that millions of dollars are squandered by inefficient or corrupt governments. The policies are also in line with a growing perception that private aid groups, both American and foreign, are better able to identify needs and deliver help.
Mr. Gore acknowledged that this is a difficult time for spending on social development at home and abroad, but said that Washington was not withdrawing from the world. In the debate on foreign policy, he said, what is being tested is "whether we will step back from the front ranks of nations that recognize a bond of shared responsibility toward men and women elsewhere in the world who are struggling to climb by their own efforts out of degradation and despair."
"I believe that at the end of the day, the United States will not step back," he said. "The Clinton Administration believes that in its commitment to remain engaged, we have the support of the vast majority of the American people in both our major political parties."
A few hours after Mr. Gore's speech, the United Nations Development Program stopped its "poverty clock," which calculated the number of children born into families around the world earning a dollar a day or less. The tally was 598,070 babies born since the clock started on March 3, when delegates at a parallel forum for nongovernmental groups began to gather in Copenhagen.
"We have turned off the display, but of course the clock ticks on," said James Gustave Speth, administrator of the development program. More than a billion of the world's 5.7 billion people live in absolute poverty, according to the United Nations.
Mr. Gore -- who did not refer to reforming the United Nations as American officials here thought he would -- spoke on the same day that President Nelson Mandela of South Africa made a plea to world leaders that the African continent should not be allowed to be "marginalized" further by denying Africans the right to a voice in a choice of assistance and by withholding advanced technology from Africans.
Mr. Mandela said, "It is to perpetuate difficulties of the South for the North to relate to us as consumers of arms and finished goods, as passive recipients of project assistance without transfer of skills and technology, as hapless victims to dictate to regarding loans and employment of aid."
President Fidel Castro of Cuba also spoke today, and his was an address full of bitterness about a world living under "the blind and cruel laws of the market." He spoke of a "criminal blockade" to which Cuba is subjected "only because it does not share the ideas of its powerful neighbor to the north."
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic of Bosnia gave an address more sorrowful than hopeful on a day when many world leaders congratulated themselves on completing a conference that "puts people first."
"A distinguished speaker said that we must put children first," Mr. Silajdzic said. "We in Bosnia wonder if we have any children left. Seventeen thousand children have been killed in Bosnia in the last three years. Those living, some with gray hair and eyes and hearts of old men, are hardly children any more."
In the United States, the Agency for International Development, which directs about $9 billion in nonmilitary aid programs, has already moved toward greater cooperation with private organizations. Two years ago, 17 percent of aid was delivered through private groups. The Clinton Administration has increased that to nearly 30 percent, according to agency officials in Washington. Mr. Gore raised the target today.
"Under this initiative, the United States Agency for International Development will be channeling 40 percent of its development assistance through nongovernmental organizations, both U.S.-based and indigenous," Mr. Gore said. In addition to fostering local government, the money would go to aiding economic growth at the grass-roots level, he said.
"The New Partnerships Initiative has three main objectives: to empower small businesses and entrepreneurs to drive economic growth, to strengthen the role of nongovernmental organizations in development programs and to help nations bolster democracy at the local level," he said.
"Families and individuals, when given the power and opportunity to change their lives, do exactly that," he said.
As the conference drew to a close today, Juan Somavia, Chile's delegate to the United Nations and the originator of the conference, known as the Social Summit, was optimistic.
"This summit has put the interests of people back in the picture, and I think it's going to do for the world what the 1972 Stockholm Conference did for the environment and the 1975 conference on women did on gender issues. Twenty years down the road, we will realize that this conference got a process going," Mr. Somavia said in an interview.
"It is also an acknowledgment that the unfinished business of the 21st century is the eradication of poverty," he added. "The century that multiplied wealth, technology, trade, freedoms in the most incredible way also multiplied poverty, and that's completely unacceptable."

HEADLINE: Salinas, at Successor's Request, Leaves for Virtual Exile in U.S.

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 12

 BODY:
With his elder brother jailed on murder charges and his once-celebrated reputation in tatters, former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has left Mexico for virtual exile in the United States, senior Government officials said today.
The officials said that Mr. Salinas, who ruled until Dec. 1, 1994, and was considered one of the strongest and most innovative Mexican leaders of this century, was asked on Tuesday to leave the country by an emissary of the man he chose to succeed him, President Ernesto Zedillo. 
 Mr. Salinas, 46, boarded a plane with his family on Saturday afternoon and flew to New York on his way to Boston, officials said. One senior official said the former President would not be prevented from returning to Mexico, but had agreed to stay abroad "for a considerable time."
Another official calculated that period as "five years, eight months," or the remainder of Mr. Zedillo's term.
"He was asked to leave," said one senior official, who, like others, would discuss the situation only on condition of anonymity. "Being reasonable, he felt it was appropriate that he go."
The departure of Mr. Salinas removed what some politicians had seen as the threat of a serious political conflict between Mr. Zedillo and the man who had led him by the hand into the Government's upper ranks.
Hours after the arrest of Mr. Salinas's brother, Raul, on Feb. 28, the former President broke what had been an unwritten rule for former Mexican leaders by speaking out bitterly against the Government. He then went on a bizarre, two-day hunger strike, demanding that the Zedillo Government absolve him of blame for the country's economic crisis and for what it said was the fabrication of evidence in the investigation of the slaying last March of a former governing-party presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio.
Mr. Salinas's exit, however, raised new questions about how Mr. Zedillo might face the possibility that Mr. Salinas had played a role in what officials describe as the elaborate cover-up of another major political murder last year, that of a former governing-party leader, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
Mexican prosecutors say Mr. Ruiz Massieu's own brother, Mario, who served as a deputy attorney general under Carlos Salinas, altered testimony and intimidated witnesses to keep Raul Salinas's name out of that case. But the Government has offered no explanation as to why Mario Ruiz Massieu might have done so.
Based on the testimony of a jailed suspect and other, circumstantial evidence, Raul Salinas, 48, was charged with ordering and financing the assassination of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
Mario Ruiz Massieu was arrested on a customs charge 10 days ago at Newark International Airport as he prepared to board a plane to Europe. He is being held in the Metropolitan Corrections Center in Manhattan pending hearings on a Mexican Government request for his extradition.
Mexican officials say Mr. Ruiz Massieu will also be charged with the embezzlement of some $ 750,000 in public funds. And after the discovery of more than $ 10 million in bank accounts in his name, they said he is under investigation both here and in the United States in connection with a scheme to collect bribes from drug traffickers in exchange for protecting their operations.
Carlos Salinas has said he believes firmly in his brother's innocence. But he made no public remarks about what, if anything, Mario Ruiz Massieu might have told him about Raul Salinas in connection with the assassination.
Government officials have confirmed that Mario Ruiz Massieu briefed Carlos Salinas repeatedly about the case. Given the extreme sensitivity of the case, they say they will proceed against the former President only if they are certain he was involved. Senior officials have insisted, however, that if they have that certainty, they will act.
"There was no deal," one official said today when asked if Mr. Salinas was promised anything in return for agreeing to leave the country.
In a televised address to the nation this evening, Mr. Zedillo did not even mention the former President. But in urging Mexicans to accept the painful sacrifices demanded by the new economic plan his ministers announced on Thursday night, he promised not to tolerate government corruption and he repeated the message he has given again and again since the arrest of Raul Salinas.
"The law obligates all of us equally," Mr. Zedillo said, "and no one, absolutely no one, can be above it."
One Government official said Mr. Salinas and his family had flown to New York on Friday in the private jet of a corn-flour magnate, Roberto Gonzalez Barrera, but that could not immediately be confirmed.
Officials said he planned to go on to Boston, where his three college-aged children were expected to study. One senior official said Mr. Salinas might teach at Harvard, where he received his doctorate in political economics in 1978. But a senior official of the university said by telephone that he had no knowledge of any such arrangement.
Officials at the State Department and the White House said they did not know anything about Mr. Salinas's movements.
Anna Cobian, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, which oversees the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said, "We don't have any information that a request for permanent residence has been made by former President Salinas."
Three former aides to Mr. Salinas said that while he became the object of public anger and ridicule for his hunger strike, he appeared to be more concerned that he might somehow be implicated in wrongdoing in the Colosio and Ruiz Massieu investigations.
"What he did was to stop the momentum toward something worse," one of the former aides said of the fast. "He hurt the Government. And what he was saying was, 'Anytime you want, I can do it again.' "
For a man who had risen from a narrow election victory marred by fraud to become one of the most popular and respected Mexican leaders in years, it was a devastating fall. In what seemed to many politicians as an almost stingy farewell, Mr. Zedillo told Congress last year, "I follow a President who governed with vision; who with intelligence and patriotism conceived great transformations and knew how to carry them out with determination."
During his six-year term, Mr. Salinas presided over the renegotiation of Mexico's huge foreign debt, the restructuring of the country's economy, and the reorientation of foreign policy in line with the economic and political alliance that ultimately joined Mexico with the United States and Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The morning that the agreement took effect, however, peasant rebels rose up against the Government in the southern state of Chiapas. Mr. Salinas managed to contain the fighting with a cease-fire 12 days later. But he could not contain the political turmoil that included the assassinations of his protege, Mr. Colosio, and a longtime friend and political ally, Mr. Ruiz Massieu. .
After being forced to take steps toward greater democracy that he had resisted throughout his administration, Mr. Salinas helped Mr. Zedillo to victory against relatively weak opposition in elections on Aug. 21. But with his own political future seemingly on the line, including his candidacy to run the World Trade Organization, Mr. Salinas resisted pressure for a devaluation of the peso and left his successor to manage what quickly became a crisis.
Barely 24 hours after Mr. Salinas's departure, Mr. Zedillo went on television to tell Mexicans that the glittering future his predecessor had promised them was no more and that his new economic plan was the only hope he could offer.
After outlining a future of growing inflation, high interest rates, a contraction of the economy and big increases in gasoline prices and utility rates, he warned, "The months ahead will be the most difficult."

HEADLINE: Washington Newly Aloof to Its Ex-Hero

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Last year the Clinton Administration was -- publicly at least -- calling Carlos Salinas de Gortari a hero of democratization and free markets. He was its candidate for the one of the most powerful posts of the new economic age, director of the World Trade Organization.
Today, in a measure of how quickly the former Mexican President's star has fallen, the White House was scrambling to find out if Mr. Salinas was really seeking to take up residence in the United States and through much of the day professed not to know where he was. Administration officials said they had not struck any kind of deal to give him sanctuary, but expressed hope that Mr. Salinas's departure from Mexico would help the chances of repairing the economic damage for which he has been partly blamed. 
 "Where is Salinas?" President Clinton's press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, asked this morning. "To quote the President, he's probably hanging out with Carmen Sandiego," he said, referring to the fictional secret agent in a popular software program for children.
It may have been a more telling one-liner than Mr. Clinton intended: In the computer program, Ms. Sandiego heads a gang of provocateurs who roam the globe causing trouble, usually by stealing a great national treasure. Mr. Salinas is accused of derailing Mexico's rise toward prosperity, contributing to the dollar's fall and sending a $100 billion trading relationship between the United States and Mexico into a nose dive.
"So it only makes sense," one senior Administration official said, half in jest, "that he is about to become the first world leader ever to receive economic asylum."
In fact, only Mexican officials have said that Mr. Salinas has entered the United States to stay. An Administration official said this evening that Mr. Salinas arrived in Brownsville, Texas, on Friday evening aboard a private jet. The aircraft was cleared on to New York, the official said.
In Mexico City, Mr. Salinas's office released a statement today saying that the former President was traveling to honor commitments to attend various international conferences. "Currently he is in New York, and he will travel to other nations to attend to the aforementioned invitations," the statement said.
The White House said that Mr. Salinas held a multiple-entry visa that had already allowed him to enter the United States three times since he left office at the end of last year. That visa would permit Mr. Salinas to stay in the United States for up to six months without the need for further approval.
Mr. Salinas's relationship with the Administration in recent months has been strained at best. The United States agreed to back him as the first head of the new World Trade Organization before he left office last year, hoping that he would be a symbol of the kind of deregulation and commitment to free trade that Washington wants to spread to other emerging economies. But his candidacy was in trouble before the Mexican peso began its free fall in mid-December, and once the scope of the economic wreckage was clear, there was no chance he would win.
Nonetheless, Mr. Salinas refused to back out of the race until 10 days ago, after his brother was arrested on charges that he had been behind the assassination of a leading politician of the governing party. President Salinas has not been implicated in that investigation. But the delay was damaging to the Administration, reducing its ability to offer an alternative candidate to head the organization. It now appears likely that Europe's candidate, Renato Ruggiero, a former trade minister of Italy, will end up with the job.
In recent weeks Treasury officials have said that tensions with Mr. Salinas's Government go back to last summer, when, according to American accounts, Washington was already issuing private warnings that Mexico was running too large a trade deficit. In Congressional testimony on Friday, Lawrence H. Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury, refused to say who in Mexico received such warnings, and most documents Congress has requested on the issue are classified.
But Mr. Summers suggested that the warnings were ignored, and others in the Administration have speculated that Mr. Salinas did not want his reputation tarred by devaluing the country's currency just before he left office.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Gingrich Speak Louder on Action

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich agree on what they want: action. It's just that they are so far apart on what to do.
"The veto is a useful device and an important thing on occasion, but what the country really needs is action," President Clinton told the National League of Cities meeting here today. He had just outlined objections to Republican plans to cut some of his favorite programs, like national service, Head Start, school lunches and drug education. 
 But minutes earlier, after addressing the same group with his active plans for cutting red tape and building a third-wave world based on information, Mr. Gingrich, the House Speaker, had attacked Mr. Clinton for a failure of leadership.
"The President has an obligation to lead," Mr. Gingrich told reporters after his speech at the Washington Hilton. "So where is he leading us to right now? He seems to think he's the defensive back for some football team and his job is to counterpunch whatever we're doing."
In fact, as Mr. Clinton's comments acknowledged, the White House is torn between its distaste for much of what Mr. Gingrich proposes and its realization that it may have to accept some of it to avoid the even more perilous prospect of renewed gridlock.
Speaking to the League of Cities, which is made up of officials from municipalities big and small, Mr. Clinton ticked off objections to the Republicans' proposed cuts in spending for programs from summer jobs for youths to anti-drug education to environmental compliance. He is expected to raise more objections as the spending cuts come to the House floor later this week.
Mr. Clinton also restated his threat to veto any effort to relax or repeal a provision in last year's crime bill that would provide new money to localities on the condition it be used to hire more police officers.
"But let me say this," Mr. Clinton said, warming to the fight. "What we need is not more vetoes. What we need is more action. What we need is for people here to behave the way you have to behave or you couldn't survive."
"Half of you come from places so small that if you made people declare their party every time they walked through the door," the President added, "you would be run out on a rail within a week."
Mr. Clinton concluded with a batch of phrases that sounded like a campaign speech: "We've got to keep the American dream alive. Middle-class economics. Mainstream values. Jobs. Incomes. Work and family. We've got to make sure this country stays strong. And I'm telling you, it takes action, not just words."
But Mr. Gingrich earlier accused Mr. Clinton of using too many words of the unkind variety in "a certain disinformation campaign in this city which is, frankly, a little disheartening."
The Speaker said Mr. Clinton had taken to attacking Republican proposals without offering clear counterproposals of his own.
"It would be nice to see the President lead," Mr. Gingrich said. "The White House seems to have this campaign-of-the-week mentality as though this is going to be the longest-running Presidential re-election in history."

HEADLINE: Deadly Rainstorms in California Likely to Be Most Expensive Ever

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 13

 BODY:
One of the most disastrous storm systems to hit California this century continued over a broad front today, causing tens of millions of dollars more in damage to roads, homes and businesses, and ruining crops in some of the nation's richest farmland.
At least 12 people have died or are missing as a result of the series of winter storms that began sweeping off the Pacific last week and have drenched the region almost relentlessly since then. More rain is expected in the next few days, and disaster officials warned that rivers in the region could remain above flood levels for a week or more. 
 President Clinton declared Federal emergencies in more than half of California, making owners of homes and businesses eligible for low-interest loans and other relief, for the second time this year.
Federal and state officials said it was still too early to estimate the overall cost of damage from the storm system, but some said it would almost certainly exceed the $1.3 billion in damages from earlier floods in January, making it the most expensive in the state's history.
"It's one of the most widespread geographic storms in California this century," said Eric R. Butler, chief of the state-Federal storm operations center in Sacramento.
Some of the worst flooding occurred in Monterey County, where much of the farmland has been turned into a soggy bog. Agriculture officials said that the Salinas Valley had lost about half of its lettuce crop and that artichoke farmers had also suffered much damage. Farm officials said that prices might rise for some vegetables, like artichokes, especially in parts of the country that depend on California produce, but that the extent of the effect on consumers was not yet clear.
Monterey County leads the nation in the production of artichokes, broccoli, cauliflower, head and leaf lettuce, strawberries and zucchini.
Richard W. Nutter, Monterey County's agricultural commissioner, said the latest string of rainstorms were "probably the worst the county has experienced in modern times." He said: "It's not only a loss for the growers, it's a loss to the labor force as well. There will be thousands of people out of work."
H. Edwin Angstadt, president of the Grower Shipper Vegetable Association in Salinas, said: "There's standing water in the fields. I haven't seen damage like this since the mid-1960's."
Particularly hard hit has been the town of Pajaro, where gushing water broke a 200-foot section of levee, inundating the town of 3,300 and making it virtually uninhabitable.
"Every home in Pajaro has been flooded," said Joseph Hertlein, a spokesman for the Monterey County Office of Emergency Services. About 10 miles south, in Castroville, state officials have ordered the evacuation of about 5,000 people because of the health hazard posed by flooding that contaminated the water system and disrupted the sewer system.
In the Napa and Sonoma Valleys, where some of the nation's best-known premium wines are produced, thousands of acres of vineyards and parts of dozens of communities were under several feet of water. Many vines are just beginning to develop the buds that will produce this year's crop, and experts feared that low-lying vineyards could face serious disease problems if standing water remains.
Richard Thomas, director of viticulture at Santa Rosa June College in Santa Rosa, said: "The single major problem is that we need to get into the vineyards to start controlling mildew. With all the mud, we don't know when we'll be able to do that."
Farther north, flooding of the Sacramento River in the northern Central Valley caused millions of dollars in damage to orchard crops. Particularly hard hit were walnut, almond and fruit orchards in Tehama County, where trees whose roots were still saturated from the January storms toppled in the high winds. In Southern California, tens of hundreds of acres of oranges, limes and strawberries ready for harvest were washed out of orchards and fields, and wound up littering ocean beaches.
Perhaps the most-urgent worry for disaster officials were the bridges, as the rushing flood waters scoured away the river bottom around the supports of some structures. On Friday night, a 184-mile segment of Interstate 5, the state's main commercial artery, was closed after a bridge collapsed. Officials say it could take as long as a month to reopen it.
On the outskirts of Los Angeles, tons of mud from fire-stripped hills have inched toward the coast, temporarily shutting down miles of the Pacific Coast Highway and oozing into dozens of Malibu beach homes.
In San Jose, the Guadalupe River overflowed and flooded parts of downtown with six feet of water, forcing temporary evacuations of homes and businesses. Evacuees included residents of several trailer parks and shelters for the mentally ill homeless, who were temporarily housed in local churches.
Meg McKnight, a spokesman for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company said the current storm front had disrupted power to more people than the January storms. Since Wednesday, about 1.2 million customers lost power, she said, but most of them have gotten it back.
The worst trouble spots are in Big Sur and the Pajaro area, and it is uncertain when those vulnerable areas will be repaired.
"We have crews ready to go and repair the lines as soon as they can get to those customers," she said.
One of the many weekend power failures in the Lake Tahoe area on the California-Nevada line shut down a pumping station and allowed some 8,000 gallons of untreated sewage to pour into the pristine mountain lake on Sunday.
South of San Francisco, crews opened State Highway 17, the main link between Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz to the southwest. The route was closed over the weekend by mudslides and boulders, but was reopened this morning.
The National Weather Service said that with the ground "completely saturated throughout northern California, rapid rises could occur on small streams in any area of heavy rain." There was also a continuing risk of mudslides, it said.
 
AT A GLANCE: The Damage So Far
 Floods continue to cause widespread damage to northern and central California. Yesterday, the town of Pajaro remained under water. Most of the 3,300 residents, many of them poor farm workers, were froced to evacuate over the weekend when the Pajaro River overflowed.
 Floodwaters covered an estimated 10,000 acres of prime farm land in the Salinas Valley and on the west side of San Joaquin Valley. In the Salinas Valley, one of the world's richest farming regions, about half the spring iceberg and leaf lettuce crop was destroyed, a lost of at least $500 million. Strawberry and artichoke fields were also damaged. Farm officials say the region's broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage crops will also suffer.
 Portions of Interstate 5, California's major north-south highway, and the scenic Pacific coast route, Highway 1, were closed from Los Angeles to
Monterey.

HEADLINE: To Our Readers

 BODY:
Today is the beginning of a new chapter in business coverage in The New York Times. Starting with this issue, we offer readers an expanded news and analytical report on the world of business. To do the job, The Times has added strength to its reporting and editing team. It has redesigned the pages of Business Day. And this weekend it will bring a new focus and depth to the Sunday business section.
These changes reflect The Times's commitment to sophisticated coverage of the plays and players in the business and economic worlds and their impact on each reader's personal financial situation. 
 The Times's business coverage has not had a major overhaul since the debut of a separate business section in 1978. Since then, the world has undergone a revolution as obvious as your laptop computer and as subtle as the three-job worker.
The American economy's supremacy is a matter of debate today. A pension is no longer a pension, nor is a telephone a telephone. And no one is sure what the growth of derivatives will mean: many aren't even sure what a derivative is.
 The goal of The Times's business coverage is to help readers balance the broad knowledge of business needed to succeed in their working lives and as citizens with the specific information that individual financial well-being now demands.
The new Sunday section, Money and Business, will focus on the personal business interests of its readers -- how they invest, spend and earn money -- with more detailed coverage of personal finance, mutual funds, investing, career and workplace issues. Each issue will also open with a cover article on major trends and personalities shaping the business world.
In the daily paper, Business Day has been expanded by close to a page a day and redesigned to give readers a more accessible and comprehensive overview of the major stories of the day and to spotlight a particular idea, event or personality. With one glance at the front of the new Business Day, the reader will quickly be able to focus on the major business stories throughout the paper, whether in the arts, sports, national or foreign pages.
The Monday and Saturday papers will also be special. Starting later this spring, the Monday section will concentrate its coverage on the quickly converging worlds of technology and media. The Saturday paper will give readers an early start on the weekly financial tables.
Here are some of the specific changes that readers will see in the coming week:
THE LOOK The layout and typography have been designed to make articles easier to find and read.
THE BUSINESS DIGEST It will summarize and rank those top business news articles not on Business Day's front page, wherever they appear in the paper.
INTERNATIONAL World business news and stock listings will be packaged together.
YOUR MONEY The personal finance coverage formerly found on Saturdays in the Your Money pages will move to the Money and Business section on Sunday.
TECHNOLOGY The special technology coverage in the Sunday and Wednesday papers will move to Monday's section.
SUNDAY FINANCIAL TABLES These listings will be devoted exclusively to weekly stock and mutual fund performance. Weekly tables for other financial instruments, which have previously appeared on Sunday, will move to the Saturday paper.
MUTUAL FUND LISTINGS These tables have been greatly expanded in both Sunday and daily sections. More qualitative performance indicators have been added to the tables as well as a new format to increase readability.
OPTIONS AND SHORT INTEREST Daily and weekly options listings and monthly short interest lists will be discontinued. There will be a concise daily list of the most active options issues and a monthly list of the stock issues with major short interest positions.
In this new coverage era, some things won't change. Paramount among them is The Times's commitment to give its readers a clear and impartial understanding of the way business works at all levels of our lives.

HEADLINE: Winners of Wireless Auction to Pay $7 Billion

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
The Federal Government completed the biggest auction in history today, selling part of the nation's airwaves for $7 billion to a handful of giant companies that plan to blanket the nation with new wireless communications networks for telephones and computers.
SC.1Lasting more than three months and 112 separate rounds, the auction marked the most ambitious attempt so far by the Government to sell the kinds of radio licenses that were once given away. 
 The Sprint Corporation, which has formed a consortium with three of the nation's biggest cable television companies, led the way by successfully bidding $2.1 billion for licenses in 29 metropolitan and regional markets with a total of about 150 million people. The group won licenses for markets that include New York, San Francisco, Detroit and Dallas-Fort Worth.
The AT&T Corporation finished second, successfully bidding $1.7 billion for 21 markets that cover 107 million people, including Chicago, Boston, Washington and Philadelphia.
A consortium led by three regional Bell companies came in third, bidding $1.1 billion for licenses in 11 cities, including Chicago, Dallas and Houston.
At auction were 99 large licenses to offer "personal communications services," a catch-all phrase that includes a new generation of cellular telephones as well as two-way wireless links for portable computers, electronic notebooks and new information services delivered over the air.
Today's totals put the Federal Communications Commission within reach of its goal of raising an estimated $10 billion in its wireless auctions. An auction last summer raised nearly $2 billion for paging and interactive television licenses. Still to come in the months ahead are several more auctions for smaller blocks of wireless telephone licenses.
But the auction completed today had all along been expected to be the one for the high rollers. Indeed, the bidding got so high that even the Craig O. McCaw, the billionaire and wireless communications entrepreneur, dropped out last week.
Reed E. Hundt, the F.C.C.'s chairman, said today's results would be a "triple win" for the economy, consumers and taxpayers.
He also noted that the auction means that cable TV operators might well become the country's biggest operators of wireless communications as well. Sprint's bidding group, which calls itself Wirelessco L.P., involved the cable companies Tele-Communications Inc., the Comcast Corporation and Cox Communications.
"The auctions just created the single largest wireless company in the world, and it's the cable television industry," Mr. Hundt said. "This is the place where actual convergence between telephone, cable and long distance is taking place."
For all the winning bidders, the opportunities and the risks are epic in scale.
The cellular-telephone business, now 11 years old, has 25 million customers and has been growing at an annual rate of nearly 50 percent. The new services are likely to continue expanding the base of wireless customers, adding at least two new services in every major market within about three years.
But the costs will be staggering, too. The Sprint coalition will pay $442 million just for the license that covers the New York metropolitan area. And it will have to spend at least that much again to build the system and absorb all start-up costs.
Multiply those types of costs for every big and medium-sized city in the country, and today's winners will very likely spend at least $7 billion more before they take in their first dollar of new business.
And when they do switch on those costly new networks, they will face intense competition from existing cellular carriers, which have been girding for battles in their home markets. Many cellular companies have also used the auctions to expand their wireless reach.
Indeed, Wall Street investors have become increasingly skittish about the risks. Sprint's stock has taken a beating in recent months, largely amid concern about its prospective capital requirements. Trading at more than $40 a share in August, the shares dipped to less than $26 by early January, a few weeks into the auction.
Though the share price has recovered somewhat recently, the decline has thrown a wrench into Sprint's attempt to sell 20 percent of itself to the French and German telephone companies for $4.2 billion. That figure was based on Sprint's stock price when the deal was negotiated last year; the French and Germans are now seeking new terms. Sprint's shares rose 37.5 cents, to $28.75, today on the New York Stock Exchange.
Today's close of bids left little doubt that this auction was for big players only. Only 30 participants entered the auction at the outset, and the numbers dwindled to 18 as the bidding grew richer. Though some licenses in small or remote markets, like American Samoa, sold for less than $1 million, those for big cities all drew high bids and intense competition.
Most of the bidding was in line with expectations. The most expensive license in the country was that covering the region from Los Angeles through San Diego, which was acquired by the Pacific Telesis Group for $493.5 million.
Only one license for that region was available, even though there are two for each region, because the other had been awarded to Cox Enterprises as a result of what the commission deemed its "pioneering" technology development.
A similar situation prevailed in New York, where a small company called Omnipoint Communications had been promised a "pioneer's" license as well. Those companies -- along with American Personal Communications, which won a license for the Washington market -- will pay 85 percent of the average bid for the top 10 markets, based on the amount bid per potential subscriber.
The most hotly contested market was Chicago, because AT&T, the Bell company group, Sprint and the GTE Corporation all sought a license there. AT&T and the Bell group won the two available licenses, paying nearly $400 million each.
The next round of auctions, set to begin in about six weeks, will cover hundreds of licenses that are reserved for small businesses and companies owned by minorities or women. Those licenses will ultimately cover just as much of the radio spectrum as the auction that ended today. But the bids are expected to be far more modest because the licenses cover smaller geographic areas than in the auction that concluded today and the Government is offering substantial discounts and financing preferences.
Predictably, most winners said they were delighted by the outcome and that they had not paid too much. "I said three months ago thaat the bidding would be rational, and that's the what happened," said Gary Foresee, a senior vice president at Sprint who was overseeing that company's bidding.
Sprint, which is aligned with both American Personal Communications and Cox, said it could begin to offer wireless service in Los Angeles and Washington by early next year.

The Federal Communications Commission raised more than $7.7 billion through its auction of 99 licenses to offer wireless personal communications devices, or P.C.S., that transmit voice, data, and images over the air. Two licenses were offered in each of 51 metropolitan areas, In New York, Los Angelas and Washington, one license was not auctioned, but was set aside for one of the companies that pioneered the technology. Pioneers will pay a license fee set at 85 percent of the average price per person bid in the top 10 markets.

HEADLINE: Pressure On All Sides In the Battle Of the Budget

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 13

 BODY:
On the airwaves, in the quiet of lawmakers' offices and in rowdy protests in the halls of the Capitol, the battle has been joined over Gov. George E. Pataki's budget and the deep cuts that it would inflict.
With 19 days until the start of a new fiscal year, when Mr. Pataki says he will virtually shut down the state government if the Legislature has not passed a budget, all sides are feeling the pressure. 
 Opponents of the budget cuts, who range from advocates for welfare mothers to public employee unions, are spending millions of dollars for television, newspaper and radio advertising. In one television spot against the health care cuts, an elderly woman looks frightened as she overhears her daughter saying that she might have to quit work to take care of her.
Nearly every day, a new group of badge-wearing, placard-waving protesters flood in and around the Capitol building. Today, a few hundred screaming state employees who face layoffs rallied outside the Omni Hotel here during a visit by Senator Bob Dole: they knew that Mr. Pataki's strongest ally, Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, would be there.
"We want to let him know we vote, and we want to take an active role in the budget," said Cathy Vallee, 35, a secretary with the state.
For groups that can afford the fees, lobbyists and interest groups are tracing Mr. Pataki's political friendships, working his former colleagues in the Republican-controlled Senate especially hard. One health care group sent out maps to each Senate Republican, showing every hospital and nursing home in the legislator's district and saying how much money would be lost locally.
For his part, Mr. Pataki, with the help of the Republican Party, plans to fire back this week with his own $1 million advertising campaign, apparently the first time that a New York Governor has bought television time to argue for his policies.
So far, he is standing firm on his $32.4 billion fiscal plan, the most severe in a generation. But some Republicans worry that the pitch of opposition has become so great that he is slipping in the all-important battle for public support. They are urging him to step up the fight for the change in state government -- for lower taxes and spending -- that he promised in the campaign.
"I think the administration has to redouble its efforts to get out its message," said Assemblyman John J. Faso, a Republican of Kinderhook who oversaw the Pataki transition on budget issues. "When people are aware of the cuts and the magnitude of the deficit the Governor inherited, I think most people will accept the necessity of reductions."
Every year's budget brings its share of opposition, of course, and that was especially true during the recession's darkest years of 1990 and 1991. But lawmakers and lobbyists say this year is even more intense because the cuts are so deep and so wide and because, contrary to the perception under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, people really believe that Mr. Pataki will carry through with his reductions.
His proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning in April represents a cut of $1.1 billion, one of the largest cuts in state history and one that would affect virtually every program around the state.
"The intensity is the kind of intensity that generates marches, picketing on the State Capitol, hundreds and hundreds of people walking the halls because you're going after programs that are really close to people," said Robert J. Malito, a founder of the lobbying firm Davidoff & Malito. "They're far more passionate than in the past."
Mr. Malito, who has strong ties to the Pataki administration and whose business has grown by 50 percent since Election Day, says he is a believer in Mr. Pataki's less-is-more philosophy. Nevertheless, he is plowing ahead with his efforts to restore money to his clients' programs.
For example, a new lobbyist with the firm, Tarky Lombardi Jr., a former Republican senator from Syracuse, has been working on behalf of the Home Care Association of New York to restore what they can of the $48 million long-term home care program, which serves 15,000 mostly elderly people in their homes.
Mr. Lombardi met with key lawmakers to argue the program's merit, and last week Mr. Bruno said he expected some restoration of the program.
For his part, Mr. Pataki has been repeating his mantra that the cuts may be painful, but that they and a $720 million reduction in the state income tax represent the only way to jump-start the state's economic growth and to create jobs. Two weeks ago, he filed amendments to the budget but underscored his commitment to his course by changing relatively little, despite enormous pressure.
"We think our budget is a budget that is extremely beneficial to all New Yorkers," Mr. Pataki said after a recent speech in New York City where he was hooted down by AIDS protesters. "I totally understand the opposition. That's the nature of democracy.
"But we think that by making the tough choices and the right decisions this year we will be able to build for a better future in this state."
Still, protest is everywhere. The Rev. Al Sharpton, for example, has embarked on a 175-mile walk from Harlem to Albany to protest cuts to welfare. Students from the State University of New York, angry at what may be tuition increases of about $1,300 a year, two weeks ago proclaimed the death of public education by heaving two wooden coffins into the Capitol lobby.
Their efforts, though loud, may not be as effective as the campaign waged by SUNY administrators. They have refused to say exactly how they would absorb what amounts to a 33 percent cut in state financing, frustrating lawmakers who want the administrators to show exactly what the cuts would mean for public education. Instead, lawmakers say, the administrators are threatening to close four two-year technical colleges, a move the Republicans vehemently oppose, in part because most SUNY campuses are in Republican districts.
In one of the most visible signs of opposition, the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 265,000 state workers, is spending $1 million on television, radio and newspaper advertisements. Local 1199 of the National Health and Human Services Union is also spending $1 million.
"People are fighting with intensity right now because what they are doing is harsh, is cruel," said Dennis Rivera, the union's president. "What they are doing is meanspirited."
To counter the attacks, the Republican State Committee is scheduled this week to begin its own statewide television advertisements, stressing tax cuts, reduced state regulation and requiring some welfare recipients to work for their benefits. The party has already begun mailing letters to voters in the districts of 20 upstate Democrats in the Assembly. Upstate residents voted heavily for Mr. Pataki, and the Republican hope is that they will pressure their Assembly members to vote for the Governor's budget.
The question is how much the protests and lobbying will affect Mr. Pataki and lawmakers as budget negotiations begin in earnest. Although the budget is supposed to be passed by April 1 -- it has been late every year for the last decade -- today was the first day that the Governor and legislative leaders met to talk solely about the budget.
"They will realize that this slash-and-burn, scorched-earth approach doesn't even work for them politically," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Democrat from Manhattan.
"I think they felt as long as the cuts were in New York City and to poor people they could just turn a deaf ear," he said. "But the volume is turning up around the state."

HEADLINE: Mexico's New Leader Finds Job Full of Painful Surprises

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 13

 BODY:
Ernesto Zedillo did not expect the presidency of Mexico to be "pleasant," he said today. Nor, he acknowledged, did he fully understand the weaknesses of Mexico's economic strategy, the depth of the demands for reform, or what it might mean to be the first developing country to fall precipitously out of favor with the world financial markets.
"I thought it was going to be rough," Mr. Zedillo said. "But I must be honest -- I never expected anything as complex as what we have lived through over these last three months." 
 After a first 100 days that have destroyed the hopes of Mexicans for new prosperity and shattered their sense of the country's political rules, Mr. Zedillo pointed only one way out of the crisis -- to accept much greater economic hardship in the months ahead and to accelerate the pace of political change.
"I know that this is going to be painful," Mr. Zedillo said in a wide-ranging interview in his office today. "I know that nobody is going to like it. But this is what the country needs. It was said that I am not a good politician to put it that way. But some of the most traumatic experiences that we have had in Mexico around financial crises have to do with the fact that people were not told the truth."
If Mr. Zedillo found any solace in his country's difficult economic straits, the only sign of it was in the warning he offered to others. Mexico was merely the first heavily indebted nation to run afoul of global investors, he said, but unless the world faced up to the risks of its changing financial system, others are likely to follow.
Two days after Mr. Zedillo's predecessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, left Mexico for what senior officials described as virtual exile in the United States, the shadow of the former leader seemed at times to dart around the sunlit office he gave up on Dec. 1.
For the record, Mr. Zedillo denied having sent an intermediary to ask Mr. Salinas to leave. Speaking privately, aides to the President did not hesitate to contradict him. They also made a point of saying that while Mr. Salinas had sought repeatedly to meet with his handpicked successor, Mr. Zedillo had declined each time.
Mr. Zedillo did suggest that Mr. Salinas's public criticism of the Government and a strange, two-day hunger strike he began after the arrest on murder charges of his elder brother, Raul, had broken the unwritten rule that calls on retired Mexican leaders to keep silent on political affairs.
"I think there was some sense in the country that he was getting involved not only in things that were strictly private but that his comments were having some political effects," Mr. Zedillo said. "The sense that I had was that he was perhaps sad about Raul's situation and that made him put forward other issues."
Mr. Zedillo may have said as much about his differences with his predecessor simply by the way in which he conducted what turned somewhat unexpectedly into one of the few lengthy interviews he has given since taking office.
The meeting had been intended as a brief, private conversation. But in the middle of the encounter, and apparently to the dismay of some of his aides, Mr. Zedillo agreed to put his remarks on the record. He spoke in English.
Mr. Zedillo appeared not even to have thought about the tiny microphones that Mr. Salinas typically pinned on his visitors to record the interviews for prompt transcription.
There were no official photographers, no aides gliding in with important messages. Mr. Zedillo shunned the blue leather sofas in which Mr. Salinas liked to hold court, speaking to his visitors at a meeting table decorated with nothing more than a neat stack of note paper and a small bouquet of yellow highlighter pens.
Mr. Salinas had seemed to revel in the exercise of power from a position that he had prepared for throughout his adult life. Mr. Zedillo, a 43-year-old economist who stepped suddenly into the governing party candidacy after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio last March, said nothing to dispell the notion that he treats the presidency as a duty, even a burden.
"I never thought that life was going to be pleasant at the presidency," he said. "Right now, we are basically in a crisis-management situation. But I think that nothing that has happened should change our long-run view of Mexico. I think that is true in the economic realm; that's also true for the political realm."
Mr. Zedillo's asserted that his biggest surprise was the vulnerability of the Mexican economy. Despite holding a doctorate in economics from Yale University, having worked as a senior economic official for a decade and having had allies inside Mr. Salinas's economic cabinet, Mr. Zedillo said he had not been able to see the seriousness of the huge short-term debts that Mexico was contracting by the issuance of government bonds called tesobonos.
"I was not aware, for one thing, of how fast the structure of the internal debt had changed," he said. "I became aware of the tesobono problem in December."
Wall Street analysts say the problem was evident by last fall, when a devaluation was being actively sought by several senior Government officials, including the man who became Mr. Zedillo's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz. But Mr. Zedillo suggested that even a devaluation at that time would only have postponed a solution to the more fundamental problem of Mexico's dependence on huge flows of short-term foreign capital to finance the shortfall in its current account. The shortfall includes both the country's trade deficit and payments on its debt.
"A few days after we devalued, I became convinced that we did not have a classical, current-account adjustment problem," Mr. Zedillo said. But when the Government's first economic-recovery plan failed to calm the financial markets, he said, he realized that the problem was one that Mexico could not handle alone.
"That's when I called Mr. Clinton and told him that this was a very different ballgame," he said.
In Mr. Zedillo's view, Mexico was merely the first so-called emerging economy to confront the growing power and immediacy of global financial markets.
"It is obvious that the speed at which international financial markets have evolved over the last 25 years has been much faster than the capacity of governments and international organizations to cope," he said. "We have a new, global agreement on trade. But we don't have a new financial arrangement. So there's something missing there, and that's very dangerous for the world. Mexico was the first to pay for this problem."
Mr. Zedillo warmly praised the Clinton Administration for its $20 billion in help with the problem.
"I am surprised at the speed with which the U.S. Government reacted," he said, recalling the long struggle between Latin American debtors and the United States after Mexico led the region into its foreign-debt crisis in the 1980's. Mr. Clinton, he added, "was extremely quick to get it."
In a televised speech on Sunday night, Mr. Zedillo offered Mexicans a bleak economic time in the months ahead, with no more consolation than the assertion that any other policy would have more drastic consequences.
Responding to calls for a moratorium on debt payments from some opposition leaders and others, Mr. Zedillo said that in an economy in which trade represents half of all productive activity, the loss of credit lines would destroy the country's financial system. The cost, he said, would be a disaster in which the economy would contract 20 percent within a year.
"We would be talking about losing not thousands of jobs, but millions of jobs," he said.
Mr. Zedillo declined to discuss why Raul Salinas might have wanted to kill the governing-party leader whose slaying he is accused of having ordered, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu. Nor would he say how he would respond if Carlos Salinas were to be implicated in the cover-up of the case that Mr. Ruiz Massieu's brother, former Deputy Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu, is accused of having engineered on Raul Salinas's behalf.
Mr. Zedillo was asked if, after 100 days in power, he had gained a better sense of how to handle the political tumult that he is expected to face in the months ahead, partly as a side effect of the harsh economic remedies he has prescribed. He skipped past what many of his Mexican critics have described as a need for more careful political management and went to a broader point.
"Mexico now needs a high speed of change regarding democracy, regarding the rule of law," he said. "And it is obvious what we have to do to make a better democratic system. We just have to do it."

HEADLINE: Argentina Announces Financing Package to Bolster Peso and Stabilize Economy

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, March 13

 BODY:
Argentina said today that it had put together a financing package that would give it an extra $11.1 billion to back its economy and bolster the Argentine peso's fixed one-to-one parity with the United States dollar.
The package, announced after high-pressure weekend talks with a visiting International Monetary Fund mission, includes a renewed loan from the I.M.F. for $2 billion and an identical amount pledged by local businessmen and foreign banks, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo told a news conference. 
 Mr. Cavallo, who has vowed never to follow the trail of devaluation blazed by Mexico and Brazil, said that the rest of the money would come from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and a planned fiscal surplus of $4.4 billion to be achieved in part through more austerity.
In Washington, the I.M.F. immediately praised the planned moves as proof of Argentina's commitment to price stability -- a key ingredient of what the Government of President Carlos Menem called its "economic miracle" until Mexico's crisis shook Latin America's emerging markets.
"We have an additional $11.1 billion that allow us to ratify convertibility, that is, the backing in gold and foreign currencies of Argentina's money, to insure the timely payment of $5.2 billion in debt maturing in 1995," Mr. Cavallo said.
He said he would disclose on Tuesday a series of tax measures that would help achieve the planned $4.4 billion fiscal surplus.
The planned $4.4 billion fiscal surplus is calculated on the basis of a 1995 growth estimate revised down to 3 percent of gross domestic product from the earlier forecast of 4.5 percent, he added.
"But we believe, however, that this is the most pessimistic hypothesis," Mr. Cavallo said.
Argentina returned to the I.M.F.'s coffers after giving up voluntarily last year the last two parts of an earlier Extended Fund Facility worth a combined $420 million, saying it had full and free access to voluntary capital markets worldwide.
Faced with a $4 billion fall in bank deposits since Mexico's Dec. 20 devaluation and a slump of more than $2 billion in central bank foreign reserves, Mr. Cavallo decided this month to draw down the $420 million after all.
Then last week, faced with an increasing liquidity squeeze that has already caused prices to deflate so far in March, the Government decided to tap the I.M.F. for a more sizable loan.
The tax increases that will help produce the pledged $4.4 billion fiscal surplus come on top of a $3.3 billion austerity package announced last month, which included the unusual step of cutting the salaries of better-off public servants.
Mr. Cavallo said the Government, which faces presidential elections in two months' time, on May 14, would not increase taxes on fuels, cigarettes or alcohol but would instead turn to trade taxes.
Argentine stocks surged today in anticipation of the I.M.F. deal, with the key blue-chip index gaining more than 8 percent. It had risen almost 13 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI IN ACCORD WITH CITY COUNCIL ON X-RATED SHOPS

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council agreed yesterday to a set of strict new zoning rules for X-rated video stores and topless bars that city officials say will drastically reduce the number and concentration of the establishments throughout the city.
The new rules, which officials hope will be put into effect before the end of the year, would prevent sex-related businesses from operating within 500 feet of residences, schools and houses of worship and within 500 feet of one another. 
 Together with other zoning restrictions, the rules will essentially limit such businesses to parts of midtown Manhattan, including Times Square, and isolated manufacturing areas in the boroughs outside Manhattan. But even in Times Square, whose red-light reputation for X-rated entertainment is known worldwide, the changes will be profound.
"This starts a new day," said Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District. She estimated that the proposed regulations would reduce the number of adult stores in Times Square "from 47 to about 5 or 6."
She added: "This is great news. It can welcome back exciting and appropriate economic development on Eighth Avenue."
The rules come in response to the proliferation of sex-related businesses both in midtown Manhattan and in residential neighborhoods where they had rarely been seen before -- places like Chelsea, the Upper West Side and Forest Hills, Queens. In the last decade, officials say, the number of adult businesses has risen 35 percent, from 131 in 1984 to 177 in December 1993.
Yesterday's agreement represents a sort of compromise between Mr. Giuliani, who last year proposed far stricter regulations that would have effectively banned sex-oriented businesses from all but manufacturing areas outside of Manhattan, and the City Council, whose members worried that his plans would push pornography shops to the fringes of the boroughs outside Manhattan.
But in revising the plan to allow some sex businesses to remain in Manhattan, the Mayor was able to allay the Council's concerns.
The proposal must still be reviewed by the city's 59 community boards and the borough presidents. It must be approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council, both of which are anticipated to do so. City officials said they hope to have the regulations approved and in place by November, to coincide with the end of a moratorium that the City Council passed last year halting the establishment of any new sex businesses while the zoning rules were being set up.
The agreement defines adult establishments as businesses that have "a substantial portion of their stock in trade or materials characterized by an emphasis on specific anatomical areas or sexual activities." It also includes businesses that regularly feature films "characterized by an emphasis on specified anatomical areas or sexual activities." The proposal does not include art schools and studios. Inspectors from the city's Buildings Department are to determine which businesses fall into these categories.
Several store owners were angered by the agreement. Richard N. Kunis, the owner of Manhattan Video in midtown Manhattan and a founder of the Adult Industry Trade Association, said he and the association would take the matter to court as a First Amendment issue.
"Any time the government is going to limit any kind of expression -- especially pleasurable expression -- you get a censored city," he said.
Arthur N. Eisenberg, the legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the agreement left unaltered his view that the regulations were unconstitutional. "The question is whether the city has created alternative opportunities for these First Amendment enterprises," Mr. Eisenberg said. "We think the city's position is vulnerable to constitutional challenge."
Mayor Giuliani said all of that was taken into account in deliberations with the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and other officials. He said the city wanted to have the "maximum degree of control" over how such businesses operated, but "consistent with the right of free speech."
Mr. Giuliani added that "that's a delicate balance and I believe that we've achieved it."
The proposed zoning regulations retained the bulk of Mr. Giuliani's initial recommendations by prohibiting sex businesses from opening within 500 feet of residences, schools, houses of worship or one another. It permits such businesses to operate chiefly in manufacturing areas, as in the Mayor's proposal.
But the agreement would expand the areas in which such establishments could operate to "commercial zones of high density." They include business areas with high traffic and larger stores, including parts of Seventh Avenue and Broadway from 48th to 55th Streets, parts of Eighth Avenue from 38th to 41st, and parts of Broadway and Avenue of the Americas from 29th to 31st.
"The proposal will have a very significant impact on the concentration, locations and operations of the adult entertainment businesses," Mayor Giuliani said at a press conference in City Hall with Mr. Vallone at his side.
"These businesses have a very devastating impact on the neighborhoods in which they are located," Mr. Giuliani said. "These zoning amendments will leave open only certain areas of the city. Basically light industrial and some high-density commercial zones."
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan borough president, responded cautiously to the new plan. "We need to take a careful look at all the maps to understand exactly what neighborhoods will be impacted," she said. "This is a broader spread than the Mayor presented at first, but I still want to see the impact, so that there are not business neighborhoods with excess concentration."
The agreement also restricts the size of the establishments, prohibiting any from being larger than 10,000 square feet.
Businesses that do not comply with any provision would be required to close within a year. However, the city's Board of Standards and Appeals could extend that period if a business can demonstrate that more time would be needed to recoup its investment.
The administration estimated that in Manhattan alone the effect of the proposed regulations would be to reduce the number of adult-entertainment areas to 45, from 107.
 
 
Areas to Be Zoned for Sex Shops
 Under the Giuliani administration's first proposal last year, adult-entertainment shops would have been restricted to light manufacturing areas in boroughs outside of Manhattan and a few small sections of Manhattan, including Chelsea, parts of TriBeCa and part of SoHo.
Under the new agreement with the City Council, these areas in Manhattan would also be included:
*Block fronts along Seventh Avenue, from 48th to 55th Streets.
*Full blocks between Seventh Avenue and Broadway from 48th to 55th Streets.
*Half blocks west of Broadway from 51st to 55th Streets.
*Block fronts along Eighth Avenue, from 38th to 41st Streets.
*Three blocks north of the Javits Convention Center.
*Parts of the blocks between Broadway and Eighth Avenue between 42d and 44th Streets.
*An area between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas from 29th to 31st Streets.
*An area at the intersection of Thomas and Lafayette Streets in lower Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Welfare and Food Stamp Rolls End Six Years of Increases

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Welfare and food stamp rolls, which increased relentlessly through recession and economic recovery in the last six years, have finally leveled off, new Government data show.
The persistent increases in the rolls had become one of the great puzzles of social welfare policy. 
 The last recession ended in March 1991, according to the arbiter of economic cycles, the National Bureau of Economic Research. But until late last year, the number of people receiving assistance under the two programs kept increasing.
Experts say the increases have now stopped for two reasons.
First, they say, the benefits of the economic recovery have begun to reach some people at the bottom of the income ladder. In addition, they say, in the last year or so, many states have restricted eligibility for welfare, so fewer people are entitled to cash assistance.
Whether the new data will affect the Congressional debate on welfare is unclear. The figures may slightly reduce the political pressure for wholesale changes in the welfare system. But the effort to make such changes is sure to continue because Republicans insist that cash welfare programs, in particular, have been a complete failure.
The food stamp rolls have grown by more than one-third since 1990. More than one-tenth of all Americans now receive the coupons. But in October, November and December of 1994, the program showed a drop in the number of recipients, to an average of 27 million, down 300,000 from the same period in 1993.
A similar pattern is evident in data for the nation's main cash assistance program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. About 13.9 million people received such aid in November 1994, as against 14.2 million in November 1993.
Melissa T. Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which supervises the cash assistance program, said, "When you look at the most recent data, the caseload has apparently stabilized and the growth in the rolls has apparently stopped."
In the past, the number of food stamp recipients declined when the economy was growing and employment was rising. The latest surge in the food stamp rolls began in 1989, before the recession, and it continued even after unemployment began to decline in the middle of 1992.
"This program has gone up when the economy turns down, as it should," said Representative Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican who heads the House Agriculture Committee. "But in addition, it has gone up when the economy turns good, in an ever-increasing spiral."
But Ellen Haas, the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said the food stamp rolls had leveled off. "It reflects the economic upturn, the recovery," she said.
Ms. Haas said the data also showed that the food stamp program, as currently constructed, expands in hard times, when more people need assistance, and can contract when the need abates.
The number of people receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children was remarkably steady, around 11 million, from 1975 through 1989. The recession in the first years of the Reagan Administration, 1981 and 1982, would ordinarily have produced an increase in the rolls, but it coincided with eligibility cutbacks, which prevented such an increase.
The number of welfare recipients shot up after 1989, rising by an average of 659,000 in each of the next five years.
The Federal Government controls the food stamp program, setting uniform national eligibility criteria and benefit levels, and it pays the full cost. By contrast, in Aid to Families With Dependent Children, states have a large degree of discretion.
Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said, "Many states have purposely reduced the generosity of their welfare benefits, making them less attractive, or adopted more stringent eligibility criteria, reducing the number of people entitled to benefits."
Why did the welfare and food stamp rolls grow so much more than expected in the last six years?
Long-term demographic trends account for some of the growth. The trends include an increase in births to unmarried women. Many families headed by such women are poor and qualify for welfare.
Demetra Smith Nightingale, director of welfare research at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization, offered several other explanations. State and local government agencies have simplified the procedures used in applying for welfare, food stamps and Medicaid, she said. Many states have tried to identify people who might be eligible and encouraged them to apply. When people seek benefits under one program, some states check automatically to see if they qualify for the others.
Declining rates of unemployment insurance coverage have also contributed to increases in the welfare rolls, said Isaac Shapiro, associate director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group. About 33 percent of jobless workers now receive unemployment insurance, down from an average of more than 50 percent in the 1970's, he said. Those who have no unemployment insurance protection are more likely to qualify for welfare because they have no income from jobless benefits and may exhaust their assets.
Changes in the labor market also contributed to the increase in welfare rolls, making it difficult for people with low skills and little education to find jobs that lift them out of poverty. Low-wage jobs are often temporary, part-time or seasonal, so women who take these jobs often return to the welfare rolls. The same labor market conditions will make it difficult for welfare recipients to comply with work requirements in the welfare bill now moving through the House of Representatives.

Bond Prices Up Again as Traders Doubt Rates Will Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday for a third consecutive session as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates this month.
Recent reports showing a persistent combination of brisk growth and low inflation have generated optimism among traders and analysts. 
 "We have seen signs of slowing in the economy," said Rob Schumacher, who oversees more than $13 billion at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. "They're not flashing red lights, but they're unquestionably amber."
The price of the 30-year bond rose 3/32 , to 1013/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 7.45 percent from 7.46 percent.
Treasury notes, which have a maturity of 10 years or less and are more sensitive than bonds to Fed rate increases, gained even more than bonds. The yield on the two-year note, for example, fell 6 basis points from Friday, to 6.74 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Rates fell at the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills. The Treasury sold $12.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.76 percent, down from 5.77 percent last week, and $12.4 billion in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.92 percent, down from 6 percent.
In one sign that the Fed may be finished raising interest rates for the time being, the spread between the 2-year note and 30-year bond widened to 71 basis points, from 66 on Friday.
A slowdown in consumer spending and the prospect that Congress will trim the Federal deficit mean "there's a very real prospect we'll continue downward in rates," Mr. Schumacher said. Bond yields could reach 7 percent by August, he said.
Fed economists associate growth of more than 2.5 percent with rising inflation rates, and last year the economy expanded by 4 percent, creating expectations that inflation would increase from the 2.7 percent recorded at the consumer level during the last two years.
Optimism that the Fed is engineering a soft landing -- controlling inflation without causing the economy to stagnate -- is keeping yields near the six-month low of 7.44 percent set on Feb. 28.
Treasury prices gained on Friday even after the Labor Department reported strong job growth in February. The resilience of Treasury prices after Friday's report suggested that any signs of strong economic growth emerging from this week's reports might not be enough to push yields up, some investors said.
A series of strong reports "could help burst the bubble," said Fabio Salvodelli, who oversees $1.4 billion at SBC Portfolio Management International. "But it's a pretty thick bubble of happiness, and it would take a fair bit of worse-than-consensus news to do that."
Top Fed officials say an economic slowdown is anything but assured. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Cathy E. Minehan, who is also a voting member of the Fed's policy-making committee, said yesterday that inflation could soon increase.
"Further growth acceleration at this point can lead to inflation, as the demand for goods outstrips our ability to produce them," Ms. Minehan said.
Economic reports this week could help Fed policy makers determine whether to raise interest rates at their next meeting, on March 28.
The week's reports include reports on producer prices tomorrow and consumer prices on Thursday. The Federal Reserve will report on industrial production tomorrow.
Following are the results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills yesterday:

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Apartments, and Lives, And an Unsure Future

BYLINE: By Evelyn Nieves 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
WHEN she thinks hard, Marisol Rivera can recall Charter Oak Terrace as a sweet little village, with the brick houses still young and strong, children doing flips off the playground swings, family barbecues on the front lawns.
"It was nice 30 years ago," Ms. Rivera said, standing on a parking pad littered with broken beer bottles. "It was different." 
 The grass that graced Charter Oak Terrace has long surrendered to neglect. A rusted slide and geodesic dome strangled by weeds are what's left of the playground. The barracks-style buildings, built in the 1940's as temporary housing for defense workers, are falling apart, and the burglar bars make them look like prisons.
Charter Oak Terrace has devolved into one of public housing's worst cases. While it is Hartford's largest housing project, with 980 units, several buildings are boarded up and some 300 units are vacant. Close to 98 percent of its 650 households are headed by single women. About 90 percent of the residents are unemployed. Gangs have divvied up the project into a drug-turf pie.
City officials say Charter Oak Terrace is beyond repair. They are talking about demolishing most of the buildings and relocating tenants into a nearby moderate-income project and scattered apartments. The city and adjoining West Hartford would turn the land into a commercial development park for light industry and give Charter Oak Terrace residents first crack at jobs.
PART of the proposal is an idea gripping public housing authorities across the country -- tear down old, high-density, low-income projects where crime and generational despair have taken hold and relocate residents to mixed neighborhoods. (Under Federal law, the housing authority has to replace housing units that are demolished one for one.) But displacement is a scary word. In Hartford, at least, the idea is making the very residents it is supposed to help scream bloody murder.
Ms. Rivera is one of them. Charter Oak Terrace is no place to boast about, but it's the devil she knows. "I was born and raised here," she said. "My grandmother lived here. I feel it's the best place for me. I say don't kill it; fix it and make it safer."
Nine people were murdered at the project last year, including Ms. Rivera's cousin and uncle. They were shot to death in their apartment the day before New Year's Eve, around the same time that two other residents were found dead in another apartment.
Ms. Rivera pondered the reasons and shrugged. "I keep my eyes open and my mouth shut," she said.
Nilsa Ramos, who has lived in Charter Oak Terrace for 20 years, said that minding your business has become the rule to live by. "Once, I saw a guy delivering Chinese food surrounded when he knocked on a door," she said. She did not stick around to see what became of him.
She is raising three children on public assistance and pays $169 a month for a two-bedroom apartment where the walls seem ready to collapse. She figures she gets what she pays for.
"Not only is the place falling apart," she said. "It has rats. Whenever they put spray for them, it attracts more. That stuff is like food for them."
She said she has requested transfers to other public housing. But now that the city is proposing the idea, she doesn't like it. She is skeptical that another place would be better, or that jobs would come. "What kind of jobs?" she asked. "Where are the guarantees?"
It's a good question. John Wardlaw, the executive director of the Hartford Housing Authority, said part of the concept for Charter Oak Terrace is a job-training program for tenants to prepare them for the companies that would move in to hire them.
"We should be in the business of helping people no longer be poor," said Mr. Wardlaw, who gained some notoriety when he hired a gang member last summer to help quell gang violence.
After spending $34 million on the buildings at Charter Oak Terrace over 17 years, Mr. Wardlaw said he is convinced that the money could have been better spent. He blames politicians who he said have a vested interest in keeping Charter Oak a power base, for scaring residents into believing the proposal is to dump residents into two projects that are almost as bad as Charter Oak Terrace, or worse, leaving them out in the cold.
"Now, as we explain to tenants the entire idea, we're starting to see the community get excited about it," he said.
TO try to dispel fears among Charter Oak Terrace residents, the City Council is expected to pass a resolution promising that under no circumstance would a plan result in displacement or undo hardship of the Charter Oak Terrace community; that residents would be given first preference in jobs created by commercial development; that whatever relocation would vastly improve their living conditions; that they would not be transferred to another project without their express approval, and that they would be part of the process.
"I think if we failed with this attempt, that would be the end of Hartford," Mr. Wardlaw said.
But if Ms. Rivera is any indication, the city has a lot of work ahead. She does not want to think about the end of Charter Oak Terrace. Even its menacing aspects don't faze her.
"For me, it's safe because I've been living here so long," she said. Sure, she said, sometimes she thinks she wants to leave, but the thought never lingers because home is home.

Greenspan Calls for a New Panel To Set Cost-of-Living Adjustments

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Reiterating his belief that the Government's Consumer Price Index overstates inflation, the chairman of the Federal Reserve called today for an independent commission to set new cost-of-living adjustments for income taxes and benefit programs like Social Security that are pegged to the index.
Roughly 30 percent of all Federal spending is pegged to the Consumer Price Index and rises with it. Personal income taxes account for 45 percent of Federal revenues and the brackets for them are also linked to the price index. 
 Because the index appears to exaggerate actual increases in the cost of living in the United States, Mr. Greenspan said, benefit programs like Social Security overcompensate recipients for inflation, while taxes are collected at artificially low rates. "For purposes of indexation of Federal programs, the C.P.I. should be a starting point, but it shouldn't be the end," he added.
The index is calculated by the Labor Department. Mr. Greenspan did not say who should serve on the panel or for how long, but he strongly implied that the commissioners should be experts on prices and that the commission should be permanent. If nothing is done, the loss to the Federal Treasury from overstating inflation could add as much as $150 billion to the Federal budget deficit over the next five years, he said.
Mr. Greenspan's proposal for an independent commission, made this morning before the Senate Finance Committee, comes at a time of intense Republican interest in finding some way to change the cost-of-living index so as to save money, either for tax cuts or to reduce the Federal budget deficit. Mr. Greenspan's proposal offers lawmakers a way to do both, while seeking to divert toward the independent commission any political criticism that may come from affected groups like Social Security beneficiaries.
Senators on the committee generally avoided taking any immediate stance on the question of the independent commission, and expressed concern that powerful lobbyists for the elderly had already misinterpreted Mr. Greenspan's previous remarks. Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who is the committee chairman, did not take a personal position on Mr. Greenspan's proposal for an independent commission but said that it might be included in this year's budget legislation.
Senator Packwood emphasized the issue's significance. "We are considering today what is perhaps a more important subject fiscally than almost anything else we will consider this year -- and I think in the public's mind yet it's had relatively little notice -- and this is the Consumer Price Index and the effect that it can have on our policy," he said.
Mr. Greenspan's comments today also set the stage for a new and potentially nasty fight over the extent to which the United States should continue to transfer huge sums of money each year from young people to older people.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, told Mr. Greenspan that "the senior citizens and their advocacy groups -- that ought to know better -- think you're part of a Republican conspiracy to cut down on Social Security in a way that we don't have guts enough to do it in the Congress, if it should be done."
Perhaps in deference to that, Mr. Greenspan mentioned the possibility that a more generous cost-of-living adjustment could be used for elderly benefits because of the fast-rising medical costs they face.
When Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, walked out of the hearing room and into a corridor, he ostentatiously looked in both directions and began walking sideways toward an elevator, his back pressed against the corridor wall. In response to quizzical reporters, he explained that he was afraid of meeting lobbyists from the American Association of Retired Persons.
Martin A. Corry, the association's director of Federal affairs, later criticized Mr. Greenspan's proposal as unnecessary. Mr. Corry defended the current practice of using the Consumer Price Index, saying that the Labor Department calculated the index impartially and without political pressures. If the index exaggerates inflation then the Labor Department should fix it, he said.
But Mr. Greenspan backed away today from his previous suggestions that the index be recalculated, saying that the index had certain inherent flaws that required broad adjustments. He mentioned that many products, from CAT scanners to power tools, have improved in quality without increasing much in price. The Consumer Price Index has failed to take adequate account of these quality improvements, he said.
"Those who remember with fondness the products of yesteryear are probably suffering from either fading memories or excessive sentimentality," Mr. Greenspan said.
Academic and Government experts who also testified before the Senate Finance Committee today tended to agree with Mr. Greenspan that the price index overstated inflation and added to the budget deficit. "Every year that we wait, Social Security beneficiaries and taxpayers are being compensated for inflation that did not occur," said Robert J. Gordon, the chairman of the economics department at Northwestern University.
Mr. Greenspan said today that the Federal budget deficit would continue to be artificially widened as long as Federal programs and taxes are pegged to the Consumer Price Index. "Left in place over long periods of time, as has now occurred and is envisioned continuing in the future, the discrepancy will compound in a manner that cumulates to a very substantial magnitude," he said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold's Rally Gains Momentum With a Surge to a 4-Month High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gold prices hit a four-month high yesterday as precious metals resumed a rally powered by the weaker dollar and what traders saw as the improbability of higher interest rates.
Rising demand by jewelry makers also underpinned gold's gains, analysts said. 
 In other commodity markets, coffee futures fell sharply and crude oil rebounded. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 1.03 points, to 235.12.
Gold for March delivery on the Commodity Exchange of New York hit $385.70 an ounce, the highest since Nov. 17. Profit taking cut the closing price to $385, which was $3.20 above Friday's settlement. The more active April contract ended $3 higher at $386.10. March silver rose 12.8 cents, to $4.696 an ounce.
The rally in gold that began last week continues, said Ian MacDonald, manager of precious metals trading at the New York branch of Credit Suisse. "I think we may well be set for further gains unless something unexpected happens, like the dollar strengthening," he said.
The dollar's renewed weakness against the Japanese yen and German mark sent investors to the perceived safety of gold, analysts said.
Traders also said they were reacting to an article in The New York Times that said four of seven Federal Reserve governors expressed little enthusiasm for further increases in short-term interest rates.
"The Times story definitely had an impact on gold and silver," said James Steel, an analyst for Refco Inc., a large futures brokerage firm. "It's unusual for an article, even in The Times, to carry that much weight in these markets."
Higher interest rates would increase the dollar's appeal to investors, traders say, and would also reduce gold's appeal as a hedge against inflation.
Coffee futures fell sharply on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York as traders awaited word on price-support measures being considered at a meeting of coffee producing countries in London. The contract for May deliveries of green arabica coffee beans fell 5.6 cents, to $1.8215 a pound.
Crude oil rebounded from three consecutive days of losses on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Traders attributed the recovery mainly to technical factors.
Light crude oil for April delivery rose 28 cents, to $18.19 a barrel, and April heating oil rose 0.36 cent, to 45.61 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Slips as Trading Quiets After Volatile Week

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most leading currencies yesterday. Trading was quiet after a volatile week when the dollar slid to record lows against the Japanese yen and the German mark before recovering on Friday.
Currency dealers and analysts said an article in The New York Times yesterday confirmed market expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates when its policy-making committee meets on March 28. Higher interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated deposits more attractive. 
 The article reported that four of the Federal Reserve Board's seven governors said they thought that economic growth was stabilizing, suggesting that further increases in short-term interest rates would not be needed.
"People are now convinced there will be no move at the March meeting," said Charles Spence, director of currency sales at the Standard Chartered Bank.
But speculation that the Fed will not raise rates soon prompted a rally in the United States bond market, which helped pull the dollar up from its lows, particularly against the yen, traders said. To buy bonds, foreign investors must first purchase dollars.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.4067 marks from 1.4120 marks on Friday. The dollar slipped to 90.75 yen from 90.90 yen.
After touching record lows of 1.3455 marks and 88.76 yen on Wednesday, the dollar slowly recovered. Now it is in the process of settling into ranges of 1.34 to 1.42 marks and 88 to 92 yen, Mr. Spence of Standard Chartered said.
In other currency trading yesterday, the mark continued to climb against the Italian lira. The German currency reached a record high of 1,211.44 lire, lifted by Italy's political and economic difficulties.
Investor confidence in Italian assets and the lira was further weakened after the governor of the Bank of Italy, Antonio Fazio, said a budget package was "necessary but not sufficient" to bring Italy's large budget deficit under control.
"The lira-denominated market is very nervous about political developments, and Fazio's comments have clearly added to the concerns," said Lorenzo Stanca, currency analyst at Credito Italiano.
The mark was last quoted at 1,194.07 lire, up from 1,182.72 lire late Friday in New York. The dollar stood at 1,680 lire, up from 1.670 lire.

HEADLINE: Mexico Without Blinkers

 BODY:
Even close watchers of Mexico have been shaken by the explosive allegations of narco-corruption and murderous intrigue being leveled against former Government officials by the new authorities in Mexico City. Those allegations led former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to flee Mexico over the weekend for a potentially extended exile in the United States.
This is not just the modest settling of scores after a high-profile administration leaves office. President Ernesto Zedillo, who shattered precedent by naming an opposition lawyer to the sensitive post of Attorney General, has now authorized a far-reaching and unflinching inquiry into past misdeeds, mysteries and cover-ups. 
 Particularly disturbing are the new Government's claims, still unproven, that intimate associates of former President Salinas may have been directly involved in skimming millions of dollars of drug profits and even organizing political murders.
The last two Presidents of the United States have embraced Mr. Salinas as the personification of desirable economic and political change in Mexico. Yet American authorities were far more aware than they let on of the close ties between Salinas associates and the Mexican drug cartels now funneling most of the cocaine that reaches the United States.
Their silence was part of a misplaced effort to maintain good relations with the Salinas administration to encourage its policies of economic reform and not spook Congressional passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Salinas economic reforms were real enough. Over Mr. Salinas's six-year term, Mexico sold off hundreds of money-losing state enterprises, substantially lowered tariffs on foreign imports and opened its economy to foreign investment. Grievous mismanagement of the peso during the final months of the Salinas presidency has chased those investors away. But over the longer run, his impressive accomplishment in opening up Mexico's economy to competitive forces should invigorate economic growth.
Washington's downplaying of corruption issues was a costly mistake. United States relations with Mexico are best served by the kind of housecleaning that is now going on. Only by rooting out corrupt links between officials and drug traffickers and ending the ruling party's long immunity from prosecution can economic reform be consolidated and secured.
Congressional critics of Washington's recent loan guarantees to the Zedillo Government may find some rhetorical grist in the latest sensational headlines. But the Zedillo administration's willingness to pursue credible evidence of corruption wherever it leads makes Mexico an even stronger candidate for United States support, and the Clinton Administration is right to encourage Mr. Zedillo in his efforts.

HEADLINE: New York's Desperate Hours

BYLINE: By Carol O'Cleireacain; Carol O'Cleireacain, an economist, was New York City's finance commissioner from 1990 to 1993 and budget director in 1993.

 BODY:
This should have been the fiscal year that New York City turned the corner. After five straight years of severe budget problems, of staggering through an endless cycle of cutting services and stretching out debt, the city got a half-billion-dollar gift: a temporary downturn in debt service payments to the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
It was a rare opportunity -- not only to balance the 1995 budget but to buy time, to start taking long-term measures that wouldn't necessarily pay off this year but would lead to big savings in the future. As the City Council holds hearings into next year's budget -- still severely out of balance despite the deep cuts proposed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani -- it has become all too clear that the opportunity was wasted. 
 Soon after the council adopted the budget last June, state and city fiscal monitors reported that it was about $1 billion out of balance. Apparently, the Mayor and council had gambled that an improving economy and a friendly administration in Albany would make up any shortfall.
To his credit, Mr. Giuliani put spending controls in place and, in October, presented budget changes to close the billion-dollar gap. But a losing game of catch-up had already begun. A quarter of the fiscal year was over; agencies had begun operating with unbalanced budgets. The Mayor and council spent three months battling over budget authority, and as they did so the city's economy stalled, so tax revenues came up at least $400 million short.
And the city is still scrambling. One-shot deficit-closing actions now come to at least $1.8 billion this year. This is more than two and a half times the average amount of one-shot actions in the past five years of economic downturn.
Some of these measures are defensible, but others seem inspired by sheer desperation. Consider the proposal to sell the state two city-owned jails near the Canadian border. It is hard to know which is the more serious risk to the city's fiscal health: not getting the State Legislature's approval for this sale, or getting it.
The first would create a $120 million hole in the 1995 budget. Under the second, the $120 million from the sale would go entirely toward closing this year's budget gap, while the city would still have to pay off $113 million in bonds it issued in 1988 to build the jails. State Comptroller Carl McCall calls this "capitalizing operating expenses," the same behavior that cut New York City off from the bond market in the mid-1970's. The nontechnical taxpayer will recognize it as comparable to selling the house, blowing the proceeds at the race track and still being stuck with the mortgage.
Whether defensible or not, such one-shot actions have no recurring value. As a result, in 1996 the city faces its largest deficit (at least $2.7 billion, or 13 percent of revenues) in the past 15 years.
And the city still has to get through this fiscal year, which ends June 30. Standard & Poor's has placed the bond ratings of the city and its Health and Hospitals Corporation on a negative credit watch. Though the fiscal monitors say the city can end the year with its budget balanced, there are still considerable risks; the biggest, they say, is at the Board of Education, where a sizable slippage in efforts to close its spending gap illustrates that the longer you wait to solve a problem, the harder it becomes.
While this is the city's worst fiscal plight since the 1970's, it is hardly a new one. In the past five years a sort of equilibrium has set in, with rolling quarterly shortfalls, new spending cuts, one-shot gap-closing measures and refinancing of debt. The focus is short-term in the extreme, the pressure is exhausting for all participants, and the uncertainty about future services punishes every city resident, from schoolchildren to subway riders (and their employers).
The only way to break the cycle is to move toward structural balance -- a situation in which revenue and spending are about the same size and grow at roughly the same rate. And the path is no mystery: it was laid out on Dec. 1, 1993, in a report to Mayor David N. Dinkins by Donald Kummerfeld, a former city budget director; Dall Forsythe, a former state budget director, and William Gray 3d, a former chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives.
Right now, the growth in spending exceeds the growth in revenue by about 2 percent a year as far as the eye can see. Structural balance, then, means making tough choices that cut the growth of spending and permanently increase revenue. The 1993 report presented a full array of the necessary spending cuts, some of which the city has begun: reducing the number of employees and their compensation; reducing debt service; eliminating certain subsidies and duplicative services, and consolidating agencies.
As for revenues, the Kummerfeld report said bluntly that structural balance could not be achieved by spending cuts alone. Revenues must be raised, the report said, and argued that it could be done in ways that would do the least damage to the economy: delay scheduled tax cuts; introduce a combination of fees and charges for certain basic services, like garbage collection and bridge maintenance.
Most important, they called for reform of the city's largest tax, theproperty tax, which is now skewed in favor of single-family homeowners and against commercial property owners. Such a change is not only a matter of equity; it would help restore the property tax to its historical role as the stabilizer of the revenue side of the budget.
Putting structural balance at the center of the city's budget planning cannot be the responsibility of the Mayor alone. It requires full participation by the City Council, and recognition in Albany that the state has a real stake in the long-term fiscal health of New York City.
Some new budget rules can help, too. The city's financial plan should make structural balance an explicit goal, with the pattern of recurring spending and revenues monitored and reported in the same way as the annual gap-closing program. The city should commit itself to a cap on one-shot actions in any given year. While there is no hard rule on where to set that cap, recent experience suggests that it should not exceed $700 million. Finally, rather than reporting after the fact, the fiscal monitors, or at least the city comptroller, should be required to verify before adoption that the proposed budget deal between the council and the Mayor is in fact a balanced budget.
As desperate as the city's plight looks now, it can get worse. So far the bond markets have accommodated the city. Bondholders are requiring, and the city has been all to happy to pay, a higher rate of interest than is generally appropriate for its investment-grade rating. But the markets can turn.
Changes in securities regulations, interest rates or exchange rates, as well as the national trend toward tax cutting at all levels of government, may lower demand for tax-exempt municipal bonds or generate a flight to higher-quality bonds. City debt service is increasing again, even with a one-third cut in the capital budget. Declines in commercial property values are lowering the ceiling on both the amount of debt the city can issue and the property taxes that can be levied. A national recession would unbalance the budget further. The city could lose its one remaining investment-grade bond rating. That's why it's more urgent than ever to listen to what the Kummerfeld report told us almost a year and a half ago.

Talks Off as N.L.R.B. Summons Parties

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., March 13

 BODY:
First, they disagreed about which day they would meet. Now they're not sure they will meet at all.
The round of talks in the baseball strike that had been scheduled to begin Tuesday or Wednesday was delayed today in the face of a scheduled meeting in Washington Tuesday at which the owners are expected to learn that the National Labor Relations Board will issue a complaint against them. 
 Fred Feinstein, the board's general counsel, has scheduled a morning meeting with the owners' representatives and one in the afternoon with union officials. At the morning session, Feinstein is expected to tell the owners that unless they agree to settle the players' unfair labor practice charge against them, a complaint will be issued and he will ask for board approval to seek an injunction in United States District Court.
Unlike a similar session on Feb. 3, the owners are not expected to agree to settle. The players have said they will return to work if the board gets an injunction forcing the clubs to restore the working terms and conditions that existed before the owners implemented a salary cap last Dec. 23.
The pending board action has prompted a delay in the resumption of talks. The owners' negotiating committee was at a hotel outside Orlando today to discuss a new proposal that the mediator, Bill Usery Jr., has asked it to make. The committee presumably would have made it when talks resumed Tuesday, the date the owners thought had been set, or Wednesday, the date the players thought had been set.
But Usery issued a statement saying, "The clubs have stated that it is not possible to comply with my request that the clubs put forward their best offer until they can receive and assess the decision of the general counsel."
Usery said he was postponing the negotiations, but would remain in contact with the two sides. He said he would decide when the talks should resume "when the situation regarding this matter has been clarified."
Donald Fehr, the union leader, said he hoped the resumption of talks would not be "long delayed."
"No matter how Feinstein rules," he added by telephone from New York, "whether it's for us or the clubs, we should continue to negotiate and try to find a way out."
The owners have called the N.L.R.B. business a distraction, and that's the way they felt today after the members of their negotiating committee all had traveled to Florida. But they didn't dismiss the possibility of meeting with the players' negotiators later this week.
"The clubs continue to believe that the best way to resolve our differences is at the bargaining table," John Harrington, chairman of the negotiating committee, said in a statement. He said the committee would determine how and when to continue negotiations after the Washington meeting.
When asked if the two sides could yet meet this week, Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said from Milwaukee, "I think there's a chance."
The charge Feinstein will act on Tuesday arose after the clubs agreed Feb. 3 to restore the conditions prior to Dec. 23 and withdraw their implemented salary cap rather than have an unfair labor practice complaint issued against them.
When the clubs altered the previous working terms and conditions, eliminating salary arbitration among other things, the union filed another unfair labor practice charge with the board. The initial charge stemmed from the clubs' act in declaring an impasse and implementing a new economic system.
In another element of the labor dispute, the clubs have renewed the contracts of more than 800 unsigned players, but the union contended today that the renewals were invalid.
"They are the function of invalidly implemented terms," Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said by telephone from New York. "The clubs haven't restored the status quo in violation of the National Labor Relations Act."
Club management lawyers did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment on the renewals and the union's position.

HEADLINE: Deadly Nuclear Waste Piles Up With No Clear Solution at Hand

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
INCREASINGLY, the world is awash in plutonium, the deadly gold of the nuclear era, the man-made element that is produced in all nuclear reactors and prized for making atom bombs. And increasingly, no one knows what to do with it, as big nuclear arsenals become passe and as alternative plans for the perilously radioactive stuff lose their luster.
The simplest option is to bury it. But that is now under fire as scientists debate, and Federal agencies study, whether a proposed underground dump in Nevada might eventually blow up in a nuclear explosion fed by waste plutonium. For years the dump has been seen as a crucial solution to the plutonium problem, and its rejection would be an enormous blow to nuclear planning. 
 And globally, plans to burn plutonium in commercial nuclear reactors are floundering for political and economic reasons.
Scientists are proposing many new methods and machines meant to rid the world of surplus plutonium, including new reactors, annihilators and special ways to discard it. But costliness and political inertia have kept these schemes largely in limbo. Meanwhile, the glut of plutonium is growing, stirring fears that sooner or later some will fall into the hands of nuclear terrorists.
"Plutonium is the bottom-line danger because it's always atom-bomb material, even when it's declared for peaceful purposes," said Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a trade group based in Washington.
It takes from 2.2 to 17.6 pounds of plutonium to make a bomb, depending on the skill of the designer and the concentration of the 239 isotope, the preferred kind for weapons. A metric ton (2,205 pounds) can make from 125 to 1,000 warheads.
Of the 270 or so metric tons of weapons plutonium in the world, perhaps as many as 200 tons are slated to become surplus in the next few years as nuclear disarmament moves forward. And on the civil side, the stockpile of plutonium, both in nuclear-reactor wastes and isolates from spent fuel, stands at about 930 metric tons and is expected to nearly double in the next decade.
"This is a very serious problem," said Dr. Arjun Makhijani, a nuclear physicist and president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, a private group in Takoma Park, Md. "Every four or five years we're making about as much plutonium in the civil sector as we did during the whole cold war."
Plutonium was discovered in 1940 at the University of California. Made in a cyclotron, the radioactive element was found to be extremely toxic and to have a half-life of 24,360 years. It was soon produced in bulk. Uranium 238, the common isotope of uranium in nature, was bombarded by neutrons in nuclear reactors and almost magically transformed into plutonium 239, which was then extracted to make atomic bombs. In 1945, a plutonium bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.
The ease of plutonium 239 production made it a bulwark of the cold war. The alternate primary fuel for making nuclear weapons, the rare 235 isotope of uranium, had to be wrung from ore in a costly and laborious process.
As civil reactors for nuclear power multiplied in the 1960's and 1970's, they too began to make large amounts of plutonium, their spent fuel containing up to 1 percent of the element as a byproduct. A civil industry to separate it for powering special reactors quickly rose and fell in the United States, its death prompted by fears that the plutonium would eventually be diverted into making nuclear bombs.
In 1977, President Carter announced an end to the civil separation of plutonium. In its place, spent fuel holding the deadly element was to be buried in underground dumps. Congress began a national search for sites in 1982. When this plan collapsed from political opposition, Washington chose a single site in 1987: Yucca Mountain, a heap of volcanic ash in the Nevada desert. If found suitable, it is to open in 2010.
The rest of the world's civil-reactor work tended to press down the separation path, mainly that of recycling the plutonium from spent fuel for use in breeder reactors. Less richly endowed with energy resources than the United States, countries like Japan, Britain, Germany and France saw plutonium burning as an economic bonanza.
But recycled plutonium fell out of favor over the years, except in Japan, as uranium fuel became cheaper. Many countries are still separating some plutonium, however, in case uranium one day grows scarce and costly. And leftover plutonium in nuclear waste is to be buried in underground dumps, as in America.
Today 438 nuclear power reactors are on line around the world, all producing plutonium in greater or lesser amounts. The Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group based in Washington, says the total will grow to about 465 reactors by the end of the century.
The plutonium glut has increased with the end of the cold war and the scrapping of thousands of nuclear weapons. In January 1994, the National Academy of Sciences, which advises the Federal Government, suggested that weapons-grade plutonium be mixed with highly radioactive wastes and buried, or burned in reactors and then buried. In either case, some plutonium would end up going underground.
Debate recently broke out among Federal scientists over whether plutonium beneath Yucca Mountain might eventually erupt in a nuclear explosion, scattering radioactivity into the winds and underground water.
While many experts say the thesis is probably wrong, it is being seriously studied at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, by the Energy Department, and by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has responsibility for licensing the proposed dump.
The main proponent of the theory, Dr. Charles D. Bowman, is one of scores of scientists hunting for new ways to rid the world of surplus plutonium. In his plan, big particle accelerators would, by a kind of nuclear alchemy, transmute radioactive wastes and plutonium into more benign elements before they were buried. Waste heat from the process could spin turbines and produce electricity.
"It's a brilliant way of solving the world's most dangerous problem by transforming a liability into an asset," Dr. Carlo Rubbia, the Italian physicist and Nobel laureate, said at a recent meeting. "It means cleaning up at least part of the mess left over from the cold war."
But perfecting the advanced technology might take 15 years and cost $500 million.
Many other ideas for plutonium disposal involve burning it up in special reactors. General Atomics, a San Diego-based company, has joined with Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy to design a meltdown-proof, gas-cooled reactor that would turn the deadly material into electricity. The $535 million reactor would be built in Russia and fueled at least partly by plutonium from Moscow's huge stockpile of scrapped nuclear arms.
The partners recently pledged $2 million to the project's design, which is expected to employ more than 200 Russian scientists.
"It burns about 12 tons of plutonium in 40 years," Dr. Walter A. Simon, a senior vice preside at General Atomics, said in an interview. "Four modules would burn about 50 tons in 40 years."
But the plan has no backing from the Clinton Administration, which in a policy move decided to abandon all work on reactors that would burn plutonium out of fear they would foster global trade in the deadly substance. In a similar vein, the Administration stopped work at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois on the Integral Fast Reactor, which would have consumed dangerous waste while producing electric power.
Perhaps the least publicly acceptable of all the plutonium proposals is to dump it at sea in missile-like titanium casings that would bury themselves deep into muddy sediments. Although a world moratorium now exists on the ocean dumping of all nuclear waste, the plutonium glut is so great that sub-seabed disposal is again being looked at internationally.
Perhaps the most elegant solution of all would be to pitch excess plutonium into space, firing it into the Sun. But high costs, as well as launching risks, have always conspired to dash such proposals.
Many nuclear experts argue that talk of transmutation and new reactors and exotic solutions only delays work on real disposal, which always seems to come back to permanent burial underground. If dangers of plutonium explosion are found to exist, they say, solutions can also be found.
Dr. Bowman of Los Alamos has suggested making steel canisters smaller and spreading them out over larger areas in underground galleries at Yucca Mountain, expensive steps in a project already expected to cost $15 billion or more. A different precaution would be to dig the deep repository in granite rather than volcanic tuff, lessening the chance that plutonium might eventually migrate into rock and flare up in a nuclear chain reaction.
"You need to dispose of it underground in an irretrievable form," said Mr. Leventhal of the Nuclear Control Institute. "Using reactors to burn it up will take hundreds or thousands of years."
The State of Nevada has seized on the explosion argument to fight the repository project, which it has long and bitterly opposed. And the state has vowed to keep battling it, even if the explosion debate proves groundless or if reasonable solutions to the problem arise. Like many other states and localities, Nevada wants no part of any nuclear dump.
Bucking the trend, the Mescalero Apaches in southern New Mexico voted last Thursday to go ahead with a lucrative plan to store high-level nuclear waste from commercial reactors on their reservation. Some 30 utility companies want to put their mounting piles of spent fuel rods there until a permanent repository is found. But the temporary dump is opposed by the New Mexico Legislature and the state's Congressional delegation, which see it as dangerous.
"Every technically good solution has political sides that are horrible, and every politically good solution tends to be technically shabby," remarked Dr. Makhijani of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research. "Nobody has any good overall solutions to this mess, including us."

Turn waste into a glassy compound and bury it deep underground, in smaller containers, at other sites.
 
Burn plutonium in more efficient reactors.
 
Convert waste into other elements with particle accelerators.
 
Dump waste at sea in missile-like titanium casings that would bury themselves deep in muddy sediments.
 
Fire waste into space.

HEADLINE: Why Do We Watch Those Awards Shows?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Grumbling Gets Louder Over Voting on Grammys" (Arts pages, March 1): For a time it seemed as if every other night television was spawning another award show; it's noticeable that many have since disappeared, but evenings like the Grammys and Tonys evidently still fascinate people or they'd be history. 
 I still don't understand why I sat through more than one evening of Academy Awards, watching inept thank-yous interspersed with forgettable special material, wooden teleprompter banter delivered in an expensively tacky stage set and clips of increasingly interchangeable films -- but I have, and so presumably have you. Why? Especially if we hadn't seen most of the films?
Ignace Paderewski, the Polish pianist-statesman of 60-odd years ago, wrote of his tour crisscrossing America by railroad. More than once a whole small Middle West town's population would come out to wave as Paderewski sped past, but afterward practically no one ever got in a car or on the next train to go to hear him play. The art itself was not so potentially thrilling as the kick that came from waving at somebody famous.
This may be an American thing: I hear that a novel that wins France's Prix Goncourt enjoys better sales, but no similar phenomenon exists in our own publishing world. Which brings up the question: Do these awards mean anything, even economically?
The composer Charles Ives, on receiving a Pulitzer late in life, felt that prizes were for children. Maybe it's our same inner child, the one who enjoyed attending birthday parties even if they weren't for us. (Maybe that is why so much of our popular entertainment is so puerile.)
Maybe if Americans ever did grow up we could abolish awards for the arts industry, as we insist on calling it, and show our appreciation for art by genuinely paying attention. What I would then like to see, if we in our new enlightenment still needed award shows, is something given to the city that got all its potholes filled first, for example. That might be a lot easier to monitor, and everybody would be happy.

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
"I don't care who writes a nation's laws -- or crafts its advanced treaties -- if I can write its economics textbooks." -- Paul Samuelson
N. Gregory Mankiw, a dweeby 37-year-old economics professor who named his dog Keynes, was not counting on getting rich overnight. Most academics, even at Harvard, don't. But a phone call from a Texas publisher changed all that. 
 Professor Mankiw, who doesn't look a lot older than the freshmen and sophomores he teaches, was offered a $1.4 million advance by Harcourt Brace in Fort Worth to write a basic economics textbook. That's about three times as big as any other in the college textbook market and rivals those of all but a few celebrity authors.
 So what's going on? It's a race among once-stodgy textbook publishers to find the next blockbuster economics textbook, a book that will shape the thinking of the 1.5 million college students who sign up for Econ 101 each year. This introductory course is both the first and the last brush that most educated Americans have with supply and demand, marginal cost, comparative advantage and other first principles of the dismal science.
 Such a book is long overdue. For nearly half a century, students have learned the essentials of economics from Paul Samuelson, now almost 80 years old, and a score of his disciples and imitators. But Professor Samuelson's "Economics" and its many clones reflect the mind-set of a post-Depression generation of scholars who thought they understood the economy well enough to tell Washington how to manage the ups and downs of the business cycle.
 Meanwhile, the world has changed. And so has what most economists believe. A new generation of scholars -- while still respectful of John Maynard Keynes, the British thinker who advocated government borrowing to end the Depression -- are far more skeptical of government fine-tuning. They worry more than their teachers about the economic long term and they focus more on how the United States interacts with the world.
 For all the shifts in thinking, though, previous attempts to sell a mold-breaking economics textbook have wound up costing publishers money. Most college students are learning from books that many in the field view as outdated.
 "We're really not teaching basic economics," said Paul Krugman, an economist at Stanford University who is also writing an introductory textbook. "We're not getting it across at all."
That's where the wooing of Professor Mankiw and other economics superstars of the baby-boom generation comes in. These scholars -- some now writing or thinking about it -- include Professor Krugman, John B. Taylor, Michael J. Boskin and Joseph E. Stiglitz, all from Stanford, and Lawrence H. Summers, formerly at Harvard and now Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. (Mr. Summers is the latest winner of the John Bates Clark medal as the best economist under 40 and just happens to be Professor Samuelson's nephew.)
Textbook publishers, like other marketers in mature and overcrowded fields, are placing big bets that these people, who are among the closest in their field to brand names, will sell lots of books.
In the past, ambitious young economists like Professor Mankiw (pronounced Man-CUE) left textbook writing to older or less distinguished colleagues. They concentrated instead on the kind of esoteric research that might win them a Nobel Prize. But now some are jumping at the chance to mold the minds of the next generation of political leaders, executives, image makers and other members of the American elite.
"Every economics editor in the business has been looking for the new Samuelson since the 1970's," said Paul Shensa, executive editor at Worth Publishers in New York.
The new stars are seeking not just fame, but fortune. "Even young people at the forefront of research are taking off time to write textbooks," Professor Mankiw said. "The top three or four textbooks, even the top 10, are profitable, wildly profitable."
"Besides," he added with a smile, "economists are proselytizers."
 
The Role Model
A Superstar For Super Sales
 Only one economics superstar, Professor Samuelson, has transformed a new gospel into a category killer. That was in 1948. His reputation as the most brilliant theorist of his generation secure by the time he was 30, the self-confident Professor Samuelson set about writing a textbook that would, as he put it, awaken students like "the kiss of the prince in 'Sleeping Beauty.' "
Without an advance or, for that matter, any publishing deal at all, he labored for three years while teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to turn the novel ideas of Lord Keynes into breezy prose, crystalline examples and simple diagrams. Samuelson, in all its editions, has sold more than three million copies and followers of his approach have sold several times that
But the feat of combining a big name with big sales has never been repeated. Milton Friedman, the great leader of the conservative anti-Keynesian counterrevolution in the 1970's, never did father a successful introductory textbook to hawk his gospel, known as monetarism. Nor did Robert E. Lucas Jr., another University of Chicago economist, or any of the other instigators of an even more anti-interventionist school of the early 1980's known as "rational expectations."
Instead, introductory economics is still dominated by Samuelson emulators. The Samuelson bible, now in its 14th edition, is heavily outsold these days by clever clones and brightly written knock-offs, from Campbell R. McConnell's best-selling "Economics: Principles, Problems and Policies" to Roger LeRoy Miller's "Economics Today" and "Economics: Principles and Policy," by William J. Baumol and Alan S. Blinder of Princeton. (Mr. Blinder is now vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.)
Indeed, as a 1990 study by two economists, William Walstad and Michael Watts, found, all the successful textbooks are remarkably similar in content.
 
The Market
Blockbusters Are Dominant
 The market for introductory economics textbooks, which most publishers peg at $50 million a year, is a lot like the movie business. Thirty to 40 books are typically on the market, but only a handful of blockbusters, selling more than 50,000 copies a year at around $55 each, provide a feast of regular profits, leaving crumbs for everybody else.
Given the chance to hit it big, some outstanding economists -- like movie actors, ballplayers and novelists -- have figured out that they are worth much more in the new superstar market. "Economists are like bassets and beagles," Professor Samuelson said at the weekly departmental lunch at M.I.T. the other day. "They've got no loyalty and they're insatiable."
Before the late 1980's, textbook editors tried to build long-term relationships with authors. Take W.W. Norton & Company's deal with Mr. Stiglitz, the 52-year-old Stanford economist now on President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. Deemed by many the leading all-around theorist, he is certainly one of the most prolific economists. The human equivalent of a multi-tasking Windows software program, he has made major contributions in a dozen or more fields of economics.
In 1986, Mr. Stiglitz signed for a $350,000 advance, a record at the time. Still, it was well within academic tradition, with Mr. Stiglitz making a deal with Norton, the publisher of his earlier public finance book, after its top editors convinced him that they shared his vision of the book he planned to write. It was not that far from Professor Samuelson's decision to choose McGraw-Hill after the publishing company bought the collected papers of his beloved teacher, Joseph A. Schumpeter.
But in 1987, the staid world of academic publishing was jolted by the heretical concept of a bidding war. Two professors, Andrew Abel of the University of Pennsylvania and Ben Bernanke of Princeton, sent what they called a prospectus to eight publishers.
The auction worked brilliantly, from the authors' point of view. It set a new floor of $250,000, which has since escalated to $400,000 to $500,000, for the much smaller intermediate-level textbook market.
Enter Mr. Mankiw, who kept a close eye on such goings on. The son of a northern New Jersey engineer and a hairdresser turned vocational teacher, Mr. Mankiw grew up sailing, raising ducks and collecting campaign buttons. He turned first to economics at Princeton, then law at Harvard and finally earned his Ph.D. in economics at M.I.T. Granted tenure by Harvard at the unusually young age of 29, he won notice not only with his original research but also by publishing a promising, vividly written intermediate textbook.
Scott Stratford, then at McGraw-Hill, began the bidding war for Professor Mankiw's principles text. He offered what he thought was a staggering advance -- $1 million. But Professor Mankiw didn't even blink. "That little money-grubber started shopping the deal," said John Greenman, the longtime economics editor at HarperCollins, which found the price too rarefied to bid.
According to several people familiar with the negotiations, Professor Mankiw's own publisher, Worth, promptly matched McGraw-Hill's offer. Then Harcourt Brace jumped in, offering what amounted to a $400,000 signing bonus on top of the $1 million, plus a 22 percent royalty arrangement. The deal was sealed in December 1992.
"There was no relationship, just money," said Mr. Shensa, Professor Mankiw's previous editor at Worth.
Developing a new economic textbook is an expensive, time-consuming process, but it is also by far the most lucrative part of the textbook publishing business. Still, the landscape is littered with some big-name failures. For instance, the 1,000-page tome by Stanley Fischer and Rudiger Dornbusch of M.I.T., two prominent macroeconomists, sank like so much concrete in the Charles River.
The Stiglitz textbook may be the biggest disappointment of all. While W. Drake McFeely, president of Norton, says the book has sold 60,000 copies, other publishers contend the true figure is closer to 30,000, well below the industry break-even of about 45,000 copies.
In contrast to the 1950's and early 1960's, when the profession wholeheartedly embraced Keynesian economics, there is no consensus today. "Samuelson may be publishing's Holy Grail," said Bruce Kaplan, a senior editor at HarperCollins, "but there can't be a next Samuelson yet because there's no new Keynes. There's just not enough unanimity on a new set of principles."
But that is not stopping publishers from trying to find another Holy Grail.
 
The Holy Grail
Many Have Tried, Many Have Failed
 One hope for publishing stardom is Professor Krugman, 42, the Wunderkind of international economics who recently moved from M.I.T. to Stanford. In 1993, Professor Krugman accepted an advance of half a million dollars from Worth, turning down much bigger offers from competitors because he wanted the freedom not to aim at the biggest possible audience. Nonetheless, he has some established authors worried.
Professor McConnell of the University of Nebraska, whose introductory text is the current best seller, said: "Krugman is an excellent writer. He has strong opinions. If he can keep those out of the way, he could be trouble. I hate these new hotshots coming down the pike."
Some of the hotshots -- like Professor Boskin, who has returned to Stanford after a stint as President George Bush's chief economic adviser, and Mr. Summers -- have only flirted with completing a textbook. And Professor Taylor's new book, while likely to do reasonably well, is not expected to be a barn burner.
That leaves the field open, at least for now, for Professor Mankiw. Cleverly, he expresses relatively modest ambitions for his book's impact. "These things are evolutionary," he said, "not revolutionary."
His boldest thought, perhaps, is to keep it short. He promises to write no more than 650 pages -- close to the original Samuelson length -- rather than let it grow to the 900 to 1,000 pages now standard.
And even though Professor Mankiw shares a number of ideas with the Samuelson emulators, such as the belief that prices and wages do not adjust instantly to changing conditions, he still plans to adopt the more skeptical attitude toward government that pervades modern economics. Earlier scholars, for instance, wrote proudly of the advantages of government borrowing to pull an economy out of recession. But Professor Mankiw will emphasize that deficit spending, while sometimes necessary, can also create significant long-term problems by sapping the savings needed for future investment and productivity growth.
Professor Mankiw's new status as a millionaire has not gone to his head. He still lives in the same comfortable, typically academic house he and his wife, Deborah, have shared for years in the Boston suburb of Wellesley. He is not planning to replace his beat-up 1988 Toyota anytime soon.
And he continues to maintain his quota of two cleanly written pages a day, having already turned in 700 pages. The book should be in classrooms by the fall of 1997.
"He's the best risk for the money," said Mr. Kaplan of HarperCollins. "When I first heard it, I thought Harcourt was crazy. But in the past year I've come to think that the book has a good chance of success."

Tokyo Trade Surplus Up 5.3% in February

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus rose 5.3 percent in February from a year earlier, officials said yesterday, with export volume resuming somewhat as Japanese learned to cope with the effects of Jan. 17 earthquake that halted operations at the port of Kobe.
The increase in the surplus, to $11.46 billion, marked a reversal from January, when the imbalance fell 52.3 percent, in part because no goods could leave the devastated port after the quake. In February, Japanese goods were sent to other ports for shipment. 
 Despite February's increase, economists and Finance Ministry officials said the trade surplus was expected to decline in the long run because consumers were buying less expensive imports. The strong yen makes imports to Japan less expensive in terms of the local currency.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose 13 percent in February, to $4.89 billion.

HEADLINE: Salinas, in New York, Denies Being Asked to Quit Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the former President of Mexico who was said to have been forced into virtual exile over the weekend by his successor, popped up on Manhattan's East Side yesterday, eager to dismiss that version of events.
"Can I return to Mexico?" Mr. Salinas said in an interview. "At any moment! Yes!" He paused, then added, "But I don't have plans now to do so." 
 Mr. Salinas phoned The New York Times yesterday, and in a subsequent interview quibbled with the portrait that has been painted of him in Mexico, as a man virtually without a country, asked to leave his homeland by President Ernesto Zedillo, who succeeded him on Dec. 1.
Senior aides to Mr. Zedillo, speaking on condition that they not be identified, have given that version of events since Sunday, after Mr. Salinas boarded a private jet on Friday and flew to Texas and on to New York City the same day. Mr. Salinas had broken a political taboo by quarreling publicly with his successor over who was to blame for the collapse of Mexico's currency and had become a source of concern to the Government after his angry response to the arrest of his brother on murder charges.
In an interview in the elegant five-story brownstone building on East 72d Street that is the official residence of Mexico's representative to the United Nations, Mr. Salinas declined to speak for the record about his country's economic and political crises, saying he feared his comments would undermine what little stability Mr. Zedillo has been able to restore.
"The situation in Mexico is delicate," he said. "It's important not to disturb that."
Because he spoke guardedly, and at times enigmatically, his current status remained a bit of a mystery. But he outlined his immediate intentions in broad strokes, saying he plans to travel indefinitely, contemplating his future role and engaging in "small private dialogues that I've been invited to."
"You could call them speeches," he added.
"I have plans to continue traveling here in the U.S. and abroad, most probably abroad," Mr. Salinas said. "My children continue in school in Mexico City, and my wife is with them."
Dressed in a formal blue double-breasted suit and wingtip shoes, Mr. Salinas appeared relaxed and affable. He spoke in English from the depths of an easy chair, sipping herb tea.
The setting for the interview did little to clarify Mr. Salinas's status.
He said it was only coincidence that he was meeting with reporters in a Mexican Government residence, since he had been having lunch there with an old friend, Manuel Tello, formerly Mr. Salinas's Foreign Minister and now the Mexican delegate to the United Nations
Mr. Tello withdrew from the room for the duration of the interview.
Asked as he ushered the reporters from his home whether Mr. Zedillo was aware that Mr. Salinas was using the official Mexican residence to meet reporters, Mr. Tello said, "He knows he's here."
Mr. Salinas, 46, left office as a highly respected world leader, but has reacted erratically since the Mexican economic crisis that began three weeks later and the arrest of his brother on murder charges last month. He began and then hurriedly ended a hunger strike -- a fast, he preferred to call it -- after he was widely criticized in the country. He demanded that the Zedillo Government exonerate him of any responsibility for its economic woes and for alleged tampering with the investigation into another political slaying last year.
"This has been a difficult 90 days," he said. "A former President of Mexico has to adjust to a different way of life. You have so many duties and responsibilities that end sharply. And that's it."
In an interview in Mexico City on Monday, Mr. Zedillo was asked if there was truth to statements by his senior aides that he sent an intermediary on March 7 to ask Mr. Salinas to leave Mexico.
"No, no," Mr. Zedillo responded, smiling. He said Mr. Salinas's only direct contact with the Government had been with the Agrarian Reform Minister, Arturo Warman, who spoke to Mr. Salinas during the hunger strike. And Mr. Zedillo added: "I know that many people went to him and gave him a lot of advice. I don't know if some of them thought they were going on my behalf or whatever."
Mr. Zedillo was asked, "For the record, you didn't ask him to go?"
"No," he replied.
"But there are people in this building who say you did," a reporter said.
"I don't know," Mr. Zedillo responded. He was still smiling.
A senior Mexican official also said on Monday: "Of course he was told to go. He was inevitably going to be making noise here."
Mr. Salinas declined to speculate about why aides to Mr. Zedillo would be spreading a story he says is false about his having been asked to leave the country. Asked if he was perplexed by this portrait of him as an exile, he screwed up his face into a look of mock puzzlement.
"Do I look perplexed?" he asked.

HEADLINE: HOUSE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS TAX CUT

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
The House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill today to reduce taxes by almost $200 billion over the next five years, a cornerstone of the Republicans' Contract With America.
But the action was tempered by the first signs of trouble in the Republicans' promise to cut spending to compensate for the loss of tax money. Party leaders had to concede that they were hard pressed to win support for even a modest first round of spending reductions. 
 Republicans have asserted that they will pay for the tax cuts with equivalent cuts in spending so that the deficit will not be worsened, but they have not specified how they will do so.
Opposition to the spending cuts, contained in separate legislation, began to jell as lawmakers realized how their own districts would be affected. The Republicans' problem was compounded by a controversy over abortion, one of the most divisive issues within the party.
The main elements of the tax legislation are a tax reduction of $500 per child for all families except the richest and the poorest, a lower capital gains tax, a tax cut for working couples and several tax breaks for businesses.
Approved by the committee on a party-line vote, the tax bill is almost certain to pass the House intact this spring. But its prospects are in doubt because of strong opposition at the White House and the determination of many senators from both parties to deal with deficit reduction before tax cuts.
Democrats on the committee originally planned to string out consideration of the tax measure by offering dozens of amendments, even though they knew they would fall to the Republican majority.
But today the Democrats saw that Republican leaders were having trouble rounding up votes in their own party for the spending cuts. So the Democrats dropped the tax amendments and let the bill win committee approval before the House began debate on the spending measure on Wednesday. "We wanted to make them face up to where the money was going to come from," said Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington.
For months, Republican leaders have promised to balance the budget by paring Government spending to the bone. The first round was supposed to be a $17 billion cut in programs for the current fiscal year.
These rescissions, in budget terminology, were approved two weeks ago by the House Appropriations Committee. They would fall heaviest on social programs for the poor, including spending for subsidized housing, summer jobs programs for poor teen-agers and helping the elderly pay heating bills. Other aspects would cut money for President Clinton's national service initiative, education programs, AIDS research and public broadcasting.
Fueling the furor over this bill was a proposed amendment to let states deny financing for abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest. Many moderate Republicans were angered by this proposal, which would apply to the Medicaid program for the poor, and they sought to have it stricken.
This afternoon, they said their party's leadership was unresponsive. "This is absolutely unacceptable," said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut. "I will not support it, and there's a lot of Republicans who feel the way I do."
But tonight, to insure the votes of moderate Republicans like Mrs. Johnson, the leadership used its authority to prevent the abortion amendment from being offered.
The sponsor of the amendment, Representative Ernest Jim Istook Jr., Republican of Oklahoma, said, "A small group of Republicans saw that they had a lot of leverage."
The possible defection of Republican moderates meant that party leaders were scrambling to piece together a majority with the votes of conservative Democrats. It also raised the friction level between moderates and conservatives just as the party headed into the most difficult parts of its agenda.
"This is going to be a very demanding bill," Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded today.
Representative Robert L. Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, pleaded with his colleagues not to break ranks the first time they considered trimming Government.
"Republicans are going to have to ask themselves, do they want to fulfill the contract?" he said at a news conference. "We either fulfill the contract beginning with this bill or we punt and tell the American people we were only kidding them."
Trying to blunt the argument that the bill would cut programs for the poor to pay for tax cuts for those better off, Mr. Gingrich promised today that the spending bill would be amended to include what he called "a lockbox provision" stipulating that none of the spending reductions would be used to offset tax cuts.
That will amount to a bit of budgetary fiction, since the Government's money is not compartmentalized. But Mr. Gingrich seemed to hope that this might give lawmakers the cover they needed to vote for unpopular spending cuts.
Mr. Gingrich continued to argue that the tax bill was to his party's political advantage. "It draws the clear distinction," he declared, "between those of us who believe that we ought to leave the money with the parents so they can pay directly for their children, and the liberals who believe that we ought to make sure we take the money away in taxes so we can then hire a bureaucrat to do for the children what their parents can't do because they don't have the after-tax income."
But the Democrats felt they won the political argument today by standing on the side of deficit reduction and by drawing attention to the extent to which the wealthy would benefit from tax cuts and the poor would be hurt by new limits on spending. The tax bill approved by the committee today would cost $189 billion in lost revenue over the next five years and another $500 billion from 2001 through 2005, according to Treasury Department calculations.
During the committee debate, the Democrats hammered the point that the richest 1 percent of taxpayers -- those with annual incomes over about $200,000 -- would get 20 percent of the tax breaks in the bill. They also complained that a mother working full time at the minimum wage would get no benefit from the $500 per child tax credit.
Republicans responded that the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers paid more than one-fifth of the income taxes, so it was only fair that they got one-fifth of the cuts.
As for poor families not benefiting, Republicans said that this was a tax cut -- not a welfare -- bill, and that people should get an income tax cut only to the extent that they paid income taxes at all. (A single mother with two children earning, say, $20,000 a year would not owe $1,000 in income taxes and thus could not take full advantage of the credit.)
The tax bill closely follows the Republicans' campaign Contract With America. Following are other main elements of the bill:
*A reduction of the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent from 28 percent, and adjustments in some capital gains to offset the effect of inflation.
*A repeal of the alternative minimum tax for businesses, an item in the tax code meant to insure that profitable companies with large write-offs still pay some taxes.
*A new retirement savings account that would allow penalty-free withdrawals for buying a home and some other specific purposes.
*A tax cut of up to $145 for working couples to reduce the additional taxes sometimes owed when two single workers marry.
*Tax breaks for adoption expenses, life insurance distributions to the terminally ill and longterm-care insurance.
*An increase to $30,000 from $11,500 in what people from age 65 through 69 could earn without having their Social Security payments reduced, and a repeal of the higher taxes that were enacted in 1993 on the Social Security benefits of middle- and upper-income retirees.
*More favorable depreciation rules for businesses with capital investments.
*Lower estate and gift taxes.
If all goes according to the Republican plans, the House will vote on the tax bill by April 8.

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Asks U.N. to Do More for Women

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 14

 BODY:
Today, for the second time in a week, Hillary Rodham Clinton came to speak to a United Nations gathering, this time about the condition of women's lives within this organization as much as in the world at large.
But this time, invoking the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt, who was a delegate to the General Assembly, Mrs. Clinton offered the most spirited American defense of the United Nations that this gloomy headquarters has heard from Washington in a long time. Today's conference, "Women and the United Nations," was dedicated to Mrs. Roosevelt's memory. 
 At a time, Mrs. Clinton said, "when full economic, social and political opportunities for women too often remain an elusive goal, we should commend the United Nations for inviting serious discussion of the unique obstacles confronting women in every country, rich and poor."
Mrs. Clinton, who last week spoke at a United Nations conference on world poverty in Copenhagen, leaves next week for a solo trip to South Asia.
There she wants to see projects like the Grameen Bank, which loans money to rural women without collateral in Bangladesh, and other self-help organizations for women in business and crafts. She will also make at least two substantive speeches on social topics, in Pakistan and India, where women face many impediments and traditional prejudices. Sri Lanka and Nepal are also being considered as stops.
In the summer, she will be the honorary chairman of a delegation planning American strategy for the fourth international conference on women, to be held in Beijing in September. Her staff said it is too soon to say whether she will go to Beijing.
The World Summit for Social Development last week made an impression on her, Mrs. Clinton said today.
"I and many others came away from Copenhagen convinced that we must work harder for ways to open opportunities for women," she said. Her overwhelmingly female audience today applauded when she added that United Nations headquarters, where only 15 percent of the officials are women, needed to improve its record.
Mrs. Clinton also drew laughs from the enthusiastic crowd in the Trusteeship Council chamber when she recalled how Mrs. Roosevelt, noting an "obsession with rule-making" among her male peers, would show her displeasure and impatience by knitting in General Assembly sessions.
Mrs. Clinton is not the first President's wife to venture alone into an international arena. Jacqueline Kennedy made a number of trips abroad, also including one to India while her husband was President. Rosalyn Carter still travels with former President Jimmy Carter on his troubleshooting missions from North Korea to Haiti, sometimes in an active advisory role.
At a time when the United Nations is under fire on Capitol Hill, Mrs. Clinton came to the defense of the series of international conferences the organization has been holding, from the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 through Copenhagen.
"With Beijing on the horizon, issues historically dismissed as unimportant may now be understood in a larger context," she said.
"The United Nations must play a leadership role, and must play a role by example," she said. "Every program, policy and decision that emanates from this building directly or indirectly affects women, as they raise their children, manage households or work at their jobs."

HEADLINE: Broad Group Visits President On Affirmative Action's Future

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
Hoping for help in defusing a political bomb, President Clinton summoned a bipartisan, interracial group of civil rights leaders and academics to the White House on Monday night, part of the Administration's review of Federal affirmative action programs in the face of Republican demands to scale them back.
In a freewheeling four-and-one-half-hour discussion over dinner in the Green Room, Mr. Clinton sought the advice of about two dozen people with experience on the topic, from the retired Federal appeals judge A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. to the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president emeritus of the University of Notre Dame, to Elliot L. Richardson, an Attorney General in the Nixon Administration. Participants said the President had suggested that he feared that Republicans would use the issue to splinter the country in next year's elections. 
 Since the midterm elections, Republicans have vowed to roll back race- and sex-based preferences in employment and contracting, and to make the subject a major issue in the 1996 Presidential campaign.
"He said his concern was this issue has legs, and how do you convince people who are sort of the white working class that this issue doesn't hurt them," one guest said of the President today, speaking on condition of anonymity. "He said that's the dilemma he faced, and that much of it is driven by the general economic insecurity of the country."
Participants said the President had mostly listened as guests at three round tables stood by turns, some urging him to concentrate on saving programs benefiting blacks, others urging him to focus on programs for women, and still others pleading with him not to pare affirmative action at all.
Senior White House officials described the dinner as private and declined all comment on it. Other participants included Ray Marshall, who was Secretary of Labor in the Carter Administration; Mary Frances Berry, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania; Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, and George Stephanopoulos, senior Presidential adviser.
Mr. Clinton commissioned the Administration's review of Federal affirmative action programs last month, in hope of finding a "third way" between defending the status quo and abolishing all race- and sex-based preferences. But already the review itself looms as a political third rail. Dinner guests said the President had mentioned that he wanted to give a speech on the topic, and last week White House aides suggested that he would make one soon, but they remain unsure just what he should say.
Mr. Clinton has said he wants to retain some preferences where needed to rectify past discrimination, while stressing broader economic assistance programs that benefit needy people regardless of race.
Yet Democrats including prominent blacks like the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the California Assembly Speaker, Willie L. Brown Jr., have warned the White House that Mr. Clinton risks grave peril with his electoral base of core Democrats if he is seen as retreating on the issue. The President's pollster, Stanley B. Greenberg, caused a minor stir last week for merely suggesting that the Democrats' electoral future lay with appealing more broadly to working Americans instead of defending preferences for some groups.
After arriving at the White House with a delegation of California state officials, Mr. Brown met with the President for about half an hour today. Mr. Jackson went to see the President last week. Aides said today that Mr. Clinton planned to consult widely with members of Congress, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus, but was still reviewing just how such meetings should be organized.
Representative Donald M. Payne of New Jersey, the chairman of the Black Caucus, said he was to meet with the President on Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, a coalition of women's and civil rights groups, including the National Organization for Women and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, is to march to the White House for a meeting with senior officials.
"We soundly reject the divisive and polarizing tactics of our opponents," one of the coalition's organizers, Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, said in a statement. "We are putting elected officials on notice that we will not tolerate sacrificing affirmative action for political expediency."
The Monday dinner was the latest in a series of discussions that top-ranking Administration officials have held on the topic. Vice President Al Gore, who attended the session, has separately held a series of dinners in recent weeks to discuss race relations generally with some of the same people, his aides said.
Participants said the White House session had begun with presentations by Charles Moskos, a military sociologist at Northwestern University, on the armed services' record with affirmative action, and by William Julius Wilson, a University of Chicago sociologist, on the need for economic development to counter high unemployment among black men.
Professor Moskos, who declined to elaborate on other participants' remarks, said he had suggested that by investing in recruitment and special training, the private sector could benefit from the military's example. He said that affirmative action programs had done much to improve morale in the military during the last decade and that the key was the military's aggressive efforts to train all recruits to high standards, then offer extra help to those who needed it.
"One of the points I tried to make was that a level playing field was not enough," Mr. Moskos said. "What drives affirmative action problems is the dearth of qualified minority candidates. What the Army has is a series of uplift and educational programs to bring everybody up to standard." That, together with a heavy concentration of blacks among the ranks, makes the Army "the only place in the world where whites are routinely bossed around by blacks," largely without resentment, he said.

HEADLINE: Investigator Seeks Control of Javits Center Hiring

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
A special investigator is seeking court permission to take control of hiring for the lucrative carpenters' jobs at the Jacobs K. Javits Convention Center and accusing the president of the carpenters' union of allowing organized crime to persist at the center.
Kenneth Conboy, the investigator appointed by a Federal judge to monitor the 30,000-member New York District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, charged in a report yesterday that the union's president, Frederick W. Devine, had ignored a court order that requires him to stop the awarding of jobs to mob-connected union members and make them available to all members. 
 The report said Mr. Devine, who represents union members from southern New Jersey to Albany, was violating a consent decree issued last year to settle civil racketeering charges brought against the union. At that time, Mr. Conboy, a former Federal judge, was appointed to investigate and monitor activities of the union.
For the second time in recent months, Mr. Conboy submitted evidence linking the union's chief at the Javits Center, Anthony D. Fiorino, to organized crime. Mr. Fiorino is in charge of hiring carpenters to assemble and tear down exhibits at the center, the city's primary trade show venue. In administrative charges filed in December, Mr. Conboy said that Mr. Fiorino gave trade center jobs only to people in a special pool of about 100, many of them attached to the mob. Yesterday's filing includes sworn statements from admitted members of crime families identifying Mr. Fiorino as an associate of the Genovese crime family.
Mr. Devine, president of the union since 1991, appointed Mr. Fiorino last April to serve as steward at the Javits Center, a post that pays more than $100,000. Mr. Conboy charged yesterday that by refusing to dismiss Mr. Fiorino, Mr. Devine was in effect aiding criminal activity at the center.
In yesterday's report filed with the court, a copy of which was sent to Mr. Devine's Manhattan office, Mr. Conboy demanded the immediate dismissal of Mr. Fiorino. And in an open letter to rank-and-file members, Mr. Conboy said the union's job referral system "facilitates racketeering control of the center by the Genovese organized crime family."
"We have learned through law enforcement sources, and by taking depositions of over 30 of these favored 'carpenters,' that a large number of these 'pool list' members have some connection to organized crime," Mr. Conboy wrote.
Neither Mr. Devine or Mr. Fiorino could be reached for comment. Phone calls to Bernard Cohen, the labor union's general counsel, were not returned.
Mr. Conboy's request to take control of the hiring of carpenters for the Javits Center will be considered by Judge Charles S. Haight of Federal District Court, who approved last year's settlement between the union and the Justice Department.
Trade show exhibitors have long complained about shakedowns and excessive labor costs in dealing with carpenters and other unions at the state-run convention center.
Carpenters union members who were on the Javits Center preferred list made far more than those who were not, Mr. Conboy said. According to his report, for the first seven months of 1994, employees on the list earned median wages of about $25,000, while union members who were not on the list and did not have steady work earned a median total of about $510 for the same period.
Mr. Conboy's report came a week after another independent report charged that the Teamsters local at the center -- which has been plagued by allegations of corruption since it opened in 1986 -- was also tainted by organized crime.
By the end of last week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani publicly requested that the center be turned over to the city, and Gov. George E. Pataki then raised the ante, threatening to shut the center down and demanding the immediate resignation of its 13-member governing board. At the same time, the State Senate announced investigative hearings.
"It's obvious to the Governor's people that they are taking over a hot potato," said Fabian Palomino, who resigned in January from his post as president and chief executive officer of the center. Governor Pataki, he said, "has to act because he sees the Mayor, and the Mayor sincerely believes that he can do a better job than anyone else."
City planners and private developers in recent months have lobbied government officials, urging them to focus on tourism as a means of economic development. A vibrant Javits Center, free of crime and exorbitant costs, would help create jobs and growth throughout the city, they assert. At a conference on the city's economy last month, Jonathan M. Tisch, president and chief executive officer of Loews Hotels, appealed to the public officials and private executives in attendance. "The most important issue is what do we do with the Javits Center," he said.
A civil hearing for Mr. Fiorino is scheduled for Monday. Mr. Conboy will act as a prosecutor, and the charges will be heard by a three-member panel, named by Judge Haight. The most severe penalty the panel can impose is the expulsion of Mr. Fiorino from the union. An expulsion by the panel can be appealed to Judge Haight.
Even with the imminent hearing date, Mr. Conboy is indicating that he may take similar action against Mr. Devine. In a letter sent to Mr. Devine yesterday, the investigator threatened, "If you continue to fail to act against Mr. Fiorino, I will be compelled to proceed against you for breaching your fiduciary duty to the union."

HEADLINE: OIL CONCERN ENDS A DEAL WITH IRAN AS PRESIDENT ACTS

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
A big American oil company said today that it would not proceed with its agreement to develop two large offshore oilfields for Iran after the White House announced that President Clinton would issue a directive barring all such transactions.
The step by Conoco Inc. ended an energy deal that would have been the first involving Iran and the United States since Washington severed relations with Teheran in 1980. It came after eight days of debate within the Administration about how and whether to block an agreement that top deputies to Mr. Clinton acknowledged was legal but said could undermine American efforts to isolate Iran. 
 In announcing Mr. Clinton's decision this morning to block such oil-development agreements, the White House said the President was trying to set an example for American allies and was also trying to prevent Iran from accumulating wealth that could make it more dangerous to its neighbors.
"We need to send a clear and unequivocal message," Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said. "There cannot be normal relations until Iran's unacceptable behavior changes."
One reason, perhaps, that Conoco misjudged the suitability of its Iranian deal was that the Administration had been sending American business a clear message: Join the age of "economic engagement," by helping the United States win over governments through greater access to American capital and investment. That was the case in China, North Korea and Vietnam. But in pursuing a policy of economic containment in Iran, one Administration official said, "We draw the line in countries with policies that are beyond the pale." [News analysis, page D5.]
The Administration was surprised by the deal between Conoco and Iran, which some analysts valued at $1 billion, and its initial complaints were dismissed by the company, a Houston-based subsidiary of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. Conoco emphasized that it was operating within the law.
But after senior Administration officials objected strongly in meetings with top Conoco executives, the company's chief executive, Constantine Nicandros, indicated that he would end the controversial deal if the President made clear that it violated United States policy, aides to Mr. Clinton said today.
At the same time, three powerful members of the Du Pont board, members of the Bronfman family, had been expected to vote against the accord, and a statement issued by Conoco today suggested that their opposition played an important role in the company's decision. Edgar M. Bronfman, Charles R. Bronfman and Edgar Bronfman Jr. are top officers of the Seagram Company, which owns 24.2 percent of Du Pont. They are also active in Jewish organizations that support the Administration's policy on Iran.
"Conoco's agreement with the National Iranian Oil Company was contingent on Du Pont board approval," the company said. "Du Pont's board of directors' approval would not be given if the U.S. Government opposed the agreement."
In prohibiting Americans from developing oil and gas for Iran, the White House said that Mr. Clinton was using the authority given to him under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows him to block commerce for national security reasons.
Even under Mr. Clinton's directive, American companies would still be permitted to buy oil from Iran and to resell it to third countries, a practice that accounts for one-fourth of the oil sold by Iran. The White House said that it was reviewing whether to close those and other exceptions to its policy of isolating Iran, which is being criticized as too weak by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, and by others on Capitol Hill.
But Administration officials said that by blocking the Conoco deal the Administration had taken an important step. They said that to allow the agreement to stand would have invited Russia, China and the European allies to proceed with nuclear and commercial accords with Iran that the Administration was determined to prevent.
To allow Conoco to develop the vast oilfields in the Persian Gulf, Mr. McCurry said, would have "dangerously added to the Iranian capacity to do the things that we regard as most dangerous in the international community."
As examples, the White House pointed specifically today to what it said was the continued support of terrorism by Iran, its efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process and its quest to obtain weapons of mass destruction.
But in shaping a decision on the proposed oil deal, Administration officials said they wanted most immediately to send a signal to Russia, which the United States is trying to persuade to break off an agreement to complete construction of two nuclear reactors for Iran. The Administration has said the deal could help Iran build nuclear weapons, and officials said today that they hoped Moscow would see an example in American forbearance.
"We're giving up something for a greater good," one Administration official said of Mr. Clinton's decision to block an accord that could have produced millions of dollars in revenues for an American company. "We're hoping that others will be willing to do the same."
Under the deal, Conoco Iran N.V., a Netherlands-based affiliate of Conoco, was to have been the contractor to develop two offshore fields close to Sirri Island in the Persian Gulf about 80 miles from Iran. A Conoco spokesman had said that the two fields were expected to produce more than 120,000 barrels a day in two years.
Among the European oil companies that competed with Conoco for the project were Elf Aquitaine S.A. and Total, both of France. Administration officials said today that they hoped that France would prevent those companies from taking part in the deal, but indicated they were not optimistic that Paris would agree.
Even the White House was initially tepid in its criticism of the Conoco agreement, saying as it became public last week that the accord "was not a helpful development." But the Administration's stance grew harder in large part at the urging of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who has led the Administration's drive to isolate Iran and who criticized the oil deal from the Middle East last week as "inconsistent with the containment policy that we have carried forward."
Mr. Christopher later withdrew from policy discussions about the oil deal because his former law firm represented Conoco. But Administration officials said today that a group including Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser; Bill White, the Deputy Energy Secretary, and Peter Tarnoff, an Under Secretary of State, had worked intensively in recent days to settle on the course that Mr. Clinton embraced today.
A senior Administration official said that Mr. White raised strong objections to the deal in a preliminary meeting with senior Conoco executives last Thursday, and that both he and Mr. Tarnoff repeated those objections the next day in discussions here with Mr. Nicandros of Conoco.
After Conoco released its statement today, the company's chief spokesman did not return a telephone call to his Houston office. But Mr. White said in an interview that Mr. Nicandros had indicated with some reluctance even on Friday that the company would not resist if the Administration scuttled the deal.
Mr. White said that Mr. Nicandros told him in response to a question that Conoco "would be willing to comply with a clear Administration policy."

HEADLINE: February Retail Sales Had Surprising Slide

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
The Government reported today that retail sales fell five-tenths of 1 percent in February, a surprising decline that was the first in almost a year.
"Consumers are keeping their wallets shut," said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch. "The retail sales report provides more evidence to support our view that the economy is slowing significantly." 
 Indeed, almost every category of merchant suffered, from car dealerships and furniture stores to grocery and department stores, the Commerce Department found.
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the economy -- with half of the money pushed across retail counters and the other half going for items like car insurance, rent and dental bills. Business and government spend the remaining one-third.
The drop in retail sales appears to make it even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its March 28 policy meeting. The Fed has been raising interest rates for more than a year to keep inflation in check. But each fresh sign of slackening from the economy's rapid 4 percent growth last year provides more evidence for most economists that the rate increase on Feb. 1 was the last for a while.
The central bank will be "very reluctant" to move in the current climate, contended Paul L. Kasriel, economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Yet some analysts were skeptical about the report of lower retail sales, which they said might reflect little more than new anti-fraud procedures at the Internal Revenue Service that have delayed tax refunds and sharply curtailed loans using expected refunds as collateral.
"There's a $6 billion shortfall" of refund money so far this year, said Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson Associates, a consultant on the bond market. Over all, Mr. Crandall said about $2 billion of retail sales was lost last month, roughly the difference between the reported February decline and a gain of that size, which most analysts expected.
Mr. Crandall predicted a moderate sales rise in March and a strong rebound in April.
Darwin L. Beck, economist at CS First Boston, agreed that slower tax refunds were a factor last month. "Consumer spending probably has slowed somewhat," Mr. Beck said, "but I'm not sure the economy will drift down to that magic 2.5 percent that the Federal Reserve seems to want."
Another reason for minimizing the February decline was that sales for January were revised upward to show a six-tenths of 1 percent advance instead of the two-tenths of 1 percent rise initially reported.
Still, lower sales were a widespread reality for merchants last month as durable goods, which have not advanced since November, fell six-tenths of 1 percent, while sales of nondurables skidded into decline after posting steady increases since last May.
"Seven interest rate hikes in a year were bound to have an effect sooner or later," said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, the largest industry trade group. "Increased payments for adjustable-rate mortgages and credit cards have sapped consumers' discretionary income."
Automotive dealers experienced a 1 percent sales decline last month while sales of furniture and other equipment for the home slumped 1.2 percent. Stores selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes took in five-tenths of 1 percent less money.
Among nondurables, sales were down 1.1 percent at stores selling general merchandise, 1.2 percent for apparel and accessory stores, six-tenths of 1 percent for food stores, four-tenths of 1 percent at drugstores and two-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars. The only increase was that for gasoline service stations, one-tenth of 1 percent.
Total sales last month were $192.85 billion, or 6 percent above the February 1994 level, with no adjustment for inflation. Sales for December through February were 7.1 percent ahead of the period a year earlier, the Commerce Department's report also showed.

HEADLINE: Weak Retail Sales Cheer Markets, Sending Stocks Up

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
It was a surprisingly good day on Wall Street yesterday, although the dollar remained under pressure.
The spark came from the new report on retail sales, which declined in February for the first time in almost a year. The five-tenths of 1 percent drop signaled that the economy might be slowing, thus encouraging traders and investors into believing that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates soon. [Page D2.] 
 Stock traders bid prices up to record levels. Bond traders sent prices up for a fifth consecutive session, as the yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 7.36 percent, its lowest since June 2. But the dollar rose only slightly against both the Japanese yen and the German mark, as rumors that could hurt the dollar continued to circulate among currency traders.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed to a record 4,048.75, up 23.52 points, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also hit a record 492.89, up 2.84 points.
The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, tracking the performance of 4,930 companies, gave the strongest performance, closing at a record 808.24, up 5.93 points -- at last surging past its March 1994 record of 803.93.
On the New York Stock Exchange, almost two stocks advanced for every one that declined. New highs were set for 105 stocks and new lows for only 25. Volume was heavy at 346.2 million shares.
The dollar affects the stock and bond markets because a declining dollar lowers the value of stocks and bonds for foreign investors, who are an increasingly important source of investment capital.
In the first week of March, the dollar plunged more than 6 percent against the German mark. But since then it has gained back about half of its value, or three percent. But the dollar continues to be down about 6 percent against the yen.
Yesterday, the dollar closed at 90.85 yen, up from 90.75 yen, and ended at 1.4140 German marks, up from 1.4067 marks.
Currency traders said the dollar may be rising for short-term speculative reasons rather than any permanent strengthening.
For example, there were rumors that the Bundesbank, the German counterpart to the Federal Reserve, would cut German interest rates soon, thus making German marks less valuable compared with dollars. That may have led to short-term buying of dollars.
But developments in the rest of Europe could just as easily send the dollar down further. There were rumors that the Italian Chamber of Deputies may delay a key vote on the Government's budget. And Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank, was reported to be considering a multibillion-dollar charge against earnings.
Both developments could prompt currency traders to dump French francs and Italian lire to buy German marks, raising the value of the mark and thus encouraging traders to dump dollars.
David De Rosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at Swiss Bank, said the stock and bond markets might be setting themselves up for a fall if they were reading too much into the recent stability of the dollar.
"Let's be realistic," he said. "In the next two days, there are going to be a ton of economic reports that could contain surprises." The February Producer Price Index is due this morning and the Consumer Price Index is due tomorrow.
Indeed, one bond trader at a major investment house, who asked not to be named, said, "We're incredibly vulnerable to bad news."
Nonetheless, the financial markets have been coming to the most optimistic conclusions about recent economic data. A stronger-than-expected jobs report last Friday reassured stock traders worried about an economic slowdown and a drop in corporate profits. Slow growth in wages and salaries, which was reflected in the same report, reassured bond traders worried about inflation.
The Dow surged 52 points to a record 4,035.61 last Friday, but the S.& P. and Nasdaq indexes failed to break records then.
Yesterday, however, a seemingly contradictory report on retail sales reassured both stock and bond traders.
Bond prices rose sharply immediately after the 8:30 A.M. report, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond closing at 7.36 percent, down from 7.45 percent. Stock prices soared an hour later, when the equity markets opened.
Stock traders were skeptical about the dollar, too, but nonetheless optimistic about stocks. "The market is gaining momentum and people are getting comfortable with a Dow above 4,000," said Paul Hennessey, chief stock trader at the Boston Company. "People are looking for a Producer Price Index and a Consumer Price Index to be within expectations" of moderate inflation.
Donald Fine, chief bond market analyst for Chase Securities, did not minimize the dollar's problems but noted that the dollar has been falling for years and had not contributed greatly to inflation in the United States.
Mr. Fine said that the stock and bond markets reacted so positively to the retail sales data because the numbers told more about future economic performance than did job-creation or unemployment figures.
"A lot of people were unconvinced that the economy is slowing and the retail sales numbers convinced them," Mr. Fine said.
A wide range of stocks rose, including local telephone companies like GTE, long-distance carriers like AT&T and health-care-related companies like American Home Products. Among blue-chip stocks, Boeing gained 2 1/4, to 49, after winning a $1.2 billion aircraft order. And Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing rose 1 3/4, to 57 5/8.
Dart Group surged 14 3/4, to 89 3/4, after news that company directors are considering a large stock buyback or special dividend. Leaseway Transportation advanced 625/32 , to 1923/32 , after it agreed to be bought by Penske Truck Leasing for $200 million.
Sports and Recreation fell 7 3/4, to 10 3/4, after the specialty retailer announced disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. And Apple Computer slid 3 1/8, to 35, because the computer maker announced slowing sales of its hot-selling Power Macintosh related to production and supply shortages.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.36 points, to 266.53; the American Stock Exchange market value index gained 0.85 point, to 453.91.

Big Investor Relations Task: Selling Mexico to Wall St.

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Mexico, the prodigal son of the financial markets, has a lot to do if it is to repair its credibility with Wall Street and international investors, who poured billions of dollars into Mexico and were badly scalded by the recent 48 percent devaluation of the Mexican peso.
Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz came to New York again yesterday to explain Mexico's second economic plan and to tackle this huge investor relations task. With the skill of the quintessential technocrat and Stanford-trained economist that he is, Mr. Ortiz smoothly rattled off projections and answers to journalists and investors in back-to-back meetings at the St. Regis Hotel. At times, though, he looked nervous as he tried to convince wary listeners that this time Mexico had hit on a workable plan. Indeed, the Mexican Government's confidence, even arrogance, of a year ago has turned to anxiety. 
At best, though, Mr. Ortiz's Wall Street audience was muted and cautiously optimistic after his presentation of the plan. That package includes a 50 percent increase in value-added taxes, Government spending cuts, increases in gasoline and electricity prices and proposals to shore up Mexico's banking system. The nation's gross domestic product is expected to contract by 1 percent this year, the minister said.
A spokeswoman for J. P. Morgan & Company -- which is advising Mexico on its financing strategy and which arranged yesterday's meetings -- said the 70 or 80 Wall Street financiers who attended yesterday's meeting represented those with substantial Mexican investments.
"The country's new macroeconomic program is clearly a step forward," said Lawrence Goodman, a vice president of Salomon Brothers who listened to Mr. Ortiz's remarks by telephone and who met with him later in the day. But, he added, Salomon would be following "quite closely" how Mexico handles the amortization of its short-term debts, which include short-term Treasury notes known as tesobonos.
"Tesobonos, bank certificates of deposit and interbank lines: until there's a formulation for addressing all those, one of the risks is heightened pressure on the currency," Mr. Goodman added. The Mexican peso has slid badly in recent weeks, ending the day today at 6.635 pesos to the dollar in New York trading.
Mr. Ortiz's audience listened with the respect and wariness of those who have suffered. He fielded a series of questions after his presentation that gave a sense of the financial markets' concerns about Mexico. There was anxiety -- even suspicion -- about how the country would manage its short-term debt.
"Isn't that double-counting," one investor questioned as Mr. Ortiz tried to explain how the Government would amortize tesobonos.
"Why not establish a fixed exchange rate?" asked another financier, who has watched the peso deteriorate to current levels, from an exchange rate of 3.465 to the dollar before devaluation on Dec. 20.
A fixed exchange rate would be unrealistic, Mr. Ortiz answered, adding later that he and his colleagues thought that the Mexican currency was now "grossly undervalued."
At least some of the concerns about Mexico's short-term debt were exaggerated, Mr. Ortiz argued. The country has the capital to meet its short-term payments, he said. And Mexico plans to refinance some of its short-term notes with international banks, but Mr. Ortiz cautioned that the country had to have its whole package in place before it could do that. To be sure, Mr. Ortiz does not have great expectations for big flows of foreign capital anytime soon. An increase in domestic savings and tough Government belt-tightening will have to do the trick, he says.
But at least some of those listening to Mr. Ortiz's remarks needed more assurance. An investment banker from Goldman, Sachs approached the minister after his remarks, seeking confirmation of what loans Mexico was currently drawing on from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Those leaving Mr. Ortiz's presentation to bankers and investors generally preferred not to be identified by name. "There was nothing much new," said one investment banker who declined to be identified. "It's going to take time to rebuild trust with investors."
A colleague, however, disagreed, maintaining that Mr. Ortiz had provided new information about how Mexico's bigger companies would be aided by the Government in dealing with their foreign-currency debts.
Mexico, realizing that it has a crisis of confidence on its hands, wants to keep its international investors informed. "I hope to come again in April to report to you," Mr. Ortiz told his audience at the St. Regis.

As U.S. hotel companies rush to get ready to enter Cuba, Days Inns appears to be a step ahead.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
AMERICAN hotel companies have made no secret of their intention to expand into Cuba if and when Washington lifts its economic embargo, but the company that appears positioned to move the quickest boasts neither luxury resorts nor a reputation as a hotel for business travelers. It is Days Inns of America Inc., a chain of 1,600 economy hotels.
"We've identified about 12 properties we consider suitable to carry our banner," said John Russell, president of Days Inns, "and once relations are normalized between the U.S. and Cuba we'd be ready to go." 
 Without commenting on the fate of President Fidel Castro of Cuba, Mr. Russell predicted that "normalization" would occur "within a year."
In preparation, Days Inns, based in Valhalla, N.Y., recently signed an option agreement with the Realstar Group of Toronto, which has 45 Days Inns franchises in Canada. A subsidiary of Realstar, Delta Hotels and Resorts, manages seven Government-owned properties in Cuba, and Delta officials helped Days Inns find the properties that the American chain considered suitable.
While the option agreement does not specify the countries in which the development will occur, Days Inns has applied to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control for the right to include Cuba in the agreement.
"We're hedging our bets," Mr. Russell said. "While 60 percent of our guests are leisure travelers, in about 500 of our properties at least 65 percent of them are business travelers. So when the surge of American visitors hits Cuba, many businessmen will choose to stay at properties they're familiar with, namely Days Inns."
And when Cuban-Americans return to visit, Mr. Russell added, "if their relatives' houses can't accommodate them, they'll stay with us, because they know us."
 
Support for T.W.A. at Home
 In an unusual demonstration of civic support, Civic Progress, an organization of the chief executives of the leading companies based in St. Louis, said yesterday that its members would purchase up to six months of travel on Trans World Airlines to demonstrate their confidence in the future of the troubled hometown carrier.
The advance-ticket purchase plan, devised after a review of the airline's operations and finances, "is a demonstration of our confidence in T.W.A.'s new management team as it continues to complete its long-term financial restructuring," said Andrew E. Newman, president of Civic Progress and chairman of Edison Brothers Stores. The other companies involved are Anheuser-Busch, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, McDonnell Douglas, Ralston Purina and the May Department Stores.
While declining to discuss the value of the commitment, which will represent about 110,000 round trips, John McDonald, a spokesman for T.W.A., said it represented "roughly five days' worth" of the traffic of the airline at Lambert International Airport, its St. Louis hub.
 
American Express in France
 The 100-year-old American Express office on Rue Scribe in Paris has played an important role in the life of expatriate writers, painters and jazz musicians. They used it as a home away from home to pick up mail, change currency and cash traveler's checks. So it is natural to assume that American Express has long been a big factor in France's travel industry.
Not so, and especially not in business travel. In fact, earlier this year a French businessman who is a rival of American Express taunted the company as being a distant fourth in the French travel market.
To remedy that, American Express recently joined with Havas Voyages, the biggest travel agency in France, to create a joint subsidiary that will combine the business travel operations of both companies. Bearing the unwieldy name of Havas Voyages American Express, the new company will begin operating next Jan. 1.
Havas Voyages, which had sales of about $820 million last year, will own about 80 percent of the operation, while American Express, with $220 million in business travel sales in France in 1994, will own the rest. The new company is expected to operate more than 180 business travel offices and employ about 1,200 people.
 
New Hilton Checkout Plan
 Express check-in and checkout are features at many hotels, but Hilton Hotels hopes to leave the competition in the starting blocks with what it calls Tableside Zipout Check-Out -- checkout at the breakfast table. Upon request, guests will be given printouts of their bills, including their breakfast checks if the meals are charged to their rooms. After eating, they can bypass the front desk and will not have to return to their rooms.
After initial tests at airports in Chicago and San Francisco, Hilton plans to expand the test this year to many of its 34 other airport hotels. What could be next? Presenting guests with their bills at check-in?

HEADLINE: Boeing Is Victor In S.A.S. Deal With a Value Of $1.16 Billion

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
In a big victory for the Boeing Company and a serious setback for the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the Scandinavian Airlines System said today that it would purchase 35 new Boeing 737 jetliners, valued at $1.16 billion, and take options on another 35 planes.
McDonnell Douglas had been counting on S.A.S., the flagship carrier of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, to be the so-called launching customer that would justify beginning production of the company's new 100-seat MD-95 aircraft. 
 Without this sale, the introduction of the MD-95 will be delayed, and it could be scuttled if McDonnell Douglas receives no suitably large orders for the plane in the near future.
S.A.S. will now be the launching customer for the Boeing 737-600, a 100-seat version of the venerable 737, with improved electronics and quieter engines with fewer emissions. The Boeing victory is all the more impressive because the company also beat competing bids from the leading European aircraft manufacturers, including Airbus, British Aerospace and Fokker.
"If you look at Boeing in the last three and a half years of this recession, they've rejuvenated the product line, upgraded the manufacturing base -- productivity is significantly improved as are profit margins -- and at this point it looks like their marketing is becoming more aggressive," said Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with BT Securities. "That's a world-beating combination, and they took on the world in this transaction and won."
Shares of Boeing, which is based in Seattle, rose $2.25, to $49, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, while shares of McDonnell Douglas, which is based in St. Louis, fell $1.50, to $55.625.
"It's a disappointment," said John Thom, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach, Calif. "We thought we had the right plane for S.A.S., and they made a different choice. The effect is probably going to be a later launch than we had anticipated."
Mr. Thom said several other airlines were considering the MD-95, which has a price in the mid-$20 million range, and the first deliveries could occur in late 1998.
S.A.S. said it had selected the 737-600 because it was modern, cost-effective and had good environmental properties.
In addition, "S.A.S. has had the advantage in that the market currently offers very favorable terms, and we have been able to choose from a number of very good alternatives," the president and chief executive of S.A.S., Jan Stenberg, said in a statement yesterday. "Our selection of Boeing was based on such deciding factors as flexibility, environmental considerations, economics and the fact that Boeing is a very professional and solid supplier."
Howard Rubel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company, said the sale was particularly damaging to McDonnell Douglas because S.A.S. was traditionally a strong customer for the company. "More than 70 percent of S.A.S.'s current fleet is Douglas," Mr. Rubel said. "This was the cornerstone of Douglas's MD-95 strategy."
Mr. Rubel said the common cockpit design of different 737's and the high residual value of the planes might have influenced the S.A.S. decision.
But in the current market, favorable financing terms and flexibility often play roles as great as or greater than those played by the relative merits of competing airplanes. By most measures the MD-95, which combines the modern cockpit of the McDonnell Douglas MD-90 with the slim fuselage and wing of the company's older, smaller DC-9, is comparable to the new 737, and the prices quoted are similar.
The actual prices, however, are not disclosed, and Boeing has shown that it can be very accommodating on the financing side to close a big deal. Mr. Demisch of BT Securities said that in a previous large sale to Finn Air, the other large Scandinavian carrier, Boeing agreed to accept the airline's existing fleet of older DC-9's and DC-10's as a down payment on new 737's and 767's.
Though no such arrangement was announced in the sale yesterday, Mr. Demisch said it was not unreasonable to assume that similar terms were offered.
Though McDonnell Douglas has less flexibility because of its smaller size, Mr. Demisch said it was too soon to dismiss the ability of the company to introduce the MD-95 and benefit from a worldwide recovery in commercial aircraft sales. "There is going to be significant improvement over the next two years in jetliner demand," he said, "and some of the worries about McDonnell Douglas will fade as the business volume picks up."
Boeing said its first deliveries to S.A.S. were scheduled for the second half of 1998. The 737-600's will become the backbone of the S.A.S. short-haul fleet, serving Scandinavia and Eastern and Western Europe. They will replace McDonnell Douglas DC-9's and Fokker F-28's. The S.A.S. long-haul fleet currently includes Boeing 767's.
Separately, the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said that Japan Airlines had ordered four Boeing 737-400's, an older version of the small jetliner, in a deal valued at about $180 million. The first of the planes will be delivered in May, and will be used to help expand the domestic services of the airline in conjunction with Japan Trans Ocean Air, of which Japan Airlines owns 51 percent, Boeing said.

HEADLINE: Chief of Nuclear Panel Quits To Build Gas-Run Generators

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said this morning that he would quit his job on July 1, a year before his term ends, to go into business in Asia building electric power plants that burn natural gas.
The chairman, Ivan Selin, who is 57, said that in his four-year tenure, the commission had completed the overhaul of the licensing process for new plants, so that if any more are ordered, which has not happened in nearly 20 years, they could fairly compete with other kinds of generating stations. He did not say any more orders were likely. 
 Of his own decision, he said hardly anyone wanted to make a big capital investment now in a new generating station. The country is "awash in electricity," he said, and the utilities face tremendous uncertainty as the industry is deregulated. As a result, he said, the market is choosing plants that can be built inexpensively and operated only part of the day, even if they cost more per hour to run.
Gas-burning plants fit that description perfectly, and in recent years have achieved very high levels of efficiency. "What's going on in gas turbines is unbelievable," he said.
Dr. Selin, who founded a computer firm in 1970 before coming to the State Department in 1989 and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1991, said he liked his job as chairman but wanted to go into the power-production business with his son, Douglas, 31, who is director of international investment at the office of the United States Trade Representative.
James P. Riccio, a nuclear expert at Critical Mass, a nuclear safety group affiliated with Ralph Nader, said Dr. Selin's decision was telling.
"The man who has been trying to bail out the nuclear industry economically has decided he's going to go sell gas-fired turbines," he said.
Dr. Selin said, though, that he would forgo working in the private nuclear business because he was a nuclear regulator. He also said that he wanted to be in private business but that most nuclear programs in Asia were run by governments.
He said his company would seek contracts for long-term electricity sales in countries like India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.
He said the nuclear industry in the United States was in a better position for recovery than it was when he took office because the commission had completed procedures for generic certifications of completed plant designs. In the construction of nuclear plants in past decades, designers worked half a step ahead of construction crews and regulators then decided whether what had been done was acceptable, leading to delays and "rework."
"I'm not predicting that the nuclear industry will pick up," he said. But electric companies will return to ordering big power stations at some point, he said, and with licensing reform and a better thought-out design process, he said, "the industry will make decisions based on longer-term economics."
Asked about the long-term role for various energy technologies, he said, "I believe in our lifetimes, maybe even our children's lifetimes, at least half the electricity in the United States will continue to come from combustion of coal." Renewable sources, like geothermal energy, he said, might be important in some regions but "I don't expect renewables will make a significant dent" in the three leading sources of electricity, which are coal, nuclear power and natural gas.

HEADLINE: J. R. Pennock, 89, Political Professor, Theorist and Author

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
J. Roland Pennock, a political scientist who made his mark in legal and political theory, died on Feb. 19 at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pa. He was 89 and lived in Haverstraw, Pa.
The cause was an acute infection, his family said. 
 Dr. Pennock was Richter Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Swarthmore College, his alma mater, where he taught from 1929 until his retirement in 1976. He served as chairman of the department of political science for 39 years and was a visiting professor at Harvard and Columbia Universities, the University of Minnesota and the University of California at San Diego.
He was a past president of the American Society for Political and Legal Theory and a principal editor of its annual Nomos series, published by New York University Press. Titles remaining in print include "Religion, Morality and the Law" (1988), "Authority Revisited" (1987), "Criminal Justice" (1985), "Property" (1980), "Anarchism" (1978), and "Due Process" (1977).
Among Professor Pennock's own books was "Democratic Political Theory" (Princeton University Press, 1979), a textbook in the field of democratic theory. He also wrote "Self-Government in Modernizing Nations" (Prentice-Hall, 1965) and "Administration and the Rule of Law" (Farrar & Rinehart, 1941).
He was a past vice president of the American Political Science Association and served two terms on the editorial board of the American Political Science Review.
James Roland Pennock was born in Chatham, Pa. He attended the London School of Economics in the mid-1920's and, after graduating from Swarthmore in 1927, earned master's and Ph.D. degrees at Harvard. As a Swarthmore student he was one of the first to take highest honors in the college's newly created Honors Program.
Professor Pennock is survived by his wife of 64 years, Helen Sharpless Pennock; two daughters, Joan P. Barnard and Judith C. P. Lilley, six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Heady days for drug makers, especially so at SmithKline.

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim 

 BODY:
THE big drug companies are pleasing investors again, after singing the blues for nearly three years. Sales and profits are stronger at most companies, but the improved results are especially sweet for SmithKline Beecham P.L.C., the British-American company based in London that is emerging from difficult times.
After the patent expired last year on Tagamet, SmithKline's strong-selling ulcer treatment, low-priced generic versions invaded the market. As a result of the increased competition, analysts projected flat or lower earnings in the fourth quarter. But SmithKline surprised them, reporting that overall sales rose 12 percent with the help of a raft of new products and that earnings per share were up 6 percent. 
 "I expected earnings to go down," said Neil B. Sweig, an analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. He recently added SmithKline to his buy list, along with most other big drug makers.
The pharmaceutical industry is beginning to see payoffs from deep cost-cutting: closing plants, combining operations and laying off employees by the tens of thousands. And drug prices are starting to creep up as the pressure on prices eases from governments and big private buyers. Ronald Nordmann of Deerfield Management in New York, a health care hedge fund, called the rising drug prices "encouraging for investors."
There has also been a temporary bonus for multinational companies that sell heavily in Europe and Japan, where the dollar has weakened and the low exchange rates swelled sales. But companies that do business in Latin America have been hurt by the plummeting value of the Mexican peso.
Pharmaceutical stocks rose sharply in January and February, well ahead of market averages. The wave of health company mergers and acquisitions continues to nurture hopes that still more drug companies will be put up for auction after the purchase in London of Wellcome P.L.C. by Glaxo P.L.C., and the bid by the German giant Hoescht for Marion Merrell Dow.
Uncertainty in the economy is also pushing many investors into drug and other health care stocks, because demand for the companies' products continues in good or bad times. "As a slowing economy becomes a greater threat, investors will continue to increase their holdings in pharmaceuticals," said Larry Puglia, a manager of the Blue Chip growth fund at T. Rowe Price, which has more than two million SmithKline shares and big stakes, too, in Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Merck.
Although T. Rowe Price bought its SmithKline shares when these sold for less than $30, Mr. Puglia said, "we still think the stock is reasonably priced." American depository receipts of SmithKline Beecham closed yesterdaty at $40 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 12.5 cents.
Viren Mehta, a health care analyst at Mehta & Isaly, said SmithKline Beecham had the "most improved management team" among the big drug companies. Joseph Riccardo at Bear, Stearns said SmithKline would be among the fastest-growing health care companies over the next few years, alongside Pfizer, American Home Products and Johnson & Johnson.
SmithKline's partisans say it will reap rewards from its $2.3 billion purchase of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a managed-care drug distributor, and its $1.9 billion investment in Sterling Winthrop's international consumer-drug business.
But Stewart Adkins, a London-based analyst with Lehman Brothers, is not recommending SmithKline Beecham. "We are mostly comfortable with the strategic direction," he said, "but we have some concern about the financial cost of getting there. Tagamet sales will continue to drop, eliminating earnings growth this year, Mr. Adkins said, and he does not expect the expanded over-the-counter drug business to reach profit-margin targets for at least three years.
And Mr. Nordmann at Deerfield Management said the advantages of owning units like Diversified Pharmaceutical Services had diminished since the Federal Trade Commission restricted the use of distributors to promote their parent companies' drugs.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Retail Sales Data Lift Bonds

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday in a rally generated by fresh indications that the economy has slowed from last year's brisk pace.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32 , to 1036/32 . Its yield fell to 7.36 percent, from 7.45 percent on Monday and the lowest level since June 2, when it was 7.34 percent. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
 Also in strong demand were intermediate-range Treasury securities, which are viewed as less volatile than long-term bonds. The yield on 10-year notes, for example, fell 7 basis points, to 7.10 percent, from 7.17 percent on Monday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Investors began snapping up a range of Treasury securities immediately after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales dropped five-tenths of a percent in February, the first monthly decline in nearly a year. Analysts had expected a moderate rise.
Investors viewed the report as strong evidence that the economy was cooling off, alleviating the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. The central bank has raised short-term rates seven times since February 1994 in an effort to slow the economy to a noninflationary rate of growth.
Inflation erodes the value of government bonds and other securities that pay a fixed rate of return. But rising interest rates also hurt bond prices, and persistent uncertainty last year about the timing and size of the Fed's increases battered the market for Treasury securities.
The rally in the Treasury market raised some speculation that interest rates, which are pegged to bond yields, could start to reverse course after more than a year of rising.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, Bolstered by Bonds, Gains as the Mark Retreats

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar advanced modestly against leading currencies yesterday, bolstered by a surge in United States bond prices.
"Today was a buy U.S. assets day," said David de Rosa, a director at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. 
 The dollar also benefited from a retreat by the German mark and an easing of concerns over Mexico's financial crisis.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to to 1.4140 marks, from 1.4067 on Monday. The dollar edged up to 90.85 Japanese yen from 90.75 yen.
United States bond prices surged yesterday after the Commerce Department reported an unexpected decline of half of 1 percent in retail sales last month, suggesting that the economy has slowed to a noninflationary rate of growth and diminishing the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further.
"The retail sales numbers gave the market a sense of confidence that Alan Greenspan's master plan may be working to slow the economy and diminish inflationary pressures," Mr. de Rosa said.
The rally in bonds helped lift stocks as well, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 23.52 points.
Those gains helped support the dollar, driving up demand for the currency needed to purchase the securities.
Currency dealers also noted that a recent easing of concerns about Mexico's economic woes and other Latin American financial trouble spots had helped the dollar.
"The Latin situation seems to be resolved to an extent," said Hillel Waxman, chief currency trader in New York for the Bank Leumi Trust Company. "Concerns have faded, and that has created demand for dollars as overseas money moves back into the market for dollar-denominated Latin securities."
In other currency trading, the mark retreated in what analysts termed a technical correction from weeks of persistent strength. The mark has been near record highs against the dollar, British pound, French franc, Italian lira and Spanish peseta.
"There is a sense that the mark may have overshot a bit," Mr. de Rosa said.
Also weakening the mark was widespread speculation that the German central bank might reduce interest rates when its policy-making council meets tomorrow. Lower rates tend to diminish a currency's appeal to investors.

HEADLINE: Foot Behind Head, Woody Harrelson Goes Positively Yogic

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
WE were entering the fourth chakra, the chakra of love.
So where was Woody? 
 It seemed that Mr. Harrelson was tied up in Brooklyn on the set of his next film, "Money Train." That explained his late entrance at the New York Health and Racquet Club, where he has been teaching a yoga class twice a week with his personal trainer.
Somewhere between the time a dozen or so club members gathered in a circle to pass along a kiss, cheek by cheek, and the moment they broke off as partners for a little mutual torture, Mr. Harrelson breezed in and assumed position, ready to twist and contort his body with the person he calls his "guru man," Ken Scott Nateshvar.
Clearly, Mr. Harrelson, 33, who made his television name playing the hapless second-fiddle bartender on "Cheers" and has since made a handful of successful feature films, does not need a day job.
He is teaching something called "yogassage" -- a partner-style form of yoga in which two people take turns bending, stretching and flipping each other over -- because, he says, he feels the message of the "yin and yang thing," the "union of body and spirit" that yoga imparts should be shared with strangers.
On a whim, Mr. Harrelson and Mr. Nateshvar decided to teach a class during the few months they are here shooting "Money Train," and the Health and Racquet Club on 13th Street was happy to give them space. Members have been permitted to take the class, which ends this week. "Tesh and I have always wanted to teach together," Mr. Harrelson said, referring to his trainer, who goes by that nickname. "We want to get yoga out there."
Mr. Nateshvar, a yoga teacher for 15 years and a former gymnast, has done the lotus position with plenty of movie stars and, he said demurely, with Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right now, he follows Mr. Harrelson on his various projects around the country.
"Yoga is extremely important in my life," said Mr. Harrelson, whose looks and demeanor resemble those of his character from "Cheers" (awkwardly youthful, slightly tan and in need of a haircut) rather than of the man he played in the 1994 movie "Natural Born Killers" (excessively cranky, constantly sneering, generally unpleasant).
"Partner yoga enhances the balance, and what the world needs right now is more balance," he said.
As the two-hour class heated up on a recent Monday night, Mr. Nateshvar and Mr. Harrelson called out instructions to each exerciser as he or she tried to drag a partner by the feet into a position meant to be therapeutic. While the rest struggled to pin their partners to the ground and to wedge elbows under their shoulder blades, the two teachers pulled and stretched each other limb by limb, not unlike wet laundry, in the center of the room.
Was this man spread-eagle in the air, supported only by Mr. Nateshvar's feet, the Inner Woody, the real yogi-in-the-making?
The room of participants -- some of them fellow Nateshvar disciples and others tenderfeet who were doing their best to remain still despite the fact that their partners were trying to force their heads through their locked ankles -- looked on in awe.
Next, the classmates sat locked back to back, one leaning forward, the other struggling for balance. They reached behind their heads and grabbed each other's faces. Then, one partner would lie on the floor only to be lifted by the feet and swung gently but firmly from side to side, as if to dislodge a few quarters and a subway token or two.
The class ended with a demonstration of advanced techniques, which involved Mr. Nateshvar, who appeared to be made of Silly Putty, balancing Mr. Harrelson precariously on the tips of his fingers. Finally, they folded into each other like a huge pair of sweat socks.
Only then did Mr. Harrelson, whose face had remained in a focused frown throughout the class, break into an actual grimace of pain. He moaned. He made that yoga sound -- "ooh ooh ohh ummmmm" -- and he looked as if he might start weeping at any moment.
At that point it was hard to imagine that this man had made his name by exchanging vacuous banter with a barmaid named Carla. Could he really slide out of this human gridlock to announce he was out of vermouth?
The next day, in an interview on the set of "Money Train," which co-stars Wesley Snipes, Mr. Harrelson explained how he had become interested in yoga several years ago when he met Mr. Nateshvar at a retreat.
"I had tried yoga before, but it meant nothing to me until I met Tesh," he said. "He just blew away every concept I ever had about it."
With the kind of lopsided grin often found on the faces of cute high-school hockey players, Mr. Harrelson shared some world views.
"We live in a white, male-dominated world, economically and politically," said the white male actor, stretched out on the floor of his trailer while his partner, Laura Louie, who gives him shoulder rubs between scenes, kept their 2-year-old daughter, Deni Montana, occupied outside. On a nearby table sat a book, "Taoist Secrets of Love: Cultivating Male Sexual Energy," and several bottles of carrot juice. The cramped trailer smelled vaguely like a medicine cabinet full of vitamins.
"I think it is imperative that we all find balance," he said. "We need to take a breath and slow down, and that is how I originally got into it. I needed to slow down. My brain was always in a fairly manic state of frenetic energy. The mind-set I got into is what I think most actors get into. We need to succeed -- TV star, movie star -- you know, where does it end? With Tesh, I started to find my balance. To learn to relax, to access my energy."
He elaborated on his theory of balance: "When you are in your teens and 20's, your kundalini energy gets rooted down in the lower chakra," he said, referring to the lowest and most sexual of the seven energy centers of the body according to Hindu and Buddhist traditions.
"The thing yoga does is loosen up the spine," he said. "With a loose spine, the energy can go up to the crown chakra, and that is where you find the balance -- once that whole kundalini stuff is running up the spine."
Mr. Nateshvar, who wandered into the trailer, explained that kundalini, Sanskrit for "power of mother nature," really means "universal life energy." It is unclear how the energy of the universe ended up in Mr. Harrelson's spine, but still, it sounded nice.
Mr. Harrelson's love for yoga is so great that he has incorporated it into his new film. It was his idea, he said, to pull his leg behind his head, a yoga position, while seated on a bar stool. The position takes lots of coaching from Mr. Nateshvar.
During the scene, Mr. Snipes picks up Mr. Harrelson and carries him through the bar, in position. After it is shot, Mr. Snipes calls out: "Am I the only one here who saw that it was Tesh who put this guy's foot behind his head? Am I?" Mr. Harrelson laughs and limps away.
Back in the trailer, the actor and his trainer go into bear-hug position. "Tesh, you're amazing."
"No, you're amazing."
They sit down to partake of plates of vegetarian takeout, along with Ms. Louie and Deni.
Even Deni, apparently, has picked up some yoga. "She can push me into a stretch," Mr. Harrelson said, flopping down into cobra position to demonstrate. "She also does the downward dog."

HEADLINE: Burglaries Show Big Decline in New York City

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
Police Officer Roger Smith remembers when he began to lift fingerprints in downtown Brooklyn and surrounding neighborhoods in 1986: He would typically face an urgent bunch of 20 or more fresh burglary cases after his weekend off. "I'd run around like a chicken without a head," he recalled.
But burglaries in his precinct, covering Brooklyn Heights, Boerum Hill and the Fulton Street Mall, have decreased to fewer than two a day on average. Some days, he said, he feels like the repairman in a Maytag commercial. 
Officer Smith's happy problem exemplifies one of the metropolitan area's most pronounced and favorable crime trends: Burglary is becoming more and more unusual in the city and its suburbs every year.
Burglaries at showcase stores, like the break-in at Gucci's Fifth Avenue store last week, still inspire a certain fascination. And thousands of city residents still triple-lock their apartment doors and buy more sophisticated alarm systems every year to protect themselves and their valuables.
Though such measures remain prudent in a city where thousands upon thousands of homes and businesses are burglarized every year, police statistics show that the threat is much lower than it once was. Reported burglaries in the city have declined more than 50 percent since they peaked in 1980, dropping to 120,000 in 1990 from a total of 206,000 in 1981, and down further, to 90,000, in 1994, .
And the suburbs are not far behind, with the combined total of reported burglaries for Westchester, Rockland, Nassau and Suffolk counties sliding to 24,730 in 1993, from 44,900 in 1978, according to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services.
"Criminals have found other ways of making money, like selling drugs," said Deputy Inspector Joseph E. Lovelock, executive officer of the New York Police Department Office of Management Analysis and Planning. "It's an easier way to make a living, and you don't have to worry about alarms and dogs."
Federal statistics show a similar though less dramatic trend. Reported burglaries around the nation dropped by more than 20 percent, to 2.8 million cases in 1993, from 3.8 million cases in 1981, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation compilation of local police department statistics.
Random surveys conducted by the Justice Department indicate that 1974 marked the modern-day high point in incidents of house burglary nationwide, when there were 93.1 burglaries or attempted burglaries for every 1,000 households. That rate dropped to 84.3 per 1,000 households in 1980, steadily decreasing to 62.7 in 1985 and to 48.9 in 1992.
The surveys indicate that the decline in burglaries has particularly benefited inner-city blacks, whose neighborhoods were previously hardest hit. But the trend of sharp drops in burglaries holds for households of all races living in cities, suburbs and rural areas.
While reported homicide, robbery and most other types of felony crimes have fallen by more than 25 percent in New York and several other cities since 1990, criminologists say the burglary trend is particularly meaningful because it has progressed steadily over a 15-year period -- defying recessions, the crack epidemic of the late 1980's and the explosion in youth crime in the 1990's.
The fact that burglary arrests of suspects under age 18 decreased 81 percent from 1981 to 1993 in New York City -- compared with a 37 percent drop for older suspects -- further suggests that the downward burglary trend could be lasting.
Criminologists note that burglaries are historically under-reported. They also say that a decision by the Federal Government to tighten rules involving tax write-offs for burglary losses in recent years may have cut the number of fraudulent claims and thus the overall numbers. But they also say the sweeping nature of the reported decreases in burglaries across geographical and class lines means the drop is real.
"Burglary is down everywhere," said Scott H. Decker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Missouri in St. Louis.
Still, for many people, the statistical decline has not translated into a greater sense of security. If they haven't been victimized themselves, many people know someone who has been. "Generally speaking, I don't feel safe," said Ellen Blumenthal, who lives on 101st Street on the Upper West Side. "But I think it's a lot of drug action. They hang out on my corner, and they could get in easily enough."
Crime experts give many reasons for the decline. Police officials credit the mass marketing of pick-resistant locks and home alarm systems, and they note that the decline in precious metal prices has made burglary less lucrative. They also say the proliferation of guns at least partly explains why robbery -- a crime that requires the threat of force -- rose so sharply in the late 1980's while burglaries fell.
Some criminologists say that the personal computer revolution and the recent baby boom are keeping more parents and child-care providers at home during the day, when home burglaries most often occur.
But more than anything else, the reduction in burglaries suggests to many experts that the replacement of heroin by crack as the most popular illegal drug in American cities has radically changed the career preferences of professional criminals.
Mr. Decker said heroin addicts typically commit more burglaries than crack users because of the nature of their addiction.
"If you are a crack user you need to buy drugs constantly, unlike the heroin addict, who scores and is taken care of for a day or two," Mr. Decker said. "Crack users don't have the time to wait for people to be away from home, and there is a ready pool of victims on the street either day or night."
Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, agreed, saying that the time needed to sell stolen property is a nuisance for impatient crack users. "Robbery is more satisfying because you get the cash," he said.
The peaks and valleys of New York City's burglary trends over the last 20 years strongly suggest that improvements in police tactics have also made an impact. Alarmed by the rocketing rate in burglaries in the late 1970's, the Police Department in 1980 began to use police officers trained in lifting fingerprints in every precinct and ordered them to help investigate every burglary.
Arrests went up and the number of burglaries began to drop almost immediately. The department computerized fingerprint processing in 1987, enabling investigators to reduce the time for matching fingerprints with the names of possible suspects to roughly two weeks, from what had previously been months or even years. Again, burglaries went down.
After the police began a campaign of sting operations last year to arrest merchants who sell stolen goods and created new computer programs to observe neighborhood burglary patterns, the 1994 burglary rate slid better than 10 percent from 1993. And the rate is down an additional 12 percent the first two months of this year from last.
Another strategy that appears to have helped is the growth of community policing, which the police began a decade ago, and which emphasizes foot patrols and neighborhood problem solving to avert crimes before they happen.
When the Hotel St. George in Brooklyn Heights faced a rash of burglaries 18 months ago, the Community Police unit in the 84th Precinct came up with the ingenious idea of painting the room numbers outside every window so witnesses who saw thieves scale the fire escapes from the hotel courtyard could call 911 and specify exactly where a burglary was in progress. Police responses accelerated, and the rate of burglaries dropped.
Judy Stanton, head of the Brooklyn Heights Association, said the trend has been noticeable throughout the neighborhood. "Neighborhood-wide, I don't hear about house burglaries anymore," she said. "I hear less about house burglaries while I'm still hearing about car theft."
While on a typical patrol one unseasonably warm afternoon last week, an officer in the Community Police unit, Michael Looney, was on the lookout for open windows. He saw one on the second floor of an apartment building on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights that could be easily entered from an adjacent drain pipe and then contacted the building's management company to warn the tenant.
Officer Looney resumed his patrol on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, where he spotted an open first-floor bay window without shutters or draperies. As he prepared to walk around the block to ring the doorbell, he crooked his neck over a wrought-iron fence to peek into the apartment, and saw a resident exercising in his underwear.
"That takes care of that," Officer Looney smiled. "I may be out of a job soon."

HEADLINE: A Better Plan for X-Rated Shops

 BODY:
Showing refreshing flexibility, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has reached a reasonable agreement with the New York City Council on strict zoning rules to limit the spread of X-rated video stores and topless bars in midtown Manhattan and residential neighborhoods like Chelsea and Forest Hills, Queens.
Courts have permitted municipalities to regulate the location and concentration of sex-oriented adult businesses if their presence undermines the economy and public safety. But such zoning laws must be drawn with utmost care. Sexually explicit videos, books and dancing are forms of constitutionally protected free expression. 
 Mr. Giuliani's original proposal to exile sex-oriented businesses to a few isolated industrial districts outside Manhattan seemed overly restrictive and legally dubious. It provoked complaints from these neighborhoods that Manhattan's problems were being transferred to their backyards.
By revising the plan to allow some sex businesses to remain in Manhattan, the Mayor bolstered the city's legal position and won support of the Council, which must approve the zoning changes. As under his original proposal, sex-related businesses would be barred from opening within 500 feet of residences, schools, houses of worship or one another. But the new agreement expands the areas in which such establishments could operate beyond manufacturing areas to "commercial zones of high density" in Manhattan, including parts of Times Square. Even there, the new regulations would dramatically reduce the number of existing adult stores -- from 47 to 5 or 6, according to Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District (of which this newspaper is a member).
Some fine-tuning by the City Planning Commission may be required once all interested parties have a chance to review the zoning maps in detail. There is no guarantee how the courts will rule. But the challenge for the Mayor and City Council was to devise a plan fair to free expression and the public, and they appear to have met it.
The next challenge is to get the new restrictions in place before the current moratorium on establishing new sex businesses expires in November.

HEADLINE: The Right Way to Help Pakistan

 BODY:
Violence is running out of control in Pakistan's port city of Karachi. More than 1,000 Pakistani lives have been lost in a year of disorder. Last week two American consular employees were killed and a third wounded when their van was ambushed on the city's main thoroughfare.
There are domestic causes behind the unrest, like ethnic and religious conflicts, political rivalries and drug-turf battles. But Pakistan's troubled relations with the United States are also a factor. 
 Less than a decade ago, Washington saw Pakistan as a front-line cold-war ally and staging ground for American aid to the anti-Communist Afghan resistance. But since Soviet troops withdrew from Kabul, relations have cooled considerably. Many Pakistanis feel that Washington has left them to cope with toxic consequences of the Afghan war, including a flood of easily obtained assault weapons, increased drug trafficking and battle-hardened cadres of unemployed Islamic warriors.
Early next month Pakistan's Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, will come to Washington in an effort to shore up relations. Both sides have an interest in reducing tensions, but the Clinton Administration must not do so at the expense of efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
Ms. Bhutto, educated at Radcliffe and Oxford, presents herself as a market-opening reformer and a secular bulwark against Islamic radicalism. But her performance has been more ambiguous. Mindful of political vulnerabilities, she has steered scarce resources toward military procurement and ignored religious intolerance and persecution. She has also done little to curb the corruption in Pakistan's political parties, including her own.
The Clinton Administration has recently been advertising its willingness to reconsider the virtual cutoff of American aid imposed in 1990 to punish Pakistan's effort to develop nuclear weapons. Ms. Bhutto, under continuous pressure at home from military leaders, would dearly like to take home some concessions on this issue.
It is in America's interest to strengthen Ms. Bhutto's civilian, secular Government, but she must provide credible curbs on Pakistan's nuclear program in exchange for any relief.
Washington also needs to press for more responsible Pakistani behavior in the dispute with India over Kashmir. India's repressive policies have been disastrous, but Pakistani support for cross-border terrorism has made matters worse and threatens international peace.
Finally, the Clinton Administration might remind Ms. Bhutto that her Government can help reinforce democratic rule by paying more attention to the economic needs, security fears and democratic aspirations of the majority of Pakistanis who have twice elected her to high office.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P.'s Contract Makes Government More Responsible

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Mistaking a Moment for a Mandate" (Op-Ed, March 9), the pollster Stanley B. Greenberg resorted to the same type of hollow distortions that left the Democratic Party high and dry last November. 
 In August 1994 we unveiled our Contract With America, and my Republican colleagues and I proudly campaigned on the content of this document. Now Congress has started doing the unthinkable -- keeping its promises. We've taken steps to make government more responsive, more responsible, more accountable and more cost-efficient.
Why then would Mr. Greenberg make allegations such as: (1) Republican Congressional candidates not running on the Contract; (2) the fall elections not being of historic proportions, and (3) people being completely unhappy with their present form of government?
Addressing these point by point:
(1) I ran on the Contract, and I am very proud of it.
(2) No Republican incumbent lost at the Federal level, and for the first time in more than 40 years, the House of Representatives changed hands.
(3) Without government there is only anarchy, and I believe that Americans want a leaner, more efficient government that they feel they have some control over -- and that's what we're delivering.
Mr. Greenberg's brand of rhetoric is divisive and unproductive. At worst, he is trying to protect his own economic self-interests. What does he have at stake? Only a monthly White House retainer of $25,000. During the first 12 months of 1993, his firm took in more than $2 million in fees from President Clinton and company -- 10 times the amount that President Bush spent on polling in his first three years in office!
So if he has a problem with fulfilled Republican promises, it's only because his wallet's growing thinner while our shared American future is growing brighter.

HEADLINE: 'Boat People' Prefer Death To Homeland

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: MORONG, Philippines

 BODY:
Tran Ba is so desperate to avoid being forced back home to Vietnam that in a protest this month he doused himself with kerosene in front of horrified Philippine guards and threatened to set himself afire.
"Next time I will light the match," said Mr. Ba, who left Vietnam four years ago believing that he had been promised a new life in the United States. 
 Ta Thi Ngoan, a 53-year-old tailor who has been detained here since 1988, has told the guards that she is prepared to kill herself and her 10 children if they are returned to Vietnam. "If I go back to Vietnam, I will go straight to prison," she said. Her neighbor, Kim Thi Ng, said several families in the detention camp here had stored rat poison. "People are very serious about suicide," Mrs. Ng said.
Two decades after the first boatloads of Vietnamese pushed off the shores of their homeland into the treacherous waters of the South China Sea, the final chapter of their exodus is being written in detention camps like the one here along the mountainous western coast of the Philippines.
For many of these Vietnamese, who have spent years in these camps only to face a forced return to Vietnam, the final chapter will in many ways be tragic. The question is whether it will be violent as well.
In February, Southeast Asian governments announced final plans to close the camps, which have housed the more than 800,000 Vietnamese who fled their homeland after 1975. The closings mean that the 46,306 Vietnamese left in the camps today -- those who have been unable to find third countries willing to accept them -- will soon be compelled to return to Vietnam.
Forcing them home will be an ugly, possibly dangerous business, as tens of thousands of people are pushed or dragged onto planes headed for Vietnam, which many of them had hoped never to see again.
As the clock ticks down, violent outbursts are becoming common in the detention camps.
In Indonesia last June, two Vietnamese boat people set themselves on fire and died in a protest over plans for their forced return to Vietnam.
Hundreds of Vietnamese in camps in Hong Kong have announced suicide pacts, and more than 200 were injured last April in a clash with the police after refusing to move to another camp in preparation for their forced return. There have been scores of cases of self-mutilation by Vietnamese who have insisted that they would rather die than return home.
"Many of these incidents were carried out more with a view toward attracting attention than causing real harm," said Jahanshah Assadi, director of the Hong Kong mission of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "But we've had attempts at hanging, attempts at self-immolation, people taking a knife or sharp-edged instrument and puncturing their arms, legs, stomachs."
 
A New Vietnam Can't Allay Old Fears
 If they are forced back, many of the Vietnamese will return to a country different from the one they left years ago. Vietnam has abandoned Marxist economics and embraced the free market. The economy is booming, with job opportunities unimaginable in the 1980's.
Vietnam remains an authoritarian country that imprisons political dissidents. But United Nations investigators who visited there say they found no credible evidence that any of the 68,000 asylum-seekers who have already returned have faced harassment from the Government. The Hanoi Government has vowed to treat the returning Vietnamese humanely.
While Vietnam's economic boom and the assurances of the United Nations should give comfort to those Vietnamese still in the camps, many are clearly still terrified about what they will confront if they are forced to go back home.
Hiram A. Ruiz, an analyst of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a private group based in Washington, has visited the detention camps and said the threats of suicide and other violence were not surprising. "They have lost years of their lives, risked everything, given up everything in hopes of living in a different country," he said.
Of the Vietnamese left in camps in Southeast Asia, more than half -- about 24,300 -- are in Hong Kong, held in overcrowded barbed-wire compounds that have long been an expensive embarrassment to the Hong Kong Government. The others are scattered throughout Southeast Asia, with about 3,300 still held in the Philippines.
 
Western Sympathy Finally Runs Dry
 When the boat people began pouring out of Vietnam after Communist forces toppled the American-backed Government of South Vietnam in 1975, they were met with sympathy, especially from the United States, which took in more than a million Vietnamese over the last 20 years.
But the West's sympathy has run out. Virtually all of the Vietnamese who made it to Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian way stations in the 1990's have been labeled economic migrants -- not refugees, a label that requires substantiated proof of fear of persecution in Vietnam -- and were refused entrance to the United States and other countries.
In 1989 Vietnam and its neighbors reached agreement on a plan that was supposed to have all of the remaining asylum-seekers back in Vietnam by the end of this year.
The December 1995 deadline is almost certain to pass with tens of thousands of Vietnamese still held in the camps, but governments in the region vow to complete the returns within a few months of the original schedule, probably by the middle of next year. Vietnam has agreed to take back 3,600 boat people each month.
Refugee groups and human rights campaigners have long praised the Philippines for having run some of the most humane detention camps. But the Manila Government is eager to see the last of the Vietnamese go home and to close its last two camps -- one here on the central Philippine island of Luzon and the other on the remote southern island of Palawan.
"This has already dragged on so long," said Rodolfo Severino, under secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs. "But we're caught in a real dilemma. We're not the kind of people who would deliberately harm other people. We're trying to persuade the Vietnamese to go home voluntarily. That would be best."
For most of the Vietnamese still in the Philippines, persuasion has not worked, particularly for the 270 left behind here in the Philippine Refugee Processing Center, about 50 miles west of Manila, in the coastal province of Bataan.
 
If Nothing to Lose, It's a 'Paradise' Lost
 The center was opened in 1980 with money from the United States and the United Nations to house Vietnamese who had been approved for asylum and were waiting to move to the United States and other countries.
Once, the camp's airy wooden barracks along a pleasant stretch of the coast -- a paradise compared with the camps in Hong Kong -- held as many as 18,000 refugees at a time.
Today it is empty except for the 270, who have been threatening since late last year to join in mass suicide if the Government tries to remove them. The camp is covered with handwritten signs that state the threat bluntly: "We'd Rather Die" and "We Are Prepared to Die Here, Even Under Force."
The administrator of the camp, Jose Busco, has worked here periodically since 1986 and said he regarded many of the Vietnamese as friends. "Basically everybody is peaceful," he said.
But the concern about violence is evident in a map of the camp posted at one end of Mr. Busco's conference room. The map's legend marks out the individual bunkers in the camp and notes the threat posed by people living in each of them.
A Vietnamese-American priest who ministers to the Vietnamese here, the Rev. Joseph Trong, says many are serious about killing themselves. "These people have nothing to lose," he said.
 
No Asylum in U.S., So Where to Go?
 The Vietnamese here arrived not by boat but by plane, after they had been approved by the United States Government for a program known as Orderly Departure. The program was set up under the Carter Administration to offer asylum to Vietnamese affiliated with the former South Vietnamese Government and to Amerasian children and their families.
But after arriving in the Philippines, the 270 Vietnamese remaining here were thrown out of the program, most after American officials determined that they had falsified their immigration papers.
In many cases, the Americans asserted that the Amerasians, most of them children of American soldiers, were traveling with Vietnamese who were only pretending to be family members in hopes of getting to the United States.
"There have been a very small number of people who were found to be ineligible," said James Nealon, the spokesman for the United States Embassy in Manila. "The United States is acknowledging our level of responsibility in this issue. We're working very closely with the Vietnamese Government to repatriate those concerned."
Repatriation is what the people here say they fear.
Mrs. Ng, an English-language interpreter from Ho Chi Minh City, the southern capital formerly known as Saigon, has a 25-year-old Amerasian daughter whose father, Mrs. Ng said, was an American soldier.
After leaving Vietnam in 1992 under the Orderly Departure Program, they arrived in the Philippines to be told that their application to continue to the United States had been denied, and that they would have to find some other country to accept them, or return to Vietnam.
"They said that we falsified the documents," she said. "But nobody told us in detail what we had done wrong. I still do not know."
Mrs. Ng, who insisted that she did not falsify her documents, said she feared that she and her daughter would be labeled spies if they returned to Vietnam.
"We know the mentality of the Vietnamese Communists," she said. "They would think that we have stayed in the Philippines all these years to be trained by the Americans, by the C.I.A., and we would be put in prison as soon as we go back. This is why people would rather die here than go home to Vietnam."

HEADLINE: Helms Seeks to Merge Foreign Policy Agencies

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Senator Jesse Helms proposed a radical restructuring of foreign policy apparatus today that he said would save billions of dollars by merging half a dozen agencies into the State Department.
Asserting that Republican control of Congress created an unusual opportunity to revamp foreign policy institutions, the Senator proposed eliminating the Agency for International Development, the Arms Control and Development Agency, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and other agencies. 
 At a news conference today, Mr. Helms, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said his plan would reduce duplication and save $6 billion over five years.
"Our foreign policy institutions are a complete mess," he said. "Over the past four decades, key foreign policy functions have been spun off into a constellation of money-absorbing, incoherent satellites, each with its own entrenched, growing bureaucracies and its own bureaucratic interest. The result has been an incoherent mishmash which no one policy-maker can control."
In spelling out details of legislation he plans to introduce, Mr. Helms said he was borrowing from proposals that Secretary of State Warren Christopher made in December. The Secretary suggested merging the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the disarmament agency into the State Department.
Vice President Al Gore has rejected Mr. Christopher's proposal, saying the costs would outweigh the savings, and Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said today that the proposal was unnecessary because the Administration was streamlining the agencies.
The White House and the State Department also insist that the proposal could create havoc for a foreign policy team that has its hands full with Bosnia, Iran, Chechnya, the Middle East and other trouble spots.
Mr. Helms proposed replacing the Agency for International Development with a foundation that would channel aid for education, health and agriculture through grants to companies and nonprofit groups. He said such a foundation should be phased out over 20 years. Under his plan, emergency relief would be handled by an expanded State Department bureau.
The Senator also proposed that an agency to develop exports and investment be set up within the State Department to assume the duties of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Export-Import Bank and the Trade and Development Agency, an arm of the Commerce Department.
Mr. Helms proposes to abolish the United States Information Agency, which runs Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, and give its responsibilities to an Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy. The work of the arms control agency would be taken over by a new Under Secretary of State for Security.
Appearing with Mr. Helms, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York and chairman of the House International Relations Committee, praised the proposals, saying foreign policy institutions needed to be streamlined. But Mr. Gilman stopped short of a full endorsement.
One Administration official said that if the Helms proposal were implemented, employees of the information agency would do the same work but their checks would be signed by someone else. "This is box-moving for the sake of box-moving," she said.

HEADLINE: Venezuela, Fearing an Uprising Today, Arrests 150 Leftists

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, March 15

 BODY:
Venezuelan authorities have arrested 150 leftists across the nation this week, alleging that they were plotting to set off an uprising on Thursday.
The crackdown, coming at a time of raging inflation and a shrinking economy, had Venezuelans nervously recalling their nation's recent political traumas: a violent uprising in Caracas in 1989, two failed coup attempts in 1992 and a presidential resignation in 1993. 
 "We will see who lasts longer -- me in jail, or you in office," Hugo Chavez Frias, a retired army officer and leader of the jailed leftists, said on Tuesday in a taunt directed at President Rafael Caldera, who has four years remaining in his term.
But the police did not dare arrest Mr. Chavez, though they arrested one of his brothers, Adan Chavez Frias, a university professor.
Hugo Chavez Frias, a leader of the first failed coup, rejects electoral politics as corrupt, but here in South America's oldest democracy he routinely runs close behind President Caldera in polls ranking respected Venezuelan political figures.
This week, the authorities moved pre-emptively against leaders of his Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement, fearing that they were going to hold potentially violent protests against price increases of 20 percent announced last month.
In February 1989, increases in gasoline prices set off rioting and a ruthless police response that claimed an estimated 500 lives in Caracas.
"What frightens the Government is the threat of another Caracazo," a Western diplomat said today, referring to the 1989 violence. "The Caracazo was the watershed experience for recent Venezuelan politics."
For Americans, political turbulence on the far side of the Caribbean is important. This year, Venezuela is expected to surpass Saudi Arabia as the No. 1 foreign supplier of oil to the United States.
Feeding Government uneasiness is Mr. Caldera's sagging position in opinion polls. Largely seen as an honest, well-meaning, grandfatherly figure, Mr. Caldera enjoyed approval ratings of around 60 percent during most of his first year in office. But in recent weeks his administration won a "bad" rating from 47 percent of respondents in one poll, and his economic policies of price and exchange controls were termed "not successful" by 72 percent in another.
"This authoritarian tendency has been present since the beginning of the Caldera Government," said Mary Eva Caguaripano, coordinator of Venezuela's leading human rights group, Provea. "What's different is that at the beginning he enjoyed a level of popularity that he no longer has."
Venezuela's economy contracted by 3.3 percent last year and inflation soared to 71 percent, South America's worst economic performance in 1994. Few economists forecast much improvement for this year.
The 79-year-old Mr. Caldera, a veteran politician who also served as President in the early 1970's, increasingly governs with authoritarian measures.
Last June, in face of the collapse of half of Venezuela's banking sector, the Government suspended several constitutional guarantees, including freedom from arbitrary arrest, freedom from search without a warrant, and freedom of travel. Although the suspensions were to be temporary, they remain in effect nine months later.
The Support Network for Justice and Peace, a human rights group here, reported recently that police and military forces killed 32 people and tortured 79 others in January, double the rate of January 1994.

HEADLINE: Economy Shows Some Signs of Strength, but Dollar Falls Sharply;
Both Stocks and Bonds Shed Early Nervousness

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled to near-record lows in overseas trading yesterday, despite signs of robust growth in the American economy that could lead to higher interest rates. The stock and bond markets largely shrugged off the fall in the dollar and the stronger-than-expected economic data.
The economy's resilience was apparently more attractive to stock traders, who might have sold off on such positive data a few months ago, fearing another increase in rates by the Federal Reserve. Indeed, on Friday, stocks surged after a strong employment report for February. 
 Still, stocks and bonds may not be able to withstand the impact of a falling dollar -- and its potential to force rates higher -- for long. Events in Europe today, like a critical vote in the Italian Parliament and a meeting of the German central bank, could force the dollar to new lows against the German mark and Japanese yen, and thus hurt stocks and bonds.
"If the dollar got into problems again, like it did last week, it would mean problems for our markets, too," said Edward Laux, senior managing director of equity trading at the Chicago Corporation. "A lot of people on the Continent have been out of the U.S. equity markets and before they jump in again, they want to see some turn in the currency."
After falling almost 20 points in early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down just 10.38 points, at 4,038.37, while the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.01 points, to 491.88. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.86 point, to 807.38.
The dollar affects the stock and bond markets because a declining dollar lowers the value of stocks and bonds to foreign investors, who are an important source of investment capital. The Dow has risen 5.32 percent this year in dollars but fallen 5.72 percent in marks.
Stock and bond traders were caught off guard early in their sessions by reports on producer prices and factory use that suggested inflation was still a threat, raising the possibility that the Fed might raise interest rates soon.
Wall Street economists had expected the Producer Price Index to rise two-tenths of 1 percent in February, but it rose three-tenths of 1 percent. And Wall Street had expected factory use to come in at 85.6 percent, but the actual rate was 85.7 percent.
But stocks and bonds recovered when the Fed's 12 regional banks reported a nationwide slowing of the economy, relieving some concerns about higher rates. Indeed, in recent days, four of the seven Fed governors have expressed little enthusiasm about raising rates further, noting that the economy appeared to be slowing to steady, sustainable growth with moderate inflation.
Traders said yesterday that the small drop in stocks and no change in bonds indicated that those markets were acting independently of the currency markets.
After declining sharply, bond prices recovered all their losses. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 7.36 percent.
Meanwhile, the German mark continued to strengthen, as traders abandoned the Italian lira as the Government appeared to be headed toward a losing vote on its budget. The French franc fell as well, amid lingering uncertainty over the exact size of the multibillion-dollar losses of Credit Lyonnais.
Overseas, the dollar fell close to the post-World-War-II lows of 1.3455 marks and 88.76 yen that it touched in intraday trading last week. The dollar fell as low as 89.33 yen before settling at 89.50 yen in late New York trading, down 1.35 yen, and as low as 1.3850 German marks before ending at 1.3895 marks, down from 1.4140 marks.
Currency traders doubt that the dollar has stopped falling. "The fact that we haven't hit historic lows today just means we haven't done it today," said Hillel Waxman, head of foreign-exchange trading at Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York.
A vote in the Italian Parliament today on the Government's budget may affect the dollar because currency traders have been betting that Prime Minister Lamberto Dini will lose what has now become a vote of confidence. Traders have been selling lira and buying marks. Meanwhile, traders are also focusing on the policy-setting meeting today of the Bundesbank, the German counterpart to the Federal Reserve.
"There is so much strength in the mark," said Charles A. Spence, director of Treasury sales at Standard Chartered Bank, "because the market expects the Bundesbank to do nothing" and not lower rates. A rate cut would make other currencies, including the dollar, more attractive.
While a weak currency makes securities denominated in it less attractive, the bond market seems to be acting independently of the dollar. Kathleen Camilli, chief bond economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, an economic consulting firm, cited two factors that do not involve only foreign investors.
Many American bond portfolio managers had been on the sidelines for much of last year, which was one of the worst years for bonds ever, she said, and now must put their money to work.
Also, there has been some repatriation of American money invested in Mexico and other troubled Latin American markets, although how much still is not clear.
Though stocks weakened because of the price index, traders also cited the performance by Motorola Inc. as having an effect. The company's shares fell 1 3/4, to 56 7/8, after losing a $200 million order for cellular telephone equipment to the AT&T Corporation. Motorola has led other technology-related stocks in recent sessions and traders often look to one or two groups to become market leaders to spark rallies.
The Dart Group Corporation rose 5 1/4 a share, to 95, in Nasdaq trading, its second day of large gains, after the company said on Tuesday that it was considering a stock buyback or special dividend. Shares of Atria Software Inc. rose 3 1/2, to 45, in Nasdaq trading after the company introduced a new client-server product.
Stock in the Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation fell 4 1/4 a share, to 41, after a Mabon Securities analyst lowered his assessment to "neutral," citing slowing prospects for growth. Shares of the Standard Products Company, an auto parts maker, fell 3 1/8, to 19 5/8, on the New York Stock Exchange after it said it expected lower earnings because of lower profit margins and higher production costs.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavier than normal, with 337.2 million shares changing hands, about 3 percent more than this year's daily average of 327 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.38 point, to 266.15, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers, 1,145 to 1,008. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.87 point, to 454.78.

HEADLINE: For Many in Work Force, 'Glass Ceiling' Still Exists

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Despite three decades of affirmative action, "glass ceilings" and "concrete walls" still block women and minority groups from the top management ranks of American industry, a Federal commission said today in the Government's first comprehensive study of barriers to promotion.
White men, while constituting about 29 percent of the workforce, hold about 95 of every 100 senior management positions, defined as vice president and above, the report said. 
 White women have poured into the workforce, taking nearly 40 percent of all jobs nationwide, compared with 30 percent three decades ago. But the report suggested that in the race for top management slots, women stumble or are tripped in the stretch: They typically constitute less than 5 percent of senior managers in industries across the nation.
Women have had greater success moving into the ranks of middle management, like assistant vice presidents and office managers. According to the report and the 1990 Census, white women now hold close to 40 percent of those jobs and black women hold about 5 percent. Black men hold 4 percent.
The report by the Glass Ceiling Commission, titled "Good for Business: Making Full Use of the Nation's Human Capital," used 1990 census data and the results of surveys by consulting firms to sketch the corporate landscape for women and minorities, and to identify the barriers to their advancement -- principally the fears and prejudices of white male executives on the lower rungs of the corporate ladder.
The report cited various studies suggesting "that the glass ceiling exists because of the perception of many white males that as a group they are losing -- losing the corporate game, losing control and losing opportunity."
"Many middle- and upper-level white male managers view the inclusion of minorities and women in management as a direct threat to their own chances for advancement," the report said.
Those male managers, the report implied, actually stand no better odds of reaching the top today than they did 30 years ago. But if there has always been competition, the face of it has changed. White men, the report said, have circled the wagons against challengers whom they view not in terms of their merit but in terms of their color and sex.
In hearings across the country, commission members heard hundreds of top- and middle-level managers, male and female, testify that white men were stymieing the progress of women and minorities. Those who do break through are often shunted to the anterooms of the executive suite -- into dead-end staff jobs, like directors of personnel and public relations.
Referring to interviews with chief executives, the commission concluded: "Corporate leaders are talking the talk of inclusion. Yet minorities and women express dismay and anger when they describe what they perceive to be innumerable obstacles to their corporate advancement. In short, there is a difference between what corporate leadership says it wants to happen and what is actually happening."
The commission had its origins in 1990, when Elizabeth H. Dole, then Labor Secretary, initiated a department investigation into the issue of the glass ceiling.
Her husband, Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, then the minority leader, sponsored the legislation establishing the commission. It is a bipartisan panel, comprising 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats -- lawmakers, workplace experts, worker advocates and executives -- plus an ex-officio chairman, Labor Secretary Robert Reich.
All but one voted to approve the report. The exception, Marge Roukema, Republican from New Jersey, did not participate in the voting. "Apparently it wasn't anything she had a big interest in," her spokesman, Craig Sherman, said.
The commission report, whose completed galley proofs were released today, is the first comprehensive exploration of barriers to women's and minority groups' advance into management. Some 250 pages long, it is based on the research of scholars, consultants and workers advocacy groups, interviews with chief executives of 25 mostly blue-chip companies and testimony of hundreds of managers in five cities.
The report made no policy recommendations: Those are planned for November in a second and final report. But the commission's findings landed just as Congressional Republicans were pushing to abandon the affirmative action programs created in the 1960's to stop workplace discrimination and give women and minority groups a boost in the economy.
The Clinton White House took some delight today in noting Mr. Dole's sponsorship of the original legislation. George Stephanopolous, a Presidential advisor, passed around a transcript of Mr. Dole's comments circa 1991 as the commission was being established. Mr. Dole noted then, "You do not have to be a brain surgeon to deduce that something is wrong out there."
Mr. Reich said today that the commission report "could be a step toward bipartisanship" on the affirmative action issue.
"Affirmative action in all respects is about plans and goals, not quotas and preferences. It's one thing when white men talk about minorities and feeling affirmative action is unfair. It's another thing when white men see the difficulties their wives and daughters have moving up the ranks."
Rene Atwood, the commission's executive director, said that its staff, like those at other institutions that attempt to examine the demography of the workforce, could not pin down the numbers of women and minorities at various levels of the economy. It had to rely mostly on 1990 Census data, and those data do not always provide useful, clear breakdowns of job categories. So the commission used a variety of surveys by universities and executive search firms.
The commission agreed not to identify the chief executives it interviewed for the report to assure their candor, but it cited several companies -- Procter & Gamble, Xerox and I.B.M. -- for broad-scale efforts to open their ranks to women and minority groups.
Chief executives, the report said, "attribute the scarcity of minority males at the top -- who they first think of as African Americans -- to a lack of qualified candidates, asserting that demand is high but supply is limited."
Yet the supply has been growing. Between 1982 and 1991, the report said, there was a 36 percent increase in the number of blacks, ages 20 to 44, with a college degree or more.
The commission report suggested that what is really happening is that women and minority groups are not receiving the close mentoring and other support that white men automatically receive from other white men.
And they must combat unfounded stereotypes with which white men need not contend. Hispanic workers, for example, are assumed to be foreign born and lazy. Yet two-thirds were born in the United States, and they have the highest labor force participation rate of all the groups surveyed for the report. Women are perceived as more prone to absenteeism than men. Yet, after excluding time lost for maternity leaves, women are absent from work less often than men, the report says.
As women and minorities strive for top corporate positions, the report says, some white men "feel excluded and angry." They used to "know the rules" and they competed only against each other. Their fear and anger leads them to thwart the progress of others, the report said.

HEADLINE: Separation Anxiety for Home of Bullets and Capitals

DATELINE: LANDOVER, Md., March 11

 BODY:
Since 1973, this Washington suburb has been known nationally as a dateline on the sports pages, the town that Charles Barkley and Wayne Gretzky pass through when their teams play Washington.
But the basketball and hockey stars will soon leave Landover's outdated USAir Arena -- the Capital Center until 1991 -- to play in a fancy new complex in downtown Washington. 
 Abe Pollin, owner of the National Basketball Association Bullets and the National Hockey League Capitals, signed an agreement on March 6 with Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. for construction of the complex, which is expected to start late this year and be completed in 1997.
Like East Rutherford, N.J., home to both the New York Giants and the Jets, and Orchard Park, N.Y., home of the Buffalo Bills, Landover has had a long run as a suburban stand-in for a big city. But not long enough, to hear the locals tell it.
"Without the arena, Landover wouldn't have existed, according to most people," said Tony Berry, a 29-year-old vendor for the Capitals, who was reared here.
"This," Mr. Berry said, waving his arm towards the ice, "is the only reason the area has an identity."
The arena brought more spirit than residents to Landover, a community split by the infamous Washington Beltway, where the population has remained relatively stable at about 5,000 over the last three decades.
Now that spirit may be deflated with the move of the two teams. When a city like Washington decides to recreate its downtown, a suburb like Landover feels the consequences. It has happened before: in Richfield, Ohio, former home of the Cleveland Cavaliers of the N.B.A. and Bloomington, Minn., where the Twins and Vikings once played.
"Clearly, we would very much like to keep the Bullets and Capitals in the USAir Arena," said Wayne K. Curry, the executive of Prince Georges County, which governs Landover. County data show that more than $5.4 million in amusement taxes was collected in the year ending June 30, 1994. Most of that revenue came from Bullets and Capitals games at USAir Arena, where there is a 0.5 percent tax on food sales and a 10 percent markup on everything else sold relating to an event, from tickets to parking to T-shirts.
Landover still has time to come up with something to fill the void, and USAir Arena hopes to be the host of concerts and other sporting events. Its regular tenants, including the Georgetown University basketball team and the Warthogs of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, have not said what they plan to do.
"Losing the teams is not going to kill us," said Dave Barry, a manager of the American Cafe in Largo, Md., one of the few places close enough to the arena to draw fans before and after events. "But it is going to hurt. As messy as D.C. is right now, who knows what's going to happen?"
Andrew Young, who works at a Safeway grocery in Landover and lives in nearby Owens, calls the teams' move to downtown Washington "the wrong idea."
"There's a lot of trouble in the District," Mr. Young said. "Right here's a good spot. It's not a big crime area, it's convenient because it's right off the Beltway. You don't have to fight people begging you for a dollar or watch your back while you find your car."
Richfield has been through the jarring change already. The Ohio town and its larger neighbor Richfield Village lie between Cleveland and Akron, where three major highways meet. The Cavaliers played in the Coliseum there from 1973 until this season.
The team is now in the middle of its inaugural season in Gund Arena in downtown Cleveland, at the heart of city's Gateway Center, and Richfield is part of sports history.
"If you're a little town like Richfield was, and is, it did give you notoriety, and it is a kind of sad identity to lose," said Mayor Ralph Waszaki of Richfield Village.
Robert Luther, one of Richfield township's three trustees, tried to look on the bright side. Although the Coliseum is empty, he said, so is its parking lot.
"I really do not miss the traffic," Mr. Luther said. "It was something terrible. Things just plugged up."
Alice Emmitt, a retired teacher, and her husband, Dan, another Richfield trustee, live next door to the Coliseum. "They left a facility that is still in great condition," Mrs. Emmitt said. "I think it was a waste of money, and I hate to see money thrown away. There sits this white elephant next to our farm. We really didn't want it to begin with. But once we had it, we got along with it."
Life after losing a home team is a different story in Bloomington. After the National Football League's Vikings and baseball's Twins moved from Metropolitan Stadium there to the Hubert H. Humphrey Dome in Minneapolis in 1982, the site was redeveloped into the giant Mall of America.
Lyle Olson, Bloomington's director of finance and administration, said that what the city made from the mall was "a considerable multiple of what it was when we just had the sports teams occupying the site."
Thanks to the mall, city officials say, Bloomington has kept its name recognition. "We have the equivalent of a home game every day in terms of economic benefits to the city," said Larry Lee, the city's director of community development.
In Landover, Mr. Berry, the Capitals vendor, took note of new housing going up in the area and said he did not think the town would die when the teams leave.
"The teams were a nice fit," he said. "I'm sad to see them go. But times go on. And we understand."

HEADLINE: Filipinos Protest Singapore Death Sentence

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: MANILA, March 15

 BODY:
The Government of Singapore, which has tried to portray the debate over its draconian legal system as a clash between Asian and Western values, now finds its courts under attack by fellow Asians who are campaigning to prevent the execution of a Philippine woman this week.
Leading Philippine politicians, human rights groups and church leaders are demanding that Singapore stay the execution of Flor Contemplacion, a Philippine maid who is scheduled to be hanged on Friday for the deaths of another maid and a 4-year-old Singaporean boy in 1991. 
 President Fidel V. Ramos has joined in the appeals, asking that Singaporean prosecutors reopen the case because of new testimony suggesting that Mrs. Contemplacion was framed, and that the other Philippine maid was actually killed by her vengeful Singaporean employer after the boy had accidentally drowned.
The testimony is coming from a third maid, Emilia Frenilla, who has since returned home to the Philippines. Mrs. Frenilla has said that the boy drowned in a bathtub after suffering an epileptic fit, and that the boy's outraged father then killed the maid, Della Maga, who was supposed to be caring for the child.
According to her testimony, Mrs. Frenilla eavesdropped on members of the boy's family as they decided to pin both deaths on Mrs. Contemplacion, who was a friend of Mrs. Maga.
Jaime Cardinal Sin, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in this devoutly Catholic country, has said he will ask Pope John Paul II to intervene with the Singaporean Government to save Mrs. Contemplacion from the gallows.
The case has made for banner headlines in newspapers in Manila for weeks, turning this into the Philippine equivalent of last year's furor over the flogging of an American teenager, Michael P. Fay, who pleaded guilty to vandalism in Singapore.
At the time of the Fay case, Singaporean officials argued that their critics in the United States and elsewhere in the West did not understand Asian values, which, the Singaporeans say, demand strict law enforcement and a preference for the rights of society over the rights of an individual.
But the reaction in the Philippines to the prosecution of Mrs. Contemplacion suggests that Singapore's concept of Asian values is not one shared by all of its Asian neighbors.
For many Filipinos, Mrs. Contemplacion has come to symbolize the plight of millions of Filipinos who are forced by the poverty of their homeland to work abroad, most of them as household servants or construction workers elsewhere in Asia or in the Middle East.
"Every new revelation in the Contemplacion case seems to point at a frame-up and a miscarriage of justice," the Philippine Daily Inquirer said in an editorial this week. "It's no longer Singapore's good will and compassion that are being put to a test here. What's on trial is its system of justice."
The Singaporean Embassy in Manila, which has been the target this week of telephoned bomb threats and of several noisy protests by supporters of Mrs. Contemplacion, did not respond to written questions about the case. In turning down earlier appeals for clemency, Singapore's Government has said she received a fair trial.
Mrs. Contemplacion, 42, worked as a maid in Singapore to support her unemployed husband and their four children back in the Philippines. The children, who had not seen their mother in four years, were allowed to travel to Singapore this month for a final reunion.
Mrs. Contemplacion was arrested in the two deaths in 1991.
Philippine officials say Mrs. Contemplacion initially pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity on the advice of her Singaporean lawyers. Her lawyers said she suffered a type of epilepsy that limited her responsibility for her actions.
But the court rejected the plea and sentenced Mrs. Contemplacion to death. News reports here have suggested that Mrs. Contemplacion had nothing to do with the crime but claimed mental illness on the advice of the lawyers, in hopes of a lesser sentence should she be found guilty.
The uproar over Mrs. Contemplacion followed a furor here in January over the execution of three Filipino contract workers in Saudi Arabia. They were beheaded after they were accused of holding an influential Arab family hostage and then killing four of them. Details of the case were never made public by Saudi officials, although news accounts here have suggested that the Saudi police were responsible for the deaths in a shootout.

HEADLINE: Dollar Falls Sharply Despite U.S. Growth

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday to near-record lows against the Japanese yen and the German mark, despite signs of robust growth in the American economy that could lead to higher interest rates. Still, the stock and bond markets largely shrugged off the fall in the dollar.
The Government said that industrial production and factory capacity rose in February to new 15-year highs and that producer prices rose by three-tenths of 1 percent. In the past, such reports have bolstered the dollar by raising the prospect that the Federal Reserve might increase rates to keep inflation in check. Instead, the dollar continued on its downward course of recent weeks. 
 Financial analysts warned that stocks and bonds might not be able to withstand the impact of a falling dollar for long.

HEADLINE: In French Presidential Race, Lagging Neo-Gaullist Hustles on the Hustings

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: MONTPELLIER, France, March 14

 BODY:
Once the front-runner and now the underdog in the race for the French presidency, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is trying to regain the lead with a new campaign full of hustle and hoopla.
With just five weeks to go before the April 23 vote, and polls showing that close to 50 percent of the voters have not made up their minds, Mr. Balladur clearly hopes to beat the odds by replacing his aloof, stiff image with something a little more hot-blooded. 
 He played openly to the French patriotic pride of about 2,500 people who came to see him in a hangar-size exhibition hall here in the south of France on Tuesday. They blasted air horns and chanted "E-douard! E-douard!" in a kind of noisy delirium that had been notably absent from his campaign until now.
The reaction apparently excited the reserved, gray-haired 65-year- old Prime Minister so much that he jumped up onto a chair and clasped hands in a victory salute, though he never loosened his gray three-button suit.
"I want this to be a dignified campaign," he told the throng, "but we are on earth; we're not angels."
That didn't mean the other candidates should behave diabolically, Mr. Balladur warned in his only allusion to published insinuations that he had cut corners financially and connived to thwart investigations of corruption in his neo-Gaullist conservative party, the Rally for the Republic.
But he conceded that with his earlier strategy of remaining far above the fray, his campaign had gone through "a difficult passage." The Prime Minister now trails his fellow conservative, Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris, and the Socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the public opinion polls.
The latest, a Harris survey published on Tuesday, the day Mr. Balladur was here, predicted 18 percent of the vote for Mr. Balladur in the first round of the two-stage presidential election on April 23, with 21 percent for Mr. Jospin and 28 percent for Mr. Chirac. The winner is likely to be determined in a runoff on May 7.
Mr. Balladur has begun a new campaign that is almost American in flavor. Here he had campaign workers passing out red baseball hats and T-shirts, and he made his entrance to the swelling strains of music made popular by a Gerard Depardieu movie.
Try to picture Bill Clinton getting cheers at a shrimp creole dinner in Louisiana by claiming triumph in the negotiations on the global trade agreement that was concluded two years ago. Mr. Balladur did, saying he had put backbone into his fellow Europeans to fight President Clinton on American attempts to outlaw protectionist measures for movies, audiovisual programming and agriculture.
"We need a stronger France, more confident of itself and of its future," Mr. Balladur said. "Europe, properly recognized and used well, is a source of increased strength for France."
It would be easy to picture the uproar in France if Chancellor Helmut Kohl had said anything like that in his campaign for re-election in Germany last October. Mr. Balladur's platform describes French-German relations as the pivot of European union, but he wants to update the 35-year-old friendship treaty to take account of German unification.
He also said again here that he would push for a common European currency as early as 1997 to eliminate the strains placed on the French economy by the German mark, which has surged recently against the franc and other European currencies as it rose against the dollar.
Mr. Balladur, a conservative who has been Prime Minister for the last two years under the Socialist he hopes to succeed, Francois Mitterrand, has a hard job representing continuity and change simultaneously at a time when people seem to want change, but only if it doesn't hurt them.
So he tried hard to be folksy, gracefully accepting a chocolate-covered coffee bean during a visit to an agricultural research center, and then picking the pieces endlessly out of his teeth with a white handkerchief. But he never lost his smile.
On national television on Sunday night, Mr. Balladur conceded that unlike Mr. Chirac, a veteran of previous French presidential election campaigns, he had perhaps been unprepared for their rigors.
"I am in training," said Mr. Balladur, a former Finance Minister and businessman. "But I am learning to fight back."
Last week, after an anti-establishment newspaper, Le Canard Enchaine, reported that he had made millions of francs through stock options and consultancy fees awarded him by G.S.I., the French computer company of which he had been chief executive from 1977 to 1986, Mr. Balladur took the unusual step of disclosing some of his finances.
He said he had made a total of $550,000 in profits from the perfectly legal sale of company stock when he left the company to go into government, and had been paid $20,000 a month as a consultant to the company from 1988 to 1993, when he became Prime Minister. French news organizations calculated his current net worth at about $4.2 million, triple Mr. Chirac's and several times that of Mr. Jospin.
Mr. Balladur told the television audience that he was a free man who owed nothing to anybody, financially or politically.
Many of the people who turn out for him appear to be on the comfortable side of the French income curve, and the other side of middle age. But Mr. Balladur, like the two other main candidates, says that his first actions as President would be aimed at reducing France's unemployment rate, now above 12 percent.
He said the first thing he would do is legislate a reduction of government-imposed health insurance charges on companies that hire the long-term unemployed by $800 a year per person, with a five-year goal of finding jobs for one million.
On March 25, thousands of supporters from around the country will converge on Le Bourget, north of Paris, for what is intended to be a demonstration of mass popularity. "Free transportation in special high-speed train," announced fliers for that rally. Everybody who came to the dinner here got one.
"France has become a raw and difficult society in which too many people have lost out," Mr. Balladur said. "I don't promise, 'Vote for me and in six months everything will be better'; it will take years of hard work," he said. "I want France to be better off, and the French to be happier than they are now."

HEADLINE: Mideast Goal Of Clinton And Hassan

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
With Israel and Syria set to resume direct talks soon, President Clinton and King Hassan II of Morocco called today for speeding up the quest for Middle East peace.
After a White House meeting with the Moroccan leader, Mr. Clinton spoke of renewed hope and urged the parties to seize what he said was now a real opportunity to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. King Hassan, who is beginning a state visit to the United States, said it was crucial that the tempo of talks between Palestinians and Israelis be quickened. 
 "This newborn peace appears to be threatened by dangers because it's not a full-fledged peace," the Moroccan King warned on the South Lawn of the White House.
The meeting between the two leaders came as Secretary of State Warren Christopher returned from the Middle East with an agreement between Israel and Syria to resume their discussions early next week in Washington. Mr. Christopher told reporters aboard his plane that the United States would play a central role in pressing for progress as the two sides try to work out an agreement on the future of the Golan Heights, and Mr. Clinton called the accord on new talks "a very encouraging development."
At a Rose Garden news conference after their 90-minute meeting, King Hassan praised Mr. Clinton for his "relentless efforts" on behalf of Middle East peace. But the Moroccan leader's comments also underscored the priority that both men said must still be accorded to talks between Israel and the Palestinians, which remain contentious even 18 months after the handshake and agreement between Yasir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin.
The King suggested that "signs of good will" in the Arab-Israeli peace effort could persuade members of the Arab League to lift their economic boycott of Israel. But while the Moroccan King has been active in encouraging other Arab leaders to make openings toward Israel, he would not say today whether he believed it was time for the boycott to be lifted.
Asked today what the White House could do to speed up the Israel-Syria talks, Mr. Clinton said, "We cannot make a peace for the parties." But other Administration officials said an active part would be played by Dennis Ross, Mr. Christopher's Middle East coordinator, who will travel to the region at the end of the month to try to push the discussions to a higher diplomatic level.
In their first stage, the principal negotiators will be the Israeli Ambassador, Itamar Rabinovich, and the Syrian Ambassador, Walid Moallem. But part of Mr. Ross's job during the meetings and on his trip to the region will be to make suggestions about the status of the Golan Heights and other issues that the two countries have been unable to solve since they began direct discussions in October 1991.
As he takes over the next round of shuttle diplomacy in the region, Mr. Ross will be seeking enough common ground to enlist the Israeli and Syrian military commanders in the Washington talks.

HEADLINE: Crackdown on Job-Injury Costs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
Willie Brown, one of the most powerful politicians in California, recently found himself on the other side of the fence from the working people whose causes he likes to champion.
Shortly after Mr. Brown, the Assembly Speaker for California, invested in an Oakland radio station, almost all the employees filed claims seeking workers' compensation for the stress they felt about the changes the owners were making. "At that moment," Mr. Brown told an appreciative audience of insurance executives in New York late last year, "you could be sure that elimination of stress claims was No. 1 on the agenda." 
 With the support of Mr. Brown, California overhauled its workers' compensation system in 1993. One change required that the workplace be the predominant cause of the stress cited in a disability claim, not just a contributing factor of 10 percent or more.
Mr. Brown did not return three telephone calls seeking comment, but such a restriction would have made it much more difficult for the workers at his station to prove that they deserved compensation.
California is not alone. Pushed by businesses and insurers, most state legislatures around the country are reining in growth in the cost of job injuries, now $70 billion a year. They are tightening the eligibility rules for collecting disability benefits, limiting recourse to the courts, attacking fraud, making the workplace safer and in some states cutting benefits.
The new vigilance in workers' compensation coincides with a broader effort in the country to free businesses from expensive lawsuits through tort reforms.
Some people wonder whether the crackdown in workers' compensation has gone too far by denying benefits on technical grounds to workers with real injuries. Already, horror stories are emerging of disabled workers stuck with huge, unpaid medical bills.
But employers, who pay the bills, and insurers are pleased with the changes. Last year, for the first time since 1970, insurers spent less on claims and other costs for workers' compensation policies than they collected in premiums -- 99 cents on the dollar, down from $1.21 two years earlier. When combined with interest and investment gains, workers' compensation profits have grown enough for insurers to cut prices in many states and compete for business they once shunned.
As for employers, the growth of workers' compensation costs has slowed, giving them relief from a financial burden that averages 3 percent of wages but can range as high as 20 percent for workers in high-risk occupations.
These are among the changes that have produced striking results:
*Connecticut no longer awards disability benefits for mental or psychological disorders unless they are the result of an injury. It has eliminated cost-of-living adjustments on disability benefits and has cut some benefits by a third. Insurance premiums in the state have fallen 24 percent in the last two years.
*Texas tightened the eligibility for temporary income benefits. For severely injured workers, it instituted guidelines designed by the American Medical Association to measure the extent of a disability. As a result, even though the number of injuries rose to 283,000 in 1993 from 251,000 in 1991, the number of workers with severe injuries who qualified for special supplemental payments plummeted to 39 from 1,055. Texas also restricted legal appeals by workers of rulings by compensation boards.
*Arkansas required workers to identify the day and time of injuries, a simple measure that state officials say has reduced fraudulent claims. "Before that, workers could just say they got hurt on the job and that was the end of it," said Lee Douglass, the Arkansas insurance commissioner. The state also adopted a medical-fee schedule and mandated a safety program for employers. In January insurance rates fell by more than 12 percent. And 40 insurance companies are doing business in the state, up from six before the reforms.
*California set up a fund, financed by employers, that pays for special teams to go after fraud. Job-injury claims declined to 8.4 for every 100 workers last year, from nearly 10 in 1992.
For many business people, the changes legislated by the states could not come too soon. Karen Keiko White, president of Summit Installation in Gardena, Calif., said she "seriously considered leaving the state" a few years ago, when her business got an insurance bill for $338,000 for 25 workers.
Ms. White had just doubled her work force to install shelves in the Los Angeles library, which had been damaged by fire. But because of a serious injury to one worker a year earlier and a history of other claims she regarded as fraudulent, the insurance cost for each worker had more than doubled.
Her workers' compensation bill, for which she later negotiated a reduction of $100,000, has come down further -- she would not say by how much -- since the California overhaul in 1993. "I haven't seen a fraudulent claim in two years," she said, adding that the company had also hired an adviser to improve safety standards.
But organized labor argues that many of the new state provisions unfairly punish the entire work force for the misdeeds of a few. "The publicity generated by the companies and insurers about fraud has put a stigma on workers' compensation," said James Ellenberger, assistant director for safety and health at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Thomas Sheehan, a former administrative law judge in the Texas workers' compensation system and now a lawyer in Amarillo, Tex., said most cases were settled fairly. "But you still see cases where people are victimized by insurance companies that are too zealous in fighting claims," he said.
Mr. Sheehan cited a client who suffered permanent hearing loss in both ears in an explosion. The client was denied supplemental benefits on a technicality, Mr. Sheehan said: The new Texas standards for measuring a hearing disability compare the hearing in one ear with the hearing in the other. "That case could perhaps be overturned in an appeal," Mr. Sheehan said, "but that costs money."
Another case shows the vulnerability of workers in states in which insurers and employers delay settlements. Loretta C. Shelton, a new worker at a cardboard-cutting factory in Axton, Va., accidentally activated a cutting machine while reaching into it to move a piece of cardboard, amputating her right hand, government records show.
The owner of the plant, Brown Products Inc., a packaging concern in Atlanta, and its insurance company, Zurich Insurance, successfully fought her claims for nearly two years on the ground that Ms. Shelton was guilty of "willful misconduct" for ignoring previous safety warnings, the records show. By the time Zurich agreed to pay the medical bills and disability compensation, Ms. Shelton had to forgo crucial treatment and therapy for her reattached hand.
Mr. Ellenberger of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. complained that state legislatures and regulators were not showing the same zeal in pursuing "the greatest problems with fraud, which are at the companies and insurers." Companies, for example, might hire workers off the books, with no compensation insurance, or misclassify them in low-risk occupations that are less expensive to insure, he said.
Richard D. Levy, staff counsel for the Texas branch of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the efforts in Texas to reduce the involvement of lawyers in the system, while laudatory on the surface, tipped the balance too much in favor of industry.
"The new system is easy for insurance companies to manipulate," Mr. Levy said. In Texas, insurance companies are more than twice as likely as workers to take lawyers with them to hearings, he said. "It's not fair to have an injured worker go up against insurance company lawyers," he said.
Geoff Smith, a vice president at the insurer ITT Hartford, said he did not buy that argument. He said that reducing the role of lawyers was important to assure fairness; in some cases that have gone to juries, he said, lawyers had pocketed big fees, while "some severely injured people were not getting adequate compensation or care, while many people with injuries of low severity were getting more than they should have."
Even some people in the insurance industry's camp question some recent changes. John D. Copeland, a lawyer in Fayetteville, Ark., who often represents insurers, wrote in the Arkansas Law Review last year that in reaction to abuses by some workers, "the pendulum has now swung too far in favor of employers."
In an interview, Mr. Copeland warned that employers might have gone so far in curtailing disability benefits that they might be setting themselves up for a new generation of tort claims through the courts that could be much more expensive than settlements through the workers' compensation system.
But cutting benefits is not the only way to reduce the costs of workers' compensation. Employers are making accident prevention a big part of their efforts to cuts costs, often with a push from state legislators. In some states, like Oregon, in which the number of injured workers has declined even as the work force has grown, companies are required to create safety committees. There is also increasing surveillance by the state-run occupational safety boards.
Employers have an interest in keeping injuries to a minimum, because their safety records help to determine the size of their premiums.
Companies are also reducing costs by getting more involved in the handling of workers after injuries, demanding a say in the medical treatment, rehabilitation and return to work. For example, Ryder System Inc., the truck-leasing company based in Miami, hired nurses to work as case managers and monitor the treatment of injured workers. The claims department at the company is expected to treat injured workers as courteously "as if they were customers," said Tad G. DeOrio, a vice president at Ryder. The hope, he said, is that "workers are not confused and do not feel the need for a lawyer."
Ryder has also worked to promote safety. The upshot: The number of workers' compensation claims at Ryder has fallen by half since 1990.
Despite the big changes in much of the country, many populous states, like New York and New Jersey, have yet to take strong action. In New York, for example, insurers are lobbying for the State Assembly to weaken a law that allows workers to sue the makers of machinery that injures them on the job. Such lawsuits in the last 11 years have accounted for about a half of 1 percent of all workers' compensation cases, but have resulted in more than 11 percent of workers' compensation costs, or $1.8 billion.
William D. Hager, president of the National Council on Compensation Insurance in Boca Raton, Fla., said the reforms in some states were reminding others that "their economic development hinges on keeping the workers' compensation system healthy."
Recently, he noted, legislators in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee asked his group for recommendations. He said he had told them all the same thing: Reduce the incentives for lawsuits, use objective standards for measuring the extent of disabilities and control medical costs.

HEADLINE: Some Drugs Rise in Price At Fast Pace

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Pharmaceutical companies have increased the pace of price increases on many of their best-selling drugs since the collapse of the Clinton Administration's health care proposal last year.
During the battle over health care, drug companies promised to rein in their price rises, keeping them at or below the increase in the Consumer Price Index. That promise, made in an effort to ward off legislated price controls, has almost been kept over all, with drug prices rising 3 percent last year. 
 That pledge, however, has not prevented the drug makers from trying to maximize their profits by pushing up the prices of most of their 20 top-selling drugs.
According to health economists who surveyed drug prices for Families USA, a consumer group based in Washington, the prices of the 20 top drugs jumped 3.6 percent in the last 12 months. The price of Zantac, for example, the No. 1 ulcer treatment, rose 3.7 percent.
And this year it appears that the increases might be getting larger. In January, the price of Mevacor, the most commonly used treatment to lower blood cholesterol levels, went up 4.4 percent and Premarin, a big-selling estrogen product used by women after menopause, jumped 6.4 percent
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, an industry trade group in Washington, said the list prices that were used in the Families USA survey were misleading because they overstated the price increases by half a percentage point.
Wall Street analysts have welcomed the price breakthroughs as harbingers of higher profits for the companies. But consumer advocates and their allies in Congress say the increases are painful for millions of low-income people, especially those living on Social Security. The Medicare program for the elderly does not cover retail drug purchases.
It is not clear yet what response there will be in Washington if the price increases continue, in part because the rises still seem low compared with those of recent years; just three years ago, the overall annual increase in drug prices was 6.1 percent.
Still, the change in pricing is getting attention. "Although the increases in drug prices have slowed down over the past year, prices on the drugs older Americans use most continue to rise," said Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, who is chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.
Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was blunt. "My sense is," he said, "that some of these big drug companies are saying that the heat's off now. They're saying that Congress didn't pass a health care bill last session; they've got a lot of new allies in the Congress, and they can get away with more than they could before."
Joseph P. Riccardo, a drug analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company, said "posted price increases in the U.S. retail market have edged up 4 percent to 5 percent" in the first weeks of 1995. He said worldwide price increases for pharmaceuticals were expected to be at a faster pace this year than in the preceding four years.
Prescription drug prices over all increased 3 percent in 1994, slightly faster than the 2.7 percent general inflation rate, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Through January, the latest available data, overall drug prices and the Consumer Price Index were rising at a 2.8 percent rate.
But prices of the 20 largest-selling drugs, according to economists with Families USA, rose 3.6 percent last year and 3.6 percent during the 12 months that ended on Feb. 28. The Families USA study monitored changes in the manufacturers' list prices to distributors, which reflect changes paid at retail pharmacists by people who do not have drug coverage in their health insurance. Such buying makes up about 44 percent of all drug purchases, according to Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a University of Minnesota economist who helped prepare the survey. Most of the rest is sold through hospitals, health insurance plans and state Medicaid programs.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association said the prices that "pharmacies actually paid" for the 20 top-selling drugs increased only 3.1 percent. That included purchases paid by insurers, which often get discounts from both pharmacies and manufacturers. The Families USA survey was of buyers who do not get discounts.
Max Duink, a retired sheet metal worker in Frewsburg, N.Y., in the western part of the state, said he spent $385 a month for heart, asthma and diabetes medicines for his wife. "A year ago it was about $320," he said. "It's going up faster than our Social Security."
A spokesman for Merck & Company which makes Mevacor, said the price increase when averaged for all of Merck's products was 1 percent, well under the inflation rate. Gary Lachow, the spokesman, said prices of some individual products had been raised by the projected inflation rate plus 1 percent. In raising Mevacor by 4.4 percent, Merck projected that the Consumer Price Index would rise 3.4 percent in 1995.
While the prices of most of the top-selling drugs rose faster than general inflation, prices of many others did not, which kept the overall increase at 3 percent last year. And in the face of market competition, some prices were lowered. For example, the price of Prilosec, an ulcer treatment made by Astra Merck, a joint venture company with the Swedish company Astra A.B., recently went down 2.1 percent.
Audrey Ashby, a spokeswoman for Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which makes Premarin, said it was still a low-cost drug, only about 40 cents a day. She said the company, a division of the American Home Products Corporation, raised the price after Premarin received Federal approval for use as a treatment for osteoporosis as well as for menopause symptoms. She added that the company had committed $200 million to research on possible other uses of Premarin.
Nancy Petarek, a spokeswoman for Glaxo P.L.C., which makes Zantac, said its overall price increases were also no greater than the Consumer Price Index.
John Coster, an economist who worked on the Families USA survey at the University of Minnesota, said some drug makers were raising retail prices of popular drugs to make up for discounts they have to provide on the big purchases made by providers of managed health care.

 While the average price increases of the most popular brand-name presecrption durgs are not as great as they were two years ago, they continue to outstrip the rate of inflation. Graph compares drug costs to the rate of inflation during 1992, 1993 and 1994. Also shown is the percent price change of the top 10 brand-name presecription drugs between March 1, 1994, and March 1, 1995. (Source: Medi-Span/Prime Institute) (pg. D6)

HEADLINE: Senate to Begin Hearings on Operation of Javits Center

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
At a conference on the city's economy last month, Jonathan M. Tisch, president and chief executive officer of Loews Hotels, appealed to public officials and private executives to focus on cleaning up the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
"The most important issue is what do we do with the Javits Center," he said. 
 The call echoed a decade of warnings about the extent of corruption at the center. But only in the last two weeks has a deluge of public attention been focused on the problem, putting the onus on public officials to make good on their promises to rid New York's premiere convention center of corruption.
Today, the State Senate is to begin hearings into the management and operation of the mammoth structure on Manhattan's West Side. The hearings follow comments by Gov. George E. Pataki that he is dedicated to rooting out corruption there, and his call for the replacement of the center's board of directors.
Aides to Governor Pataki said the Governor had been committed to cleaning up corruption at the Javits Center since the beginning of his term and was not being driven to act merely by the recent bad publicity and calls by the city for state action. After he took office in January, aides said, the Governor assigned a team to examine operations at the center, which was built with state financing and operates as an autonomous public benefits corporation. That team, led by Robert Boyle, recently reported to the Governor that there was an "alarming and immediate need" to address the situation at the center, said the Governor's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha.
Mr. Boyle, a former chairman of the board of the Hudson Valley Hospital Center, , will be nominated by the Governor today to be chief executive of the Javits Center, sources close to the Governor said. Mr. Boyle, who was the Governor's campaign treasurer, would replace Fabian Palomino, an appointee of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo who resigned in January.
But today's hearings were called by Republican legislative leaders only last week, after an independent board issued a review of mob activity at the center. And the hearings are expected to focus primarily on problems at the center under a Democratic Governor, Mr. Cuomo.
Before the panel gets an opportunity to question the exhibitors, union leaders and others who have direct knowledge of how the Javits Center operates, members will hear from a parade of Republican officials, including Governor Pataki, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and State Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco.
Mayor Giuliani was thrust into the issue last week when his Deputy Mayor, John S. Dyson, suggested that the state turn the operation of the center over to the city. Mayoral aides said Mr. Dyson made the comments because many business people have been appealing to Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Dyson to take action that would make it easier to do business at the convention center.
Forrest Taylor, a spokesman for the Mayor, said: "The Mayor recognizes that the Javits Center is an asset and wants to make sure that asset is fully exploited."
Indeed, as economic developers and city planners focus on the need to create jobs to replace dying sectors of the economy in the city, tourism is increasingly mentioned as one area with the potential for growth. Officials say a thriving Javits Center is essential to drawing visitors.
The sudden attention on the center also stems from the fact that, as a huge public operation that creates jobs, contracts and prestigious board appointments, it offers significant patronage and power to the person who receives credit for rooting out corruption there.
"The convention center is the type of thing you will see political television commercials about in the future, either as a plus for the Mayor or Governor for having cleaned it up, or from their opponents because it's still a mess," said Hank Morris, a Democratic media consultant.
The list of people expected to testify before the Senate panel includes Mark Schienberg, the executive vice president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, which represents 500 new-car dealers. The group's auto show has been held at the Javits Center each year since it opened in 1986.
Where to hold the 1996 show is in question, Mr. Schienberg said, because costs continue to rise and the Javits Center management has trimmed the number of setup days allotted for the show, to 4 from 10.
"That will call for workers to do double time, and that will double our cost," Mr. Schienberg said.
For this year's show, scheduled for April, the Ford Motor Company is spending about $1.6 million. For the same show in Chicago, Ford is spending about $1 million, he said.
If given the chance, Mr. Schienberg said, he might tell the committee of a meeting he had last year with Mr. Palomino, shortly after the auto show's costs for some services were increased by Javits officials.
"There were about seven people in the room, and I was standing up with blueprints in my hand, giving a presentation," Mr. Schienberg recalled. "Palomino fell asleep. I didn't know what to do. I rattled the blueprints to try to wake him up."
Mr. Palomino, who ran the convention center from 1991 until January, has come under fire in recent days for his management of it. In his defense, Mr. Palomino has characterized the problems as intractable. He has said that he and his inspector general, Sebastian Pepitone, were being unfairly singled out for failing to transform an ingrained culture that existed long before they were around. Both men are expected to testify before the Senate panel, a hybrid drawn from the Finance, Labor and Tourism committees.
Although the panel has invited representatives from the convention center's major labor unions to appear, it is not clear whether they will.


GRAPHIC: At the outset, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was billed as the centerpiece for the renaissance of midtown's West Side. Optimistic New York City and state official predicted that the center would quickly attract major conventions and exhibitions that would directly and indirectly generate $2.3 billion a year in spending and more than 30,000 new jobs.
Chronology: "The Javits Center: A History of Trouble"
Those rosy projections were made in 1979 when the Legislature approved the construction and the issuance of $375 million in state bonds for building costs. But none of those hopes has been fulfilled, and from its inception the center been beset by bid-rigging, organized-crime infiltration, labor-racketeering abuses and financial woes. SELWYN RAAB
 
October 1980 -- First major construction contract for $30 million given to Julius Nasso Concrete Company and S.A. Concrete Company. Anthony Salerno, the underboss of the Genovese crime family and several other mobsters are convicted in 1987 on Federal charges of rigging the concrete bids for the center and inflating costs by about $12 million.
 
April 1984 -- Planned opening date for center postponed because of cost overruns and by problems of manufacturing novel "nodes" or "rods" for glass superstructure.
 
November-December 1985 -- A 13-member board that sets policy for the center appoints John D. Feerick, the dean of the Fordham University School of Law, as impartial arbitrator or "labor czar" to resolve union jurisdictional disputes and prevent work stoppages. Unions representing employees at the center agree to prohibit strikes and featherbedding -- the hiring of unneeded workers for trade shows and meetings.
 
PUB-DATE: April 3, 1986
 
February 1987 -- After one year, trade show exhibitors say that center is plagued by power failures, poor cleaning and maintenance, labor slowdowns and inadequate space for major shows.
 
1989 -- Alair A. Townsend, then a Deputy Mayor in the Administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, says exhibitors are complaining about high costs, no-show jobs and demands for bribes by employees who set up and dismantle displays. Ms. Townsend says complaints were turned over to Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau after center officials failed to take action.
 
Sept. 6, 1990 -- Federal prosecutors in Manhattan file a civil racketeering suit against one of the major unions that dispense jobs at the center, the District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners. The suit asserts that the union used the center as hiring hall for mobsters.
 
January 1991 -- Exhibitors and trade show organizers say in interviews that they are being victimized by excessive costs and thefts. The exhibitors maintain that costs in center are 50 percent higher than in other cities. Most frequent complaints are about unneeded overtime and work rules requiring $80 for an electrician to plug in a lamp, featherbedding by electricians and carpenters and demands by teamsters and laborers for bribes to expedite loading and unloading of materials. The Police Department reports that between $500,000 and $1 million in supplies and equipment are stolen each year from exhibitors.
 
Feb. 5 1992 -- Twenty seven men, including officials of three unions and two former state police officers, are indicted in Manhattan on state charges of extortion, theft and violence in connection with operations at the center. The charges result in guilty pleas by 24 defendants with most receiving sentences of less than one year in prison or probation. Three defendants were cleared. Prosecutors said the cases were compromised by a former state police officer who leaked information to targets of the investigation. Four unions -- carpenters, electricians, teamsters and laborers, agree to new work rules intended to lower costs. Exhibitors will be allowed to screw in a light bulb without having to pay an electrician and to carry packages into the center.
 
PUB-DATE: March 7, 1994
 
October-December 1994 -- Kenneth Conboy, a former Federal judge appointed to investigate misconduct in the carpenters union, reports that two union officials who control jobs at the center are linked to the Genovese family. Most of the carpenters who work at the center, Mr. Conboy charges, are mobsters or ex-convicts.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Prudential Is Putting Its Home Mortgage Business Up for Sale

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
The Prudential Insurance Company of America announced yesterday that it wanted to sell its home mortgage business, one of the largest in the country.
The sale, which analysts said could fetch as much as $1 billion, comes at a time when rising interest rates have caused mortgage lending to drop by more than 50 percent from 1993. The decline has led to big losses at many companies and a flurry of sales, as some have abandoned the business. The Prudential mortgage business, for example, lost $119 million last year, after earning about $150 million in 1993. 
 The withdrawal from the mortgage business, in which profits have fluctuated widely in recent years, is the first big change at Prudential under Arthur F. Ryan, the new chief executive. Mr. Ryan, previously the No. 2 executive at the Chase Manhattan Corporation, said when he arrived at Prudential late last year that he would review the Prudential strategy, adopted in the 1980's, of expanding into many different financial businesses.
Mr. Ryan has said that one of his objectives is to reduce the swings in the earnings of the insurance company, a move that would help attract more customers and perhaps restore the top-notch credit ratings that it lost recently. Earlier this month, Prudential reported a loss of $907 million for 1994, and said that its capital base had been reduced by $1.2 billion, to $9.5 billion.
In addition to its core life and health insurance businesses, Prudential also owns Prudential Securities, the fifth-largest securities firm in the country, a property and liability insurance company, a re-insurance company and a credit card business. Its other businesses related to home mortgages -- Prudential Real Estate Associates, with a network of 5,000 brokers, and Prudential Resources Management, which specializes in the purchase and sale of the homes of workers who have been transferred -- are not for sale, Mr. Ryan told Prudential's employees yesterday.
Speculation that Prudential may sell its securities subsidiary, which lost more than $800 million last year, has been a perennial topic on Wall Street. The losses last year were mostly a result of fines and legal expenses of $1.4 billion arising from improper sales of limited partnerships. But Mr. Ryan has previously said the securities business is not for sale, at least for now.
Stan Strachan, editor and publisher of National Mortgage News, a newspaper based in New York, said enough companies were interested in expanding their mortgage business that "Prudential can cash in readily, earn a big profit and increase its capital." He estimated that the Prudential mortgage business could be valued at $1 billion. It includes the servicing or record-keeping for $75 billion of loans, and it issued $24 billion of new loans last year.
Prudential has valued the businesses to be sold at $175 million on its own books, so a sale for $1 billion would produce a pretax profit of $825 million.
Whatever the exact price, analysts said it would not be out of reach for many of the largest companies in the business, including GE Capital, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, Countrywide Credit, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the BankAmerica Corporation and Nationsbank.
"It's a high quality company, and I expect it will end up owned by a large bank," said Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst at Smith Barney.
Prudential tried to keep apace of the contraction in the industry last year by cutting about 1,200 jobs, or a quarter of its work force. Still, Mr. Ryan said yesterday, the giant insurance company "needs to better focus its resources."

HEADLINE: State Leaders Agree on Revenue Estimate

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 15

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and the state's legislative leaders passed the first milestone on the path to enacting a state budget by agreeing today on how much money they will have available to spend.
Aides to Mr. Pataki had warned only a week ago against the dangers of unjustifiable increases in state revenue estimates. But today, the Governor agreed to raise his previous projection of $33.88 billion by $300 million. That figure, which is for the fiscal year that starts on April 1, fell between the Senate Republicans' estimate that state taxes and fees would generate an additional $214 million and the Assembly Democrats' estimate of $549 million. 
 The leaders may raise their revenue estimates even further because they have yet to agree on a projection of how much will be generated next year by the lottery. The Governor's estimate on the lottery's revenue is $91 million below that of the Assembly.
It is a time-honored practice in Albany to begin budget negotiations with what amounts to an instant discovery of cash. The Governor and Legislature declare that the state can anticipate more revenue than they previously thought and then spend the year hoping that their optimism will not leave them with a deficit the next year.
Mr. Pataki's budget division believes that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature overestimated this year's revenues by almost $1 billion. Some independent fiscal analysts believe that today's agreement may leave the state in a similar hole at the end of the year.
"A sound justification for raising these estimates has not yet been presented," said Cynthia B. Green, vice president for state studies at the Citizens Budget Commission, a private organization. "Certainly, raising revenue estimates to accommodate spending desires has happened in the past, and under this practice, we increase the risk that even larger spending cuts will be needed next December."
Mr. Pataki and the legislative leaders, Speaker of the Assembly Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, each said today that the new projections were based on new information about improving sales tax revenues and economic growth indicators.
"We think that's a real number based on the changing economic forecasts that have come out," Mr. Pataki told reporters after meeting with Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno.
The leaders said they had made little headway in deciding how to construct the budget. Both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, said they were interested in using the additional money to pay for cuts in business taxes, like the gross receipts tax on utility revenues, or to expand the state's credit for property-tax payers who spend a large share of their income on real estate taxes. They also said they would like to soften some of the spending cuts proposed by Mr. Pataki to close a budget gap of more than $4 billion and to pay for proposed tax cuts of $720 million.
Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said significant changes must be made in Mr. Pataki's proposed budget, starting with the Governor's cuts in funding for the state and city university systems, in welfare programs for the elderly and disabled, and in Medicaid coverage for home health care.
Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno have met each day this week to negotiate the budget, and will meet again on Thursday.
Mr. Pataki has threatened to shut down state government if a budget is not passed on time, except for functions essential to the health and safety of New Yorkers.

Mixed Economic Signals Leave Long Bond Unchanged

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, as the dollar remained weak and reports of strong growth in the economy countered a Federal Reserve report that suggested that inflation was unlikely to accelerate.
The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged at 1036/32 for a yield of 7.36 percent, with rates on shorter-maturity bills slightly lower. 
 Bond prices fell nearly half a point in early trading after the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in February.
Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said, "It wasn't so much the slight three-tenths percent uptick in the headline data that spooked the market, but rather the sharp 1.5 percent rise in crude goods and the nine-tenths percent rise in the intermediate goods that got under traders' skin."
The latter figures implied an increase in inflationary pressures, which would cut the value of fixed-income investments.
"With the 30-year bond down through 7.50 percent, the two-year more than a half-point over the Federal funds rate, and the three-month bill trading 25 basis points under," Mr. Hamilton said, "you almost need a Fed easing to justify these levels -- all representative of an overextended market."
The dollar was another big factor in the market's weakness yesterday. Foreign exchange traders in Europe, Mr. Hamilton said, were buying German marks in a flight to quality ahead of the political uncertainty expected from the vote set for today in Italy's Parliament on a resolution of no confidence in the Government.
The market pace picked up in the afternoon as some traders with short positions -- bets that bond prices would drop -- began buying bonds to give themselves some protection against having made the wrong bet. The buying trend was aided by the release of the Federal Reserve's beige book report, which showed considerable slowdowns in both the retail and housing sectors. It also stated that there were few signs that wage and production-capacity pressures would find their way into the prices of finished goods.
In addition, Janet Yellen, a Fed governor, said the increases in interest rates engineered by the central bank during the last year stood a good chance of keeping consumer prices in check; those prices have risen 2.7 percent during each of the last two years.
The pace of buying quickened further after reports that some foreign central banks were purchasing Treasury securities with short maturities, regarded as a safe haven for investing.
In the municipal bond market, investors continued to show strong demand for new securities, traders said. Investors have been paying higher-than-expected prices for some new issues, as offerings so far this year have been down about 60 percent from last year's pace.
Among corporate issuers, the MBNA Corporation sold $526.1 million of floating-rate securities. The securities of MBNA, a bank holding company based in Newark, Del., are backed by credit card debt and were sold in two parts through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch.
The securities were sold through specially formed MBNA Master Credit Card Trust 1995-A, with $500 million of a senior class A issue with a maturity of 9.4 years priced to yield 27 basis points more than the one-month London interbank offered rate. The issue had no cap at the top.
In the second part, consisting of $25.9 million of subordinated class B securities, the maturity was 9.48 years and the yield about 45 basis points over the one-month London rate. It also had no cap.
The one-month London interbank offered rate, which is the rate that international banks charge one another for loans, was at 6.125 percent late yesterday.
According to John H. Nash, an analyst with MCM/CorporateWatch, this is the longest maturity ever for a floating-rate issue backed by credit card debt. Previously, seven years had been the maximum.
Traders said that the senior debt was rated triple A by the major rating agencies and that the subordinated debt was rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service, AA- by Standard & Poor's and AA by Duff & Phelps Credit and Fitch Investors Service.

The Greatest Auction Ever

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
They all laughed at the economist Milton Friedman when he suggested a generation ago that the Federal Government auction off broadcast licenses, instead of giving them away to political favorites.
The last laugh is his; last week, in the greatest auction in history, bidders for wireless places on a tiny fragment of the broadband spectrum committed nearly $8 billion to the U.S. Treasury. 
 And that's only the beginning of the taxpayers' bonanza in the sale of our valuable thin air.
Remember all the talk, eight years ago, of high-definition television, the Japanese invention that was supposed to force us all to replace our 200 million TV sets? U.S. manufacturers, with antitrusters' blessing, formed a "Grand Alliance" to match the Japanese advance.
Along came an unexpected scientific breakthrough. We leapfrogged the analog (feh!) competition into the brave new digital world. This not only produces a knock-your-socks-off picture but expands each TV channel into five or six wireless channels for video, audio, computer data transmission, telephones and every form of communication short of mental telepathy.
Broadcasters smacked their lips at the bonanza. "Advanced television is not just about pretty pictures anymore," F.C.C. chairman Reed Hundt told Edmund Andrews of The Times, one of the few reporters on top of this story. "It's about the digitization of television and a huge range of new services."
It's as if one old oil well gave birth to six new gushers. Broadcasting lobbyists have descended on Congress and the F.C.C. to insure "flexibility" -- that is, to exploit exclusively all the new technology, and to charge viewers for the "ancillary and supplementary" services.
Even if accompanied by payment of rent to the Government, the exclusive arrangement sought by broadcasters would be an outrageous taxpayer ripoff.
What is the digitized, divisible channel worth? Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler gave a hint in an op-ed piece last week, suggesting that noncommercial licensees had a huge hidden asset: "Public broadcasting stations could rent, sell or make use of the additional channels for other telecommunications and information services."
Based only on current uses, which are primitive, the market value of the VHF, UHF, cellular, broadband and narrowband spectrum ranges around $120 billion.
But in the near future, your television set will combine with your computers and telephone and fax machine into a single unit you can hang on the wall or fold up in your pocket. That's soon -- possibly in the next Presidential term.
I've seen not-for-attribution estimates that the market value of the digitized spectrum in that onrushing era will be -- hold your breath -- a half-trillion dollars, give or take a hundred billion.
Before rushing into any giveaway, or any long-term exclusive rent away, we need extended, wide-open, thoroughly debated hearings to make certain of three outcomes:
First, we want a guarantee of spectrum competition. The criterion to determine competition must be scrupulously economic, not jiggered by the Government to introduce sexual or racial or ethnic or ideological favoritism. An appeals court yesterday stayed the F.C.C. from holding auctions that favored minority fronts.
Next, we want a holdback of certain rights. For example, we can solve the campaign finance dilemma justlikethat by putting a right-of-way in the deed setting aside air time, on-line time and direct E-mail advertising for candidates, which could be used or traded or sold by them in election campaigns.
Finally, we want top dollar for our public property. That means a series of Friedman-style auctions. After the purchases, sophisticated risk-takers and their banking backers can enhance the value of their property at no cost to the taxpayer and with great benefit to the consumer.
Where should the spectrum-sale money go? Toward reduction of the crushing national debt. By recognizing our hidden asset of the spectrum, Americans can ride the wave of the future.

The nation's newly prosperous basic steel industry appears on its way to even more prosperity by raising prices for the second time this year on the sheet products that go into automobiles, appliances and a broad variety of consumer and industrial products.
A spokesman for the largest domestic steelmaker, the United States Steel subsidiary of the USX Corporation, said yesterday that the company had notified its customers that it planned to raise prices by an average of 3.5 percent effective July 2. The increases would total $15 a ton for hot-rolled steel, $20 a ton for higher-quality cold-rolled steel and $30 a ton for steel with an additional coating like zinc galvanizing. 
 The proposed price increase comes shortly after the No. 2 company, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, announced an increase of 2 percent, or $15 a ton, on galvanized sheet, also effective July 2.
The stocks of steel companies were up broadly yesterday after the disclosure of the price increase. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of USX rose $1.50, to $32.50; Bethlehem rose 50 cents, to $15.75; the LTV Corporation rose 25 cents, to $15; the Inland Steel Company rose $1.375, to $26.375, and the National Steel Corporation rose 75 cents, to $17.50.
Analysts said the demand for steel continued to be strong, and they expected other companies to follow quickly with price increases.
If it holds, the increase would be the second of the year for the integrated steel companies, most of which returned to solid profitability last year, after several years of losses. Most of the industry raised prices by $30 a ton on Jan. 1, and the increase appears to have held, despite some reports of resistance from buyers.
But some industry specialists questioned whether USX and the other companies would be successful in raising prices in all grades of sheet steel.
"This looks like the last gasp at the end of a pricing cycle," said John E. Jacobson of Jacobson & Associates, a steel consulting firm in Swarthmore, Pa. "The increases might hold in coated and other high- value products, but the hot-rolled situation is unclear."
He said the Nucor Corporation and other so-called mini-mills were moving into the hot-rolled market and, with their low costs, would likely be the price leaders. "U.S. Steel does not have the clout to move the market as it once did," he said.
But Charles A. Bradford, an analyst with UBS Securities, said the weak dollar was likely to reduce steel imports by making them even more expensive than domestic steel. As such, he said, companies would have little choice but to pay higher prices for domestic sheet steel.
"Imports are coming down big time this year," he said. "Given the value of the currency, this is just not a very attractive market." He said the prices for coated steel had risen sharply in Europe, making it uneconomical for steel users to seek alternatives there. Similarly, imports from Japan have declined.
Mr. Bradford said steel users were accepting the price increases of the last two years as necessary to get needed raw material. "I've talked to big steel service centers and they say they are paying the January increase and their customers are paying them," he said.
Steel service centers buy large lots of steel from the mills and break them down into smaller quantities for sale to manufacturers.
The pared-down domestic steel industry has been running nearly flat out for the last two years to meet the demand of an economy that some analysts say is hungrier for steel than in the past. The industry has invested heavily in equipment that has improved the quality of steel and lowered the cost of making it.
Meanwhile, the mini-mills, which rely on scrap rather than iron ore, have begun moving into flat-rolled steel, the last stronghold of the integrated producers.

Austerity and Rates of 92% Fail to Perk Up the Peso

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 15

 BODY:
A tough new economic plan and interest rates of more than 90 percent were not enough to rekindle much confidence in Mexico today as the peso tumbled an additional 5 percent and investors expressed worry that the country's problems would continue to worsen.
The peso closed at an exchange rate of 6.95 to the dollar, which means that one peso now equals little more than 14 cents, compared with almost 29 cents before the Government first devalued last December. 
 The austere new recovery plan has proved hard to sell to skeptical investors who have seen earlier plans crumble. The initial enthusiasm shown after the latest plan was announced last week seems to have faded quickly.
"Most people have taken a wait-and-see attitude with Mexico," said Brian M. Barish, vice president for emerging markets at Lazard Freres & Company in New York. "The new plan might work, but nobody is really willing to commit meaningful amounts of money to see if in fact it will."
In the measures introduced last week, taxes are increased sharply, the prices of state-produced goods like gasoline rise by a third and Government spending is cut 10 percent. Officials vow to stick to a tight monetary policy that will reduce the supply of pesos in the economy and eventually lead to a stabilization of the exchange rate, even if there is no formal method for controlling the currency.
For the first time since 1989, the Government sold two-week treasury certificates. The annual rate for them was 92.5 percent, the highest in seven years. The issuance of high-yield, two-week certificates was seen as indication of the Government's hope that conditions will improve in the third quarter of 1995.
Rates were set at 82 percent for one-month certificates and 85 percent for three-month certificates. The Government did not issue its usual six-month and one-year certificates.
However, even in the short term, such sky-high rates will strangle an already badly weakened economy. For example, the interbank rate, which is used as a guide for many consumer and business loans, nearly reached 110 percent.
Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz was in New York for a second day selling the new plan to Wall Street investors, who for the most part said they were willing to give the plan a chance even though they harbored doubts that it would succeed.
The Mexican stock exchange received a modest boost, closing at nearly 1,612, an increase of 1.3 percent, largely on the belief that for foreign investors, stock values in Mexico rise when the peso weakens and a dollar buys more.
Some financial analysts here thought the peso had weakened in anticipation of more than $700 million in Government bonds that mature this week. The bonds, called tesobonos, are pegged to dollars but are paid out in pesos. Investors who redeem their maturing bonds take the pesos into the market looking for dollars, creating a demand for dollars and an oversupply of pesos.
Jonathan E. Heath, an independent economist in Mexico City, said few buyers or sellers were still active in Mexico's currency market. "If you have very few buyers going to the market where there are no sellers, the rate goes up," Mr. Heath said. "I wouldn't be surprised if every once in a while you see the peso bouncing up to the same level again."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Price of Gasoline Rises Sharply On Signs of Tightening Supply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gasoline prices surged yesterday after Government reports showed supplies were tightening for the first time in weeks. Other energy prices also gained.
On other commodity markets, lumber prices plunged and soybeans were sharply higher. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 0.97 point, to 236.64. 
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for April delivery rose 1.25 cents, to 54.04 cents a gallon.
Gasoline prices had been sinking as many states balked at using a reformulated grade of gasoline that is less polluting. The reformulated grade that is traded on the exchange contains an ether additive, which raised health concerns among officials of some states.
Analysts speculated yesterday that many refiners halted gasoline production in the face of the sinking prices prompted by the uncertainties around the reformulated grade. That cutback was reflected in the American Petroleum Institute's regular weekly report on inventories, which was released after the market closed on Tuesday.
The institute's report showed that refinery production over all climbed to 91.7 percent of capacity last week but that gasoline production fell.
Unleaded gasoline output fell 3.5 percent, to 7.1 million barrels a day, and production of the reformulated gasoline fell nearly 6 percent, the report said.
"The refinery runs are very high, but the production of gasoline and reformulated gasoline did not increase," said Tom Bentz, director of the energy division for ING Derivatives Clearing Inc. in New York.
With many refineries likely to be shut soon for routine seasonal maintenance work, there could be an increased chance of shortages during the peak driving season, Mr. Bentz said.
The rise in gasoline prices lifted other energy contracts. Crude oil for April delivery rose 17 cents, to $18.11 a barrel, and the April natural gas contract rose 3.6 cents, to $1.506 for 1,000 cubic feet.
The expiring March contract for lumber fell $8.40, to $272.20 for 1,000 board feet on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. May lumber fell $7, to $292 for 1,000 board feet.
Investors were squaring their positions in advance of tomorrow's report by the Commerce Department on housing starts in February.
Lumber traders are betting that rising interest rates have led to a decline in housing starts of as much as 2 percent, analysts said.
Soybean prices rose sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade on an increase in optimism about export prospects. March soybeans rose 8 cents, to $5.7650 a bushel.
The rally was mostly technically driven, with investors viewing the weaker dollar as a sign that exports would increase. A weak dollar makes American commodities cheaper for foreign buyers.
Soybean prices also gained as investors began to adjust their positions for the seasonal shift to summer trading, said Steve Freed, director of research for ADM Investor Services Inc. in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The dollar also rises, but not so much lately. Why is that?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE weighty dollar, anchor to the world's monetary system, has once again torn loose in turbulent financial seas.
Why did it happen now, even as the Federal Reserve was being congratulated for navigating so cleverly between the Scylla of inflation and the Charybdis of recession? Was this just a preview of worse to come? 
 Surjit Bhalla, a currency strategist for the Deutsche Bank, answers with candor uncharacteristic of his profession. "I just don't know," he says. "At times, economists ought to be humble."
But never fear: there is more to this column than nautical metaphors. Try these ideas on for size.
 
THE CRASH WASN'T AS BAD AS IT LOOKED Yes, the dollar is down by roughly a fifth against the German mark, Swiss franc and Japanese yen, compared with its peak over the last year. But the dollar is up substantially against the currencies of two of its largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. J. P. Morgan's trade-weighted index of the value of the dollar against 19 currencies is down only 4 percent since the beginning of 1995 -- and only 2 percent since the last time the dollar got mugged, in October.
Robert Lawrence, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, adds that this asymmetry may even offer Americans an unexpected bonus. Since Germany and Japan are America's major competitors in third markets, the appreciation of the mark and the yen are good news for American exporters, like Caterpillar, Citibank and Motorola, whose costs are largely denominated in dollars.
But by the same token, Mr. Lawrence suggests, the dollar's appreciation against the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar has softened the blow for American consumers, who will benefit from improved terms of trade with these two neighbors. And it will reduce the lingering pressure on the Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher as a damper against import-led inflation.
 
OR YOU WERE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE While the phenomenon was little noted in America, Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, says that the latest plunge of the dollar is part of a broader flight by cash holders toward the perceived safety of the yen and the mark. Portugal and Spain, questionably managed economies whose exchange rates fluctuate within predetermined bands, were both forced to devalue.
Spain and Portugal are minor players in the European currency game, but Italy, Sweden and Britain are not. And while all three managed to keep their currencies within target ranges against the German mark, the drama exacerbated Europe's continuing difficulties in making the transition to monetary union. In a world of highly integrated capital markets, it has become all too clear that events in Mexico or Indonesia can affect exchange rates between France and Austria.
 
WHERE THE DOLLAR GOES, IRONY FOLLOWS Since the 1970's, economists and statesmen have been fretting over the lack of will in the advanced industrial nations to coordinate their economic policies. But Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs suggests that the explosive growth of capital mobility in the last few years may accomplish what high-minded pleas to serve the commonweal could not. After all, the price of not keeping one's financial house in order these days is often a noisy and costly currency crisis.
 
GOOD NEWS IT WASN'T The dollar rises and falls -- but more often the latter. In 1986, a dollar bought 2.2 marks and 170 yen; today those figures are down to 1.3895 marks and 89.50 yen. Even adjusting for relative rates of inflation and the shift in American trade toward Asian and Latin countries with weaker currencies, the effective exchange rate of the dollar has decreased by about 20 percent.
Mr. Lawrence worries that this reflects a decline in the "competitiveness" of the American economy in the sense that only economists take seriously: Foreigners are now demanding more of our stuff in return for less of theirs. He speculates that this reflects improvements in the relative quality and reputation of products made elsewhere.
That is not so terrible; indeed, it meshes with the prediction that free market economies will sooner or later converge in their capacities to innovate and grow. But an alternative explanation, offered by Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, is unambiguously grim. "To understand the long-term decline of the dollar," he says, "look at America's low savings rate."
For more than a decade, America has sustained its living standard with a lot of help from its creditors. Should it really come as a surprise that as the foreign debt mounts it takes ever more dollars to induce foreigners to sustain the binge?

HEADLINE: Education Transfers, and Stops;
Public Schools Are Struggling With High Student Turnover

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
It is March, and Marie Pompeo-Melone, the nurse at Public School 8, is still registering new students -- 25 in the first eight days of the month alone.
The students keep coming, but the seams of the school do not burst because others are leaving just as fast. In 1993, the school had a mobility rate of 89 percent, according to the State Education Department, meaning that 89 percent of the children spent part of the year elsewhere. Ms. Pompeo-Melone's file cabinets are crammed with their transfer papers, and her head swims with their faces and names. 
 "I can't tell you the last time there was a day when I had no transfers," Ms. Pompeo-Melone said. "It's just all the time. Words cannot describe how mobile it's become."
P.S. 8 is not alone. Throughout the country, especially in poor areas, schools are struggling with student turnover rates of 70, 80 and 90 percent. A 1994 report by the General Accounting Office found that nationwide, 17 percent of third graders had attended three or more schools since first grade. At many urban schools, that third-grade percentage is often double.
The consequences can be troubling for both schools and students. Children who move often are more likely to fail a grade and to have behavioral problems than those who do not, according to a 1993 study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Even a short move is often stressful, said David Wood, an author of the study and a pediatrician at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
Lillian Soto was in first grade in Puerto Rico, split the second grade between schools in Hoboken and Jersey City, attended P.S. 8 for third, fourth and fifth grades, transferred to another Jersey City school for sixth grade and now, as an eighth grader, is back at P.S. 8. Lillian said she did not know why her family had moved so much. But recently, she said, her mother has been thinking about returning to Puerto Rico. Lillian, 13, said her brothers all wanted to go. But she will resist.
"She didn't want to let me finish the eighth grade," she said. "I don't want to keep moving to different places. I'm tired already."
The question, educational experts say, is this: Can any effort to improve public schools succeed if the schoolhouse door is a turnstile?
"Do we really have a prayer of educating these kids?" said L. Scott Miller, author of a study of student mobility for the Council for Aid to Education. "I say no."
Education experts say they have only started examining the problem in recent years, and as a result there are few data, making it difficult to know if the mobility rate is growing worse. But at P.S. 8, the teachers have no doubt.
"Years ago I could see a little kid in the first grade and that kid was here at graduation," said Linda Herman, who has taught at P.S. 8 for 30 years. "That was most. Now, it's a handful. Everything has just changed so."
For some families, moving means enhanced fortunes as a parent takes a better job or buys a larger home. But among the nation's most transient families, it is often poverty and its complications that lead to a change in address. A parent loses a job and is evicted. An unemployed mother bounces from the house of one relative to another. An immigrant gives up on his dreams and returns to his homeland.
Poor families move twice as often as those that are not poor, according to a report by the Bureau of the Census. A study by the Council for the Aid to Education linked frequent moving to unemployment, immigrant status, the shortage of low-income housing and problems like drug use, violence and child neglect.
"Mobility is both a cause and a symptom," said Mr. Miller, author of the study.
The stress of mobility weighs most heavily on the student. But a fluctuating population can also paralyze the school. Teachers find it hard to maintain lesson schedules and get to know children and parents. Paperwork overwhelms everyone, from the principal to the nurse.
Each new student disrupts the class and sidetracks the teacher as she tries to figure out where, educationally, the new child stands, said Linda Stokes, a second-grade teacher at P.S. 8.
"If the kid is behind, that's a problem," she said. "If the kid is ahead, it's a problem. Either way, now you have to accommodate the kid, but meanwhile you still have the children that have been there."
Teachers and administrators say it is unfair to judge them by the standardized test scores of students they have not taught -- students who may fare well but are more likely to score poorly on such tests. At P.S. 8, a student from California arrived early this month and took the state's Early Warning Test five days later.
"It's a big issue," said Linnea Weiland, director of urban education for the State Education Department. "The urban districts complain that the suburban districts don't have these problems and that it skews the results."
P.S. 8's working-class neighborhood seems too solid to produce such migratory children. Its modest houses look out on clean sidewalks. A few blocks away, elderly women push carts through the Central Avenue shopping district. Teachers and students said they felt safe on the neighborhood streets.
Because Jersey City does not have middle schools, its elementary schools are large. With more than 1,350 students in kindergarten through grade eight, P.S. 8 is the city's largest elementary school. The three-story, brown-brick building looks like a high school. The halls are so long teachers sometimes walk them in sneakers for exercise.
New Jersey's mobility figures may be higher than other states' because they include students who transfer in or out during the first few weeks of school. (The rate is calculated by dividing the number of students who transferred in or out by the number of students present for any part of the year.)
New York City, for instance, does not count students who transfer until Oct. 1, after schools have been in session for several weeks, and that lowers the rate compared with those in New Jersey districts.
In New York City, the mobility rate for elementary and middle schools in 1993-94 was 27 percent, according to the Board of Education. The New Jersey Education Department does not compile a statewide mobility figure.
However the calculation is done, P.S. 8 educators say the crisis is real. "It's unbelievable," said Pat Farrell, the guidance counselor. "Sometimes a second grader will have eight different past addresses."
Ms. Farrell said the school's proximity to Union City, Hoboken, Bayonne and New York might contribute to its high turnover.
The district is predominately Hispanic, and many students were born in Ecuador, Mexico, El Salvador or Puerto Rico. Every April brings a large influx of Spanish-speaking students into Joanna Veloz's bilingual third-grade class.
"That's when a lot of the Spanish countries finish school, and the parents decide to come on over," Ms. Veloz said.
Linda Herman, an eighth-grade teacher, said the spring also brings a group of eighth graders who are in danger of failing at their old schools.
"A lot of them think the records aren't going to catch up, and that they'll be able to come here and graduate and be promoted," she said.
Ms. Pompeo-Melone said she knew of several cases in which children left P.S. 8 after teachers suggested they be tested for learning disabilities. In one case, officials at the child's new school called, and Ms. Pompeo-Melone told them of the plan to test for a learning problem.
"They said, 'O.K., we'll continue that here,' and the child picked up and left again," she said. "It's a form of running away for a lot of these parents."
The children themselves often have only a vague understanding of why their families must move.
"We just move a lot to different housing projects," Lillian said.
Stephanie Nazario, 13, has attended P.S. 8 since kindergarten. But last year, her best friend of many years transferred to P.S. 28.
"Sometimes people move because their father lost a job," she said.
Lillian said, "Maybe it's because they get tired of the place they're in."
Latasha Foster said, "Grown-ups -- that's their favorite thing, moving." She added, "They just want to move around and around. They want to see different places."
Latasha, 13, went to school in New York until the third grade, then attended P.S. 8 for two years. But during the summer before her fifth-grade year, her mother moved the family to Washington. Latasha said she was academically ahead of her classmates in Washington. Still, she did not like the school or the city.
"It was different -- the way people go about themselves and talk," she said. "It was countrylike."
Norma Reynoso, 11, attended Catholic schools until the third grade, then transferred to one public school for fourth grade, and to P.S. 6 for fifth grade. She entered P.S. 8 in September, after her family moved into the neighborhood.
"I didn't want to come here," she said. "I still feel like I want to go back. A lot of people liked me at Number Six. I used to make a lot of friends."
There are some grass-roots efforts to address the problem. In 1988, a group of landlords in Rochester started a program to educate parents about high mobility, said David Schuler, president of the Apartment Owners Association. Members intervened in housing problems and helped change the way the county pays the rent of welfare recipients, a method that Mr. Schuler said had encouraged people to move often.
The group also tried to build community support for School 9, one of Rochester's largest schools. Its mobility rate has dropped from 73 percent in 1988 to 48 percent in 1993, the last year for which figures were available, district officials said.
Latasha Foster said her mother was planning to move again once Latasha completed eighth grade. But Latasha's acceptance into Jersey City's academic high school changed her mind.
"I don't think your parents know what you go through," Latasha said. "My mother lived in the same neighborhood growing up. She doesn't understand. They think kids can make friends really quickly. But some people can't."

HEADLINE: Whitman Bond-Recycling Plan Would Provide $500 Million to Stimulate Housing

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 15

 BODY:
By recycling state mortgage bonds and refining construction rules, New Jersey housing agencies will put more than $500 million into urban and suburban low- to medium-income housing in the next nine months.
The program announced today by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman will promote home ownership in cities, where ownership rates are low, and smooth the way for apartment construction in the suburbs, where rental units are scarce. The Governor said one part of the program would produce at least 1,500 city homes. 
 The housing plan follows the pattern of past ventures of a Republican administration with an active social imagination but with no cash to spare for new projects. Rather than seeking new money, the plan relies on recycling a modest increase in borrowing from the state mortgage agency to multiply, or leverage, in Mrs. Whitman's favorite term, limited resources to multiple uses.
State officials pointedly offered several urban elements in today's proposal as a rebuttal to criticism leveled at the self-help urban agenda announced by the Governor last week, which had neither a timetable nor specific improvement plans.
In contrast, most of the money raised for the housing program will be directed to urban home-ownership programs or the rehabilitation of city dwellings. "When you encourage ownership, the owner has a commitment not only to the four walls of that particular property, but to the community at large," Mrs. Whitman said.
Home ownership rates in New Jersey's cities are below 30 percent, in contrast to ownership rates above 70 percent in the suburbs -- statistics that Democrats turned against the Governor's proposal.
"This plan's focus on home buying rather than affordable rental units shuts out a large segment of our urban population, perhaps 7 out of 10 urban residents, who need rental housing before they can dream of owning a home," said Senator Bernard F. Kenny Jr., a Hoboken Democrat and a party spokesman on housing issues.
The plan rests on exploiting $150 million in unused bonding capacity by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, a state agency that acts like a nonprofit bank, selling bonds, lending the proceeds to first-time home buyers and repaying the bonds from the buyers' monthly mortgage payments.
Using a change in the rules authorized by the State Attorney General, the mortgage agency will lend the new bond funds twice, first as construction loans to builders, then as mortgages to buyers of the builders' houses as they are completed.
In that way, according to the plan's logic, $150 million becomes $300 million but does not become new debt for the taxpayers, the state emphasized, since mortgage agency borrowing is separate from state obligations.
The Division of Community Affairs, which oversees the mortgage agency and will be in charge of today's program, took pains after Mrs. Whitman's announcement to say that the Governor was not increasing the state's indebtedness.
The program lets builders raise construction cash by selling Federal tax deductions to investors. And by making builders use more of their own money to qualify for the credits, the state expects to turn $14 million in Federal tax credits into $70 million worth of housing investment.

HEADLINE: Strong Yen Aids Japan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your front-page article March 8 on the dollar's continuing fall states that a "7 percent rise in the value of the yen in recent days will cost Japanese companies billions in lost products on exports." The yen has risen approximately 10 percent in the last two months, which means that all the food and fuel Japan eats and burns will be bought 10 percent cheaper in world markets. 
 Japan will purchase all the materials for exports 10 percent cheaper than the equivalent cost for American industrial companies. Japan controls its internal labor costs. Since Japan can now buy all its materials at 10 percent cheaper, because raw materials are traded in dollars, it can buy 10 percent more.
Another way of looking at it would be that exclusive of labor, 1 in 10 Japanese autos would cost nothing versus dollar-based American companies.

HEADLINE: In Jersey City, It's Earning by Learning

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Paying Children to Read Isn't Cheap, or Right" (letter, March 9) attacked Newt Gingrich and his Learning by Earning program. 
 Here in Jersey City, we are well under way on our first Earning by Learning program. The fourth graders of Public School 5 have read their way into the second half of the initial effort. Mayor Bret Schundler and I intend to spread the program all across the city.
The program is based on the premise that children don't read well because they don't read often,
and they don't read often because they don't read well. Reading all too often is a chore to the young. Unfortunately, this happens where socioeconomic conditions preclude broad reading opportunities. Since today's society is heavily motivated by economics, can we not use those economics as a valid motivational tool when the end result is improved reading skills and greater appreciation of reading? Academic success is based on the ability to read well and to comprehend.
Our program begins with school reading specialists and classroom teachers. It involves library personnel, parents and college students as facilitators and monitors. Where these programs have been implemented, there have been increased and improved reading practices among children.
In Jersey City, the child is not handed $2. There is discussion of the child's plans for his or her money with a direct point to educating the child about financial planning, saving and more.
We encourage the child's opening of a bank account, and we involve the local bank and banker in the process. We also urge the bank to match the dollar amount the child deposits or to match the amount in the form of a donation or a gift to the child's class or school.
The National Westminster Bank Corporation presented its annual community spirit award to Jersey City for this program, and the attendant cash prize went directly into the program. We intend to reach out to more members of the corporate, business and banking community for involvement.

HEADLINE: Economy Shows Some Signs of Strength, but Dollar Falls Sharply

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Even as consumer spending appears to be tailing off, American industry pushed solidly ahead in February and prices obtained by producers showed signs of acceleration, according to Government figures released today.
While the latest reports added to anxiety over inflation, the Federal Reserve helped calm them with fresh evidence from its regional banks around the nation that the economy was slowing to a more sustainable pace. 
 Production at factories, mines and utilities climbed five-tenths of 1 percent, somewhat more than expected by most economists, with their combined operating rate moving up two-tenths of a point, to 85.7 percent of capacity. That pushed the operating rate of American industry to another 15-year peak, the highest level since 1979.
"The data so far for the first quarter suggests a dramatic slowing in the consumer sector while the industrial sector continues to run in high gear," Laurence H. Meyer, a St. Louis economic consultant, said today.
Partly as a consequence, the accumulation of inventories on store shelves and in warehouses during January posted its biggest increase since August.
Prices received by producers of finished goods rose by three-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month in February. The so-called core rate of inflation that excludes food and energy moved up a bit faster than in January, or three-tenths of 1 percent.
The Labor Department's report also showed that the prices of products at earlier stages of production rocketed ahead, with intermediate goods climbing by nine-tenths of 1 percent and crude goods by 1.5 percent.
Analysts and policy makers have been wondering for months when at least part of this pressure would begin to emerge from the end of the pipeline and affect finished goods -- those ready for sale to the final business or individual user.
Today, Janet L. Yellen, a Federal Reserve governor, said she was still somewhat surprised that "we have thus far seen so little pass-through of higher raw and intermediate materials prices into the Consumer Price Index."
The consumer prices report for February is to be issued on Thursday.
Early in the day, the tentative evidence in the Labor Department report that the pass-through process may be under way unnerved the bond market and pushed interest rates up. But that move was largely offset later by a contradictory assessment in the Fed's periodic survey of business conditions throughout the country.
"Although commodity prices continued to rise, several districts note that the rate of increase has decelerated," the survey, known as the beige book, stated in its summary of the anecdotal findings from its 12 districts. "There is little evidence that strength in labor markets or increases in commodity prices have spilled over into wages or prices of finished goods."
Over all, the report -- compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York based on information collected through March 5 -- suggested that "the pace of the economic expansion has moderated over the past two months." Half the districts found activity slower and the rest described them as "mixed."
The economic strength indicated by the reports on producer prices and factory capacity may somewhat increase the chances that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its March 28 policy meeting to keep inflation in check. Still, the dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen and the German mark, even though hints of higher rates would normally serve to lift it.
Indeed, in recent days, four of the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board expressed little enthusiasm for raising rates further, despite the decline in the dollar and some other signs of economic growth. The four governors said the economy was still slowing to a point of steady, sustainable growth with moderate inflation.
February's rise in industrial production -- about twice the January growth but half that in December, after offsetting revisions -- reflected increases in light trucks and business equipment and from a 2.6 percent surge in utility output that reflected winter temperatures.
Factory output rose four-tenths of 1 percent, to a level 6.9 percent above that of February 1994, the Fed's report also showed, while the operating rate for factories was unchanged at 85.1 percent. Motor vehicle assembly was at an annual rate of 13 million, compared with 12.9 million in January.
The beige book, which is part of the preparation by the Fed for meetings of its Open Market Committee, stated that the dive in the value of the Mexican peso had hurt retail sales all along the border and, according to one respondent, "throughout Texas."
But capital goods industries have been "particularly robust," with the Cleveland district reporting heavy export demand. With plants running flat out and the dollar down, said L. Douglas Lee, economist at NatWest Washington Analysis, inflation pressures could emerge from "two sources -- from both imported and exported goods."
Unlike January, when food prices fell and energy soared, these items both rose moderately last month while prices for prescription drugs jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent and over-the-counter drugs jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Intermediate-stage goods, which advanced 1 percent for the second straight month when food and energy are excluded, included a 1.3 percent surge for metals and other durables used in manufacturing that followed a 1.8 percent leap in January. Aluminum mill shapes rose 6.4 percent and cold rolled steel sheet rose 4.2 percent, increases partly offset by declines for copper and brass mill shapes.
Nondurable materials used in factories surged another 1.7 percent, with alkalies and chlorine up 10.6 percent and medicinal and botanical chemicals up 2.6 percent. Primary organic chemicals, however, turned lower by nine-tenths of 1 percent and inedible fats and oil and paint materials also fell after rising in January.
The price of containers accelerated to a 3.9 percent increase last month from 1.9 percent, with aluminum cans soaring 19.6 percent.

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, A Time for Planting

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
ON a desolate corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in the South-Central neighborhood recently, a group of fidgety fifth- and seventh-grade students from two local schools were being taught a lesson in urban renewal, environmental conservation and civic responsibility.
The only tools of learning they needed were a square of barren earth, a shovel and gardening gloves. 
 "How do trees help us?" asked Andy Lipkis, the founder of Treepeople, a California environmental, educational and training organization, as he handed Ana Reyes, 9, a Canary Islands pine seedling, one of 30 for the neighborhood.
"They give us water and make the air cleaner," she answered, and smiled proudly as Mr. Lipkis nodded.
The newly planted trees will also beautify a community in which empty lots from burned-out businesses stand as drab reminders of the riots that erupted in 1992 after four white police officers were acquitted of assault in the videotaped beating of a black motorist, Rodney G. King.
Mr. Lipkis's largely volunteer, nonprofit organization, has used the simple act of planting trees not only to educate the young and to enhance this city's esthetic landscape, but also to bridge the chasm between the city's wealthy enclaves and its low-income communities. Both have endured painful wounds recently.
Since 1977, the group's 18,000 members, 1,000 trained volunteers, and neighborhood residents have planted an estimated 1.5 million trees citywide. In 1986, with the help of Pan American World Airways, Treepeople airlifted thousands of fruit trees to Africa, where they helped train groups to plant and maintain them.
Through its planting programs, the group has taken youths who had never seen beyond the worn, cracked sidewalks of South-Central Los Angeles and shown them the wild hills of Malibu. And it has taken rich children from privileged havens like Malibu, Pacific Palisades and Bel Air to the streets of South-Central and to nearby Pico-Union -- neighborhoods where the average lives of the trees, at 40 years, will be longer than the lives of many young black and Hispanic men living nearby.
"The plantings brought together young people from two culturally and economically disparate sections of the Los Angeles area and allowed them to interact with one another as partners of the same extended community," Mr. Lipkis said as he guided a visitor through the Baldwin Hills and South-Central sections to show off young, healthy pine and magnolia trees. "It's also a vehicle to help remove stereotypes and fears."
The trees are also helping to restore natural beauty to a city that has been plagued by disasters from earthquakes to fires, droughts to floods.
"The public perception is that this place is dying, and without having to go through more disasters, we have the ability to sow seeds of a whole new city," Mr. Lipkis said. "The city can have an environmental rebirth, which in turns means an economic rebirth."
Like a latter-day Johnny Appleseed, Mr. Lipkis has expanded Treepeople's mandate beyond planting to include a citizen forestry program that trains local residents to care for trees, an environmental education program that shows children how to recycle and a proposed watershed-management project. In 1993 alone, Treepeople distributed 3,000 fruit trees -- apricots, peaches, pears, figs and apples -- to residents of low-income areas.
Rather than have the organization do the planting, Mr. Lipkis encourages residents to put their hands in the soil and by doing so to help improve their communities.
Eudora Russell of Baldwin Hills discovered a novel way to reduce graffiti in her neighborhood: cover the walls with vines. Delores Reese turned an abandoned, weedy, trash-filled lot on South Fairfax Avenue into an urban forest of Bradford pear trees. Emboldened by that effort, she formed her own nonprofit urban forestry group, called Green Islands in the City.
In some parts of South-Central, however, residents appreciated the beauty of trees and took good care of those on their own properties, but they were reluctant to have trees planted on the streets for fear they would attract beer-drinking loiterers or drug dealers.
Over time, Treepeople has managed to assuage such doubts.
After the riots of 1992, Treepeople organized its largest single urban planting, seven miles of trees in one day -- 300 in all -- along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Scores of residents helped in the planting; others agreed to keep watch over the trees. For the last two years, Treepeople has marked Martin Luther King Jr. Day by planting more trees in South-Central and areas nearby.
Mr. Lipkis's involvement in conservation began 25 years ago when as a 14-year-old camper he learned that smog from Los Angeles was killing the trees in his summer camp in the San Bernardino National Forest. He spent three weeks working with two dozen other campers to revive the dying forest by planting smog-tolerant seedlings obtained from the California forestry division and private nurseries. When still in high school, he organized volunteers to plant and adopt trees, an effort that resulted in the founding of Treepeople in 1973.
Today, Treepeople has a staff of 34 and a budget of $2 million, which comes from private contributions and grants from the city, corporations and foundations. It members, who include Hollywood celebrities like Gregory Peck and the producer David Zucker, pay $25 a year and often make additional donations.
Even now, at 39, Mr. Lipkis still exudes a dogged youthful idealism.
He has been able to persuade tree farmers to turn over their surplus plants. He pestered city officials until they turned over an abandoned fire station situated on 45 acres on Mulholland Drive, near Coldwater Canyon, for the group to use for its headquarters, tree nursery and environmental education center for the more than 75,000 schoolchildren who visit each year.
He used the riots to create good will, taking youths from Malibu to South-Central to help with the cleanup. Some of those same youths returned a few months later to plant trees along streets lined with forlorn rectangles of dirt. In 1993, when fires charred the hills of Malibu, destroying acres of vegetation, young people from South-Central returned the favor. They were among hundreds of volunteers involved in restoration planting.
Mr. Lipkis's passion for the cause persuaded Katie Irving, a young woman he met on a speaking engagement in Melbourne, Australia, to leave her job as a copy writer for an advertising agency and write press releases and reports for Treepeople. In 1983, they were married.
Now, Mr. Lipkis is twisting city officials' arms to grant the group a permanent occupancy permit so they can renovate the Coldwater Canyon site. Treepeople has been operating under a 30-day revocable lease for the last 10 years.
After the fifth and seventh graders from Edison Middle School and Wadsworth Elementary School had secured their seedling between the stakes, making sure they were far enough apart to allow it to sway in the wind and develop its trunk, they formed a circle, held hands and offered a blessing for it.
To give people a sense of ownership of the trees they've planted, Treepeople encourages naming. The students were about to divulge the name they had chosen when an older man who had been standing nearby quietly watching the planting spoke up.
"Can I offer a suggestion for a name?" he asked. The children, who had already chosen the name Charles Drew, listened. "Fatiha," he said. "It's Arabic for first growth or new growth."
With that, the tree was christened Charles Fatiha Drew. "I hope to come back here some day, when I'm older, and show my son our tree," said Jose Castillo, 13. He said he was sure the tree would still be standing, "because I'm not going to let anybody mess with it."

HEADLINE: Clinton Meets With Bosnian and Croatian Chiefs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
President Clinton met today with Bosnian and Croatian leaders in an effort to give new life to a languishing political federation that his Administration says is vital to helping Muslims and Croats stand up to their joint enemy, the Serbs.
Administration officials acknowledge that the agreement that formed the federation of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia, signed a year ago in Washington, had accomplished virtually nothing beyond getting the two groups to stop fighting each other. 
 Tensions between the two sides remain high, and they have done little to forge effective political or military links that would deter the Bosnian Serbs from fighting.
To mark the first anniversary of the agreement, President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia; Kresimir Zubak, the Bosnian Croat who is president of the federation; and Ejup Ganic, the Vice President of Bosnia. Alija Izetbegovic, President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was unable to attend because of a meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany.
The United States pledged $30 million in economic aid to the federation, while the European Union promised about $120 million. Including pledges from Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Turkey and other Muslim nations, aid promised to help the Muslim-Croat alliance now exceeds $300 million.
The United States has also promised to provide the Muslims and Croats with a few military advisers to help them coordinate their armies, a move that American officials say is intended to deter future Serbian aggression.
For their part, leaders of Bosnia's Muslims and Croats vowed to set up joint governments at the canton and town level. They also promised to restart efforts to create an integrated police force in Mostar, in the southwest, and to allow displaced Muslims and Croats to return to their homes there.
"The federation is the way to build Bosnia and Herzegovina from the inside," said Vice President Ganic. Up to now, he said, "We have succeeded in building the federation house from the roof; we have built less on the ground."
While many of the steps pledged today are small, the officials said those efforts would be crucial to healing ethnic tensions between the two groups and restoring peace and a sense of community to the 30 percent of Bosnia controlled by Muslims and Croats.
"The federation one year later is a fragile vessel at best, and it needs revitalization," said Richard C. Holbrooke, an Assistant Secretary of State.
Mr. Holbrooke showed little optimism about persuading Bosnia's Serbs, who control about 70 percent of Bosnia, to make peace with the country's Muslim-dominated Government. He again urged the Serbs to accept an international peace plan under which they would reduce their holdings to 49 percent.
President Tudjman said President Clinton told him today that the United States would back Croatia's application to join the Partnership for Peace, a group of former Soviet-bloc nations that cooperate politically and militarily with NATO. Admitting Croatia to the partnership would be unusual because almost one-third of his country is occupied by rebel Serbs.
Mr. Tudjman said he had asked Vice President Al Gore for such support last Saturday in Copenhagen before he announced that he would allow a scaled-down United Nations force in Croatia.
President Tudjman also complained about the disappearance of Gen. Vlado Santic, a Bosnian Croat commander who Croats say was kidnapped by members of Bosnia's mostly Muslim army.
 
Disappearance Sows Tension
 SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, March 16 (Reuters) -- The disappearance of a Bosnian Croat officer is sowing tensions between the Croats and the Bosnian Government, a Government official said today.
Bosnian Croats have accused elements of the Government army of kidnapping the officer, Gen. Vlado Santic, on March 8. But a Government official said today that General Santic had vanished and was "most probably was killed" after a brawl erupted at a private party in the Bihac region, in northwestern Bosnia.

HEADLINE: New York City Watershed Purchases in Danger

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, March 16

 BODY:
In a move that could hinder New York City's plans to protect its upstate watersheds from development it considers harmful, the state has proposed new restrictions on the city's ability to buy land in those watersheds.
City officials said the restrictions would be so burdensome that they could force the city to drop plans to buy 80,000 acres of watershed property and instead turn to a much more expensive alternative for insuring the purity of its water: an $8 billion water filtration system. 
 "With conditions like that, we would never be able to buy an acre of land in the Catskills," said Marilyn Gelber, Commissioner of the City Department of Environmental Protection.
But while Ms. Gelber called the proposed restrictions "onerous" and "impossible to meet," upstate officials praised them, saying they would encourage the economic development the region needs to provide jobs for its residents.
"Buying that land is going to create problems and make it a zero-growth area," said Anthony Bucca, the Supervisor of Hunter, N.Y., in the Catskills. "Nobody will want to live here."
Under the proposal, towns in the watershed would have 60 days to review any proposed land purchases by the city and the right to appeal any purchases to the state environmental agency, which could block the sales. Environmentalists and city officials say that the delays and uncertainties of that process would make it virtually impossible to strike deals with individual property owners.
The rules, while only preliminary, could be the first signal that the city will get little help from the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki in its efforts to limit development in the watershed.
Although the Governor said on Wednesday that he had not seen the regulations yet or evaluated them, in the past he has been a voting ally of upstate senators who oppose such city land purchases.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on Wednesday expressed the hope that the state would give the city what it needed to acquire and protect the watershed lands.
"No final decision has been made yet," Mr. Giuliani said. "I'm pretty certain that we will have the scope to accomplish what we have to accomplish."
Land acquisition is a major element in a broad plan the city has worked out with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to protect the watershed and avoid building a filtration plant. There are more than 150 other elements, including upgrading sewage treatment plants and reducing runoff from farms.
The state restrictions on land purchase were proposed on March 6 by the staff of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, which must issue permits governing the acquisition of watershed land.
The city's water, once world famous for its quality, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent decades because of the booming development of northern Westchester and lower Putnam counties, home of the southernmost of the city's three water systems, the Croton.
Development around the Croton system has resulted in increases in bacteria and chemicals, and the city has committed itself to building a $600 million filtration plant for the system.
To avoid building a more expensive filtration plant for the more pristine waters of the city's Catskills and Delaware reservoir systems, the city decided to spend $200 million to acquire 80,000 acres around those reservoirs and dampen further development. Under an agreement with the Federal Government, Ms. Gelber said, the city must acquire the first 10,000 acres by June 30.
Land acquisition has become a political quagmire because of opposition from most of the towns around the Catskills and Delaware watersheds, 35 of which have banded together as the Coalition of Watershed Towns. More than 90 percent of the city's water comes from the Catskills and Delaware watersheds.
The coalition towns, said the group's lawyer, Jeffrey S. Baker, fear that substantial city land purchases would throttle development. They have proposed that the city instead spend $450 million to replace old septic tanks and build new sewage systems in the watershed communities and for loans and grant programs to foster development that would not damage the environment.
The group's intervention forced the matter of land acquisition before an administrative law judge, Robert P. O'Connor, at the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
Unable to resolve the matter amicably between the city and the coalition, the department's associate counsel, Glenn Bruening, on March 6 sent Mr. O'Connor the draft of a seven-page set of conditions governing land acquisition.
While the city would prefer to buy land outright from individual owners, the permit conditions require it to allow the coalition and individual towns 60 days to comment about the acquisition of even a single parcel. If the city rejects a town's viewpoint, that town or the coalition has the right to appeal the matter to Mr. O'Connor, who would make the final decision.
The city must also pay each town $20,000 to compensate it for the costs of studying and analyzing the city's plans.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer at the Pace University Law School here, said that informing the towns about which parcels the city intended to buy would make those parcels prohibitively expensive. "It telescopes the city's intentions and doesn't allow the city to walk away from the deal," he said.
He said he was not sure whether the new regulations were "an attack by Pataki on the city or a mistake by the staff."
Ms. Gelber, facing a June 30 deadline for initial land acquisition, said that the hurdles created by the new permit conditions would make it unlikely that any significant portion of the 10,000 acres could be bought in time.

HEADLINE: Conoco Told U.S. Years Ago Of Oil Negotiations With Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
A senior Administration official acknowledged today that Conoco Inc. had repeatedly told American officials over the last four years that they were negotiating with Iran on the development of a $1 billion oilfield, but that the Government focused on the issue -- and decided to block it -- only after the deal was reached earlier this month.
The official, Peter Tarnoff, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, insisted that lower-level officials of the Clinton and Bush Administrations had told Conoco that "this kind of a deal was not consistent with American policy toward Iran," although it was legal under the rules that prevailed until President Clinton said he would bar the transaction on national security grounds earlier this week. 
 But Mr. Tarnoff's testimony painted a picture of an Administration still struggling to pull together a coherent strategy in its effort to isolate Iran, loath to offer it financial support but unwilling to bar American companies from billions of dollars in lucrative business that would be snapped up by Japanese and European competitors.
For example, in his testimony today before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Tarnoff said that while the United States barred the Conoco deal because it would directly help the Iranian Government, it was still unwilling -- after several years of debate -- to prohibit American companies from buying Iranian oil and selling it to third countries. Petroleum industry experts estimate that those purchases amounted to about $3.5 billion last year.
Mr. Tarnoff said the Administration feared that such a ban would lead to "prolonged litigation and controversy," and would ultimately be futile, because it was "unlikely there would be cooperation" from America's major allies in Asia or Europe.
Japan is Iran's biggest customer for crude oil, and Japanese officials have repeatedly made clear that they will not participate in American efforts to isolate the country economically.
Mr. Tarnoff did not explain why it took so long for the State Department and other Government agencies to wake up to the details of the Conoco deal. A vice president at Conoco, Michael Stinson, said the
company was never told to halt its negotiations.
Although the issue was never discussed at the hearing today, other Administration officials have said in recent days that Japan's close relationship with Iran played a significant role in the Administration's move on Tuesday to block the Conoco project, which would have been the first involving Iran and the United States since Washington severed relations with Teheran in 1980.
For years Japan has been supporting the construction in Iran of a giant hydroelectric dam on the Karun River costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Tokyo has slipped past the deadline for announcing the second installment of its support for the dam, a loan of $450 million, because of heavy behind-the-scenes pressure from Washington.
While the two Governments have avoided public recriminations over the project, the issue has taken such a high priority that President Clinton raised it directly with Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama.
The Administration feared that if the Conoco deal went ahead, it would be impossible to insist to the Japanese that they cancel their loans and effectively kill the project, in which Japanese and European companies are deeply involved. Japan has still not indicated what it will do, but it recently sent Nobuo Matsunaga, a former ambassador to the United States, to meet Iran's President, Hashemi Rafsanjani. Mr. Rafsanjani told Mr. Matsunaga, according to Japanese officials, that Iran was not supporting international terrorism or blocking the Middle East peace process.
Mr. Stinson, the Conoco executive, told the committee that his company thought the deal would be workable because American policy was "vague." He said that the company met regularly with State Department officials in Washington and at the embassies in Dubai, Kuwait and London.
"Until recent weeks," he said, "the typical response was: The United States would prefer that you not do this deal, but it's clearly legal."
In opposing the Conoco deal, Washington also feared that Russia and China would use it as a pretext to move ahead with several nuclear power plant projects and other commercial deals.
The hearings today were prompted by legislation introduced recently by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to ban all financial transactions between Iran and American companies, including their foreign subsidiaries. The Iranian deal would have been conducted by Conoco's Dutch subsidiary; Conoco itself is a Houston-based subsidiary of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.
"Either we have an embargo on dealing with and taking -- particularly in this case, Iranian oil -- or we should call it off, it's a myth," Mr. D'Amato said today. "We are saying to the Iranians on the one hand that you're going to pay a price for being an outlaw nation," he said, but the world would not take the policy seriously if Washington is "facilitating Iran with U.S. companies."
But Mr. Tarnoff suggested that a ban on dealings with American companies would not deprive Iran of revenue, it would only deprive American companies of profit.
As many State Department officials are quick to acknowledge, however, that is probably exactly what will happen in the case of the project that Conoco abandoned under pressure, not only from the Government but also from members of Du Pont's board. Two French companies, Total and Elf Aquitaine, were negotiating for the same project and seem likely to strike a deal, American officials say.
Mr. Tarnoff said, however, that many American allies "have been looking to see what the United States would do on Conoco by means of a political signal," and that they should realize that proceeding with deals of their own would undercut "the solidarity that many of them at least express rhetorically about Iran."

HEADLINE: Hundreds Turn Out to Seek Jobs That Have No Future

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, March 16

 BODY:
When Jeanene Wright got to the Labor Department office here at 7 this morning, the line already stretched for more than two blocks and the jostling for position was so fierce that police barricades were soon thrown up to keep everyone calm.
Like the nearly 900 other people who gathered here today, Ms. Wright was hoping to secure one of the hundreds of temporary jobs that General Motors Corporation will soon begin offering on the assembly line at its North Tarrytown plant. 
 And like the rest in line, Ms. Wright, a nurse's aide from Yonkers, said she was drawn by the salary: $12.90 an hour, with a work week of more than 40 hours likely. Never mind, she said, that the jobs carry no benefits and are not expected to last past the fall of 1996, when G.M. plans to close its North Tarrytown plant for good.
"This is still better than standing on the welfare line," she said.
They came from as far as away as Manhattan, Poughkeepsie and Teaneck, N.J., all hoping to get an interview for a job with no future. Most of them were black or Hispanic. General Motors officials said they would use the temporary hires to replace as many as 1,500 permanent union assembly-line workers. Under an agreement with the United Auto Workers, the regular union employees are being offered transfers to other G.M. plants as the Tarrytown operation scales down over the next 18 months.
New York State reported an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent in January that was lower than any previous January since 1990, but for minorities the rate is twice that high. And so, today, the people began lining up as early as 4 A.M.
"General Motors is prestige," said Darrell Mollette, 32, a carpenter from the Bronx. "There are not that many jobs available. When a good job like this comes along, you got to make sacrifices to get it."
Many of the applicants said they had high hopes that the plant would remain open past 1996 or that they, too, would be transferred elsewhere someday. But company officials said emphatically that neither possibility was realistic. And Donald C. Martino, the president of Local 664 of the United Auto Workers, said that the decision to hire temporary workers dashed any last hopes he had that the plant, which manufactures minivans, might somehow be saved.
"I hate to say it, because I'm the last one here who stayed optimistic, but I'm finally seeing the light," said Mr. Martino, who first worked at the plant, the company's oldest, 30 years ago. "I don't think we have a chance."
As they waited in line many of the black and Hispanic men and women said that today's hiring represented an opportunity for union-quality work that might not have come their way under other circumstances. Indeed, a majority of the plant's current work force -- about 60 percent -- is white, union officials said.
What transpired today was only the first round in the hiring process. State labor officials assisting General Motors screened all the applicants for proof that they spoke English, had finished high school and are American citizens. If they cleared those hurdles, they were given appointments for 15-minute interviews with company officials sometime in the next six weeks. After that, they will be given physical examinations and drug tests.
In brief seminars for 30 people at a time, labor officials made sure that the applicants knew what would be expected of them if they were hired.
"You have to be available to be in Tarrytown at 6 A.M.," said Patricia Patrick, a state labor department service representative, during one presentation. "You have to have good hand-eye coordination and you have to be able to lift 40 pounds."
Company officials made it clear that the jobs were physically demanding, whether they entailed installing wiring or bolting down doors or priming van bodies for painting. But none of that fazed Cynthia Smith, 36, an unemployed mother of five who used to work as a nurse's aide.
"If I can lift a 250-pound person," she said, "I can lift a 50-pound piece of equipment."
As in other G.M. plants where temporary workers have been hired, the union is being permitted to charge a $20 initiation fee for temporary union membership and two hours' salary each month as union dues, said Mr. Martino, the president of the local. Typically, the new workers will earn salaries that are $6 less an hour than those of the workers they are replacing, G.M. officials said.
Nevertheless, many applicants said that if they were lucky enough to be hired, their wages at G.M. would still be double the going rate at many other companies seeking unskilled labor in the metropolitan New York region.
"Having a benefit package would be nice -- that's why I'm applying to other places," said Ernest Sneed, 49, who is seeking to supplement the income he earns managing two apartment buildings in Elmsford. "But this is a job paying somewhere in the neighborhood of $12 an hour. I'll get what I can get."

HEADLINE: YELTSIN TO ALTER PARADE ON V-E DAY TO DRAW CLINTON

BYLINE: By BERNARD GWERTZMAN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 16

 BODY:
In a fresh effort to persuade President Clinton to come to Moscow for the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he would tailor the Red Square military parade on May 9 to avoid embarrassing the American leader.
"He wants to come," Mr. Yeltsin said of Mr. Clinton, but is "a bit concerned about the whole scenario." He said that to make it easier for Mr. Clinton to come for the celebration, the parade in Red Square would be limited to veterans of World War II and no military equipment would be included. 
 The Russian leader, speaking in his usual mixture of seriousness and occasional bluster, has been pressing Mr. Clinton to join other Western leaders in Moscow on V-E Day, and then to extend the visit into a summit meeting with Mr. Yeltsin.
Mr. Clinton, worried about the Russian offensive in Chechnya and fearing the consequences if a summit meeting produces no concrete results, has not said yes or no to the May invitation, although he has said he would like to meet sometime this year.
Speaking in an interview with foreign editors, Mr. Yeltsin confirmed that the United States and Russia were drafting an exchange of letters between him and Mr. Clinton over NATO expansion, letters that are aimed at meeting some Russian concerns over having NATO move closer to its borders. The United States wants Russia to join the so-called Partnership for Peace, a form of association with NATO falling short of membership.
Mr. Yeltsin said the press had "overdramatized" his concerns about NATO, but he expressed irritation on the issue. His voice rising and speaking with intensity, he criticized what he called "forcing the pace of NATO expansion."
"What's happening is that we have just recently abandoned the bloc divisions," he said. "Now assume that some East European and Central European countries would join NATO and the border would move immediately closer to Russia, so the situation would appear to suggest that we would again have a bloc situation with NATO."
"Is it really consistent with all-European security?" he asked. "No, it is not. The situation will not be calm."
These are essentially the same arguments Mr. Yeltsin made, also with some vigor, at a conference on European security held in Budapest last fall. He has been concerned for some time over accusations by Russian nationalists and hard-line Communists that Russian foreign policy has been too accommodating to Washington's interests at the expense of Moscow's.
Another major problem for Mr. Clinton as he considers whether to come to Moscow is the continuing Russian military action against separatist guerrillas in Chechnya. In the interview, Mr. Yeltsin gave no sign that he was interested in reaching a political settlement with the leader of the Chechen rebels, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev.
"I am not going to meet with him," Mr. Yeltsin said of Mr. Dudayev. "He is a gangster. He is a bandit. He should be tried for having killed so many of his own people."
Speaking in Russian to the small group of foreign editors who had been invited for the session, Mr. Yeltsin said Mr. Clinton had passed the word that although he would like to make the trip in May, he did not want to be seen and photographed with the kind of modern Russian military equipment that is being used in Chechnya.
Saying he was addressing Mr. Clinton's concerns, Mr. Yeltsin said, "We want to arrange a program so that in Red Square, there will be a military parade, but without any military equipment." He said there would be speeches by him and by veterans.
"To put it in a nutshell, we shall meet the conditions," he said.
Other Russian officials said the Red Square parade would consist of some 2,500 World War II veterans, and would be preceded by religious ceremonies. Another parade, including modern arms and soldiers, is being planned for Poklonnaya Hill in northern Moscow, some distance from Red Square, and Mr. Clinton would not be asked to visit that parade.
Of the World War II allies, only President Francois Mitterrand of France has said he would be in Moscow on May 9. In the United States and Western Europe, V-E Day is celebrated on May 8, and Mr. Clinton has reportedly been pondering whether to hold a ceremony in Washington on May 8 or whether to attend similar ceremonies in London and Paris on that date.
There has been no word from the British on their plans, Russian officials said. The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, has reportedly also been invited, and Mr. Yeltsin said during the meeting that he has become closer to Mr. Kohl than to any other Western leader.
"I can also add that it is with Helmut Kohl of all the world leaders that we have the most frequent telephone conversations," he said. "Hardly a week passes without my calling him or his calling me. I believe this is very helpful, and we compare notes. We have very good relations with him, and very good contacts. We are real friends."
The interview, in a Kremlin conference room, lasted nearly an hour, and was Mr. Yeltsin's first extended meeting with the news media in some time. He looked fit and spoke firmly and clearly. On a trip to Kazakhstan five weeks ago, Mr. Yeltsin seemed unable to walk without assistance, and he has been rumored to drink heavily and to need medication for back pain.
Today he seemed in a good mood, and often reacted vigorously when he disagreed with a question. He was most angered when he was told that many in the West wondered who was directing Russia's economic policy.
"The most important decisions are made by the President," he said, speaking sharply and emphasizing every word.
The editors -- two from Britain and one each from the United States, France, Italy, Germany, Egypt and Japan -- had been invited specifically to receive briefings on Chechnya, where fighting continues, but at a less ferocious pace than a month ago when Russian troops battled hard for control of Grozny, the capital.
But little was said about Chechnya that was new, either by Mr. Yeltsin or at a larger symposium the night before in which officials from several ministries took part.
Although Washington has been somewhat critical of the use of force in Chechnya, it has supported Moscow's right to quell secessionist movements, and Mr. Yeltsin seemed appreciative of the American attitude.
"The United States and President Clinton were very restrained and quiet in assessing the situation in Chechnya," he said, "and President Clinton on many occasions, including news conferences, was very firm in asserting that he firmly supports President Yeltsin."
Mr. Yeltsin said that although he would not deal with Mr. Dudayev, the Chechen leader, Russian officials were still trying to negotiate with others.
"I believe at this time they are moving on more energetically than in the past," he said of these contacts. "We are talking with the elders, district representatives, city representatives and leaders. We have already set up the government of Chechnya, and are looking forward to organizing elections to the Chechen parliament." He was referring to the Russian effort to create a rival government to Mr. Dudayev's.
But he acknowledged that his Government's efforts had so far not won much Western support.
"We realize that until such democratic elections are held, we will be unable to convince the world that the situation in Chechnya is really positive, really democratic and there are no human rights violations," he said.
In his opening remarks, he gave a fairly optimistic appraisal of Russian society. He said that this year, the pace of economic reform was better than last year, with February's inflation about 11 percent a month, as against 17 percent in January 1994.
He said that 50 percent of the industries were reporting growth, and that companies responsible for 60 percent of the country's gross national product had been privatized. And he said the goal was to reduce inflation to between one and two percent a month by the end of the year.
"But the most important thing we have been able to achieve is the fact that the people who have been for 75 years living under a totalitarian regime, and knew nothing about private property, they are now beginning to understand what is a market," he said.

HEADLINE: In Power Industry, Changes Batter Independents

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
For Charles F. Goff, the president and chief executive of Destec Energy, the solution to a bad turn in his business is tantalizingly close: the distance he can drive a golf ball.
The Lyondell electric plant of Destec, an independent power company, sits a little more than 200 yards from a complex of chemical and oil refineries near Houston, most of which would gladly buy the inexpensive power produced by the plant. 
 But the distance that this eager golfer could have easily nailed off the tee might as well have been hundreds of miles away. The transmission system from the plant is controlled by the Houston Lighting and Power Company, the regulated utility that has long served those industrial customers. And unless it is pressed by the Texas Public Utility Commission, the utility is not about to let its own transmission lines be used to help a competitor lure its customers away.
The plight of Destec is similar to that of hundreds of independent power companies around the country. Federal law once required utilities to buy the power produced by independents like Destec. But late last month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruled that two California utilities might be able to walk away from the high-priced deals they had struck with several independent producers. Independents now fear that the agency will let other utilities out of their contracts as they expire.
What is worse, as far as the independent power producers are concerned, existing long-term contracts could be put in jeopardy, too.
This week the New York State Public Service Commission, in a big shift of policy, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to allow New York State Electric and Gas, a large upstate utility, to break its 15-year contracts with two independent power producers so the utility could renegotiate the pacts and bring down the cost.
And just as independents are on the verge of losing their best customers, they are finding it difficult to get around barriers that make it tough for them to find new ones. Independents in states like California, Maine and New York, where many of the plants are situated, all face similar struggles.
It is an important issue not only to the independents, but also to the large industries that want to lower their electric bills. Most independents can produce electricity more cheaply than the regulated utilities can, and if the independents were free to sell their power to all comers, industry experts say, the resulting competition would lower electric rates around the country.
"The availability of alternative sources of cheaper power will force down rates and bring change," said David T. Flanagan, president and chief executive of Central Maine Power, a utility in Maine, where large amounts of power are also set to come onto the market as contracts run out.
But Houston Lighting and Power, a subsidiary of Houston Industries, worries that increased competition would make it much more difficult to keep power flowing at reasonable costs to its 1.3 million customers, maintain the transmission system and provide backup services.
"Just to let someone like Destec to basically hook up into the transmission system without bearing any part of the cost creates some major problems," said William Carter, a Republican Representative in the Texas Legislature. "We're going to be looking for some equitable way for this to happen."
Despite intense lobbying, Destec has largely been left to fend for itself. The company has been unable to find a state legislator to sponsor a bill providing it with more access to customers.
The quandary faced by Destec is most clearly shown by its Lyondell plant near Houston, which was built in 1985 as a co-generation plant that supplies steam and power to the ARCO Chemical Company. The plant, which is connected directly to the ARCO plant, can generate 465 megawatts of power, but supplies ARCO with only 66 megawatts.
The surplus power of the plant was sold under a 10-year contract for 6 cents a kilowatt-hour to Houston Lighting and Power, which serves Houston and a 5,000-square-mile area along the Texas gulf coast. The contract generated about $1.48 billion.
Even though Houston Lighting and Power thought the price was too high, it and other utilities were mandated by the state to sign many such long-term contracts under the provisions of a 1978 Federal law that encouraged the building of small co-generation plants. The plants were seen as better alternatives, because of the expense and risk of building big coal and nuclear power plants to replace generators that were dependent on imported oil. Independents now generate 6 percent of the power in the United States.
The law required utilities to buy the power at a rate equal to that which the utilities would have spent to generate it themselves. Many states set rates based in part on estimates of future oil prices, which were expected to soar to $70 a barrel by the 1990's. Oil is currently trading for about $18 a barrel.
 Meanwhile, utilities in Texas were in the middle of their own building boom, putting up huge coal-fired and nuclear plants. "There was a need for power," said Dan Bulla, who is in charge of investor relations at Houston Lighting and Power. "We spent about $1 billion a year for a decade to keep up."
Then the bottom fell out of the Texas economy, and the state ended up swimming in surplus power.
Founded by the Dow Chemical Company in 1989, Destec still prospered because the Texas utilities were locked into their long-term contracts for its gas-fired plants. Growing revenues and profits made the company popular on Wall Street. When it went public in March 1991, the stock sold for $20 a share. Yesterday shares of Destec closed at $9.875, unchanged, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Last year, however, Destec went from feast to famine as it became one of the first independents in the country to lose a big long-term contract. Without its deal with the utility, Destec has been forced to run some of its plants below capacity. Its Lyondell plant, which can produce 465 megawatts, is generating about 250 megawatts, most of it fed into the grid system of the regulated utilities at less than than 3 cents a kilowatt-hour.
Destec is feeling the pinch. In its fourth quarter, revenues fell 14 percent, to $206.4 million. Analysts predict that its earnings will fall to about 40 to 50 cents a share this year, from $1.84 a share in 1994.
The management of Destec has been able to sell power temporarily to some municipal utilities, like San Antonio's, which the regulated utilities are required to carry, for a fee, over their transmission lines.
But Mr. Goff is after bigger game. Rick Zalesky, the manager of energy services for the Chevron Corporation, which has a large petrochemical plant near the Lyondell plant, said his company was eager to buy power from Destec.
"It's really hurting Destec and it could really help us," he said. "Destec has power that they would love to sell to us, but the regulators won't allow that. That's crazy."
The regulated utilities like Houston Lighting and Power have argued that the independents should not be allowed to raid their biggest industrial customers. "They want to cherry-pick the most profitable customers," Mr. Bulla said. "The result would be an increase in the cost of power to the smaller residential and commercial customers."
Mr. Goff of Destec predicted that the pressure on the utilities would grow as states sought to attract new industry and keep existing ones by making cheaper power more available.
"There is a consumer-driven movement that is sweeping the country demanding cheap power," he said. "That movement is the same one that has led to the ability to select long-distance telephone suppliers. That movement will lead to competition in the utility industry in the not too distant future."

Diagram: "Independent Power"
 A Federal law has required utilities to buy power from independent producers at higher-than-market rates. That, in part, has helped the independents claim a significant share of the total output in Texas and across the country.
 But as the long-term, high-priced contracts expire, the independents are left to scramble for customers and fight with he utilities about access to the distribution grid.
